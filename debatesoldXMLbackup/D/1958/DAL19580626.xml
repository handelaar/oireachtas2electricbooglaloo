      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill, as the House is aware, is to enable Bord na Móna to join with Messrs. Arthur Guinness Son and Company (Dublin) Limited in establishing and maintaining a Chair of Industrial Microbiology at University College, Dublin.  Towards the end of last year Messrs. Guinness, who have displayed a deep interest in scientific education and research, approached Bord na Móna with this proposal.  While the board were more than willing to participate in the project with Messrs. Guinness, they found that their statutory powers were not adequate to enable them to do so. The purpose of this Bill is to provide the necessary powers for the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna already have powers under Section 19 of the Turf Development Act, 1946, to carry out their own researches and experiments, and the achievements of their experimental station at Newbridge clearly indicate what can be done by organised research on peat problems.  Since its <Col N="779" /> establishment the resources of this station have been devoted to the improvement of methods of draining bogland and cutting, harvesting and utilising turf and turf products.  A great number of new processes and machines have been designed and developed at the station with these objects in view.  The outcome of this research has been to improve considerably the efficiency and productivity of all the board's operations and, as a result, the cost of production of the board's products has been maintained at a reasonably stable level.</P>
    <P>Microbiology is an important science with wide applications in the medical, agricultural and chemical fields.  It is generally accepted that research in the microbiology field is at present inadequately covered in this country. Bord na Móna and Messrs. Guinness regard it as important that such research should be undertaken on a bigger scale and that it should be established on a practical basis with clear objectives.</P>
    <P>The main object of the research, which it is proposed to conduct at University College, Dublin, is the study of industrial and soil microbiology applied to turf, that is, to investigate the activities of microorganisms which might be used to promote chemical changes in peat and extend its uses as an industrial raw material.  Research of this nature must be fundamental and academic and in order to pursue it properly it is necessary to avail of the conditions and atmosphere of university life.</P>
    <P>In addition to research work, courses will also be conducted for students. Spectacular developments at an early date cannot be expected, yet it is only by such scientific work that the major discoveries of our time are made. Peat is an organic substance and it is generally true to say that all organic chemicals can be produced from it. The scope for research activity in peat problems is, therefore, very wide and on that account it would not be possible to give any indication at this stage of the lines along which the work at University College, Dublin, will proceed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> As Deputies are aware, there is in existence an organisation established by the State to carry out industrial research, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  The research work in microbiology envisaged in the present proposal will consist principally of pure research, and will be of a long-term nature and confined to a highly specialised field; in addition certain teaching activities will be carried on.  The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards was set up to deal with specific practical problems arising in industry and in general the investigations undertaken by it are of a short-term nature.  It would not be appropriate, therefore, that the institute should undertake the type of research envisaged by the promoters of the present project.</P>
    <P>Turf is already well established as a fuel for the production of electricity and for use in industry and the home. Investigations are at present being carried out into the possibility of utilising it for the production of nitrogenous fertilisers.  In addition, as was recently announced, the question of producing town gas from peat is under examination.  These large-scale developments can, however, be carried out only on extensive tracts of bogland. For some time the board has been considering the question of extending its operations to the smaller bog areas which contain the greater part of our total peat resources.  The prospects of profitable exploitation of these small bogs for the production of conventional peat products are not very good, however, as the development of a whole new range of machines and processes would be required.  The research into non-conventional fields which it is proposed to carry out at the university may indicate the possibility of producing hitherto unknown high-grade peat products which might provide a better solution for the development of our western blanket and hill bogs.</P>
    <P>There is considerable scope for increased expenditure on industrial research in this country.  The main reason for this is, no doubt, that many firms have not got sufficient resources to conduct research in their own premises.  This need not, however, preclude <Col N="781" /> such firms from participating actively in research work as they have the alternative of assisting in the financing of research at educational establishments, either individually or in co-operation with other firms.  To encourage this, provision was made in the Finance Act, 1957, for certain tax concessions in respect of covenanted annual payments to universities and colleges in the State for research purposes.  It is hoped that this provision and the example now being set by two such important industrial organisations as Bord na Móna and Messrs. Guinness will encourage other firms to consider undertaking similar co-operative ventures.</P>
    <P>Messrs. Guinness have at all times taken a sympathetic interest in the development of our peat resources and, as the House is aware, they have already undertaken to lend £500,000 to the board towards the cost of setting up the first briquetting factory at Boora, County Offaly.  The new development now proposed is but another example of the practical way in which the company is prepared to co-operate with one of our most important national undertakings and I should like to take this opportunity of again expressing the Government's appreciation for their action.</P>
    <P>The initial cost of the establishment of the proposed chair is estimated at £10,000 and the cost of maintenance and administration at about £6,000 per annum.  It is the intention that the expenditure involved will be borne equally by the board and the company. As there is no doubt whatever that this money will be well spent, I confidently recommend this Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be general agreement that this Bill will be welcomed by everybody, not alone in this House but outside it.  The gratitude which the Minister has expressed to Messrs. Guinness has been expressed on previous occasions for their generosity in providing a sum of £500,000 for the erection of the two briquetting factories.  That was another example of the interest which this firm has displayed over a number of years in the development of the country.  It is a <Col N="782" /> great firm with a great record of achievement and the work of the whole undertaking of Messrs. Guinness has always been characterised by an interest in the welfare, not only of the country but of the employees of the firm.  This decision to join with Bord na Móna is a further example of the firm's interest in the welfare of the country.</P>
      <P>The only question I should like to put to the Minister in the matter is whether it would not be better for other State companies interested in scientific and industrial problems to combine together and deal with this matter on a wider basis.  It may be, as the Minister has said, that this question of the scientific examination of microbiology is specialised and for that reason that Bord na Móna, in conjunction with Messrs. Guinness and the university, are obliged to consider it themselves.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it seems that with the wide field and great scope for research in this country, bodies like the E.S.B., the Sugar Company and Bord na Móna, in conjunction with the universities, could combine to consider the question on a wider basis and should pool their resources, at least pool their resources from the point of view of providing a share of the funds for scientific research.  This is an age in which science is occupying the minds, not only of companies of this sort, but of people in universities, schools, colleges and so forth.  The remarkable steps which scientific developments and advancements have made in the last couple of decades is indicative of the great necessity for further development here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is generally agreed that research, scientific development and technical training in this country are far behind, principally because of lack of funds.  On the other hand, those of our scientists and technicians who have been trained can more than hold their own with technicians and scientists from other countries.  For that reason, it is desirable to combine the efforts of the State bodies principally concerned with this sort of development. I can see that there are other State <Col N="783" /> companies which have not the same deep interest in scientific development, but the ones which I have mentioned, in conjunction with the university authorities, should be permitted to take part in this new development, with the co-operation, not only of the Minister's Department but of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>The common criticism expressed about scientific training in this country is the lack of funds to provide the very expensive equipment.  The provision of scientific equipment is always expensive, but now, with the rapid changes and great developments elsewhere, the demands are far greater than we here are in a position to meet. It is for that reason that I believe a good case can be made for a joint effort.  It may be that specialised consideration would have to be given to the problem of peat development which has been mentioned.  Probably that problem affects only Bord na Móna, but it might have a bearing on agricultural development, on forestry and on other problems of that sort.</P>
    <P>In that connection, the establishment of the agricultural institute offers further scope for a general pooling of resources and some unification of direction, in this whole problem, with the universities, State bodies, the Departments of Industry and Commerce, of Education, of Agriculture and possibly the Industrial Research and Standards Institute.  Though all these different bodies indicate the diversity of the problem, at the same time they emphasise its wide ramifications and the importance of utilising the combined resources of all these various institutions further to develop and expand the scientific and technical training, which is so important if we are to compete on anything like comparable terms with other countries.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that those of our people who have been trained as engineers, scientists and technicians, when they go abroad, either on postgraduate courses or to appointments with companies or universities, have in many cases more than held their own with technicians and scientists from other countries.  However the <Col N="784" /> complaint always is that, because of a general lack of facilities&mdash;a lack of finance and consequent lack of suitable equipment&mdash;they are at a disadvantage initially in training, and in the provision of the facilities which research students and research scientists, technicians and engineers have in other places.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that the only complaint I have to make about this approach is that it seems to be piecemeal. It would seem to be possible to get the same advantage for Bord na Móna in co-operation with Messrs. Guinness and the universities, by combining this effort with a joint approach by all the bodies I have mentioned who are interested in it, and by utilising the proposals to the best advantage of all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as another step forward in the progress of our peat production industry.  It is a notorious fact that this country is extremely backward in the field of scientific and industrial research.  Anything, therefore, that helps to promote our advances into these sadly-neglected activities has everything to commend it.  Unfortunately, as Deputy Cosgrave said, our students have not the facilities for research that are available elsewhere.  Consequently, many of our industries, and many of our infant industries which have a considerable potential, are handicapped because of the fact that our technicians and engineers here have not access to the sources of information and the results of researches which have been substantially financed in other countries. Therefore, I think the joint action of the Guinness firm and Bord na Móna in promoting these researches into microbiology in relation to our peat production industry is a commendable public activity.  It is one further piece of evidence of the genuine interest of the Guinness firm in helping to aid our industrial development here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1956, the Guinness firm, at a time when it was extremely difficult to secure money to finance State-sponsored bodies and other desirable public projects, came forward <Col N="785" /> with an offer to lend £500,000 to Bord na Móna for the purpose of aiding in the development of the two new briquetting factories which Bord na Móna at that time were authorised to construct.  I must say that, in a period which was marked by many depressing factors, the public-spirited action of the Guinness firm on that occasion was something which was praiseworthy and well worth note as evidence of the public spirit of that firm, and their further advance, in conjunction with Bord na Móna, into a field of research calculated to aid Bord na Móna is another commendable example of the same public spirit.</P>
    <P>I should like to take advantage of the occasion to say that I think that anything that helps to aid Bord na Móna to make a still greater success of the turf production industry is highly commendable.  Bord na Móna is a first-class State-sponsored body and, if one were to strike out from our national activities all that has been done by Bord na Móna over the past 25 years, one would find a very substantial gap in our national productivity and in the development of our industrial possibilities.  Bord na Móna, in my view, have done a first-class job. They have not only transformed the resources of this country and made them a source of industries where there was previously waste and unwanted lands, but, in the process of doing that, they have provided a very substantial measure of employment.</P>
    <P>Approximately 6,000 to about 7,000 persons per year find employment with Bord na Móna in the areas where there is no agricultural land which could offer employment, and where there are no industries which could provide employment for those who live in the bog areas.  Therefore, I think the House, as occasion offers, ought to mark its commendation of the excellent work Bord na Móna has done, not only from the point of view of developing our peat resources, and to that extent rendering us proportionately independent of foreign fuel supplies, but in providing a substantial measure of employment and, at the same time, adding to the national wealth.</P>
    <P>Private enterprise could never have <Col N="786" /> done what Bord na Móna have done. When one remembers that there is probably £17,000,000 of public money invested in Bord na Móna, the immensity of the enterprise at once becomes obvious.  Private enterprise could never have raised a sum of money such as that for the purpose of developing our peat resources, and the fact the State has been able to do it through the medium of Bord na Móna shows the desirability of using in such circumstances the resources of public organisations to do what, for a variety of reasons, the private sector of the economy is unable to do.</P>
    <P>I should like, therefore, to conclude by taking advantage of this Bill to commend the directors, the management and all the staff of Bord na Móna for the excellent job which they are doing in the national interest.  I should like them to feel, as I am sure the House would like them to feel, that their work in that respect has the warm approval of the House and that the House has never shown itself in any way unwilling or reluctant to provide the necessary funds to enable Bord na Móna to carry on the excellent work they are doing in the national interest.</P>

Is maith an rud é go mbeidh an ceangal seo idir an Ollscoil Náisiúnta agus Bord na Móna sa ghluaiseacht seo ar leas na tíre agus, go deimhin, támuid cinnte go dtiocaidh toradh maith as.</P>
      <P>I should like to say how pleased we are that this Bill is before the House. This linking of industrial research with universities is a development which is likely to lead to excellent results for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In University College, Cork, over the past 12 months, a fund has been accumulated for industrial research. Certain firms there have given donations to the president for the same purpose. I am very glad that the Minister has mentioned that this is specific work.  The effort in University College, Cork, has not yet been concentrated to that extent.  The result is, of course, <Col N="787" /> that when the various scientific faculties in the college look for funds for equipment for industrial research, there is a danger, perhaps, that the funds may be decimated without helping the solution of a specific problem. However, when the matter has been fully examined by the interests concerned, by the various firms and by the university authorities, I am sure there can be research on specific lines in regard to particular problems which will bring good results to the country. The whole idea is an excellent and admirable one and I hope that other firms will follow the good example.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  I regard it as a very definite step forward.  Most Deputies will agree that the first corner has been turned very successfully, so far as Bord na Móna is concerned. The first stage of their activities was confined to the production of turf and briquettes from ordinary peat. This Bill is important because so far we have not been able to exploit with any degree of success the by-products of peat.  When Bord na Móna entered into turf production, there was no previous experience of turf production on a commercial basis and we depended a good deal in those days on co-operation from abroad, notably from Germany and later from Russia. Prior to World War II, there were a few technical engineers and scientists from Germany on the technical staff of Bord na Móna.  Unfortunately, at the outbreak of war, they were recalled to service in the German forces.  That made the position rather difficult for Bord na Móna.  Happily, they undertook the task with confidence and determination and we are very glad to be able to congratulate them on the splendid measure of success they achieved.  At that time, their main line of activity was the production of turf for fuel during the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a later date, Messrs. Guinness contributed to a fund to finance Bord na Móna in the matter of research in connection with the manufacture of briquettes.  That was the first time that Bord na Móna got any real opportunity <Col N="788" /> to enter into the enterprise we are now discussing.  Messrs. Guinness's offer at that time was the most important contribution to research that Bord na Móna had received since its formation. I am very glad that Deputies on all sides of the House have paid particular tribute to Messrs. Guinness for that very noble gesture.  It was a public-spirited patriotic act and we could never be grateful enough to the firm for their co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very desirable at this stage because it is important that by-products should be developed as much as possible.  I have in mind one particular by-product, namely, wax.  I understand that some years prior to the outbreak of World War II, a research laboratory attached to University College, Cork, made investigations in a number of bogs in southern counties, including a bog in my constituency, Lyracrompane.  Investigations were made over a rather protracted period and I understand that satisfactory evidence was forthcoming that the type of raw peat available in that area was suitable for the production of wax.  For some reason, no progress has been made in this matter in recent years.  Perhaps that is due to the absence of technical research, which has been referred to by a previous speaker.  I hope that the Bill will enable Bord na Móna to set up the necessary machinery to proceed without delay on the issue that I have referred to.</P>
    <P>In connection with the establishment of chairs and lectureships, perhaps the Minister may be able to tell me if the appointments will be made through the Local Appointments Commissioners or otherwise.  I am quite sure that the usual machinery for filling such important posts will be availed of, but the Bill does not indicate the manner in which the posts will be filled and I should be very grateful if the Minister would give us some idea on that matter, when concluding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to appointments to the professorship of industrial microbiology, a notice inviting suitably qualified applicants will be issued and I understand the appointment will be made by the university <Col N="789" /> authorities.  General approval has been expressed here of the public-spirited action of Messrs. Arthur Guinness&mdash; and, in that connection, I should make special mention of the firm's managing director, Sir Hugh Beaver&mdash;which is fully justified and which will, I hope, encourage other firms to consider similar action.</P>
      <P>The efficiency of turf has already been well established as a fuel for the production of electricity and for use in industry.  Investigations are at present proceeding into the possibility of utilising turf in the production of nitrogenous fertilisers.  In addition, as was recently announced in the newspapers, the question of examining the technical problems associated with the production of town gas from peat is under examination.  These developments, which would necessarily be of a large-scale character, could be carried on only on extensive tracts of bogland.</P>
      <P>For some time past, Bord na Móna has been considering the question of extending its operations to smaller bogs which, as Deputies know, contain by far the greater part of the peat resources of the country.  The prospects of profitable operations on these smaller bogs with the methods and machines now available for the production of the conventional type of peat products are somewhat doubtful and, therefore, research into non-conventional fields, which it is proposed to carry out through the instrumentality of this Chair in Industrial Microbiology, may indicate the possibility of producing hitherto unknown or undeveloped high-grade peat products and may provide a better solution to the commercial development of our western blanket and hill bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave spoke about the possibility of other State companies engaging in research activities.  He will, of course, be aware that the Sugar Company have already embarked upon a large-scale practical experiment in the cultivation of peat bogs.  Most of their research activity has, however, been directed towards practical problems associated with their own operations.  They have, as Deputies know, been particularly successful <Col N="790" /> in the development of a peat harvesting machine for which, indeed, some export trade has been secured because of its suitability for that operation.</P>
    <P>The E.S.B. have available to them information regarding technological developments all over the world and, while they themselves do not carry on research activities in the ordinary sense of the term, nevertheless they regularly send their engineers abroad to keep them in touch with developments in other countries.</P>
    <P>The Institute of Industrial Research has as one of its main functions the keeping of an up-to-date library of technical information and of informing industrial firms of developments which have taken place.</P>
    <P>I should not wish to comment upon Deputy Cosgrave's observations regarding the facilities available for training in research work in our universities.  That is, perhaps, somewhat outside my sphere, but there is no doubt that we cannot but gain by any improvement in these facilities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton paid a well-deserved tribute to Bord na Móna, whose work has converted what were previously the most desolate and depressing areas in the country into great centres of industrial activity.  I fully agree with him that that could never have been done by private enterprise.  Indeed, it is my hope that I may find other fields of equal importance for productive public enterprise.  The future progress of the country must to a great extent depend upon other activities of the same character organised through public enterprise.  In that connection, I find myself in complete agreement with the views expressed by Deputy Norton.</P>

      <P>Whatever could usefully be said from this side of the House on this Estimate was suitably expressed by Deputies Dillon and Blowick yesterday evening.  Because of the very detailed statement made by the Minister, covering some 15 pages of single type, in relation to the administration of the Forestry Division, the work that is being done and the future prospects for forestry, I do not think very much opposition or criticism could usefully be advanced.  Up to 1948, planting was very slow, although it was one thing that a native Government should have attended to, because this country was denuded of its trees to such an extent that the percentage of forestry was only something like half of 1 per cent., whereas in other European countries, including England and Scotland, the percentage was between 12 per cent. and 18 per cent., and in Norway, 23 per cent.  I remember reading about 35 years ago a very useful book called <i>The Rape of Ireland.</i>  I cannot remember the author's name and I would not be surprised if the book were now out of print, but it dealt entirely with the destruction of our forests.  It also dealt with the work that would lie ahead for an Irish Government in order to increase the percentage of our forest land to something like what it was in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was, of course, further depletion during the first world war.  While the people of this country were always in opposition to landlordism, there was one thing that landlords did.  I do not know whether it was for the welfare <Col N="792" /> of the country or to beautify the landscape for their own benefit, but they did plant forests in their time.  All of these forests were cut down, but in many cases they have been renewed.</P>
    <P>The principal difficulty here in connection with forestry appears to be the acquisition of land, particularly since there has been a vast increase in planting.  In 1947, planting was 7,000 acres and for this financial year, the target is 22,500 acres.  However, the forestry experts say that you would really want about three times the amount of land in reserve as the number of acres planted, in each year. We have scarcely twice the amount of planting land in reserve.  Nevertheless, no good arable land or potential arable land should be planted while we have sufficient land of a type suitable for forestry, as we have particularly along the western and south-western seaboards. In the Midlands and elsewhere, too, there are thousands of acres of land that could be planted that would be useful for nothing else. But I hope that forestry will never get into competition with sheep farming and those who engage a great deal in the grazing of cattle.  There are areas in my own constituency where mountain farmers have anything from 300 to 600 acres of land on which there is scarcely a tree grown.  They would be well advised to offer 100 or 200 acres of that land to the Forestry Department as well as to carry out some private planting.</P>
    <P>Public representatives, Deputies, Senators and members of local bodies could help the Forestry Department to a great extent when speaking in public by suggesting to farmers of that type that they should offer land to the Department, which would benefit their farms, and also to undertake private planting.  The Minister has referred in his Estimate to dowries for sons, daughters, grandsons, and so on. Whether it would be a dowry or not, it would be useful to those who would inherit the property to have trees planted in order to shelter the land. Furthermore, planting on mountainsides saves land erosion.</P>
    <P>We have in the Forestry Department men who have the technical knowledge <Col N="793" /> and experience required to know the type of trees to plant in the various types of land.  They have also gained experience from the very good practice of visiting forest lands in other countries and consulting the experts there, and I am sure experts in those countries have derived benefit from their visits to this country and consulting our forestry experts.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, I have often been asked by mountain farmers if arrangements could be made by which they could get an exchange of holding, if they offered their lands to the Forestry Department.  We know about the exchange of holdings under the Land Commission, but evidently no provision has been made by which such land could be acquired for forestry purposes.  Perhaps it would require some legislation.  We may not refer to legislation on the Estimate, but it is possible that the Minister has power to do that.</P>
    <P>If a mountain farmer has 300 or 400 acres of land, the Land Commission will not take it over because his neighbours have more land than they want. If he sells that land to the Forestry Department, the money he receives is not much good to him.  He may be a married man with a family.  However, if he got an exchange holding down the country, it would be a great incentive to him to offer his land to the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister has doubled the grant for private planting from £10 to £20 but, as we heard in reply to a question to the Taoiseach the other day, the £ is worth only 4/3½ at present compared to what it was worth in 1914. Therefore, the grant of £20&mdash;£10 when the planting is done and the remaining £10 after five years&mdash;is no great inducement to farmers to carry out private planting.  Of course, my personal view is that any wise farmer who could well afford to plant a portion of his land suitable for forestry would do it, if he never got a grant.  It would be a benefit to himself and to those coming after him.  In other words, it would be a very good investment.  It would be a better investment, perhaps, to spend some money in that way than to put it in the bank and get only 1 per cent. for it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> During the past ten years, thousands of acres have been offered for forestry in South Kerry.  I think we have three forestry centres.  There have been so many offers in the Cahirciveen area that perhaps it is time the Minister and his Department considered setting up a centre in that area in the far south of Kerry.</P>
    <P>There was a reference in the Minister's opening statement to the setting up of a pulp factory.  It would seem as if we have enough thinnings already to supply such a factory. Instead of setting up a central factory which would, I suppose, be somewhere in the neighbourhood of Dublin, these factories should be decentralised and set up in a small way in areas which would have, or be likely to have, sufficient plants, thinnings and so on, to supply them.</P>
    <P>At one time, steps were taken in Kenmare by an Irish-American in regard to a pulp factory there.  He called a meeting.  One of his ideas was that, when there would be sufficient plantations and when the material would be available in South Kerry or in the whole of Kerry and West Cork, Kenmare would be an ideal place for a pulp factory.  It would be very desirable also in view of the fact that, in the past few years, people there invested money in a tannery which appears to have failed.</P>
    <P>We have some factories in Killarney; a factory is now starting in Killorglin and there is a generating station in Cahirciveen.  It would be a great benefit to the area in general if, when the time comes, these claims were favourably considered.  There is no necessity for me to go further.</P>
    <P>It is very satisfactory that the Minister is continuing the good work of his predecessor, that the planting of trees is being increased from year to year and that the annual target is 25,000 acres.  Until more land is available, I presume we can scarcely exceed that amount.  If we have already planted only 246,000 acres, and our target is 1,000,000 acres, our planting will not be completed in less than 30 years' time&mdash;in fact, longer, because I understand it is necessary to replace forests cut down to the extent of 7,000 acres annually.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> I listened to remarks on the good work of Bord na Móna, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and the E.S.B.  It would be well if the Government considered setting up a forestry board: I suppose it would be called An Bord Foraoiseacha.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have too many boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a board could take over the work of forestry.  I referred only to three boards which have been very successful in their different spheres.  It is only a suggestion that a board might be set up under the control of the Minister for Forestry. Every suggestion from any part of the House or any part of the country, which would advance the planting of trees to the extent that this country requires should be considered.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will continue the good work of his predecessor, as he appears to have been doing quite energetically during the past year or two.  When his term of office comes to an end, I hope we shall be able to pay him the tribute that he did his duty, so far as the forestry requirements of the country are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke last year and the previous year on this Forestry Estimate I expressed myself as reasonably satisfied with the work of the Forestry Department and that I considered it was acting as well as could be expected, having regard to all the circumstances.  I am not of that opinion to-day so far as extending the acreage of land for forestry and promoting employment are concerned. My viewpoint on some aspects of the work of the Forestry Department has completely changed.</P>
      <P>The first question I shall deal with is that of the employment of forestry workers.  I believe it was a laid-down fact that the recruitment of forestry workers should be through the local labour exchange and that the man in receipt of the highest unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit, as the case might be, should get first preference, if he were deemed to be suitable otherwise.  I believe that was the position, but I do not believe it is the position now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> I may mention that, for years back, so far as the employment of workers in West Cork is concerned, everything was going on quite well.  I believe employment was given on a reasonably fair basis.  Peculiarly enough, since the present Minister took office, that position has completely changed. Probably the Minister is not responsible for it.  It may be just a coincidence. Another fact is that the change is more or less confined to one forestry district&mdash;the district adjacent to Dunmanway town or Dunmanway No. 1 District.  We have not these complaints from the Dunmanway No. 2 District, from the Ballingeary area or from the Rosscarbery district.  As a representative of West Cork, I have, time and time again, brought these complaints to the notice of the Minister's Department in the past 12 months, with little or no redress.</P>
    <P>I learned from my representations at the Forestry Department that it is more or less the local forester who finally determines all questions arising out of that employment of workers. That is a most peculiar position.  No local authority or business concern, when employment or a question incidental to work is at issue, would allow it to be determined by a junior officer. Apparently the Forestry Department believes that the &ldquo;man on the spot&rdquo; as they term him, is the best man to determine the merits or demerits of any problem that arises.  If that is true, I cannot see why we should have a large supervisory staff travelling the country and a large supervisory staff here in the office in Dublin. If that maxim, that the local forester is more or less infallible, is correct, there is no need for all these other people having good salaries to supervise work which they maintain needs no supervision.</P>
    <P>It is quite true to say that in an area like West Cork and the area to which I refer, where the workers have no official organisation or trade union to act on their behalf, the Forestry Department do not mete out to them the same set of rules, or deal with them as if they were an organised body. They take advantage of the fact that they are not organised and it is most <Col N="797" /> peculiar for a State Department to take such an advantage.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to make representations to the Forestry Department regarding a worker who was suspended some 12 months ago.  This man was employed by the Department for 25 years and no more capable worker could they have had.  They made exhaustive inquiries regarding his capabilities as a worker, even from foresters who served in the area previously, and the reports were favourable on all occasions.  I know the man myself and undoubtedly, so far as output of work is concerned, and as far as being a conscientious, active worker, you could not get a better man in the country working for the Department.</P>
    <P>So far as this case is concerned, it is no harm to put it before the House, as recently I had intended to raise it with the Minister by way of a question. I thought some redress would be granted to this man, and that possibly there would be no need to deal with it publicly in this House.  However, I think there is an obligation on me to do so, and for all we know there may be similar cases throughout the country, but I doubt if there is any case as strong as the one I have to mention.  This man was employed by the Department for 25 years and every forester and foreman in charge of him was quite satisfied with his work.</P>
    <P>One morning, the present forester reprimanded him, not because he was not giving a sufficient output of work, but the forester believed that the method, and the manner in which he was carrying out a particular type of work, was not correct.  That is the only slip which he made.  He was a conscientious type of worker and he became very vexed and threw whatever implement he was working with on the ground and left the scene after some words with the forester.  It happened on the spur of the moment and it was a completely isolated incident. Possibly if he was not a capable and conscientious worker, he would have accepted what the forester said.  This man admits that he was wrong.  He admits that he should have accepted the forester's word without question in the first instance.  At the same time, <Col N="798" /> this man had extended service, and this was the first mistake he made. Surely no private employer or no local authority would think of dismissing a man for one isolated incident, not of a very major nature, in 25 years.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister is there any man in the Forestry Department, employed for 25 years, who has not made some blunder.  I have no hesitation in saying that there is not, and I am quite doubtful if there is any man employed by any concern, whether privately-owned or State-owned, who has not made some blunder once in 25 years. It is preposterous that such a man, with a wife and two children, should be completely knocked out of his employment.  I am sure the Minister has the facts of this case.  I have discussed them often enough with his Department and I would ask him, when replying, to say whether or not he stands over that action.  Worse than that, the Forestry Department agreed with me, many months ago, that this man should be taken back and that he would be the first man to be taken back again when they were extending their employment.</P>
    <P>How was that assurance honoured?  I accepted that assurance at the time, but how was it honoured by the head officials of the Department?  When there was occasion recently to employ extra workers, and when three extra workers were employed, how were they taken on?  Was this man employed? Did the Forestry Department officials honour their assurance?  You may be sure that they did not.  Despite the acute unemployment position that existed in Dunmanway, one of these men was taken off county council work, which is very scarce.  He was working with the county council on a local job. He was able to give up that job and say: &ldquo;I am getting a job from the Forestry Department.&rdquo;  He was transferred from working with the county council to the Forestry Department and this man to whom I am referring was completely forgotten.  Two other men were employed at the same time I should like to know from the Minister how he can stand over the statements of his agents, across the road in Merrion Square, that employment in West Cork, as indeed in any part of <Col N="799" /> the country, is strictly through the labour exchange, and that unless a person is registered as unemployed in the labour exchange he will not get employment.</P>
    <P>I think it is a shame and a scandal and establishing a bad precedent.  The workers in Dunmanway are at their wits' end to find a few weeks' employment, now and again, to keep them going and there is no harder hit town in the country than Dunmanway.  We are always trying to find out if there is any hope of any extra work being provided there by the Forestry Department, and by the county council, and this is what happens&mdash;this glaring scandal of taking a man from county council work, after asking for his discharge from the county council engineer, I presume, and letting him walk over and get employment with the Forestry Department in an area in which such acute unemployment exists.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about this and my position as a T.D. for the area can be appreciated.  I have told the people what the officials of the Department told me, that employment was through the labour exchange.  What answer had I for the many people who wrote to me concerning the employment of this man?  It led these people to believe, and they will not believe otherwise, that my information regarding the recruitment of labour was wrong and that my statement that a man could not be taken from another type of employment and put into a forestry job was wrong.  Apart altogether from the question of employment in that area&mdash;and I may say that I never like to abuse any privilege which attaches to membership of this House&mdash;there is something wrong there.  There is growing dissatisfaction in that forestry district, a dissatisfaction which does not exist in the other two districts in West Cork.  It is entirely due to the fact that the people in charge are incapable of doing their job, or at least they are not capable of dealing with an ordinary group of workers.  I am fearful that the fact of having a disgruntled group of workers, will mean that the output will not be as large as we would wish, but I cannot see what other conclusion one <Col N="800" /> can come to because of the dissatisfaction existing both as regards the employment of workers and the nature of their employment.  The best chance you have of getting along smoothly is if you are an active member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Then you are left alone.  But if you happen to support Murphy, then God help you.  That is the position in this forest near Dunmanway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nonsense.  I had no communication with the forestry officials in that area, good, bad or indifferent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned earlier I was not charging the Minister with being guilty of any offence, as far as this is concerned.  The Minister may not be aware of the position, but over the past 12 months I have discussed this again and again with officials of the Department, and I have got assurances from them which they did not honour.  They told me they were satisfied that this man suspended 12 months ago was a capable worker guilty of an isolated blunder and that he would be the first man to be taken on as soon as employment was available.  That assurance has been grossly dishonoured.</P>
      <P>I think I am right in expressing the viewpoint of several workers in the Dunmanway district and in putting these facts before the Minister.  They feel they are not getting fair play and that unless they are in very close touch with the head labourer there, it is very difficult to get fair play.  I am asking the Minister to inquire into my remarks; I am not charging him personally with any offence or any departure from the regulations.  It is impossible for a Minister up here in Dublin to be conversant with what is happening in every forest in the country or to be conversant with all the details of the two Departments he has charge of.  But I feel that where a question of principle is involved, it is my duty to bring it to the Minister's notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to dwell any further on that aspect.  I must say I am very disappointed with the Forestry Division. I expected that the assurance they gave me would be honoured; and when I informed the people on whose behalf I made representations that so-and-so <Col N="801" /> would happen, I did so in good faith, in the belief that the information I got from the Department was genuine.  I am sorry that is not the position.  I think it is only right for me after my repeated representations over the past 12 months to make this public in the House.</P>
    <P>While, dealing with the employment position in Dunmanway, I should like to ask the Minister what is the position in regard to the Coolkelure estate. The 814 acres in that estate were supposed to be taken over by the Forestry Division some three years ago.  There were a few technical difficulties to be overcome, but I was informed, even during the previous Minister's time, that these difficulties were of a minor nature, that it was expected the land would be finally acquired and that the work would proceed in the very near future.  I am asking the Minister now to ensure as far as he possibly can that the question of this estate will be finally dealt with and that work be commenced there as early as possible to try to relieve the unemployment position in the district.</P>
    <P>Another matter I was asked to bring to the Minister's attention was this question of the incentive bonus.  I know he has replied to a question put to him by myself and later that he gave more elaborate information to Deputy Mrs. Ryan.  We in Cork and Tipperary feel that this bonus scheme should be extended as soon as possible. If the Minister believes it is a good idea, I do not see why there should be any great delay in extending the scheme and giving all the workers employed by the Department an equal opportunity of benefiting by it.  I am sure it will be a benefit.</P>
    <P>We have big tracts of land in West Cork suitable for forestry which have been offered to the Minister.  They are in the Skibbereen, Baltimore and Schull areas and along the Berehaven peninsula.  Acres of land have been acquired by the Minister's Department and I have been asked to stress as strongly as possible to the Minister and the Department the necessity of trying to get schemes going in these areas as quickly as possible.  We have a very big emigration problem in these districts.  They are congested areas, <Col N="802" /> and there are no local industries available. There is little work of a public or private nature available to relieve unemployment.  In order to stay at home people are depending now on the development of forestry in the area. I am asking the Minister to do the best he can to get schemes going in these areas.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I should like to refer to is this question of the value of land acquired by the Forestry Division. Many people complain that the £10 ceiling is not sufficient.  The Minister should re-examine the position as far as the ceiling value of land is concerned. I think if he does so he cannot but increase the figure.  If we are to get any suitable land, or medium type land, we will have to pay more than £10 per acre for it.  Everyone knows that cattle and sheep prices have been very good of late, and the roughest land, if the farmer had capital to put sheep and cattle on it, would earn more for him than selling it to the Department.</P>
    <P>I remember listening to a very sound statement made by the former Deputy Maguire from Leitrim when speaking on forestry.  Possibly he had a different viewpoint from most Deputies. If I quote him correctly, I think he stated that many farmers who sell their land to the Forestry Division do so because they have no capital to work that land.  Many of them are not sufficiently well-off to stock the land. Their economic position is not sound and consequently they have to raise money.  The only easy way of raising it is by selling portion of their farms to the Forestry Division.  That is not a good idea if it means that the portion of the farm left is uneconomic. We are anxious to get land for forestry.  It is a matter for each landowner to determine for himself whether it is advisable or not to dispose of land to the Forestry Division.  Many of these people are anxious that the ceiling price should be increased.  Having regard to all the conditions obtaining at present, £10 per acre is not sufficient. I can bear that out from my own knowledge and I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter of that £10 ceiling price per acre for land</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> I shall not delay the House any longer and I am very sorry that I had to make the statements which I made at the outset.  In that connection, I want to say that my remarks referred in particular to only one of the three forestry districts in County Cork.  I am asking the Minister to examine the particulars of this case and he will find that I have called to the office, phoned the office and made several representations regarding this matter because I thought it could be dealt with privately.  Whether the Minister has any responsibility or not, I cannot say; I am not charging him on that ground, but the Minister, as Minister for Lands, must accept responsibility for the work and conduct of his officers and it is his responsibility to see that employment is given on an equitable basis.  It is also his responsibility to see that all his officers and workers, from the head of the Department down to the humblest labourer, carry out their duties efficiently.</P>

      <P>I was glad to notice that in the speeches of Deputies to-day there is a general measure of agreement that the Minister has been able to submit a satisfactory report on his Department this year in regard to forestry.  I think when we have begun to approach the question of forestry in that way it augurs well for the future.</P>
      <P>Anybody who has bothered to make a close study of forestry development will notice that it was during the past four or five years that progress has been really satisfactory&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Our annual target of 25,000 acres has been substantially achieved in the year under review.  I am particularly impressed by the fact that the progress achieved in planting <Col N="804" /> was eclipsed, so to speak, by the number of acres that have been acquired&mdash;approximately 24,000.  The Minister indicated that he felt some uneasiness with regard to the reserve of land available for planting.  The total unplanted reserve now available is evidently less than two-and-a-half times the annual target.  I think there should be no reason for uneasiness there.  If the Minister can succeed, year by year, in acquiring as much land as he succeeds in planting, or approximately the same amount, he is doing reasonably well.</P>
      <P>As I said last year, I feel that the methods hitherto employed in the acquisition of land are slightly outdated and a little impractical.  I indicated when I spoke on the Vote last year that a more realistic approach should be made to that problem.  I often think that if the Minister could broaden the scope of the authority vested at present in the officers who go out to acquire land so as to enable them to approach people likely to be in a position to give land&mdash;as local farmers would do if they wanted additional pasture land&mdash;and negotiate directly with them, more satisfactory results could be achieved.</P>
      <P>A Deputy&mdash;I think it was Deputy Palmer&mdash;this morning made what I regarded as a very good point when he suggested that the Minister might examine the possibility of enabling owners of mountain lands suitable for afforestation to qualify for an exchange or transfer under the Land Commission system of settlement.  At the moment the Land Commission will not take such land for exchange and I think there are many holders of that kind of land who would be very glad to exchange it&mdash;particularly in our part of the country&mdash;with the Land Commission for farms in Dublin or adjoining counties.  I feel that sooner or later the Minister will have to take new steps to satisfy the requirements of the Department in regard to acquisition and I would recommend him to examine the suggestion made by the Deputy on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general policy of the Department when acquiring land for forestry is to acquire only land which appears <Col N="805" /> to be suitable for forestry purposes. Usually, the land is acquired in parcels of different sizes and it often happens that a couple of acres of land more suitable for agriculture are taken over.  It is very important that if any land of that type is acquired, it should be exchanged with some local farmer for land of an inferior type suitable for forestry.</P>
    <P>An even more important point is the housing problem which the Forestry Division must face eventually in connection with workers employed in different forestry centres.  Where suitable building sites are available on any lands taken over, the Department should give such sites to local authorities who might be interested in building houses for labourers or other eligible people in the district.</P>
    <P>I would even suggest that sooner or later it would probably be good policy for the Department to consider erecting schemes of houses for their workers.  There is a very good precedent for that.  When Bord na Móna found difficulty in housing workers, they did not hesitate to seek the necessary financial aid to erect houses and rent them to workers on a differential scale of rents.  Adjacent to most bogs there are small schemes of workers' houses.  The workers on those bogs are contented because they are well-housed, are living near their work and have a sense of security.  It is important to have houses for forestry workers near forestry centres and I suggest that the Minister should see what can be done about it in due course.</P>
    <P>With regard to general State policy in the matter of forestry, generally speaking, a high degree of satisfaction has been expressed by Deputies. We are all satisfied that, whatever criticism may be offered of the Forestry Branch, they have proved themselves very competent to carry out the responsibility imposed on them.  It is highly important that they should get co-operation in every practical way.  The people have got into a rather bad habit because of the fact that the State was originally obliged, in the first instance, to do all that was required in the matter of forestry.  It <Col N="806" /> was later appreciated that, no matter how successful the State might be in that sphere, it would not be possible for the State alone to overtake the arrears of planting which had accrued.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the public have realised the necessity for private planting. Steps were, in fact, taken by the Forestry Branch under various Ministers to encourage private planting but unfortunately, very little, if any, progress was made.  Therefore, I am glad that the Minister has found it possible now to increase the private planting grant.  I am quite sure there will be criticism on the lines that the increase is not sufficient.  It is time that we should get down to brass-tacks and realise that in this matter we are doing something for ourselves, that we are developing a very important asset which should be jealously guarded.  It must be accepted that the State cannot come into the picture more than is reasonable.</P>
    <P>The scheme which the Minister has prepared is a practicable scheme.  I am all with him in so far as part of the grant is paid on a deferred basis.  The initial payment is quite sufficient to enable a person who is serious about developing a private plantation to prepare the land, fence and secure the plantation.  When we commit ourselves to the payment of a grant for that work, we should be satisfied that the plantation is properly guarded and developed, and that it is attended to in accordance with the advice that is available and moreover that it will get a reasonable opportunity to mature in the normal way.  Therefore, it is desirable that the second instalment of the grant should be deferred and paid only on well laid down conditions.</P>
    <P>There are one or two points in that connection that may cause the Minister a certain amount of worry and frustration. There is a feeling among landowners in rural districts that if they were to plant certain waste tracts of land, the poor law valuation would be increased.  I do not know what the law is in that connection.  There is a low valuation on waste land.  Where such land is planted, there should be no increase in valuation at least until the plantation matures, which would be <Col N="807" /> many years ahead.  I am rather surprised that there should be any anxiety in that connection.  There is a precedent for that.  For instance, under the land rehabilitation scheme and various land projects, large tracts of land have been considerably improved, but there is no change in valuation.  I should like the Minister to deal with that aspect of the problem when replying to the debate, because it is the first difficulty he has to surmount.</P>

      <P>I am very glad.  There is the question of technical advice. Believe it or not, there is very little knowledge available to landowners with regard to planting.  So far as private planting is concerned, it has been carried out by trial and error. There are no two people of the same mind as to the correct method of developing a private plantation.  I appreciate that the number of technical experts available for this work is very limited.  Apart from the local horticultural instructors who take care of this activity, there are no &ldquo;free lance&rdquo; experts available.</P>
      <P>When private planting is undertaken on a satisfactory scale, how does the Minister propose to make available to interested persons the necessary technical advice?  If advice is not available, the results will be unsatisfactory; the private individual's time and money and the State grants involved will be put to bad use.  We are rather understaffed in the matter of technical experts on forestry and private planting. My suggestion to the Minister is that, in view of the small number of experts available to give advice and instruction in this matter, he should consider adopting some central scheme whereby he could recruit suitable young people to existing State forests where they would get a course of elementary training under the direction of qualified foresters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the knowledge and experience such trainees could thus acquire they could be afterwards assigned to the local committees of agriculture, under <Col N="808" /> the supervision of the permanent trained horticultural instructor, to advise on simple problems in connection with the selection of suitable types of land, the planting of trees, the treatment of soil and other minor problems which are relevant to these projects.  There are very important duties to be attended to by the existing experts and I think it would be unfair to divert them from the present line of activities in which they are engaged.  At the same time, it would be a highly dangerous thing to start off private planting, if there is not some reliable, semi-skilled technical person available to give landowners the advise necessary at the commencement of operations and later on as planting develops.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the question of land acquisition, if the Minister succeeds in getting private planting activities extended in the way he envisages, the question of land acquisition will become more easy.  At the moment, the most difficult land to acquire is bad land, especially if it is suitable for the grazing of sheep or cattle.  With the development of private planting, the problem may be eased because it may be possible to persuade the owners of such land to develop it themselves by private planting.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that a campaign is being initiated for the purpose of inducing landowners to embark on this scheme.  He indicated a number of ways in which that campaign would operate and named the bodies which it was proposed to interest in it.  I think the Minister should go further at this stage.  I would suggest to him that with the co-operation of his colleague, the Minister for Education, he may be able to get the schools, particularly the vocational schools, to take part in this campaign.  At the moment the campaign may get off to a good start with the people directly interested, but a campaign of that kind is rather hard to keep up eventually.  To keep up the good work is always a job.  It is when such a campaign would be showing results in the private planting of trees that interest in the project could best be maintained in the schools.  The vocational schools could do very good work in that connection because of their <Col N="809" /> close association with such voluntary bodies as Macra na Feirme whose services are to be enlisted in support of this project.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to what has become known as peat planting.  At the moment, it is proposed to make a start on lands acquired by Bord na Móna and which are now known as cutaway bogs.  That is a very important step.  I suggest that these parcels of land should be taken over for demonstration purposes.  Most counties, particularly on the western seaboard, where so much leeway has to be made up, have large tracts of cutaway bog on which a start could be made.  I think it would be a distinct advantage if that project could be &ldquo;farmed out&rdquo; to Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>During the winter and early spring months, the activities of Bord na Móna are somewhat restricted because weather conditions are not suitable for the development of turf production. That is the time when forestry work could be undertaken.  If the Minister could come to a satisfactory arrangement with the local managements of Bord na Móna, it would ensure continuous employment for the staff of the board all the year round. In my constituency, about 300 acres of bog were acquired by Bord na Móna about 20 years ago and in a year or two from now the entire area will be completely cut out.  I understand that the Minister has already had consultations with Bord na Móna with a view to taking over this bog as a forest and I hope he will find it possible to develop that cutaway bog without delay.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy M.P. Murphy who spoke about the unsatisfactory method of recruiting forestry workers. There are only one or two small forest areas in my constituency and I have no complaint to make about the employment of workers in that area.  All the men are recruited through the proper channels.  They are got through the employment exchange and preference is given to the men in receipt of the highest amount of unemployment assistance.  From these men are selected the most suitable, having regard to the type of work to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> The only complaint I have to make is that the existing scope of activity is not sufficient to employ all the men available.  I have to say here that there is no complaint from my part of the constituency with regard to the employment of men.  I think they get a fair share of the work and that they get good employment whilst working.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister has been able to introduce, at long last, the incentive bonus scheme for workers employed on forest projects.  That is a very attractive arrangement for workers employed on forestry activities. There is already in the rural areas, particularly amongst turf workers employed by Bord na Móna, a somewhat similar incentive scheme.  I think the Minister will have very little difficulty in getting the forest workers to accept that the idea of the scheme is to improve the employment remuneration, as well as of course to improve the output in these forests.</P>
    <P>I am happy to note from the Minister's statement that the worker can earn from 30/- to £3 a week through that bonus scheme.  I appeal to the Minister to have as little delay as possible in bringing this scheme into operation through the entire area of forestry work.</P>
    <P>I join with my colleague, Deputy Palmer, in appealing to the Minister that, if and when pulp processing factories are being set up, they be placed as far away as possible from Dublin. Industrial pulp processing should be decentralised and sited in the different areas where our forests are likely to be developed.  One point which I regarded as very satisfactory in the Minister's report was his reference to the additional money he has provided for technical assistance.  This type of assistance is all the more necessary when the Minister has in mind the development that he explained with regard to the setting up of pulp factories, and I sincerely hope the time is coming when we will have a number of those factories throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There is another good reason why there should be some research work into the growth of the various types of trees.  We were dependent on a number of unskilled experts in the past to <Col N="811" /> advise us as to the correct type of trees to plant in the different types of soil, and I have not the slightest doubt that many mistakes were made in the advice given.  At all events, it is now about time we did have real experts who know their job, and I hope the Minister will experience no particular difficulty in having that research undertaken with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking I think I have covered the main points I wanted to refer to and, as I said at the outset, this is an easy Estimate to deal with because, on the whole, it is one which records much progress and achievement. From my point of view, it is entirely satisfactory in that some positive step has at last been taken to try to develop forestry by private planting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>As I will have some criticisms to make of the Minister's Department, I am glad, at the outset, to welcome the doubling of the grant for private planting.  I might add that it is long overdue and that the amount of £10 per acre allowed so far&mdash;£5 payable on planting and the other £5 after five years&mdash;was quite unrealistic in regard to present-day prices.  I think it is clear that the Minister has been motivated in this action by the fact that there has been a considerable reduction in private planting, a fact to which he referred in his opening statement. In fact, we are gradually getting to a condition where practically all planting at the moment is being carried out by the State and, I think, when we come to consider it, we will realise there is not much incentive for a private individual to plant trees nowadays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a private individual plants his land with trees, even though he obtains the sum of £20 an acre, over a great many years he has to pay rates on that and, as well, in some of the bigger estates, he has to pay income-tax.  If the Minister comes to consider it, he will find if anybody fells timber or clears a plantation and, say, he has some 30 or 40 acres to replant on some of the big estates&mdash;that is the place you are most likely to get planting&mdash;he will have to pay rates for 30 years before he gets <Col N="812" /> any return, and he is also likely to pay income-tax on that holding as well.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose anybody gets the benefit of the timber he plants in his lifetime and, by the time his descendants will derive anything from thinnings for pulping, or from the final matured timber, they will really have paid the amount they get a couple of times over.  The return they are getting now is £20 an acre, which is a more realistic sum than £10 an acre, but, at the same time, it does not give much return and is not much incentive to private individuals.  State plantations pay no rates and no taxes and, therefore, it is easy for the State to plant as compared with the private individual. I do not think it is right that that state of affairs should obtain.</P>
    <P>Practically every Deputy in the House, with a few exceptions, feels himself committed to private enterprise, but how can private enterprise be fostered and encouraged in circumstances such as that?  It is time some very serious thinking was done in the Minister's Department, but, at the same time, while saying that I should like to congratulate him on having the courage to double the amount of the grant.  However, when he was going part of the road, he might have gone the whole way.  He might have raised the grant to £25 an acre which would be more commensurate with present-day prices to cover the cost of trees, of labour and of materials for fencing to make the trees safe from vermin and so forth.</P>
    <P>With regard to the taking over of land, a problem to which some Deputies referred, I feel there is not sufficient expedition in the taking over of land by the Forestry Department.  I have had first hand knowledge of that problem myself, and I should like the Minister to give the House some idea of what actually happens between his Department and the Land Commissioners when land is offered to him.  I have known of many instances where offers of land made by farmers, usually in the high country, contained pockets of arable land.  I have known several instances where the Department was offered over 100 acres which, perhaps, contained 30 or less arable acres of <Col N="813" /> land.  I am totally and strongly opposed, as the Minister's officials know, to the planting of trees in arable land.  I think it is a positive outrage, considering it has been stated so often that there is not sufficient arable land in the country to go around, and the idea of the Forestry Department going in on arable land does not make sense to me.  There is no use in anybody saying that has not happened because I have seen it taking place in the area in which I live.</P>
    <P>When a farmer offers land to the Forestry Department and there is an arable portion contained in his offer, the Land Commissioners say they are not interested and then the offer is referred back to the Forestry Department. Perhaps at that stage pressure may be put on them and it goes back to the Land Commission again, and this causes endless delay.  There seems to be no co-operation between those two Departments.  They have got different systems of finance.  The Forestry Department, I think, is entitled to pay out hard cash, but the Land Commission can only pay in bonds which are not always realisable at cash value. However, I believe the Minister has some direction over both Departments, and he could create some system whereby the mechanism could be improved.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what the procedure is when offers of land are made to his Department, and to tell us what the procedure is between the Forestry Department and the Land Commission.  I should like him to tell us how many officials deal with an offer of land, when it passes through the administrative section, how many people it goes to, and how long, in the ordinary course of events, such a transaction takes.  It should be easy to arrange that.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject, I should like to mention that I have known cases where land has been inspected and the owner has been told he would hear from the Forestry Department in the course of a few weeks.  The Department know the names of these cases and I have been in touch with the Department about them.  The extraordinary thing is that when you go in there, you always find they are <Col N="814" /> going to write to a person and tell him they are taking over the land.  If the Forestry Department want land, why do they not take it over?  Why is this frustrating position allowed to develop in regard to its being taken over?  I know many of the officials in the Department believe that what I am saying is right and should be rectified. Many officials are themselves suffering from frustration.  The only person who can rectify that is the Minister, and that is why I am bringing it up on this Estimate.  Until that is rectified, there is no use in saying that the amount of reservable land for planting is at a dangerously low level.  It would not be so if there were some decent mechanism contrived and some efficiency introduced into the method of taking over land.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the Courtown estate, and as I have some hard things to say, I want to make it clear that I do not place the blame entirely on the Minister, though he must take his share in the final act on that estate.  I can describe it in no other way than &ldquo;a public futility&rdquo;.  In 1951, when I was elected to Dáil Éireann, I discovered that An Bord Fáilte had offered to the Forestry Department Courtown estate, which comprises some 300 acres.  I was asked to ensure that the transfer would be as rapid as possible, so that some people might get employment rather than have to emigrate.  I interviewed several officials and was shown a file &mdash;actually not in the Minister's Department but in An Bord Fáilte&mdash;and I may say that if you put two copies of the British Encyclopædia, one on top of the other, they would appear quite diminutive beside this file.</P>
    <P>The correspondence had been going on between the two Departments over three cottages on the estate&mdash;until someone got the idea of railing the three cottages off and transferring the estate.  That took several years.  It was then transferred to the Department of Forestry.  There are 70 acres of arable land in it.  I asked the Department about it and suggested they should offer the arable portion of the land to the Land Commission, which they did.  I understood the Land Commission's function was to take over <Col N="815" /> arable land, but they refused this. This did not actually happen in the Minister's time.  The land was sent back again.  I went in and raised a further row and it went back to the Land Commission again, but the Land Commission again refused it.</P>
    <P>We come on gradually to the present day.  There are four or five smallholders living adjacent to this Courtown estate and they are all suitable people to hold land.  I know the estate has been inspected by the Land Commission officials.  I suspect&mdash;of course, I have no inside information, as I am an Opposition Deputy&mdash;that a scheme has been prepared for the transmission of this land to suitable smallholders. I suspect that that scheme has been frozen down by someone in the other Department.  Anyway, the land has been given back to the Forestry Department again.  The Forestry Department has 70 acres of arable land.  They have decided now to sell that land.  They decided that, I believe, three or four months ago. The Minister replied to a parliamentary question by me, to that effect. The land has not yet gone up for public tender.  I think this represents the acme of futility between two Departments, the Minister being responsible for both of them.</P>
    <P>There are 70 acres of arable land belonging to the Forestry Department, absolutely in their possession, as far as I know, as freehold, to do with it what they like, and they cannot transfer those 70 acres to the Land Commission to divide amongst smallholders.  If that is not public futility, I do not know what is.  That has been going on since before 1951 until 1958.  I do not know how much money has been expended in officials writing letters to each other.  Of course, I presume they are only acting under the direction of the Minister.  Anyway, there has been voluminous correspondence.  I have not seen the file myself since 1953 or 1954, when it was the size of two British Encyclopaedias on top of each other; it has probably mounted in size by now.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister, as Minister for Forestry, that he owns this estate <Col N="816" /> and is responsible for it, that he has 70 acres of arable land, that there are four or five smallholders there, and that he do his duty and divide that land amongst them, rather than sell it publicly, after holding it for eight years.  I would make it clear that he is not to be held responsible for all of this, but he has been responsible for the final act of public futility in putting it up for sale.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether we are rapidly getting to the stage at which, on account of the rapid expansion of forestry plantation, we have too much land in State ownership.  The Minister made clear in his statement yesterday, which I have not to my hand at the moment, that the aim was to plant 1,000,000 acres and that these 1,000,000 acres would be practically all in State ownership.  That means there will be approximately one-seventeenth of the land owned by the State.  In a private enterprise economy, I do not think that is right.  It is not a good thing to have a huge area of the State like that&mdash; even though it matures later on and may be a benefit to the State&mdash;in the control of whatever the Government of the day is.</P>
    <P>A system has been tried in many other countries and successfully tried. I feel that the Minister himself has some knowledge of European conditions. In France a greater part of the forests are owned by the local authorities; and where they are not, they are leased to private individuals.  The Forestry Department in France is a very efficient one; it confines itself largely to technical matters, to the teaching of foresters, and so on.  It tries as far as possible to shed itself of the overhead ownership.  Most of its forests&mdash;take the Vosges, to name one of the biggest forests in France&mdash;are owned by the local authority, they administer them, they sell the timber and they give a vast amount of employment, which goes a long way to keep down the rates.</P>
    <P>If we are driving ahead at the rate of 25,000 acres a year&mdash;even though, as a Deputy said this morning, it would take 30 years&mdash;in 30 years' time, the Forestry Department will own one-seventeenth of the land.  I do not see why the Minister should not direct his <Col N="817" /> energies and intelligence&mdash;of which he has plenty&mdash;in that line and try to evolve some scheme whereby the State would have the over-all charge, but would encourage the people to develop the land and not put the State grasp on it, to try to hold everything for themselves.</P>
    <P>Letting to private individuals is being tried in a great many countries.  In Scandinavian countries, where there is a forestry tradition, and in Britain, where they are, perhaps, as forestry-minded as we are, that has been tried and tried successfully.  In that way, the State ultimately receives an annual financial return for capital expenditure on afforestation.  If we continue as we are doing at the moment, from my experience as a Deputy, I should think we will not get anywhere.  When the State comes into a project, the dead-hand of the Civil Service immediately makes itself felt.  I do not say that in any derogation of civil servants; civil servants have to do their duty.  They must safeguard the moneys at their disposal.  They are also aware of the Public Accounts Committee in the background and they are aware of the a certain extent.  More satisfactory results in the long run can be obtained from private enterprise than from State enterprise.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why private enterprise should not play a large part in afforestation.  I have asked the Minister questions on one or two occasions directed to that end and the Minister has told me that it is not possible. If other countries can do it, we can do it.  We cannot claim to be forestry experts and I think we have done extraordinarily well up to this, but we should now follow the example set for us by those countries which are expert in afforestation.</P>
    <P>The marketing of timber is not successful here.  It is not easy to dispose of home-grown timber.  There is a certain demand in South Munster and in the West, but, generally speaking, it is not easy to sell home-grown timber. The Minister should get his hands on some of the money provided for market research in an effort to solve this problem.  We have very heavy imports of timber.  The practice which has most militated against the sale of <Col N="818" /> home-grown timber is the fact that the timber is felled and used almost immediately. It is not left to season.  In Scandinavian countries&mdash;I have seen it, too, in France&mdash;the timber is felled, the bark is stripped and the wood is left to season before it is finally disposed of.  Because of the practice to which I referred earlier, Irish timber has quite unjustifiably got a bad name. Builders providers will not take it for house building.  They want imported timber because it is better seasoned. If Irish timber is given a fair chance, it will be as good as any in the world.</P>
    <P>The Minister should foster and encourage private enterprise in the growing of timber.  He should ensure that those who grow timber are relieved of the crippling taxation imposed upon them and that they get a remunerative return for their labour.  If that is done, there is an assured future for forests in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>Afforestation has been geared to a very high pitch and it is a perpetual joy to see the beautifully wooded slopes and tracts of land throughout the country to-day.  There is nothing pleasanter to the eye.  These woodlands provide an attraction for tourists, too.  In addition, the forests will, at some future date, give an assured financial return to the nation. The sum of £14,000,000 spent on afforestation to date is money well spent.</P>
      <P>About 12 months ago, I put down two questions to the Minister.  I felt that the £10 was of little use and provided no encouragement to a farmer to plant an acre of ground.  The Minister has now gone half-way to meet the farmers in that regard.  It is a step forward, but better results would, I think, be obtained if real encouragement were given to the young men in their teens to plant trees.  These young people, particularly those of them who emigrate, would be glad to see the fruits of their labour in the form of mature trees.  I did a little afforestation myself and it now gives me great pleasure to go back and see the growth that has taken place over the past 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should set up a committee of the various farming organisations with a view to developing <Col N="819" /> afforestation still further.  That committee could guide the Minister and those interested in afforestation.  The officials of the Forestry Division cannot take the same intimate interest in developing private forests as they take in State afforestation.  The establishment of a committee, such as I suggest, would be a step in the right direction.  As the Minister said, he is starting from scratch in this regard. Over the years nothing was done in this direction; no encouragement was given.  We are starting off on the right foot now, and that is all-important.</P>
    <P>The greatest difficulty of any farmer who intends to engage in private planting is the provision of suitable trees. It takes four years to develop a sapling. I know they can be put out after three years, but I was always better pleased with the four-year-old.  They stand up better to the rough ground and the hard weather to which we are accustomed.  However, the Minister should go all out to develop private forestry through the aid of young boys, especially the members of Macra na Feirme.  Instead of expecting fathers to plant for their sons, we should encourage the sons to plant for themselves. When the father of a family gets to a certain age he is not very interested in doing this type of work, but young lads are.  I was very interested in it myself.  The youth of to-day, given the proper lead, would make even more headway in ten years than the Forestry Department has made in the past 10 years, although I compliment the Department on the great advance they have made in the development of State forestry.</P>
    <P>I do not think private foresters can provide all the trees required.  The cost of the trees on an acre of ground would be almost £20 and if the Minister, instead of giving the grant, provided the trees for certain Macra na Feirme clubs, it would be the proper step to take under the guidance of the committee, as I have suggested.  There might be a risk that the trees would not be looked after as well as the State forests are but the scheme is worth trying out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> The number of acres available, particularly on smallholdings in the congested districts, is very great indeed. It is not likely that the farmer in those congested districts will want to part with his parcel of land, but if the wasteland on these smallholdings were planted it would be a great help to these uneconomic holdings and would beautify the countryside.  I understand the average holdings taken over by the State in recent years is 70 acres.  For private planting the area would be in the region of an acre or two, but scattered over a wide area that could amount to a very large acreage over a period of years.</P>
    <P>Although a vast acreage of wasteland is being planted, farmers are reluctant to part with this type of land.  Even where they are anxious to part with it the Department officials strike a very hard bargain.  The maximum of £10 is very rarely given.  The officials are too much inclined to take advantage of the circumstances of a farmer who may be anxious, through shortage of cash or for one reason or another, to part with some of the holding, and they give him, perhaps, half the maximum price.  If they were more reasonable and more generous in their dealings with the farmers they would have less difficulty in acquiring land and there would be no scarcity of it for their purposes.</P>
    <P>With the development of forestry in the future, we must have some outlet for the timber.  It would be almost impossible to sell a substantial portion of it at a fair price, so the necessity will arise for the establishment of an industry for the processing of this timber whether it be for pulp or paper. Of course, the proper thing to do would be to set up such an industry convenient to where the timber grows.  I hope it will not be set up in Dublin which is already overtaxed with industries but that it will be set up in rural Ireland so as to give employment to the people in rural districts, which are getting very depopulated.  If that incentive were there, I hope an industry would be set up for the marketing of trees.  It would be a further inducement to farmers to go in more for forestry development on their own holdings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> Up to now, it was almost impossible to sell trees except at sacrifice price. It is important that the Minister should, as soon as possible, make known his intentions in that regard. Whether it be set up under State control or by private enterprise is a matter for the Minister.  I am in favour of private enterprise.  Certain types of businesses may be too elaborate and too big for private enterprise as, for example, E.S.B., Bord na Móna and C.I.E. which are doing a reasonably good job.  However, I would perfer, if this could be done under private enterprise. The development of private forestry is very important.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing an excellent job in extending State forestry.  I wish him the best of luck.  I hope he will be as successful in the development of private forestry as he is in the development of State forestry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, the most significant part of the Minister's long and detailed statement last evening was that part in which he said his Department are aiming at a plantation of 22,500 acres this year.  That is very creditable.</P>
      <P>Over the years, in this House and outside it, there have been incessant demands by organisations interested in trees for an increased acreage under forestry.  In fairness to the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Blowick, it must be said he geared up the Department to that increased activity.  It is very gratifying to find the present Minister continuing along those lines.  I feel he will not slack in the least in the drive that has been put into forestry in recent years and that he will not be satisfied with a target of 25,000 acres a year but will exceed it.  That is a result we should all like to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can look forward to the time when the development of forestry will be our greatest rural activity.  In our present limited circumstances, it will provide a very useful potential for employing labour in rural districts.  As has been stated by other Deputies, any money put into forestry is money well spent.  It is productive of wonderful results.  In a few years' time, forestry should be a great revenue-earning acti <Col N="822" /> vity or yield a good deal of money for what is invested in it now.</P>
    <P>It is soul-stirring to see in parts of the country areas which were waste and barren regions now being covered with forests.  It is very gratifying, when travelling through the country to see the incomparable beauty that has been added to districts which at one time were rather weird looking but are now so charming to the eye. We are all very proud of that.  As Joyce Kilmer, the poet, said, a tree is a noble work of God and its development is a thing we should all treasure.</P>
    <P>The Minister will always get sufficient land for forestry if he pays the price for it.  I concede that most of the land used is of very poor value. Nevertheless, the people who have a sacred right to that land value it just as if it were equal in fertility to some of our best land.  I think it is not generally known&mdash;I did not know it until I came up against it&mdash;that when the Forestry Department take over land, and offer a very small price for the very poor land, they deduct the redemption of the annuity when paying the person who is giving the land. Therefore, in the last analysis, the amount received by the owner of the land is negligible.</P>
    <P>The Minister should arrange with the other branch of his Department and make some arrangement about the annuity and at least give the owner that benefit and not charge him for the outstanding annuities that remain on that portion of the land taken over.</P>
    <P>To the gratification of many, the Minister has doubled the grant for private planting but, in doing so, he has held over the second mojety for at least five years.  That is a bit long. If a landowner has the initiative, industry and determination to develop an acre, or two, three or five acres, of his land for forestry puposes, I think he will be anxious to protect that forestry to the very maximum.  If, after the first two years&mdash;the important years in the development of a new forest&mdash;the inspector accepts that everything is in order, the second moiety of the grant should be paid over.  That would give an added incentive to private planting.  Nevertheless, <Col N="823" /> I readily compliment the Minister on doubling the grant, which is one way of encouraging private planting.</P>
    <P>Forest fires have been mentioned and suggestions have been made as to how these dangers may be eliminated. In conjunction with the Department of Justice, the Forestry Department should prohibit fires within a quarter of a mile, at least, of any forest land. A very heavy penalty should be imposed on anybody infringing on that rule.  It is unpardonable that people should be so indifferent, careless or reckless as to be responsible for the ignition and destruction of forests.  It is lamentable and shows a great want of civic sense.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy spoke about the employment of forestry workers and said they should be drawn from the employment exchange.  I agree entirely with him in that regard.  In any development of a temporary nature in rural areas&mdash;constructions or buildings of any kind&mdash;it is very bad to disturb the labour equilibrium.  Sometimes people come off the land at such times and then cannot be replaced later if they are needed.  It is desirable, and I am sure the Forestry Department sees to it, that people are recruited through the employment exchanges for forestry work.</P>
    <P>Forestry is an entirely rural development and I suppose it would be too much to aim at, too Utopian a request, that the Forestry Department should be located in the Midlands, or perhaps in North Munster, say in North Tipperary.  It is extraordinary that a Department, whose activities range over the rural parts of the State, should have its central offices in Dublin.  There may be difficulties involved, the officials have their homes here and so on, but I am sure many of them would gladly move out and help to counteract this menace of centralisation. Departments whose activities are entirely associated with rural development of this kind could usefully be located in some central part of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister's statement is very encouraging and that all the noise we heard over the last four years was <Col N="824" /> not justified.  The results justify the Minister's approach and that of his predecessor to the whole question of forestry development and I hope we will continue the good work until we have reached the target which we would all like to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement is encouraging.  After the long years of delay and neglect we are now getting into our stride.  So far as my county is concerned, while most of the land there is arable land and does not lend itself very much to forestry, yet we could have more afforestation in Meath.  A lot of the old bogland and marshland around Bohermeen, Girley and Athboy could be utilised for the purpose of afforestation.  It would be of immense importance to that area, even if only from the drainage point of view.  There are large numbers of unemployed in that area, also, who cannot get work unless they emigrate and we do not want that.  In the past most of them got work on road making but now we are almost in a period of road perfection and there is very little employment on the roads.  The drainage and afforestation of those central belts in County Meath could be of immense importance.  I would ask the Forestry Department, if at all possible, to carry out an afforestation scheme at Bohermeen, Girley and Athboy.  That is an area where a forestry centre could be established. At the moment we have only about two or three small forestry centres in Meath and it is time we tried to develop a little more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A vast amount of private planting could be, and should have been, done years ago.  I would like to ask the Forestry Department what happened between the First World War and the Second World War in Meath, where at one time there were vast forestry belts on various estates.  Speculators came in and bought those estates, got permits from the Department and denuded these belts of forestry land. Why was it that they did not have to replant, or where did they replant? Certainly it was not in Meath.  Many of them made hundreds of thousands of pounds on forestry land.  In most of those places I do not see even one <Col N="825" /> acre replanted.  Why is the Department so rigid with a man who wants to cut down, perhaps, a score of trees? He has an inspector down on him at once to make sure he does the necessary replanting.  How can those speculators get away with it when they should have planted thousands of trees?  It is very unfair that one type of law should be applied to one person and another type to somebody else. We could have a vast amount of private planting in Meath if the law were enforced.  I hope it will be enforced; it is unfair to see men getting away with vast sums of money without having to replant.  I ask the Minister to state how they got away with that.</P>
    <P>In regard to private planting, there is no man with a holding, whether of 30 acres or 300 acres, who has not got a huge amount of marginal land, corners of fields, or land on river banks, where he could plant many acres of trees.  I hope that by every possible means we shall encourage these people to get such land under afforestation, even if only for shelter belts and to enhance the picturesque aspect of the country.</P>
    <P>Another matter on which I should like to obtain some information is in regard to the shooting rights over the new forestry belts of the Department. How are they let, and how is it that local people who try to obtain the rights find that they have been let long before the Department has even put up a fence in that area?  There is some pull somewhere; and there should be special advertisements to give local people as much chance of acquiring the rights as the small clique in Dublin and a few others in the country.  I would ask for a statement on that; I should like to know why we cannot get even one of these shooting rights.  The people want them, not for the purpose of making money, but as an amenity in their district and to develop as something worth-while.</P>
    <P>I hope that in future we shall be enabled to know when those rights are being let, that we shall be able to apply for them and get them on paying our fair share.  As far as I can see at present, a certain type of lawyer, very closely connected with some Departments, <Col N="826" /> or with the Kildare Street Club, has the monopoly.  For hundreds of years those shooting rights were denied to the people, even on the land which they possessed, and now we want to see the shooting rights going to the people who live there and not to speculators or to the people in Dublin who have influence.</P>
    <P>There is a vast amount of waste land on our derelict railways and semi-derelict canals which could be planted. One need only go from Dublin to Galway to see tens of thousands of acres of land which is waste.  It is on Government or semi-Government property. If that land were taken over, properly drained and reclaimed and afforestation started, it could transform these areas into picturesque plantations of great value.</P>
    <P>There are many pockets of State or semi-State land which could be utilised for afforestation.  I would ask the Minister to see that land over which railways formerly ran and the canal banks, where there are thousands of acres involved, is taken over by the State for a proper scheme of afforestation. If that were done it would be an incentive to private enterprise to get going, but when private enterprise sees those thousands of acres lying fallow, and being wasted, there is very little incentive to do anything.  Thousands of acres should be taken over and made of some use to the country. The land has been lying derelict for the past 70 or 80 years.  Perhaps stretches are set to local farmers for a few pounds for the period of grazing.  I wants to see it utilised for the public good.  It is a scheme well worth considering. There is too much derelict or semi-derelict land on the hands of the State.</P>
    <P>We should do everything we can to further the development of private afforestation.  Committees of agriculture, the Land Commission and everybody else should be asked to see that everything possible is done to get our farmers and the people in general to plant waste land.  Land is going to waste which could be a public utility in future years.</P>
    <P>The Department, have made very <Col N="827" /> satisfactory progress, and I wish to compliment the previous Minister and the present Minister on the good work done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The schedule of planting for the coming year is something to be proud of and the proposed increase for the following year to 25,000 acres shows that the Government are fully conscious of the value of forestry to the nation.  During the past two months, I have visted the plantation in Glenamoy, an area along the shores of the Atlantic.  I have visited Nephin and have seen where the new trees have been planted along the slopes of the Nephin Mountain.  I have visited Moygownagh, Foxford and Shranmore and I was delighted with the progress I saw in those areas.  Prior to its being planted, this was neglected, boggy, marshy land.  The change, now that the land has been drained and new trees planted, is certainly remarkable. I am certain that far more work can be done in my constituency.  We have a vast area of bogland and plenty of labour.  There is no reason why some of it should not be used for forestry purposes, as I can testify from what I have seen in the area.  The Department can make a good job of practically any land and grow a certain class of tree on it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick said the Minister had been fortunate in having the position prepared for him&mdash;that his Department had been geared up previously. Deputy Blowick likes to claim credit for everything done, but he has in the Department for only a short period.  He forgets that his predecessor had to do the planning before he came into the Department.  I recollect having had a conversation with the late Deputy Derrig&mdash;ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam&mdash;and discussing plans for setting trees in the various areas of Mayo. I certainly admit that Deputy Blowick carried on the good work and did all he could, but it is absurd that he should attempt to take all the credit for the present level of forestry development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forestry can absorb a lot of labour; and when we see that it can save the country from importing foreign timber <Col N="828" /> and pulp, we realise the necessity of developing forestry.  The pulp trade would be able to take up any amount of timber we have, and we will have an export market for it.  There is no doubt in the world about that.</P>
    <P>I have heard talk here about the price for land for forestry.  People should not look for an exorbitant price for land the Government requires.  The tendency is now that if the Government want to acquire land for forestry, people think&mdash;and they are supported by a number of other people&mdash;that the Government should give them at least two or three times the value of the land being acquired.  That is nonsense, and the Government should not give anything more than the land is worth.</P>
    <P>Regarding fires, I would go further than Deputy Manley.  I certainly would ask that strong action be taken against anybody who lights a fire within a mile of a forest area.  When they see such fires, the Guards should go out and investigate. I would also ask schoolteachers to tell the children of the dangers of lighting such fires, and I would even ask the Church in areas where there are plantations, to ask members of the congregation not to light fires and that, if fires are started, they will be quenched immediately. That might prevent the harm being done by these forests fires.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to know that the new labour bonus scheme is proving very beneficial.  It is good to know that the ordinary labourer, carrying out his work fairly well, is getting between 32/- and £3 over the normal rate.  That certainly is an incentive to the country labourer to work diligently and carefully. I hope the scheme will be extended to all forestry areas in the near future.</P>
    <P>There is very little private planting done in an area like mine.  The agricultural instructors should be asked to point out at the various centres the benefits to be derived from private planting and draw attention to the increased grants being given for trees. They should point out that the planting of an acre or two of land with timber is providing something for a rainy day in 20 or 30 years' time.  There would be a little trouble in getting private <Col N="829" /> planting started in an area like mine, but I think it would be worth it.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his magnificent achievement and I hope we will be able to get more than 25,000 acres planted in the coming year.  I hope we will be able to acquire sufficient land to carry out this undertaking.</P>

      <P>Deputy Calleary said that Deputy Blowick had come into a Department which had been prepared for him by previous Ministers and that what he had actually done would appear to be&mdash;though he did not say this&mdash;on &ldquo;another man's wound&rdquo;.  No matter who is Minister for Lands, I am sure his mind would be directed to making a success of the Department and to do as much as he could to see that more trees were planted in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the stumbling blocks is the delay in the acquisition of land and in the method of purchasing it by his officials.  That makes it impossible to acquire land reasonably quickly.  In my constituency of Waterford, lands have been continually offered, during the term of office of Deputy Blowick as Minister, of previous Ministers and probably during the term of this Minister; and inspections have taken place, but that is all that has happened.  I suggest the officers of the Department should be sent down to an area, much <Col N="830" /> in the same way as men are sent to a fair, to purchase the land, if it is on offer.  They could have a price for it and wherever it is offered at that price and is reasonably suitable for forestry, they should take it and they need not be afraid of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>Even if that committee jumps on them, the Minister can slap it back to them and say he is endeavouring to get more land for forestry and to blazes with the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am a member of that committee and I can assure the Minister that I will defend him or his officers if there is ever a question about moneys spent on the acquisition of land for forestry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Palmer mentioned to-day a book on forestry, a classic, <i>The Rape of Ireland,</i> and he said he could not remember who wrote it.  I can tell him; it was John Mackay, a Waterford man. I would recommend Deputies who may not be aware of the whole state of affairs in regard to forestry here and the whole background of it, to read that book.  Deputy Palmer said that he believed it was out of print.  It should be the duty of the Department to put it back into print.</P>
    <P>Deputy Calleary and others mentioned forest fires.  I agree that there should be very strict penalties on people who light picnic fires near forests.  The Department take great care to put up large notices so that people cannot go near these forests without knowing of that danger. Deputy Calleary said that teachers should be asked to tell the children. Why should the parents not do some of this?  Everyone throws it on to the teachers to do this and that.  The people of Ireland own the forests and it is their duty to tell their children&mdash; especially when they have them with them near the forests&mdash;about this important matter and to see to it that care is taken when they are in the vicinity of the national forests.</P>
    <P>All land available for forestry is not overvalued by the people who offer it to the Department.  I have known people to offer land at the Department's figure, but it has been followed by years and years of correspondence, <Col N="831" /> lobbying with Deputies, questions in the House and &ldquo;the matter will be dealt with&rdquo;, and then nothing happens and the land is left unacquired. I know that is not the Minister's fault and I suggest to him again that the method of acquiring land should be changed.  Even if an inspector goes down and buys land, some portion of which is not suitable for forestry or anything else, I would rather have him buy the land and make a mistake than not buy the land and do nothing.  That is the danger in the Civil Service when they come to buy land.</P>
    <P>If would be no harm to have a little inquiry made into the scalping of many estates back through the years. One of the few things that some of the landlords left us were fine demesnes and fine forests, but then the speculators came.  They knocked down the houses; they sold the lead and slates; and they scalped the whole place and went away.  When Deputies drive past them now, there does not appear to have been anything done about replanting. This is not just a case where one should say that if a man cuts down 5,000 or 10,000 trees, many of which may be landscape trees, his duty is done if he plants the same number by taking a small part of the estate and sticking down that number of plants. Practically a quarter of them would not grow.  Where a lot of these parklands are not being used for tillage and where the big roots of the trees are in them, the owners should be made to plant hardwood trees there.</P>
    <P>In the matter of industries for pulping, some people say it would be a good thing to have all this in the hands of one great company.  There is divided opinion on this.  There are several hardboard factories in the country and that is good from the point of view of competition; but even though we would like to nurse our industries, we must remember that we have been for years and years planting forests.  We must not allow those forests to become the monopoly of any trust, if a big company should come along and say: &ldquo;We will establish an industry for the pulping of thinnings from these forests, if we get them at <Col N="832" /> our own prices.&rdquo;  Usually I favour private enterprise, but as forestry is a State proposition, if there is to be a pulping industry, it should also be a State proposition or, if private enterprise is interested in pulping at present and if that is sufficient and if that enterprise gives the State a fair deal, I would give way to that.  But I think the State should own a processing plant of its own so that it could complete with private enterprise, and if private enterprise is not able to compete with the State in purchasing thinnings, let private enterprise go. Our forests should not be there to be looted by any group.</P>
    <P>I was on the Continent and several Deputies, some of whom are at present in the House, were with me when I went to Finland where forestry is a main crop activity.  From inquiries I made there, I found that forestry is one of the things the children are trained in.  The children's parents teach them about it; the children know about it; it is part of their lessons in school and afterwards when they go to the equivalent of our secondary school and vocational schools, even if they are to go into other businesses or industries and even if they are going into engineering, they are still taught the rudiments of forestry.  That policy could be, and should be, applied in our forestry areas so as to make the people forestry conscious.  It is easy for countries such as Finland to have great forests when even small children can tell the difference between the various plants, the best time of year to plant, and can transplant them.  They know the various things that must be done for the preservation of forests, thinning, watching and trimming branches and so on.  I would recommend that policy to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Minister is ambitious to make a success of his Department and I wish him every good luck.  I know he will work very hard, but I suggest he will not succeed unless the method used by his Department in acquiring land is changed and a quicker method adopted.  These are the main points I want to make but the final one is the most important. There should be no delay in acquiring land.</P>
    <Col N="833" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on the progress made and the plans he has prepared for forestry, but the greatest single item on which I congratulate him is doubling of the grant for private planting.</P>
      <P>In many fields of activity, there is a new feeling of co-operation in the country, a new feeling of self-reliance, and we are getting away, thank God, even to a small extent, from the idea which seemed to be rooted in the minds of the people that everyone should look to the Government for everything.  For that reason I am glad to note that extra incentives will be given to those who can do so to plant trees of their own.  Private planting can become a very important feature of our forestry programme but the increase to £20 in the grant is not everything in a country where people are not forestry-minded.  Many other things must be made available also.  Private individuals do not plant trees on parts of their farms which are not suitable for anything else because they do not know what varieties to plant.  They do not know the proper time of the year to plant them; they do not know how to plant, and they are not clear on the proper steps to take in the maintenance of small plantations.</P>
      <P>There are very few areas at present without forestry centres and I would advise the Minister to make available the technical advice of the officials in these centres to individual farmers and to groups who may&mdash;and, I am sure, will&mdash;undertake to do private planting under the impetus of the increased grant.  Private planting will save the State much money.  It will create a new activity for farmers and it will add to the pool of forests.  Much land will be planted which the Minister's Department could never hope to get; it would not be worth while for the officials of his Department to go after the small lots which I imagine will be planted by private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see forestry officials in various areas co-operating with the local people and making available to them, by way of pamphlets, information dealing with the various types of trees which should be planted in <Col N="834" /> different types of land.  I should like that information to be made available to national schools, and committees of agriculture in the different counties should be asked to give their advice and the benefit of their knowledge to private individuals.  I think the effort which the Minister is now encouraging will become an important new feature of forestry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch mentioned Finland.  I think that in Finland most of the forests are privately owned.  They are owned by the individual farmers and I think this is a welcome feature&mdash;this expansion of private effort which I think will follow on the increase in the grant and on the advice which I anticipate will be forthcoming from the Minister's Department and from the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>There are several farmers who would like to plant fairly large areas of their lands and, in that connection, I should like to know what the position is with regard to insurance.  One of the dangers which a private individual can foresee is that, through accident or carelessness, his small plantation may be wiped out by fire.  I wonder if there is any way of having an insurance scheme or of having talks with the insurance companies in order to provide for this item which may be one that would considerably hinder private planting.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies mentioned the delay in the acquisition of land.  There has, and may still be, delays, but the officials of the Department do their best to get over, as quickly as possible, the items which cause delay.  I have had experience of the delay in the acquisition of a large amount of land, but, when I went into the whole picture, I was firmly convinced the Department was perfectly right in all the precautions they took.  One of the things which held up the purchase of the lands for a long time was the fact that, although they were vested and registered in the owner, it was discovered that the Earl of Shaftesbury, when he sold the lands, held on to the right of planting on them.  The Forestry Division would look very foolish if they acquired the lands, planted them and <Col N="835" /> then discovered that somebody else held the rights of all the trees on that land.  While I should not like to see them too pernickety where acquisition is concerned, it is only right that they should take suitable steps to ensure that the land they acquire is properly held by them.</P>
    <P>Another important future development of forestry is the industries which must be set up, if we are to use the products of our present scale of planting. Again, I do not at all agree with Deputy Lynch, who started off by saying that he was in favour of private enterprise, but that in the case of the various industries based on the thinnings of forests and the forests themselves, they should be left to Government development.  I do not agree with that at all.  Take the trees themselves, which will be available for building and all the other things for which timber is required.  The Department could not possibly deal with the utilisation of the timber or set up a State body to deal with it, nor could they set up a State body to deal with the utilisation of the thinnings.  This is a matter which should be left to private enterprise because it is a highly technical job and one which will require the energy which private enterprise can put into it.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister, when planning his forestry programme, to consider the situation in the western counties.  They should receive special consideration because of various factors.  First of all, the land is more freely available in these areas and, secondly, there is, outside of agriculture, nothing else which can provide. the continuous employment which is very much needed in the western counties. Furthermore, a properly planned scheme of plantations which would form as continuous a belt as it is possible to have along the western coast would have a very beneficial effect on our climate.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned a book by John Mackay&mdash;<i>The Rape of Ireland.</i>  I read that book last year and it is one which the Minister should endeavour to make available in all the public libraries.  It is one of the most useful books I have <Col N="836" /> read in a long time and I have suggested that it should be made available in the Dáil Library.  I am not quite sure if that has been done, but it is a book I should like to see in the hands of our young boys, especially those in the technical schools.  It is probably a bit above national school boys, but it should certainly be in the libraries of all technical schools and secondary schools.  If it is out of print, that is unfortunate and, I suggest to the Minister that he should have it reprinted.</P>
    <P>It gives us a very good idea of what is possible in this country, what can be done and the advantage of doing it from various points of view.  One special feature of that book is the information contained as to the benefits to the soil which the planting of forests would give.  In various places throughout the country, the greatest evil the farmers have to suffer is the flooding of their lands.  In the book by John Mackey, it is pointed out and illustrated how a planned forestry programme can prevent flooding in areas where flooding exists at present.  On the whole, the Estimate is very encouraging and the Minister deserves to be congratulated on his efforts to encourage private planting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamMurphy" hpid="Mr. W. Murphy Mr. W. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Estimate at all, but, just as with the Board of Works Estimate, I say that County Clare has something to offer the Minister and should receive in return some of the money allocated in this Estimate.  In Clare, we have very many acres of land suitable for no other purpose but forestry, and it is for that reason I am speaking on this Estimate.  I should like the Minister to consider every offer of land that he gets from County Clare and I should like him to do his best to give us in Clare what I think we are reasonably entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made here of the pricing of land offered by people to the Forestry Department.  I know very well that the Forestry Department are not too liberal in their offers, but, nevertheless, they do make an offer, and I will say this much to the Minister's credit, that in recent dealings I had with him about one holdings of 70 acres, he did his best for me.  He was <Col N="837" /> reasonable with me and we eventually arrived at a price and that holding is now in the hands of the Forestry Department. The reason I stress that point is that there seems to be prevalent, at least in County Clare, the idea that there is no use in offering land to the Forestry Department, if the land is not adjoining an existing forest.  The land I have referred to is miles away from any existing forest and that, to my mind, is a good thing. As I have said, there is much land in Clare not suitable for any other purpose but forestry, and I can tell the Minister now that from now on he will receive many offers of land from Clare and I would ask him to treat those offers as well as he possibly can.  Of course, we cannot expect everything in County Clare.</P>
    <P>While much stress has been placed on the commercial value of forestry, I have another idea on the subject, and it is that the scenic beauty which forestry lends to the country means a lot to tourists who come to Ireland and travel through it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned only with Clare, but I should like to remind the Minister of one fact which I am sure is known to him already.  There is a new factory to be established in Scariff, a hardwood factory.  It is one of the very few which we have in Clare and at the moment I believe we have Germans down there. The site has been selected and the layout work is proceeding.  That factory will cost money and there is a certain amount of the raw material which will be necessary close to that factory. Nevertheless, if that factory is to last, something must be done to hold it there, and that is why I am trying to impress upon the Minister the desirability of planting as many trees as he possibly can so that they will help to keep at least one factory going in Clare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the success of the efforts of himself and his Department in trying to bring forestry to the stage to which everybody in this country desires it to be brought.  However, I am of opinion that the price the Forestry Department is prepared to give for land is antiquated and outdated. The price of all types of land <Col N="838" /> has increased in recent years and I believe that the Minister and his Department officials should think seriously about the possibility of giving a little more to the owners of lands.  If they did that, they would get the lands with better goodwill.  Knowing as we do that lands cannot be acquired compulsorily for afforestation, the present antiquated price ought to be forgotten.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should consider the possibility of introducing new legislation, with a view to giving him greater powers to acquire lands where the deeds of such lands are troublesome, or where possibly no deeds may exist.  Most of the lands to be acquired are in bog and mountain areas and we all know the tradition in such places with regard to deeds.  The result of that is that there is very considerable delay in acquiring lands and I believe new legislation would help in no small measure to remedy that problem.</P>
      <P>Like my friend, Deputy Murphy, we in Tipperary have vast areas of land available for forestry purposes, and I think there should be some sort of agreement between the Land Commission and the Forestry Department whereby persons residing on uneconomic holdings, which are suitable for forestry, purposes, will be transferred to more fertile land, leaving the poor land available for forestry.</P>
      <P>Many years ago, when it was hoped that the country could be planted in a year or two, I mentioned private planting.  I was shouted down and told that that was not afforestation, that it was not relevant to the Vote, and so on.  I am delighted that even at this late stage the Minister has agreed to give more help to private planting. There is not a farm in Ireland that does not lend itself to an acre or two of forest.  Having regard to the beneficial effect of forests, in our climatic conditions, it behoves every farmer to plant larger shelter belts on his holding. As Deputy Murphy remarked, apart from the commercial value of such shelter belts, they greatly enhance the scenery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was sorry to learn that, in some forestry centres in Tipperary, the Department had discharged some of the workers.  I am not prepared to stand over any man who does not give <Col N="839" /> an honest day's work, but I know that some of the men who have been discharged are good men.  I know some of them personally.  Men who have given eight or ten years in forestry work are of very little use for any other type of work and I would ask the Minister and the Department to consider immediately the reinstatement of these men. It is no economy for a State Department to discharge workers on the ground of redundancy.  It is a bad headline to other employers.  Every man in the forestry service should be kept in that employment.  I am not standing over anybody who is a slacker. If a man wants to slack when he is getting a good wage, I admire the forestry inspectors for sending him about his business and let him take the consequences.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage when more native timber should be used in building.  I am afraid that we are importing too much timber.  I know of Irish timber that was not chemically treated used in 1912 and 1913.  I examined some of it a week or two ago, and I find that even the timber that was used for sashes has given great wear and scarcely needs to be renewed after all these years of service. With modern chemical treatment, there is every reason to believe that Irish timber could be used for practically every type of work.  Perhaps we might need to import certain types of flooring, but we ought to concentrate on the use of native timber which would help the balance of payments in no small way.</P>
    <P>I have received complaints with regard to roads leading to forests that, where the Forestry Branch bring out timber, they do not leave the roads in as good a state as they should.  It is only natural that heavy loads of timber cause devastation to a road, but I maintain that the roads so damaged should be repaired, so that there will be no cause for complaint by farmers and others who reside on these roads and whose farms adjoin the roads that they are put to enormous inconvenience by the fact that the Forestry Branch leave the roads in a very bad state of repair.</P>
    <P>I have urged on many occasions that, <Col N="840" /> when planting takes place, a certain amount of ash be planted that would be suitable for hurleys.  Young people all over the country complain that they are unable to procure hurleys.  It would be disastrous if hurleys were not available. We can import hockey sticks and tennis racquets and the thousand and one things for foreign games.  We have to depend on native ash for hurleys.</P>
    <P>In every county, there are first-class horticultural instructors who are always very anxious to help farmers in the matter of shelter belts and so on.  Their services should be availed of more widely, especially in mountain areas.  They are only too anxious to help in any way they can.</P>
    <P>Private planting is being encouraged and I sincerely hope that the Minister will give farmers every help possible by providing suitable species of trees, and so on.  I have seen forests and sawmills in many countries from Finland to the Vosges mountains and I can congratulate our own people.  Our Forestry Branch is miles in front of their opposite numbers in the countries I have been in.  What I saw in some of these places made me feel very proud that our own forestry inspectors were head and shoulders, so to speak, over the people in many other countries in the matter of planting.</P>
    <P>I could scarcely finish without saying that much of the present-day success is due to the late Commandant General Moylan.  Nobody I have met had a greater love of forestry than the late Seán Moylan.  As time goes on, it is only right that every one of us, in his own way, should remind the people of the great work he did for forestry.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will continue the good work and remove all obstacles and barriers in the way of planting.  Planting should be encouraged at the source of rivers.  Afforestation could obviate much of the damage caused by the flooding of rivers. People should be induced to plant at the source of rivers and along the banks and in every possible suitable place.  A proper civic spirit should be developed that will give afforestation a great boost.  Afforestation helps to provide employment, helps to stop emigration, helps to prevent flooding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> Many forests are now reaching maturity and we should be able to use native timber to an appreciable extent. I cannot be convinced that native Irish timber is not as good as timber produced in any country in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to make a very lengthy contribution, but I should like to comment very briefly on the working of the Forestry Branch.  Since the establishment of the State, forestry in general has been neglected and has not been given the importance it deserves by any Government.  Not alone is afforestation an important national requirement but it is a means of providing employment, a means of beautifying the countryside and a means of utilising waste land.  Afforestation, and forestry schemes in general, should have engaged much more active attention on the part of past Governments than they did.</P>
      <P>It is very easy for us to criticise here, and elsewhere, and to appeal for the planting of tens of thousands of trees.  It is very easy for us to ask the Forestry Division to acquire huge tracts of land for that purpose.  As I said, on another occasion, there is nothing easier than planting trees with ink on paper and nothing easier than acquiring huge strips of land with ink on paper, but it is a most difficult job when one gets down seriously to tackling the problem.  A tree does not grow overnight nor is plantable land acquired overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Afforestation is a long-term policy and the planting, of trees cannot be undertaken in the space of a few months or, indeed, in the space of a few years.  Therefore, if we have criticisms to offer of the work of the Forestry Division, it must be borne in mind that that work cannot be done overnight.  So far, I think we have done very well.  The previous Government realised, and the present Government realises, the importance of afforestation from the point of view of providing employment and utilising waste land.  Unfortunately, work was to a certain extent impeded in the past because of the manner in which title had to be cleared before lands were <Col N="842" /> acquired.  In recent years, the law in that regard has been simplified and it is now easier to acquire land for afforestation purposes.</P>
    <P>One of the main hindrances to large-scale afforestation in the past has been the failure of successive Governments to allocate sufficient moneys for that purpose.  In the past, we have tinkered with afforestation to some extent, and that is something of which I could never approve.  If we are serious in our policy of afforestation, we must be prepared to tell the taxpayers that, if they want afforestation, they must pay for it.  There are statistics of the areas planted.  Are there any statistics of the total amount of land suitable for planting?  I believe that a huge scheme of afforestation could be undertaken is the Shannon Valley, where there are large tracts of mountain suitable for planting.  The chief difficulty seems to be that the funds available are so limited that the Forestry Division cannot acquire sufficient land.  The Government will have to face up to making adequate provision for a full afforestation programme.</P>
    <P>As afforestation is a long-term policy, Governments will have to be more liberal in their provision for afforestation purposes.  I think, too, that the Forestry Division is in need of reorganisation. Such a reorganisation would have the effect of achieving quicker results.  We have not done badly up to the present, considering the limited amount of money provided and the limited number of trained personnel.  We have not done badly, too, because of the co-operation received from the farming community as a whole.  Unfortunately, that co-operation has not always been as it should have been, and the fault did not lie with the landowner.</P>
    <P>I was interested in a case in my own constituency, I remember directing the attention of the Minister to a serious situation there.  A substantial farmer &mdash;a very decent man&mdash;who had never been inside a courthouse had a difference of opinion with the Forestry Division in connection with a right of way.  The Forestry Division held that the best means of entering their plantation was through this man's gate and along his avenue.  No farmer could be <Col N="843" /> faulted for defending his rights in his private avenue and his entrance gate. This farmer decided he would defend his rights.  Meanwhile, another piece of land was acquired from him by the Forestry Division and the main water supply for his live stock was wired off. That aggravated the position considerably. The officials of the Forestry Division made no effort to negotiate.</P>
    <P>There was an old tree cut down on this man's avenue and, in the interests of safety, he moved the tree a couple of yards.  The Forestry Division then said that the farmer was stealing the tree and they notified the police.  A summons was issued and this decent farmer was described in every newspaper in the Midlands as guilty of larceny.  He was convicted and fined in the District Court.  All that unpleasantness was provoked by some pig-headed, thick officers of the Forestry Division.  If there is a lack of co-operation on one side, a favourable conclusion will never be reached.</P>
    <P>This dispute is still continuing.  I have done everything I possibly could. I know that the value of this man's farm, as a result of all this unpleasantness, has been considerably reduced. I shall not say any more, but, whoever was responsible for bringing that decent man into court, having him convicted and branded as a crook, should be fired, and fired forthwith. Remember, Governments do not last for ever and, if I ever have any influence with any future Government, I shall have this case thoroughly investigated and find out who was responsible for instituting legal proceedings in the name of the Minister. If I have any influence, an injustice will be righted, if it takes 40 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed, but I asked the Minister to intervene in this case and he would not do so.  I wrote personally and even marked the correspondence to the Minister as confidential. I asked him to take action to see that there would be a measure of co-operation between the Forestry <Col N="844" /> Department and the farmer concerned, and the Minister refused to intervene. I feel the Minister was wrong entirely in not intervening in that case.  That farmer is highly respected in the district in which he lives, and the manner in which he has been treated reflects no credit on the activities of the Forestry Department.</P>
      <P>When you are dealing with country people you must think and act like country people.  You cannot bully them.  In the Forestry Department, even more so than in the Land Commission or any other Department, you have the city mentality.  They try to bully the countryman and to stuff down his neck reams and reams of law tied with red tape.  That will not work when you are trying to coax the farmer to give his land for forestry.  When you sit down with him to deal with the question of price, if you give him a fair crack of the whip you will find an entirely different man.  The officers of the Forestry Department have not been as levelheaded as they should have been in this respect.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be prepared to call his officials around the table and tell them how to treat the people.  If legal proceedings are to be instituted in the name of the Minister for Lands he should tell the officials that he wishes to be made aware of the facts. If any Deputy or Senator or member of the general public wishes to discuss the merits of a case the Minister should be prepared to discuss it before legal proceedings are instituted.  I have made my protest in this respect. I think the Forestry Department were wrong in this case.  I have advised my constituents on that matter and I was prepared even to go into court to express my opinion on it.  However, the wrong has been done now and it has left a bitterness and sourness that will take a long time to disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the general taking over of land for forestry, I join with the other Deputies who have expressed the opinion that arable land ought not to be taken over for afforestation purposes. However, to give credit where credit is due, I believe the Forestry Department have been very cautious and I do not think they will take <Col N="845" /> over land which can be used for purposes other than planting.</P>
    <P>I have been wondering whether the Minister for Lands is satisfied with the whole set up of forestry in relation to the bringing in of new ideas to his Department.  The fact that the entire control of forestry is exercised from Dublin is not good.  The Minister would be wise if, at some later stage, he would consider giving county committees of agriculture or sub-committees of county councils some means of assisting in afforestation by formulating schemes for submission to his Department in each county.  I do not know what the procedure is at the moment, but it would be a good idea if there was a forestry officer appointed as in the case of the Land Rehabilitation Scheme under the Department of Agriculture, so that county control could be exercised.  If we had county control in forestry we would have more work done and there would be a greater local interest.</P>
    <P>More people could be employed on forestry if there was greater co-operation between Bord na Móna and the Forestry Department.  At certain times of the year Bord na Móna have to let men go and the Forestry Department at the same time are inclined to take on men.  If there was greater co-operation between Bord na Móna and the Forestry Department it would solve unemployment problems in many areas.</P>
    <P>The publicity undertaken by the Minister for Lands with regard to forest fires is effective.  The advertisements published in the papers, in trains and buses and posted up outside forestry centres warning people of the dangers of forest fires and of the substantial loss involved were necessary. It has brought home to many of our people the need to be careful about lighting fires convenient to forests. Large sums of public money are lost as a result of these disastrous fires.</P>
    <P>The work of the Forestry Department can be criticised and will be criticised, I suppose, like that of every other Department.  It is easy to criticise but extremely difficult to offer criticism of a constructive character. The best we can say in this House is <Col N="846" /> that in the past ten years particularly, we have done work in regard to forestry of which we can be proud, work which has been undertaken with efficiency and which has yielded great benefits both from the point of view of providing employment and the acquisition of waste land for forestry purposes.</P>
    <P>I should be pleased to hear from the Minister what is his detailed policy for the future of forestry.  Has he in mind any new development projects?  Does he propose to have committees set up in various counties for the purpose of advising on the development of forestry and as to the best means of speedily acquiring land?  Forestry is of the greatest importance because of the role it can play in our economy-the provision of employment, the drainage of land, the utilisation of waste land and the beautifying of our countryside.  Naturally enough, the moneys that have been provided for this work in the past have been too limited.  If we are to go ahead with it as we would like to see it conducted, we should not be unprepared to spend money on forestry which, as we all know, will not yield a return in the immediate future but will yield a very substantial return in from 15 to 20 years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks of Deputies, almost without exception, have been very helpful and constructive.  I am glad there is such a measure of unanimity on forestry policy.  The first matter I want to deal with is what I would regard as the most important question raised in the debate, namely, the amount of afforestation being done in the congested districts.  I have every sympathy with the observations of Deputy Cunningham and Deputy Blowick, and other Deputies also, in regard to that matter.  We are continuing to place an emphasis on afforestation in congested districts.  We shall employ more people than last year.  We shall plant more land than last year and we hope to acquire more land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of last year, we increased the acquisition of land in the congested districts area.  If I say that, it will indicate in some measure, in any event, the desire I have, which is <Col N="847" /> shared by the officers of the Department, to continue emphasising afforestation in the West.</P>
    <P>As I said in the course of my opening speech on the Estimate, the experiments on peat forestry conducted both here and in Scotland are fairly promising.  We have to rely very largely on peat forestry in the West if we want more forestry there.  In the early stages, the amount of employment per acre tends to be less because there is less scrub to clean and there is even less cleaning to effect because the trees planted on mountain peat are practically never interfered with by grass or weeds and no cleaning is necessary.  In spite of that, we should concentrate our efforts on acquiring suitable land in the congested districts.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputies referred favourably to the decision to double the private forestry grant.  I am glad to tell Deputy Blowick that there is no question of the valuation of land being increased in consequence of forestry plantation.  According to the various Acts which have decided the elements of the valuation of land, trees are crops.  On account of that, there is no chance of rates being increased on planted land.  I can say with a fair measure of certainty that any Government that tried to increase the rates on planted land would have little hope of political success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is not an annual increment in the growing crop. Deputy Cunningham and Deputy Moloney expressed the hope that technical advice would be made available in connection with the private planting programme.  I can assure all Deputies that that will be part of the services that will be rendered in connection with the promotion campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies suggested <Col N="848" /> that the schools could co-operate in this matter.  We hope to co-ordinate the efforts already made by local authorities and by private forestry societies such as the &ldquo;Trees for Ireland&rdquo; movement. We hope to co-ordinate the general effort for private forestry in the best way possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wycherley thought private plantation should be carried out by young people.  If we could make quite sure that the young people could get the land, if we could encourage the parents to give them land for private forestry, naturally we would do so. That is a matter for private decision. It would be impossible for me at this stage to say whether, if the private forestry campaign succeeds, it will be undertaken largely by the present owners or by their sons: I imagine, on the whole, the former.  Nevertheless, we would naturally encourage the growing of trees by young people.</P>

      <P>I am trying, with considerable difficulty, to get information sufficiently substantial to enable me to say what I know a great many experts believe, namely, that if trees were planted in blocks on land fairly suitable for sheep-grazing the feeding <Col N="849" /> value of the land left unplanted might very easily equal the total area previously unplanted through the effect of the shelter.  If Deputies want to study this question, they will find that the information as to the extent to which trees can raise the temperature of sheep lands in winter months, increase the length of grazing time and improve the character of the grassland is not precise.  I am trying to get more information.  If I could do it, I could possibly prove that farmers who planted, say, one-quarter of their land with trees would eventually be provided with a greater amount of total grass because of the shelter afforded, particularly in areas which previously had been exposed.</P>

I can assure Deputies that that matter is very much understood.  We are most anxious not to do anything unfair in regard to workers who have been established a long time in forestry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon suggested there is nothing novel about the incentive bonus scheme which has been started and that it could, in fact, have been established by officers who deal with organisation and methods.  The scheme is far too complex to be initiated save by the very greatest experts in that regard.  Therefore, we had to invite a consultant to assist us.  He is training officers of the Department who will be able to carry out the work study involved in calculating the time required for the many different operations in forestry work in the different areas under varying conditions.</P>

      <P>The reply is in the negative. As I stated, in reply to a somewhat similar question on the 30th October last, the present rate of interest has been in force through periods of both cheap and dear money and I consider that, in the long term, it is to the advantage of the Post Office and Trustee Savings Bank depositor to enjoy a rate of interest which remains unaffected by market variations in interest rates.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
      <P>A new sub-section added as follows:</P>
      <P>(2) Where the repayment of money borrowed under this section by a committee of agriculture is to be spread over a term of years, the committee may borrow the money on the security of the contributions under Section 2 of this Act to the committee and may charge those contributions with payment of the principal money so borrowed and the interest thereon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present county councils are empowered by the Agriculture Act of 1931 to botrow on behalf of county committees of agriculture.  The Bill provides that county committees of agriculture will become bodies corporate, with powers to acquire or sell property and to borrow.  Long term borrowing especially could necessitate the offer of security and the present amendment will enable committees to offer their contributions from county councils as security for any long term borrowing they may need to undertake, and which is approved by the Minister for Agriculture. While I do not anticipate that the committees will need to avail themselves to any great extent of the power to borrow on a long term basis, <Col N="876" /> I feel it well to provide for such a contingency.  Other local bodies such as vocational education committees and county councils are similarly authorised.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think these amendments will cause any difiiculty to any member of the Dáil.  Deputies will remember that one of the provisions of the Bill had the effect of entitling a company which could not make itself qualified to carry on manufacturing operations in this country, under any of the provisions of Section 5 of the Bill, but nevertheless was manufacturing now, to continue to do in the future the same business as it is doihg now.  The Bill, however, as it left the Dáil limited that right to manufacturing operations carried on by that company within the month prior to the 1st Dlay of this year. It was argued in the Seanad that some companies in that position might be engaged in seasonal operations and that the period of a month was too short to cover it, and that the period should be increased to a year.  The effect is to ensure that companies may <Col N="877" /> carry on in the future any manufacturing operation which, they carried on in the year prior to May 1st, 1958.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3), lines 25 to 27 deleted and &ldquo;year with another, not more than 10 per cent. of the aggregate value of its total output is sold on the home market.&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>The second amendment has a different point.  It will be recalled that the Bill put outside the scope of the restrictions imposed by the Control of Manufactures Act, any company carrying on a business primarily for export and that condition was described as one in which sales on the home market were only incidental to the export sales and so regarded if taking one year with another the quantity sold on the home market did not exceed 10 per cent. of the company's total production of each commodity.  The removal of the word &ldquo;each&rdquo; in that respect is the purpose of the amendment.  The effect would be that the company is outside the terms of the Act altogether, if 90 per cent. of its total production is for export, even though the 90 per cent. may not be reached in respect of one of the commodities it is producing.  It is a further extension of the scope of the exemption which, I think, is desirable and necessary.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, the Bill does not contain any procedure <Col N="878" /> for enforcement by the Minister.  The position might arise under which the authority of a company to manufacture would be challenged.  The company can itself go to the courts under a section of this Bill and get its position established. If it is challenged, it is the courts will decide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Minister would, but probably the Minister would act only when some interest had been affected and representations had been made to that effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister knows he will not act in this matter at all.  It is one of the cod aspects of the whole Bill.  As I said when I saw it first, it is a lawyer's paradise.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect of the matter on which I should like to get some clarification, in case there has been a change in the assurances the Minister gave.  I understood it was the Minister's view on the Committee Stage that if a company sold 10 per cent. of its production on the home market, it would still be outside the scope of the Bill, but in ascertaining what that 10 per cent. was, it was 10 per cent. taking one year with another.  I think I put a question asking if a firm which sold 15 per cent. one year, 20 per cent. the next year, 5 per cent. the next year and 8 per cent. the next year and in that way, by a process of averages, so long as over some period it levelled out at 10 per cent. of its production, was still outside the scope of the Bill.  Is that still the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position. To be outside the scope of the Bill under that heading, it must be carrying on business primarily for export, and the purpose of the sub-section is merely to give some indication of what is meant by manufacturing primarily for export. The Bill as it left the Dáil required that that condition should be met in respect of each commodity which a firm produced.  With this amendment, it will be met if it is exporting to the extent of 90 per cent. of its total production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody cares whether they understand it or not.  That was the procedure under the Control of Manufacturers Act.  I take it that, under this, a firm producing and selling 50 per cent. of its production on the home market for five years and then cutting its production to 5 per cent. for the next five years, but having an average of 10 per cent. over ten years, is still outside the scope of the Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole purpose was to get away from these precise calculations. The Bill says that if 10 per cent.  of its total production, taking one year with another, is disposed of on the home market in a manner which can be described as incidental to its main purpose of export sales there is no question of its being within the scope of the Acts.</P>

As I said on an earlier stage, I think the publicity that he and his agents abroad seeking to get capital to come to this country could get by saying: &ldquo;Look, we have wiped out the old Control of Manufactures Act.  Anyone can come in here now and manufacture for any purpose&rdquo;&mdash;such publicity would be of inestimable value in the whole business of inducing foreign <Col N="881" /> capital to set up in this country.  At the same time, we could go to the existing industries that have secured certain guarantees in the past of permanent protection and say to them: &ldquo;We will give you on foot of these guarantees given by Deputy Lemass, Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Norton, all of whom spoke with authority as Minister for Industry and Commerce, on foot of their several guarantees, legislative protection of a different kind to keep you in existence; but, at the same time we are anxious to get a really good drive going and we want the publicity of being able to say to any candidate for admission that there are no restrictions, apart from the ordinary restrictions of a social kind which apply to every company operating in Ireland.&rdquo; With this amendment from the Seanad, I think you have almost got to the point in which you are doing that, but the trouble is you are getting none of the value of the publicity.</P>

Therefore, I take it that if a firm had an output, say, of £1,000,000 spread over ten commodities, that it could nevertheless sell £100,000 worth of a commodity already produced here by an Irish firm and could sell £100,000 worth of stuff against the Irish manufacturer, so long as the £100,000 worth sold on the home market was not in excess of 10 per cent. of its total output.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress, I was dealing with the incentive bonus scheme.  I want to reiterate that it is to the credit of the officers of the Department that this scheme has been undertaken and put into operation in a very short time.  It is by far <Col N="883" /> the biggest advance in work study of its kind that I know of or have heard of since the inception of the State.  I do not want to take, as Deputy Dillon suggested, any personal credit for it. It has been the work of the officers, in combination with an industrial consultant. The work has been splendidly done and it leads me to believe that it is possible for a Government Department to operate a productive service with the same efficiency as a State company or a private company.  I have every faith that we shall in the future continue operating efficiently, now that we have reorganised our working methods to include incentive bonuses in the payment of remuneration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon seemed to think that the increase given to forestry workers was something quite automatic under the general increases given in connection with civil servants.  In fact, forestry workers before were paid in relation to county council workers, so that there was a very definite change in the scheme of payment that did not relate to the previous practice in respect of forestry workers.  To establish a basic wage structure agreed to by the trade unions, shows a considerable advance; it means that from now on forestry workers will know where they are over very large areas and their wage is no longer tied to the wage of county council workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked a question by various Deputies about employment in the Forestry Department.  Perhaps I had better make that clear.  The average number employed in 1956-57 was 5,048; and the average number in 1957-58 was 4,835.  In the meantime, there had been a considerable swing of employment to contractors, both in relation to thinnings and to road construction, estimated to total about 350 men.  Therefore, the total employment in 1957-58 was as high as in the previous year.  I might add that, according as more thinnings come for attention, the comparisons of employment will be more difficult, because, as in the case of most other countries, the thinnings will be dealt with to a greater and greater extent every year by tenders for standing trees and will not be done directly by the Department.  Therefore, comparisons <Col N="884" /> in employment will be difficult to make, as they have been in the past two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong. I said the number was about the same. In connection with the coming year, we expect employment to be about the same in respect of direct employment by the Department and that there will be increased thinnings and a larger road construction programme, so there will be an increase of employment in forestry in general as between the Department and private contractors.  I thought I should make that clear, so that people would understand the general position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the next five years, no matter who the Minister in charge may be and no matter what scheme is used for payment of men, the employment picture will be slightly flattening out. Assuming that we continue to plant 25,000 acres a year, having reached that target next year, it is simply then a matter of the way the forests grow and the work to be undertaken on them.  In the five years after the next five years, there will be a sharper rise in employment; and five years beyond that, the employment will start rising even more rapidly.  That is simply a matter of the operations involved in forestry.  The forests have to grow before employment can be given on <Col N="885" /> various operations.  I hope that we will be able to secure more employment indirectly through the private forestry programme in order to supplement the total employment in the Department.</P>
    <P>There were several observations about the price of land.  I have investigated this matter and, so far as I can see, over a period of nearly two years back, the total acreage of parcels in respect of which negotiations broke down because of price, was less than 10 per cent.  of the total area on which price negotiations were initiated in the same period.  I do not believe that the price we pay has any great influence on the amount we can take.  A good deal of the land is of poor quality from the standpoint of sheep.  Taking the categories of land which we acquire, we make allowance as far as we can for the change in the value of money and in the value of land.  My own belief is that, if we were to go beyond the present maximum price we pay, we would be starting to invade on sheep ground; and I do not believe in doing that.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the delays in dealing with acquisitions.  We are acquiring more staff for that purpose, in order to reduce the bottleneck between the time the land is offered and the time the negotiations are completed. I should add that usually there are considerable delays between the time the price is agreed and the time the land is taken over, which are due to arranging matters of title.  Sometimes these are the responsibility not of the Department but to a very considerable extent of the seller's solicitor.</P>
    <P>One Deputy suggested we should encourage offers of land in isolated districts.  Quite obviously, the more forests grow in number the less there will be in isolated areas.  We certainly would like to encourage offers of lands in areas which might appear to be isolated from the nearest forest.  If it is impossible to take a particular parcel of land immediately, the chances are that other owners will have land close by and in that way we will be able to develop a satisfactory forestry centre.</P>
    <P>In any event, we are taking a more elastic attitude towards that now, <Col N="886" /> because of the necessity to acquire land more rapidly.  The rules and forms required for the regulations in the Forestry Act, 1956, for dealing with commonage have been drafted, but I understand some further consultation is necessary.  I also understand that the Incorporated Law Society must be consulted on a question of negotiation with the claimants to title in commonage and it is quite a complicated legal matter.  We are doing our best to settle it as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon and Deputy Blowick referred to the problem of developing a market for thinnings.  Deputy Blowick stated he had submitted proposals to the previous Government to set up a State board to enter into the market for woodpulp products.  When I became Minister, I found the whole question of the proper development of pulp market had been under consideration for quite some time, but no progress had been made, in the sense that no final decision had been taken as to whether to have a pulp factory or what action to take.  It is vitally important to the economic running of forestry in this country that we should have efficient industrial utilisation of forest products, including small-sized material.</P>
    <P>There are several firms already active in the pulp field, a good number of which are independent Irish firms. It was obvious that the first step necessary was to put the information available to the Government as to increasing availability of forest products over the next ten years or so before existing paper and pulp industries and ask those industries to produce a blueprint for a properly conducted development of industrial potential based on what they themselves were prepared to do.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has established a committee to go into that with the Industrial Development Authority.  The various firms that process woodpulp are on the committee and the committee is preparing a report which is not yet available, and until we have made a full study of the report, it would be premature for me to say more.</P>
    <P>I agree with all the Deputies who <Col N="887" /> say it is tremendously important that we should have as high a price as possible for our forest products and that we should not get ourselves into the position where we might be forced to accept an excessively low price through the operation of any group within the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a committee of private firms, meeting with I.D.A. They are people who are using our wood and many of whom wish to expand. It is in their interest that the expansion should be in the form which would be most conducive to the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister in charge of forestry should be represented on any such committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have given them information as to the pulp or the wood that will be coming available.  In fact, Deputy Dillon has slightly exaggerated the urgency of the problem because thinnings will only reach the 10,000,000 cubic feet figure per year some time in the early seventies, according to our most recent assessment, but, as I indicated already, we are going on with our assessment programme, the programme of trying to estimate the produce of our forests and that programme has only begun.  We should be able to make further announcements on that matter later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked that small forestry industries should be established in various places.  One of the difficulties is that unless the information <Col N="888" /> we already have is contradicted as a result of further examination, it would appear that most of the efficient pulp plants are large and the smaller ones in use are either branches of bigger ones or are concerns which in some extraordinary period of good fortune managed to amortise all their capital so that the location of such industries is a matter for consideration. In view of the fact that we shall have to export a great deal of pulp and paper products in competition with the entire world, except to the extent that we can get preferential treatment in Britain and from members of the British Commonwealth, we must make sure that whatever pulp factories we have are highly efficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Minister, but before he passes on from that subject, might I implore him to urge on the Government the desirability of the Forestry Division being represented at all stages of an inquiry being conducted by the I.D.A. into the user of forest products.  This is a matter wherein we may be most gravely prejudiced, once the I.D.A. presents a report.  At that stage, the Minister may criticise or protest, but the blueprint is there and the Minister's criticism of it can be represented as blocking, frustration or sabotage. If he is adequately represented at each inquiry right from the beginning, problems which should receive consideration from the point of view of the producer of the timber will be dealt with and protests can be made, but once the plan is placed on the Minister's desk, he is on the defensive and the vested interests are in possession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the general principle that no blueprint should be placed on the desk of the Minister for Lands of the day which, through the absence of his officials on the committee, is likely to force his hand.  I can assure the Deputy that will not be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Murphy made a complaint of victimisation against a worker in Dun-manway which I shall have examined again, but I should say in fairness to the officials of the Department in that <Col N="889" /> area, that the action taken in the first instance seems to have some justification. I shall have it examined again and I do not think there is any need to say more about it at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is satisfied, I shall say no more.  I could say more, but I do not think it would be helpful to the person involved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy raised the question of a particular estate where there appears to be excessive delay.  Other Deputies have mentioned delays that have taken place in acquisitions, and I take this case simply because it is one example of the difficulties of title.  The title position is extremely complicated and the administration of the estate at the moment actually rests with the High Court.  Deputies know that when you get into legal difficulties of that kind, it takes time to settle them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that case has now been three years in the High Court and it is about time the High Court determined the question at issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde referred to the Courtown estate, and I reply to him by saying that on 27th February, it was intended to offer parts of the estate which are arable or semi-arable for sale by public tender.  The total area involved was 77 acres and the Land Commission have informed the Forestry Division that they are not interested in the land.  It would be difficult for me to discuss a Land Commission question on a Forestry debate, because, as I have often indicated, I must leave these matters to the Land Commission.  They have the final decision about whether to acquire land, and I think, in this case, they were probably right in their decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke of fire precautions.  We shall consider putting up a poster adjacent to forests if it would be useful.  Under the Forestry Act, 1946, it is unlawful to burn vegetation <Col N="890" /> without giving due notice within one mile of plantations, whether those plantations are private or State-owned. I think many people in the country do not know that regulation and I hope that, in future, it will be obeyed as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles referred to shooting rights and said that they were not fairly allocated by the Department. Shooting rights are given out by means of tender in the usual way.  A booklet is published showing where shooting rights are available under the charge of the Land Commission.  However, in a number of cases the landowner, when selling the land, reserved the shooting rights to himself and in that instance there is nothing we can do about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern referred to the deficiency of ash for hurleys.  The amount of ash we are planting now will provide all the hurleys needed in the future.  We believe that the ash plantations will be sufficient to meet any demand in the future.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the book by John Mackay&mdash;<i>The Rape of Ireland</i>&mdash;and asked to have it republished. In my view there is a great deal of value in that book but there is also a colossal amount of exaggeration. So far as the late John Mackay was concerned, sheep did not exist as a matter of importance in the life of the country.  There was a good deal of exaggeration in regard to the total extent of forestry that could be planted here, particularly if we take into account the growth of the sheep population and the value of the sheep industry to the country.  Although it is true that sheep rearing does not provide much employment for people locally, the money got from the sale of sheep and sheep products must be spent somewhere and it is spent among the workers making the commodities which sheep owners require.  We have to consider the two aspects of giving employment.  We have to consider both sheep and afforestation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moloney suggested that we should give the officers of the Department more power to negotiate directly for land.  That is a very difficult question. Unless the price to be paid is checked by headquarters officials there could easily be charges of unfairness <Col N="891" /> and corruption and, therefore, this is a defence for the officials concerned. I should like to give more delegation of power but it would be very difficult under present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon raised the question of export licences being refused for wood suitable for veneer.  I understand that was done in the interests of a new factory which is to be set up for the making of veneer but I am quite sure that the interests of exporters and manufacturers can be reasonably reconciled in time when evidence becomes available as to what class of wood will be necessary for the veneer industry and what class can continue to be exported, when not used by this factory.</P>
    <P>I should like finally to say something to balance the arguments used by the Opposition with regard to forestry development. While making it quite clear that it is obvious that Deputy Blowick had great interest in forestry and did much to aid its expansion, I shall not accept the propaganda that forestry started only in this country largely due to the enthusiasm of Deputy Blowick. That is absolute nonsense.</P>
    <P>The revival of forestry commenced in this country with the advent of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1932.  It was then that planting started in earnest, that staff was trained and the knowledge acquired to establish more forestry.  It was the war, with the complete absence of rabbit wire, which was then needed as the rabbits had not been decimated by myxomatosis, and the diversion of the only trained men we had to deal with compulsory tillage, that slowed down the progress of afforestation almost to a stop.  The Government, in 1947, had every intention of resuming the programme as intensively as possible.  In saying that I do not wish to detract in any way from the great interest and enthusiasm which Deputy Blowick displayed in the matter of afforestation.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £129,220 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The net total amount required for Fisheries is £193,820 of which £64,600 has already been provided in the Vote on Account.  This represents an increase of £16,820 over the amount voted last year including £44,800 for which I introduced a Supplementary Estimate.  Increased expenditure directed towards the development of national resources such as fisheries is, of course, to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Greater activity in the Fisheries Division is reflected in increased provision for salaries (sub-head A), travelling (sub-head B) and telephones (sub-head D).  There is no change in the amount for incidental expenses (sub-head C).</P>
      <P>Before referring to the financial provision required for sea fisheries I should like to sketch the statistical background.  In 1957 the number of full-time fishermen was 1,613.  The total fleet of motor vessels solely engaged in fishing was 469; of these 133 were in the category of 25 tons gross and over. During the year ended 31st March, 1958, six boats of 50 feet in length and four of 56½ feet were issued to hire-purchasers by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and two of 56½ feet were allocated under the special Gaeltacht scheme. The preference of fishermen for the larger vessels is illustrated by the fact that only one new motor boat less than 45 feet in length has been issued on hire-purchase in the past four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Excluding salmon (to which I shall refer in connection with inland fisheries) the landings of wet sea fish totalled 532,000 cwt. in 1957, an increase of more than 150,000 cwt. or 41 per cent. over the previous year.  The most remarkable development was the <Col N="893" /> increased herring catches, particularly at Dunmore East, where landings doubled.  The overall increase in herring landings was almost 100,000 cwt. and there were also substantial increases in the intake of haddock, whiting, mackerel and sprats.</P>
    <P>The total value of wet fish landed went up from £787,000 in 1956 to £907,000 in 1957, an increase of 15 per cent.  The total value of shell-fish, however, showed only a slight increase from £234,000 to £240,000.</P>
    <P>The landings of shell-fish are to a large extent governed by demand on export markets and it is satisfactory to note that, in spite of French import restrictions, there were increases in the catch of some varieties.  Landings of oysters and Norway lobsters increased substantially.  I might mention here that Norway lobsters&mdash;or Dublin Bay prawns as they are commonly called&mdash;occur in considerable concentration off the south coast in depths varying from about 12 to 40 fathoms. Those taken in the deeper water are of good quality and should find a ready market.</P>
    <P>Exports of fresh fish increased in value by 144 per cent. from £91,000 in 1956 to £215,000 in 1957.  Herrings alone accounted for almost £100,000 of the increase.  The value of cured fish exports rose from £39,000 to £73,000. Exports of shell-fish went up in value from £312,000 to £330,000, or by 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>The prospects for the sea fishing industry are encouraging.  Not only is there considerable scope for expansion of the home market&mdash;our consumption of fish being one of the lowest in Europe&mdash;but a vast export market is available for the taking.  The British import £33,000,000 worth of fish in all its forms a year.  There is a world market for several varieties cured, canned or otherwise processed.  The demand for herring alone is far above our capacity to supply.  Our fresh fish is appreciated for its quality when properly graded, packed and iced.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with more general matters I shall comment on the sub-heads for sea fisheries.  There is little or no change in the relatively <Col N="894" /> small sums under sub-heads E (1) to E (4).</P>
    <P>Sub-head E (5) relates to the permanent commission established under the International Fisheries Convention, 1946, to which this country is a party.  The contribution towards the expenses of this organisation has been increased but, as this year's meeting of the commission will be held in Dublin in November next, our delegates will not incur travelling expenses.  The object of the organisation is the conservation of fisheries through the regulation of the meshes of fishing nets and the limitation of the size of the fish which may be retained.  Fishermen should realise that in the long run it is in their own interest to see that conservation measures are observed. There have, however, been complaints of breaches of the Orders in force in relation to undersized fish and net meshes.  I should like to take this opportunity of making it clear that these Orders must be enforced and that I will take a serious view of any breaches which come to my notice.</P>
    <P>An exploratory fishing vessel (sub-head E (6)) is being designed by a naval architect and it is hoped to make substantial progress with its construction in the present year.  A fundamental weakness of our industry is the lack of research.  This vessel is a good beginning. But we shall need more than one and we will also want a shore fishery station and laboratory.  We need in particular to study the movements of the herring and the plaice.  I attach great importance to the work&mdash; including the hydrographic survey&mdash; to be undertaken by the exploratory vessel.</P>
    <P>The details of the scheme for training fishermen as skippers were announced some time ago.  We are setting up what is hoped will become a permanent nautical school at Galway with the enthusiastic help of the Town of Galway Vocational Education Committee. We have also adapted two of the offshore fishing vessels, operated by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to accommodate four trainees on each.  We hope to be able to put about 16 trainees through the course each year. It is rather disappointing, however, <Col N="895" /> that, even though the course was widely advertised and generous terms of pay and away-from-home allowances offered, only 24 applicants attended for interview.  The first eight have been called for training.  It is hoped that trainees who complete the practical and theoretical courses will qualify for certificates of competency in accordance with the Merchant Shipping Acts and will form a nucleus of highly-skilled skippers.  Such men are urgently needed in the development of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of training I might mention here (although the financial provision is made under sub-head H) that an Icelandic master fisherman has recently arrived in this country and is engaged in demonstrating modern fishing methods and techniques. This should be of considerable benefit to our present fishermen.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G provides for the grant to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in aid of administration and development.  While this year's grant of £71,000 shows a reduction of some £9,000, it is some £20,000 higher than last year's original provision which was supplemented at my request.  The amount included for administration this year is £39,095 which shows an increase of £6,465 to cover normal salary increments, the salaries of some additional staff, the cost of improving the head office premises and miscellaneous items.  The grant contribution required towards development work, such as the provision of ice plants and fish handling premises, is £31,905.  Further sums will of course, be available as repayable advances to the board from the Central Fund.  The amount of these advances authorised for the current year is £186,000 including provision for boats and gear.</P>
    <P>An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is, under the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952, charged with the development of the sea-fishing industry.  The need for such a body arises from the fact that the industry is highly speculative, particularly on the catching side, and consequently does not readily attract private investment of capital.  The board's position has been in many ways unique.  It is not a co-operative organisation.  It does not control the production of one <Col N="896" /> specific item such as turf or sugar.  It competes with the wholesale trade.  A number of illusions exist about its activities which must be dispelled.  It does not subsidise or support fish prices.  It auctions fish and deducts the hire-purchase instalments from the proceeds.  Its low profits or losses on auctioning sales and processing are not due to an element of direct subsidy of fish prices.  Its marketing operations must be made economic.  As a State body, however, its liberties are closely circumscribed and any effort on its part at a competitive drive for sales is resented and, indeed, frustrated.</P>
    <P>I might at this point advert to the fact that the recently appointed members of the board are not representatives of ports but include specialists in fishing, the fish trade, and in packing, processing and advertising food products.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that an understanding has been reached between the board and the other auctioneers in regard to the handling of catches from hire-purchase boats.  The board have agreed in principle to allow hire-purchasers to market their catches through approved auctioneers who undertake to give to the board a full return of the amounts realised.  These arrangements are intended for a trial period of a year in the first instance and further details will be announced before they come into operation.</P>
    <P>I have received assurances from private interests that they will make fresh efforts to develop home and export trade when the question of marketing the catches of hire-purchase boats is settled.  I feel that this dispute has been preventing much needed capital investment in all branches of the industry.</P>
    <P>I would like An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to spend State aid in trying out new markets, co-operating in developing and financing new exports, getting new areas of fishing activity established and in experimenting with new techniques in fishing and processing. The subsidy received by the board for processing plants is also a desirable element of State aid.  The board should continue to auction fish and remain in a position to prevent <Col N="897" /> any rigging of the market against the fishermen.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the operation of boats issued on hire-purchase is not completely satisfactory.  In good weather conditions many boats are not fishing long enough to pay their hire-purchase charges although similar boats fishing in the same waters are able to discharge their obligations.  It is also a regrettable fact that some hire-purchasers do not give proper attention to their boats and the valuable machinery with which they are equipped.  The length of each individual voyage could be extended by many fishermen to their own profit. In this way our fish intake from the existing fleet could be substantially increased&mdash;possibly by some 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>This question of catching power is the key to the development of the fishing industry.  If existing markets are to be exploited additional boats of suitable size must be provided.  Boats of not more than 56½ feet in length do not normally remain at sea in relatively bad weather when there is acute scarcity of fish on the market and prices run far too high.  Much better results could be expected from boats of say, 72 feet in length.  We are the only maritime nation without middle water trawlers and this state of affairs cannot continue.  We must proceed to provide some larger boats which will successfully engage in fishing at greater distances from our coasts.  Careful planning and market research have necessarily taken some time to get moving, but rapid progress is being made now.</P>
    <P>The power of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to finance hire-purchase is not limited to the smaller boats.  Members of the fish trade might well consider-acquiring boats with the aid of the hire-purchase facilities and entering the catching side of the business on a larger scale.</P>
    <P>Boats, particularly of the larger classes, immediately pose the question of suitable harbour facilities&mdash;another fundamental desideratum in the development of the fishing industry.  It is safe to say that the majority of the piers and harbours which sprinkle the coastline were constructed for the convenience <Col N="898" /> of the local people in much the same way as bog roads.  None was ever developed as a fishery harbour.  It now seems essential to develop a few of them specifically as fishery harbours with the necessary berthage, slips and shore installations including cold stores, freezing equipment, production of ice, reduction plants, etc.  We have looked for guidance in this to F.A.O. and on their recommendation have employed a Swedish engineer of international repute to advise us on which harbours could best be developed in a large way as fishery harbours.  He is at present in this country working on the problem.  This does not mean that the other harbours should be abandoned; far from it.  They should be maintained in reasonably good condition to serve local interests and fishermen who will, it is hoped, continue to contribute to local and national fish supplies.  The Commissioners of Public Works are the State authority for harbour works and their engineering staff will have to be strengthened to cope with the expanded programme; they are taking the necessary steps to make engineers available to deal with this programme.</P>
    <P>The expenses of the harbours consultant, whom I have just mentioned, and the Icelandic master fisherman, to whom I referred earlier, are being met from sub-head H which provides for technical assistance.  Other projects under that sub-head include the engagement of an expert to review the present state of the sea-fishing industry with the object chiefly of developing it as an export industry, and visits abroad to study the possibilities of stimulating exports of fish.  It will, therefore, be appreciated that every effort is being made to keep abreast of developments elsewhere.  As indicated at sub-head I (9), part of the expenditure on technical assistance is to be recouped from the American Grant Counterpart Special Account.</P>
    <P>When fish is landed in quantity for export it must be processed by quick freezing, canning or curing.  This necessitates a number of handling stations around the coast.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have already provided such stations at Killybegs, Galway and Schull, as well as ice plants at other <Col N="899" /> points.  I am glad to say that private enterprise is displaying an increasing interest in fish processing.  In the last six months a number of quite large projects have emerged some of which I expect to come to fruition.  The construction of a commercial fish-meal factory at Killybegs is already well advanced.</P>
    <P>In the initial stages of the development of the sea-fishing industry it must be recognised that it will not always be practicable to achieve perfect timing in the provision of both catching power and processing outlets. Accordingly, the fact that there may at first be a shortage of supplies at a particular processing station should not give rise to pessimism about the future of the industry.  Taking the long view the outlook is quite hopeful if all interests concerned, from fishermen to exporters, seriously tackle the problems facing them.  They can, of course, at all times count on the fullest assistance from me and my Department. Grants from An Foras Tionscal and the Industrial Development Authority, which are available for fish processing projects, should help to overcome any extra costs of freight and marketing.</P>
    <P>I should point out that agriculture and fisheries are becoming linked in a new way through the steady growth in the quick-freezing trade.  Of 17 companies engaged in this new industry in Britain ten sell fish, meat and vegetables, and many produce pre-cooked dishes, turkey pie and the like.  I invite all private firms here with deep freeze capacity to consider this type of trade which will continue to grow.</P>
    <P>The number of lobster ponds and storage establishments has increased steadily and will result in greater exports. In addition to the fresh lobster market there is a demand for processed lobster and boiled deep frozen crab. At present crab is frequently thrown overboard.  I hope that complaints of badly graded, poorly packed periwinkles and mussels will soon cease as better grading is undertaken.</P>
    <P>Not half enough ice is used by fishermen: more ice must be used for the export and even the home trade.  An <Col N="900" /> Bord Iascaigh Mhara have installed ice plants at a number of fishing centres and are continuing this work. A new fishery officer is being appointed to advise fishermen on the handling, grading and presentation of their catches and to encourage wider use of ice.  Prejudices against ice by retailers must be overcome.</P>
    <P>In the case of the smaller fishing centres, I do not believe that the industry will survive here any more than in Scotland or in other places unless greater co-operative effort is made to market the fish&mdash;by the use of co-operatively owned transport if nothing else.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara does spend money on various marketing overhead expenses in assisting the smaller fishing centres.  But co-operative working is becoming more essential.  The lobster trade is a valuable aid in these areas.  Smaller boats suitable for lobster fishing are, of course, available from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara on hire-purchase or credit sale terms.</P>
    <P>Our present supplies of fish are irregular, the home demand is low and marketing inadequate.  Because of these factors the retail price is averaged at a higher figure than in Britain. I should say that fish costs a good deal to distribute.  Cod in the round paid for at 6d. per lb. in 1954 was retailed in Britain filleted at 1/10 per lb., the aggregate net profit at all levels being only 1d. per lb. after charging all costs and overhead expenses.  The extra price paid here is the result of insufficient supplies and an inadequate marketing organisation.  I congratulate the fish merchants who by their recent expansion of outlets are willing to take risks and particularly those who finance their own fishing vessels.</P>
    <P>Our greatest immediate need in the fishing industry is for increasing numbers of competent fishermen.  These men must like the sea for its own sake and have a taste for the adventurous living it provides.  Indeed the mental outlook of our people as to the sea needs to be changed.  This cannot be done overnight, but those in a position to reach the public ear should help to foster a love of the sea and publicise the challenge it offers to our people, <Col N="901" /> the possibility of wresting from it a decent livelihood, and the chance it affords our young men of an interesting, dangerous but independent career. Our public must be awakened to the fact that jobs and livelihoods in one of the most productive industries are in the offing.  We have not enough land to go round all who seek farms but we have sufficient coastline to accommodate many thousands.  Belgium with a strip of coast merely 45 miles long harbours one of the biggest fishing fleets.</P>
    <P>It would be a great pity if, through lack of interest on the part of our own people, we were forced to employ foreign fishermen to develop our fishing industry.  But I must make it clear beyond all doubt that the supply of skippers to fishermen trained to fish in middle waters is an absolute prerequisite to development.  For that reason I consider that if we cannot get Irish fishermen, we should employ others to begin with, now that we know markets are available.  This would not be depriving our own people of employment: on the contrary, every man actively engaged in fishing would help to create employment in processing and distribution ashore.  I have been told that in a developed fish industry up to 14 people are employed on shore for every one on a boat.  It may be necessary to invite landings from foreign trawlers to secure adequate supplies of some fishery products for the export trade.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that, at the recent conference in Geneva on the Law of the Sea, we favoured proposals for extension of exclusive fishery limits. Unfortunately, none of these proposals attracted the necessary measure of support to secure its adoption.  This situation has left us with a difficult task to pursue and it is too early to-make any pronouncement.  Our actions at the conference imply a belief in the need for a change from our present restricted position but more than that I cannot say at present.  It will be noted that other European States are taking time to review their position.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the vast export market available.  As an inducement to exporters a bulk transport scheme has <Col N="902" /> been arranged under which fish is being exported to the Billingsgate Market at reduced sea and rail freight rates.  This scheme has been in operation in the Dunmore East area since last December and its extension to other areas is being planned.  I might also mention that direct landings of fish into Britain from Irish-owned vessels will become more attractive from the 1st January, 1959, when the duty of 10 per cent. at present applicable will be removed. The steady increase in the intake of wet sea fish from 188,000 cwt. in 1951 to 532,000 cwt. in 1957 is encouraging but is still far too slow for development of large-scale exports.</P>
    <P>Progress in the development of the sea-fishing industry cannot easily be accelerated.  Postulating its confinement to our own fishermen, progress must await their training and the acquisition of greater skill combined with a changed mental outlook on their part.  Acceleration must be geared to the production of skippers and crews, to the output of vessels from our own boatyards, to the development of our harbours, and to the provision of processing factories.  In the early stages other measures to increase catching power may be necessary.  The marketing of fish is a complex business and the associated problems of training, catching power and processing require intensive study.  The whole position is being carefully examined as I have already indicated.</P>
    <P>On the Inland Fisheries side increases on various items as compared with 1957-58 total £9,283, while decreases total £7,135, leaving a net increase for this group of sub-heads of £2,148.  The first item showing a significant change is sub-head F 1 (4)&mdash; Grants to Boards of Conservators, which has been reduced from £13,000 to £6,000.  The latter sum will, I consider, be an adequate State contribution to conservators' incomes this year to supplement the yield of some £10,000 from the salmon export levy which is expected to accrue to the Salmon Conservancy Fund this year.  I may add that since this levy was re-introduced in June, 1957, a sum of £5,000 has been issued from the fund in aid of statutory revenues of boards of conservators for fishery protection purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> Deputies have had before them recently the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill. The Bill provides for certain changes in the mechanism whereby funds are made available to boards of conservators for purposes of conservation and development of salmon fisheries. I should like to give an assurance here and now that every penny of the moneys realised from the salmon export levy and from increased salmon fishing licence duties will be used for the preservation and improvement of the salmon fisheries and for no other purpose.</P>
    <P>When the rod licence fees revenue is credited to the Salmon Conservancy Fund in the next financial year, other things being equal, the revenue available for salmon development will be £80,000&mdash;an increase of £14,000 on the amount received in 1956-57.</P>
    <P>This is the minimum required to administer an industry employing 5,000 persons, exporting over £500,000 worth of salmon and catering for 16,000 anglers between game fishing and coarse fishing.  Officers of the Department are making a survey of all salmon rivers, particularly those where obstructions prevent salmon spawning, with a view to engineering works being carried out wherever these will be profitable.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance will in future assist, I hope and believe, first in providing such extra subventions as may be necessary by way of grants for improvement works or advances to the Salmon Conservancy Fund for the same purpose.  It may also be necessary to look to the Exchequer from time to time for grants required by boards of conservators owing to unforeseen circumstances.</P>
    <P>We will be introducing a Consolidation Bill in the Senate bringing all fisheries legislation within the compass of one statute and will later introduce an amendment Bill making desirable changes in our inland fisheries legislation.</P>
    <P>In the interval the officers of my Department are examining the administration of each board of conservators through friendly discussions with the <Col N="904" /> staffs and committees so that necessary reorganisation can be effected and in this the varying conditions and equally the many diverse views on protection methods can provide an exchange of knowledge from which all can benefit.</P>
    <P>I have noted with interest a recent move by the boards of conservators to set up a central standing committee to examine and advise on problems affecting fisheries generally.  I hope that the work of the committee will prove fruitful in securing the more effective conservation and improvement of our fisheries.</P>
    <P>At this stage may I repeat again&mdash; poaching can effectively prevent a growth in this industry, prevent greater employment so urgently needed in the country and may I point out that poaching is not an Irish sport, it is plain theft and no better and is universal?</P>
    <P>I have not recommended any mitigation of fishery penalties and I have conveyed in full the views of the boards of conservators on poaching offences to the Minister for Justice who I believe will exercise his functions with a due appreciation of the position.</P>
    <P>The only other significant change in this part of the Estimate is in the amount of the Grant-in-Aid to the Inland Fisheries Trust&mdash;sub-head F (6). This has been increased by £7,500 to £20,000 in 1958-59.  The House is well aware of the invaluable work the trust is doing in rehabilitating the brown trout fisheries of the country. Already the trust has achieved a remarkable degree of success in its efforts and the work done is assisting in no small way in bringing fishing tourists to the country.</P>
    <P>Brown trout stocks have increased very considerably in all waters in which the trust has been working.</P>
    <P>On Corrib during the past two years some 15-20 miles of extra spawning ground had to be provided to accommodate the greatly increased runs of spawning fish in the winter.  The spawning effort on the eastern side of the lake was the biggest in very many years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> Here are some mayfly catches made on Corrib:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1956&mdash;2 rods in 4½ days took 82 trout weighing 162 lb.</P>
    <P>1957&mdash;2 rods in 6 days took 84 trout weighing 113½ lb.</P>
    <P>On Lough Conn under Arctic conditions early this season:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Two anglers in 2½ days took 50 trout weighing about 57 lb.</P>
    <P>On Lough Arrow the rod catch in 1957 was about treble what it was before full-scale trust operations were commenced in 1954.  On Lough Sheelin wet fly fishing is now a common method of successful angling; previously the lake had the name of yielding fish only in the mayfly season.  Trout stocks have increased and pike stocks have decreased to such an extent that hundreds of trout were taken in draft nets which were recently being hauled for pike, while relatively few pike were captured.  Trout, so caught, were safely returned.  Big spawning runs now take place into the tributary streams.  When work started in Sheelin in 1951, these streams were almost empty of spawning fish.  One stream in which trout were never previously seen to spawn had its own complement last winter.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity of clearing up a misapprehension that seems to have been gaining ground of late&mdash;an idea that the ultimate objective of the Inland Fisheries Trust is nationalisation of the fisheries.  This is a most harmful idea and one that if left uncorrected might alienate the sympathies of many who are attracted to the trust by the sterling worth of its labours to date.  I must, therefore, emphasise that the trust has no compulsory powers of acquisition such as would be required for any effort at nationalisation, and that I do not propose to seek such powers either for myself as Minister or for the trust.</P>
    <P>Angling can play a very important part in the development of our tourist trade, and last year a five year plan for the development of all forms of angling was inaugurated under the joint auspices of An Bord Fáilte and the Inland Fisheries Trust.  In order to enable the trust to participate fully in <Col N="906" /> the plan, its articles of association were amended and expanded to cover all forms of angling.  It is pleasing to record that already the plan has helped to arouse a spirit of enthusiasm throughout the country and local development associations have sprung up in many areas.  Game fishing, coarse fishing and sea angling are all receiving attention and indeed it may be said that it is only now the potential of sea fishing as a tourist attraction is being realised.</P>
    <P>An interim report which I have received on the working of the five year plan shows that preliminary surveys of coarse fish waters have been made at 18 centres with a gratifying measure of local co-operation.  In consequence stocking with bream, rudd or tench has been carried out on 14 waters.  Fishing stands, jetties and the like, have been provided at some 60 sites on the Shannon and Erne systems.  In co-operation with Department of Education and with certain vocational education committees successful boat building courses for woodwork teachers in the service of the committees were conducted. Sixty-nine boats constructed during the course have been issued to angling associations catering for coarse fish anglers.  Next season scores of additional boats will be available as a result of boat building courses provided by the participating committees.  In general the demand for boats is very heavy and I understand that some of the longer established builders have substantial waiting lists of orders.</P>
    <P>Predator reduction work was carried out on ten waters, a number of fish passes was constructed and fry salvage operations carried out during the summer drought.</P>
    <P>Sea angling groups were established in six centres and preliminary work was done towards establishment of a further six similar groups.</P>
    <P>An information and publicity service was active and a number of visiting angling teams and fishing publicists were afforded facilities.</P>
    <P>The contribution by Bord Fáilte to inland fisheries and sea angling development in the current year will be <Col N="907" /> of the order of £39,000, an increase of approximately £12,000 compared with the previous year.</P>
    <P>Apart from the joint activities just mentioned, Bord Fáilte has engaged in promotion of angling chiefly by encouraging sea angling competitions and by arranging for visiting teams of sea anglers and coarse fishermen.</P>
    <P>The number of tourist anglers is quite evidently increasing steadily, and the board is gathering material for a central information service as to availability of accommodation in hotels, guest houses and private residences. Some of the returns which are required for a comprehensive survey have not yet come to hand, but reliable indications are that bookings for the current season have increased by 30 per cent. to 50 per cent. on last year in the coarse fishing areas.  Accommodation for game fish visitors is also much in demand and during the recent mayfly season, despite the fact that the hatch was rather scattered, the hotels in many places were booked almost to full capacity.</P>
    <P>Package tours for anglers would, I consider, play an important part in spreading visitors over as wide an area as possible.  Local development associations are in favour of this development and preliminary arrangements for it are being made by the board with the expectation that such tours will be available in 1959.</P>
    <P>This joint enterprise is one of the finest and most promising in the country.</P>
    <P>All over Ireland anglers' associations and other local groups are voluntarily taking part in a great panoply of varied development works.  The following are examples:&mdash; Assessing the fish potential, river flow, feeding potential and access to waters where the Inland Fisheries Trust hope to carry out a detailed survey, organising and scheduling accommodation for anglers, taking cookery courses, providing amusements, supplying boats, listing and standardising boat hireage charges, improving spawning beds and laying down fry and fingerlings.</P>
    <P>Of the greatest importance will be contacts, not only those made by Bord <Col N="908" /> Fáilte but also by the use of local brochures and advertising.  Equally important are personal connections arranged by anglers' associations with regional groups of anglers in Great Britain, which have already yielded results in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>This splendid work prompts me to appeal to all anglers' associations who could help, and who are not helping, to lend a hand particularly in advance of the Inland Fisheries Trust coming to their area.  This tourist angling development provides a lead to the whole country's economic development. Even if the taxpayer had money to spare to provide large subventions, the planning of tourist development without securing local co-operation, local investment and local expenditure would be fatal.</P>
    <P>Everything depends on whole communities led by the hoteliers, anglers and county councillors becoming expert in the craft of tourist development as are the Swiss, applying this knowledge so as to concentrate upon angling and their working with the Inland Fisheries Trust and Bord Fáilte.  The reward will not come all at once but over a period of years.</P>
    <P>May I take this opportunity of pleading for accuracy in providing information to visiting anglers and may I ask county councils to consider sympathetically the requests for access roads and for sewerage and water facilities in villages and towns where the second industry will be tourist angling?</P>
    <P>The establishment by the Inland Fisheries Trust of a fish farm at Roscrea has shown that fish farming can be successfully carried on here. The main object of the Roscrea farm is of course to provide material for the stocking of waters throughout the country.  I am glad to say that plans are already in hands for the establishment of a commercial fish farm by private enterprise.  Fish farming in one small continental country has an export value of £2,500,000 a year and I believe that it can be the basis of a highly successful export industry here.</P>
    <P>The general requisites for a commercial fish farm are suitable soil and <Col N="909" /> water conditions in a river bank site which can be readily excavated and is not subject to flooding.  For purposes of regular supply of food and also for provision of deep-freeze facilities reasonable proximity to a fish processing or meat processing factory is advisable.  Where such facilities are available an initial capital investment of, say, £13,000 to £15,000 might be expected to yield an output valued at, say, £20,000 a year gross against which must be charged the cost of food, freezing, labour and general maintenance.</P>
    <P>The provision of deep freeze facilities would of course add substantially to the initial outlay.  When site conditions permit the initial installation can usually be extended at reduced unit cost.  The extent of land required will, of course, vary with the topography of the area but taking the experience of the Roscrea Fish Farm as typical we may estimate that a planned capacity equivalent to £20,000 a year gross output would occupy three to four acres.</P>
    <P>A small fish farm unit consisting of, say, four ponds for operation as a side line to ordinary farming would call for an outlay of some £200 on excavation of ponds and providing equipment. The yield from a successful unit of such size might be valued at £800 a year gross on the home market.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that the foregoing figures are intended to give merely a rough indication of the possibilities. Each enterprise would naturally have to be costed in detail by reference to the conditions affecting it.  It is my intention to encourage the development of fish farming in every possible way.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, responsibility for the conservation and protection of the fisheries of the Foyle area has been entrusted to the Foyle Fisheries Commission, a body set up under the joint auspices of the Government here and in the Six Counties.  The commission also administers on behalf of the two Governments a very valuable commercial fishery and I am pleased to record that as a result of its operations <Col N="910" /> last year, a sum of £5,000 was paid over to each Government.</P>
    <P>The opening of the Salmon Research Trust Laboratory on the Burrishoole River at Treanlaur, County Mayo, is worthy of mention.  The laboratory is the first of its kind in this country set up for the purpose of investigating the life history and habits of this valuable fish.  In passing, I should pay a tribute to Arthur Guinness, Son and Co. Ltd., for their part in the setting up of this trust and for their generous financial contributions.</P>
    <P>In so far as time permits contact is maintained with the proceedings of international bodies which have a bearing on our inland fishery problems. Representatives from the Department, the Inland Fisheries Trust and the Salmon Research Trust attended a conference in London in November, 1957, organised by the Salmon and Trout Association on the subject of &ldquo;Water and its Abstraction in Relation to Fisheries&rdquo;&mdash;a subject of growing urgency in relation to our industrial development.  An engineer of the Fisheries Division has been invited to contribute a paper on &ldquo;Dams as barriers or deterrents to the migration of fish&rdquo; at the General Assembly in Athens next September of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Bill also provides for the relaxation of certain restrictions imposed by the Fisheries Act of 1939 on eel fishing.  It is my intention to give every help to the development of eel fishing.  On the basis of the present export market available for eels, I am advised that double the current export value of £28,000 to £30,000 a year would be a reasonable initial target.  An officer of my Department has just completed a tour of eel fisheries in Germany where he studied improved methods of capture and the technique of eel farming.</P>
    <P>I must advert to the controversy which arose recently over the decision of the E.S.B. to develop the upper waters of the Shannon salmon fishery consequent upon the construction of the fish pass at Ardnacrusha.  The following are clearly the main conditions <Col N="911" /> affecting this tremendous body of waters, one-fifth of the Irish river and lake system.  There are several types of anglers, game fish anglers, bream, rudd and tench anglers, anglers specialising in large pike and incidentally in other coarse fish, carp anglers and numbers who enjoy mixed fishing.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the total tourist potential, it is possible to develop the Shannon as a salmon fishery and at the same time provide ample opportunities for all types of fishing particularly since only two of six common coarse fish species are predators.  In conjunction with Bord Fáilte, the Inland Fisheries Trust and the E.S.B., I am working towards a means whereby all the interests may prosper and in this endeavour every opportunity for joint consultation will be taken.  A decision on this problem will be soon forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Steps are also being taken to enable fishery rehabilitation post arterial drainage to take place more rapidly. In this field voluntary work by angling associations will be essential.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope to arrange for closer co-ordination between my Department and State and semi-State bodies in relation to the preservation and development of inland fisheries where conflict of interest arises through drainage or other engineering operations.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>I have listened attentively to the statement made by the Minister in introducing this Estimate.  It reminds me of a returned Yank who came to the Midlands full of knowledge.  He frequently uttered a word of advice to his nephew particularly when he would be writing a letter.  He would take the letter and, examining it closely, would say to his nephew: &ldquo;You have not got the technique.  You must put more sauce on the letter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Minister for Lands on the Fisheries Estimate is a report with plenty of sauce on it, but this lengthy statement contains no <Col N="912" /> facts of which this House is not already aware.  We are aware of the activities of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara; we are aware of the activities of the Inland Fisheries Trust, of the activities of An Bord Fáilte; and we are fully alive to the content of every sentence the Minister uttered in the course of his speech.  He failed to give us any outline of what policy he had in mind for the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recollect that, this time last year, when introducing the Fisheries Estimate, he pointed out that he was new in office and had not had sufficient time to probe deeply into the running of the Department, but that he would do so.  He also said he had in mind a policy of development and that no time would be lost in putting it into operation.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree with me that, in so far as the fisherman on the coast of this country is concerned, the statement now made by the Minister does not hold out any brighter hope for an improvement in his standard of living.  As a matter of fact, it will generally be admitted that the standard of living of the ordinary fisherman, whether he be in Dunmore East, Killybegs, Galway or Clogher Head, is worse this year than it was last year simply because, during the year, the Minister made an attempt&mdash; successfully&mdash;to make matters more difficult for fishermen, particularly those engaged in salmon fishing.  In addition, overhead costs&mdash;the cost of oil, the cost of repair and maintenance of boats&mdash;have increased and there is no clear evidence of an increase in the income of fishermen.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister that consideration was to be given to the provision of safe anchorages.  There were to be harbour improvements.  We were also told there were to be greater facilities through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for the purchase of boats.  A number of depots were to be set up, in addition to those already set up, for the distribution of fish.</P>
    <P>With regard to general development through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara it must be admitted, that in respect of the next 12 months, there are no general <Col N="913" /> schemes of development in contemplation by the board.  The Minister says the prospects of the sea-fishing industry are encouraging.  In the same paragraph, even though the prospects are encouraging, he states that our consumption of fish is among the lowest in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not tell us what steps An Bord Iascaigh Mhara or anybody else are taking to encourage, by any means, the greater consumption of fish in this country.  First and foremost, if we are to ask our people to consume greater quantities of fish, we must guarantee them regular supplies and, to do so, we must have cold storage and a price to attract the housewife.</P>
    <P>There are many parts of the mid-lands&mdash;we need not go as far inland as the midlands because there are many such districts even on the coast&mdash; where it is impossible to procure fish. An Bord Iascaigh Mhara has been criticised severely because it engages in marketing operations.  I am glad the Minister makes it very clear that the board does not support fish prices. Many persons have a wrong idea about the operations of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>
    <P>Whilst certain interests in the fishing industry may criticise An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and may endeavour to bolster up a case to belittle the activities of the board, the Minister will find from his experience, as I found from mine, that, no matter what part of the shores of this country and no matter what fishing port he may go to, if he asks the fishermen if they are satisfied with the board or if they want the board, or if they would prefer it not to be in existence, they will tell him they want the board as it serves a very useful purpose for the fisherman. It protects the fisherman and guarantees him a market for his catches.  In addition, it guarantees him certain rights and liberties of which other interests in the fishing industry would endeavour to deprive him.</P>
    <P>I took the trouble to ascertain the views of the ordinary fisherman on An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I did not meet a fisherman who, when asked if he desired the complete elimination of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, did not reply <Col N="914" /> that the board gave him a certain amount of independence and protection against other interests in the fishing industry who were out to take advantage of fishermen.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also agree that, whilst the board is charged with the administration of fisheries development, no programme whatever was announced by him for development on general lines during the coming financial year.  The Minister did not go into any great detail with regard to the future policy on fishmeal.  He made a vague reference to the effect that the fishmeal plant at Killybegs is in course of construction.  He did not tell us whether or not they had in mind the setting-up of a further fishmeal factory. He did not tell us what became of the plans which An Bord Iascaigh Mhara had for the setting-up of a fishmeal factory prior to the arrival of the private interests who are establishing the fishmeal factory at Killybegs.</P>
    <P>I understood, when the fishmeal factory at Killybegs was being constructed by private enterprise, that the board had already intended to erect a fishmeal factory, one way or the other, and that the factory the board were considering erecting would be put up in another part of the country. I understood that the fact that people were interested in the setting-up of the Killybegs factory did not mean that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara were completely disregarding their responsibilities in regard to the erection of a suitable fishmeal factory elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the Minister's statement at Dunmore East where he addressed the fishermen and referred to the question of fishmeal, I was wondering what was the board's future policy and programme for setting up other fishmeal factories.  The Minister in his statement, dealt with the International Fisheries Convention of 1946, to which this country is a party, and with the object of that organisation, the regulations laid down regarding the size of the meshes of fish nets, and the limitations of the size of fish which can be landed.  It is extremely difficult to get fishermen to comply with that Order, but I feel it would be much <Col N="915" /> better to encourage them by instruction rather than to take drastic action in the form of legal proceedings against them.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister, even though he now says that he is taking the opportunity of making it clear that these Orders must be enforced, and that he will take a serious view of any breaches that come to his notice, that it might be much better to advise the fishermen that it is not in their interests to remove undersized fish for which they cannot get a market, which is absolutely useless and which is a great hindrance to the development of the fish.  That is why I hope that every effort will be made by the Department's officers to advise fishermen that it is in their own interests to comply with the regulations, rather than to take legal steps against them if they do not comply with the law.</P>
    <P>There was no reference at all in the Minister's statement to the boat-building programme of the board I understood from inquiries I made that there is a shortage of work in the board's boatyards at present.  If we have the volume of applicants which we had two or three years ago, I find it difficult to understand how there can be a shortage of work and a curtailment of employment in boat-building.  I was expecting that the Minister would have given us some idea of the likely output from the boatyards at Meevagh, Killybegs, Baltimore and Dingle.  As a matter of fact, I expected that some consideration would have been given to the extension of the boatyard at Dingle.  From the number of fishermen who are applying for boats, I expected that the activities in the boatyards would have been at their very peak at this time.  Unless the Minister, or the board, has decided to cut down on boat-building, it is hard to realise how it is that there is a shortage of employment in the yards at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us any idea as to what orders are at present with the boatyards? <Col N="916" /> With regard to ice-plants which were set up at Ballycotton and at Schull, I think the board have under consideration a long-term programme for the development of other coastal districts. I feel that the policy of the board must have entirely changed because there seems to be a complete lack of policy for the future, judging by the vagueness of the statement made to-day by the Minister.</P>
      <P>May I say that the question of the provision of boats is of the greatest importance to the fishermen?  If we have the proper type of fishermen provided with boats and if they are properly trained as good skippers, there is no doubt whatever that the supplies of fish required will become available.  The Minister's statement gives very little indication as to the number of applications for boats which are under consideration, nor does he give very much information as to the likelihood of further boats being issued to those who are anxious to get them.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Inland Fisheries' Trust, I entirely agree with the appeal the Minister has made for more co-operation with the trust.  The Inland Fisheries' Trust has carried out very important work.  The fish farm at Finure is an undertaking which reflects great credit on their activities, and we can safely say that those who are interested in angling, and who come from abroad, have something really worthwhile to see when they visit that fish farm at Finure.  Everybody connected with it deserves special praise for the successful manner in which it is being run.  I cannot understand why so many anglers fail to respond to the appeal which has been made, time and again, by the Minister, and indeed, by everybody who knows the value of the Inland Fisheries' Trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might make some inquiries as to the outcome of negotiations which are taking place between the Inland Fisheries' Trust, the officers of his Department and Bord na Móna regarding the poisoning of large numbers of fish in the Boyne, and in other rivers convenient to Bord na Móna works.  I have directed the attention of the Minister to a number of serious complaints that have come <Col N="917" /> from the owners of fisheries, and from angling clubs, about the poisoning of fisheries.  I expected that before now some statement would have been made by the Minister on the outcome of a conference between Bord na Móna and the Fisheries Branch on this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say anything further except that the Estimate contains nothing new for the development of our fisheries.  I want to conclude by asking one question.  Have the developments which Bórd Iascaigh Mhara had in mind been changed by the newly constituted board?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to stress the urgent necessity of having the harbour at Skerries extended as soon as possible. There are three or four more boats going into the harbour now in addition to the former fleet of nine or 10 boats.  I welcome the survey the Minister carried out there.  His visit to the harbour gave much encouragement to the fishermen of North County Dublin.  This harbour will also be used by fishermen from Balbriggan and Loughshinny.  I hope the Minister will see that this work is carried out.</P>
      <P>The harbour is in a very bad way. The fishermen are getting a good deal of trouble, and if something is not done in the very near future they will be at a very great loss.  When coal boats come into the harbour, the fishing boats have to go out and that is causing an immense amount of trouble.  I am aware that the harbour is under the control of the Dublin Port and Docks Board; but I want to repeat what I said before.  I should like to see the Minister dealing with fisheries having the harbours completely under his control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>We had always been led to believe in years gone by that the fishing industry was second to agriculture, but as the years went on we were told the tourist industry was second to agriculture.  However, in an island such as ours with fish teeming around our coasts, certainly it is an industry that should receive the highest consideration from the Government. Any Government must consider the matter from the point of view of the people engaged in the industry and must ensure that they have all the necessary equipment to carry on their work.  Fishing is a very dangerous and arduous occupation.  Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that our fisheries are properly protected within our territorial waters.</P>
      <P>Let us see how this Government and past Governments have dealt with these matters.  In recent years the fish that used to be within our territorial waters are, in many cases, no longer there.  I am sure we cannot blame the Government for that, although it is a good thing to have somebody to blame for anything that happens to the detriment of the fishermen, the farmers or anybody else.  The position is that since this State was established many of our fishermen have not had the proper boats and gear to fish along our coasts.  That responsibility must lie with the various parties which formed the Government since 1922 or 1923.  If this industry is to be revived and carried on with success, it is about time steps were taken to ensure that our fishermen will have the boats and gear they require.  We want the fishermen and their sons to remain at home to carry on their work.</P>
