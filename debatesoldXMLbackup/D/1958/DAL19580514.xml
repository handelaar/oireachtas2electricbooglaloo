      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £6,343,310 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The net Estimate for my Department for 1958-59 shows an increase of over £2,500,000 on the original net Estimate for 1957-58.  More than £1,000,000 of this is accounted for by the exhaustion of American Grant Counterpart on which we have previously been able to draw for financing the ground limestone subsidy and part of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme.  The remainder of the increase is due mainly to an increase in the provision for export subsidy on Grade A bacon, compared with the original provision for 1957-58; to the losses on disposal of surplus wheat of the 1957 crop; and to an increase in the cost of export subsidy on butter as compared with the original provision for 1957-58.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The past year has seen a further rise in agricultural production and exports. The total volume of gross agricultural output in 1957 is estimated to have been 3 per cent. to 4 per cent. higher than in 1956.  There was a record production of wheat and of feeding barley but the acreage under oats declined and, coupled with a low yield, made it necessary to import a small quantity this year.  The output of cattle in 1957 was the highest on record.  Pig production increased sharply.  The quantity of milk delivered to creameries was also the highest ever recorded.  With only a few exceptions, prices remained firm during the past year.  The provisional <Col N="157" /> index number of agricultural prices for 1957 was 100.2 as against 93.5 for 1956 and in each of the first three months of 1958 the index number was higher than in the corresponding month of 1957.</P>
    <P>Agricultural exports, including processed goods based mainly on agricultural products, were valued at about £90,000,000 in 1957&mdash;a figure which contributed to a very important extent in the welcome improvement in our balance of payments position in that year.  The value of our live cattle exports in 1957 was £46,000,000 and they accounted for 50 per cent. of our total agricultural exports and 35 per cent. of total exports of all products.  Bacon, butter and carcase beef exports also showed increases on 1956.  In the case of eggs there was a decline which was, of course, due to the serious slump in prices which has been a feature of the export market for the past few years.</P>
    <P>As far as the future is concerned, there is no denying that we have some serious problems in front of us which either did not exist a year ago or which did not exist in an acute form.</P>
    <P>We are, in the first place, confronted with an over supplied market in Britain for bacon, eggs, butter and other milk products.  This is due to a number of factors of which one is heavy production in Britain itself under the stimulus of high support prices, and another is increased exports of bacon and butter from continental and overseas countries to Britain.  Favourable seasons have, of course, been a big influence in raising milk production in most of these countries.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot lately about the dumping of butter.  Our position is that while milk production increased in 1957, exports of butter were appreciably below the pre-war level. Our exports in fact have had nothing to do with the catastrophic fall in butter prices in Britain which has been going on continuously since early 1956. Indeed, during the period from January, 1956 to February, 1957, when the market price for butter in Britain fell by about 140/- per cwt., we shipped no butter to Great Britain.  The real reasons for the slump in butter prices <Col N="158" /> were first of all, greatly increased exports to the British market by overseas countries; secondly, increased production in Britain itself and in some other countries which normally import fairly considerable quantities, such as Germany; and thirdly the rising trend in the consumption of margarine.</P>
    <P>We in this country are the second highest consumers of butter per head of population in the whole world and by far the highest in Europe, and we are the smallest consumers of margarine.  If some of the butter producing countries whose supply has contributed to the present slump in Britain consumed as much butter per head of population as we do, the problem would be greatly alleviated. We have no wish to sell butter below its economic price but because of the entirely uneconomic prices obtainable in the export market we have no option but to support the export price, as was done for many years before the last war.  Otherwise there would have been a serious crisis in the dairying industry and that in turn would have serious reactions on cattle production which is so important to our whole economy.</P>
    <P>Another product that encountered slump conditions in the export market was bacon, though there has recently been some recovery.  A major cause of this slump was the big increase compared with pre-war in the production of British bacon and also the increase in the larger exporting countries on the Continent.  Our exports of bacon to Britain in 1957 amounted to 300,000 cwts., or about 4½ per cent. of total British imports.</P>
    <P>The minimum price arrangement for bacon proved more costly than was originally expected.  The original provision made in the 1957-58 Estimates was £70,000 but actual Exchequer expenditure amounted to £787,000.  We were therefore faced with the unpleasant necessity of making some modification in the guaranteed price. The reduction, which comes into effect on 1st July, 1958, is actually a very small one&mdash;5/- per cwt. dead weight or a little over 2 per cent. of the present minimum prices.  I do not believe that this will have any serious effect on production and I notice that the January Live Stock Census showed an <Col N="159" /> increase in the number of breeding stock in the country compared with January, 1957.</P>
    <P>Our new pig progeny testing station has been operating in Cork for the past few months.  This is a very up-to-date building with the most modern equipment and in planning it a careful study was made of similar institutions in various European countries.  The results obtained at this station and at the second station which is now being planned should pave the way for a decided improvement in our breeding stock.  I might mention that Landrace pigs, which may now legally be imported, subject to certain conditions, will be tested at the station as well as Large Whites.  As the House knows, we also ran into a surplus problem in the case of wheat.  The loss on the disposal of surplus wheat of the 1957 crop will be about £1,250,000.  It therefore, became a matter of urgency to consider how to avoid surplus problems in the future while continuing to use the maximum amount of domestic wheat for milling.  Various methods, including the introduction of a contract system of growing, were considered and discussed with the interests concerned, and the Government finally agreed to try for this year a scheme already announced.  This involves the bearing by the wheat growers themselves of the loss sustained on any surplus of wheat of the 1958 crop over and above milling requirements.  The scheme is admittedly experimental and the indications at present are that it has not prevented some increase in the acreage sown in wheat this year.</P>
    <P>Turning now to cattle, the number of cattle under one year old in June, 1957, which can be regarded as a good index of future production, was 1,070,700, an increase of over 60,000 on the figure for 1956.  While the extraordinarily heavy shipments of cattle in 1957 have inevitably been followed by smaller exports in the opening months of this year (though not lower than in the same period of 1956) the healthy position as regards the numbers of young cattle should eventually result in another upward surge in exports.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one serious cloud <Col N="160" /> over the cattle industry and I need hardly say that it is the question of bovine tuberculosis.  Britain expects to be entirely clear of the disease by 1961 and the Six Counties will follow shortly afterwards.  No reactors or untested animals from this country can then be admitted to Britain.  I would, therefore, say that the eradication of bovine tuberculosis must be regarded as the outstanding task in agriculture in the years that lie ahead.  I am most anxious that we should at the earliest possible date be in a position to accredit the whole of the area west of the Shannon and I shall make every effort to achieve this in the shortest time possible.  To this end I have had useful discussions with the National Advisory Committee on Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication, committees of agriculture and other interests.</P>
    <P>The National Advisory Committee is a representative body whose advice will be helpful in working out a plan which will secure the accreditation of a considerable area of the country, I hope, well before the whole of Britain has become attested.  Once we have one accredited area established, there should not be the same difficulties in expanding the area to include other counties in which considerable progress is already being made.</P>
    <P>My Department and the British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are keeping in close touch about developments and I believe that if we make an energetic all out effort to accredit the western area in the very near future, our worries about the cattle trade from this source will be greatly reduced.  I am very hopeful about this western area as the overall incidence of tuberculosis in cattle in the West has now been reduced to not more than 5 per cent., while the incidence in store cattle in the area is probably now under 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>There are two other important matters which I should mention specially. First of all, the Act setting up An Foras Talúntais has been passed and the necessary agreement has been concluded with the United States authorities. The Council of An Foras Talúntais will be nominated in the near future and it will then be able to get <Col N="161" /> down to its very important task of coordinating, promoting and developing agricultural research.  The council will, as the House knows, consist of representatives of the universities and of the farming organisations together with a few nominated by the State.  I hope that this body will make a major contribution to the agricultural development of this country and I am sure the House will join me in wishing it every success.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer concerns the marketing of our agricultural produce which is now under investigation by a representative committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Greene, President of the National Farmers' Association.  I am informed that the committee, which held its first meeting last November, has been very busily engaged in carrying out a detailed survey of the marketing position and arrangements in respect of our main agricultural exports and I shall await the findings of the committee on this important and complicated subject with much interest. I will certainly welcome every practicable suggestion regarding the marketing of our agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with what seem to me to be the most important recent developments in agriculture and with the principal problems that face us in the future.  If there is any further information required which has not been covered either in my speech or in the notes on the activities of the Department of Agriculture which have been circulated to Deputies, I shall be glad to supply it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. I do so because I am wholly at a loss to understand the economic policy which begins by raising the cost of living by deliberate action of the Government to every citizen of the State by increasing the price of the loaf by 6d., a stone of flour by 3/6 and the lb. of butter by 7d., and which then proceeds, equitably and fairly enough, to hear the remonstrance of the various sections of the community and to make some provision for the industrial worker by sanctioning an increase of 10/- a week <Col N="162" /> in wages, by authorising the elimination of price control so that all manufacturers compensated themselves for that increased charge, by meeting the civil servants equitable and reasonable demand and providing extra pay for every civil servant, civic guard and member of the Army, and by acknowledging in respect of every section of the community that some adjusted remuneration was required to compensate for the increased cost of living and then approaching the agricultural community who, most Deputies know, consist, in the main, of small farmers, all of whom have to consume bread, butter and flour, and telling them that they must bear their share of everybody else's compensation.</P>
      <P>In the last analysis, it is the small farmer or the substantial farmer who has to provide the taxes to raise the prices for commodities sold in this country and out of which the increased pay provided for civil servants, industrial workers and everybody else has to come.  And then, to add to that, after the small farmer has helped to meet all these increases, he is not only to be told that his compensation will not be increased at all but that in respect of wheat, barley, pigs and milk he most have his income reduced by the positive action of the Government of the day and mainly by the positive action of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the Minister for Agriculture sitting in the Government and finding himself in the position that while every colleague he has in the Government makes the case and sees it prevail that that section of the community with whose interest he is primarily charged must be helped to meet the burden of the increased cost of living created by the general policy of the Government, he alone takes up the position that the agricultural community, which is producing 80 per cent. of our total exports, which is helping to bear every other man's burden, is not only to be denied what it is at present receiving but must accept cheerfully a reduction in these four fundamental commodities to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger I see in that is this.  In <Col N="163" /> the last analysis, every section of the community, whether they live in town, city or country, depend for their standard of living on the success or failure of the people who live and get their living on the land in exploiting the resources of that land to the optimum degree.  If the lesson is borne in upon the farmers of this country that, if they conform to the universal request to expand production on the land, their only reward is to be told that they now have the privilege of producing more for less reward, so certainly as we are in this House production from the land will go down. If it goes down, our agricultural exports surplus will decline, and if that exportable surplus of cattle, butter and bacon had not manifested itself during the year 1957, I would like to ask every Deputy to examine his conscience now and ask himself: where would the extra wages come from, where would the extra salaries come from, where would the extra social services come from and where would the essential imports come from which employ our industrial workers?</P>
    <P>It is not so very long since we had no butter exports and no bacon exports.  They amounted last year to £8,000,000.  They can vanish.  I do not mind confessing that I have an instinctive, and for me, uncontrollable indignation at the inequity and inherent injustice of segregating out the agricultural community and telling them in so many words that they were destined by God to be poor and that Dáil Éireann intends them to be poor; that while everybody else is to have his income adjusted to meet the increased cost of living, it is not necessary in their case.  To me, that sounds wrong, unjust and outrageous.  But leaving out of consideration all questions of justice and equity, I think it is just economic suicide.  People can talk and make propaganda about a thousand dreams of pie in the sky, but ultimately rational economists will have to come back to the fact that the natural resources upon which this nation depends are 12,000,000 acres of arable land and the people who live and get their living on that land.  If <Col N="164" /> those are not fully exploited, no other device will maintain the economic viability of this State.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister speak to-day of the present system of fixing the price of wheat.  The total wheat requirements of this country can be produced on 3 per cent. of our agricultural land, but it seems to me that the present system of fixing the price of wheat has abandoned the only feature of the price fixation system which was of any value.  If I understand the agricultural mentality&mdash;and I think I do&mdash; what they desired was certain knowledge of what their crop would be worth at harvest time before they sowed it.  Sometimes they were pleased with the price; sometimes they were displeased with the price, but they knew with certainty what it was.  Any man who felt it was not fair or adequate could turn his land to another crop or another purpose and any man who felt he could make a profit at the price offered could sow his land for wheat.  To-day nobody knows the price.</P>
    <P>As I understand the present system of price fixation, an estimate is to be made in July, and it is on that estimate of the surplus that the price of the whole wheat crop is to be based.  How anybody is to make an estimate in the month of July of what the outturn of the wheat crop is likely to be is a mystery to me.  But some genie in a bottle is to be invoked for that purpose and an arbitrary figure will then be fixed which will govern every barrel of wheat sold in the country.  That is a thoroughly bad and dishonest system.  I think it was adopted by the Minister to avoid the necessity of telling the farmers honestly the price the Government intended to pay for wheat of this harvest.  It has introduced a note of uncertainty into the situation, which is highly undesirable and which I hope will not be accepted as a precedent for price fixation in respect of other commodities.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to what the Minister had to say, but I also scanned with interest the White Paper that he was good enough to circulate.  I am <Col N="165" /> glad to observe that that is one of the revolutionary changes in procedure which I inaugurated, I think in 1949 and which various successors have determined to maintain.  I think it right to direct the attention of the House to the fact that the only reliable test of the success or failure of a policy is its results.  The Minister has given us figures in the White Paper for the results that have eventuated in 1957. I think the House will agree with me that the cattle, the sheep and the pigs herein referred to, and the crops gathered in this year, are all the fruit of a policy which was followed in the years that went before.</P>
    <P>If we are to judge the success or failure of that policy by results, I direct attention to page 1 of the Minister's White Paper, where the production of wheat from the 1957 harvest reached 502,100 tons&mdash;which is, as far as I am aware, a record for all time.  On page 2 of the Minister's White Paper, the production of barley from the 1957 harvest is estimated at 400,700 tons, which I believe is a record for all time.  The number of cattle exported to Great Britain, shown on page 6, is approximately 800,000 which I believe represents a record for all time.  The export of carcase beef amounts to 26,673 tons, which is 70 per cent. more than the previous year and, I think, must be very closely approximating to a record for all time. Certainly, taking the exports of cattle and carcase beef together for the year 1957, they represent a record for all time.</P>
    <P>Turning to page 7, I note with satisfaction that the export of bacon has realised about £4,000,000.  Turning to page 8, I direct the attention of the House to the fact that the muchdespised large Irish White Pig was being delivered to the factories in the year 1957, 67 per cent. Grade A, 21 per cent. Grade B, 9 per cent.  Grade C, and 3 per cent.  Grade X.  I think the figure of 67 per cent. for Grade A and 21 per cent. for Grade B closely approximates the best average performance of any other breed in Europe.</P>
    <P>On page 10, the Minister refers to the turkey trade and the export prices. I do not find much information here <Col N="166" /> as to the progress that has been made in distributing the new variety of turkey imported from the United States some years ago.  I direct the attention of the House to the fact that on page 12 the quantity of creamery butter produced in 1957 is 977,883 cwts. which, according to this paper, is the highest figure reached since records were first kept in 1937 and which I venture to inform the House is the highest figure ever recorded in the history of Ireland.  Unfortunately, the export of chocolate crumb tends to decline.  If we are to judge the success or failure of an agricultural policy, it is important to keep these figures in mind.  I hope the Minister will have as good a tale to tell when he has been in office&mdash;if he is in office&mdash;for another year.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the minimum price of bacon proving more costly than was expected and of having to find £787,000, from the Exchequer for export subsidy&mdash;which appears to have shocked him.  I think the Minister ought to tell the House, when concluding the debate, why he reduced the levy&mdash;I think it was his pradecessor, the late Senator Moylan, who did it&mdash;which was put on pigs before the present Government took office, to build up a fund to meet the very contingency that arose, of an uncovenated collapse of bacon prices in Great Britain.  The aim was to keep the levy on and to allow it to accumulate, so that if there were a fall, the price of pigs could be maintained throughout the period without discouraging the producers here.  The present Government was not in office three months until they reduced that levy, with the result that the fund which should have been there was materially depleted.  I regret the House is not informed in the Minister's statement of the fact that, if the Exchequer had to find £787,000, the industry found substantial sums itself, through the levy, to assist in the stabilisation of pig prices.</P>
    <P>I would further ask the Minister how he was betrayed into what I regard as one of the most disastrous decisions he has made so far in his administration.  At a time when publicity was being canvassed widely <Col N="167" /> about the catastrophic prices for bacon in Great Britain, the Minister for Agriculture in Ireland announced that he was going to reduce the price of grade A pigs by 5/- a cwt.  That announcement was made nearly six months ago.  The first consequence of that announcement was consternation and dismay amongst pig producers and the second development was the traditional one which we have always sought to avoid that is, that the bacon curers reduced the price of grade B pigs, not by 5/- a cwt., but by 50/- a cwt.  I received for grade B pigs 160/- per cwt.&mdash;and what was the consequence of that?  I was one of hundreds in that position.</P>
    <P>The result was that in-pig sows were being sold on the streets of Carrickmacross at £15 a piece.  Hundreds of in-pig sows were sent into the factories for slaughter and converted into sausages.  I remember saying here at the time that I most strongly advised these people not to sell&mdash;to keep any Pigs they had&mdash;and the situation would come all right in the end.  How any Minister for Agriculture could have allowed the bacon curers to get away with that, I do not know.  He is largely to blame himself for allowing himself to be bulldozed by the Minister for Finance into making an announcement six months ago that he was going to reduce the price of grade A pigs by 5/- per cwt.  Mark what will happen on 1st July next.  The fixed price will be 230/- and the grade A price will be 240/- to 245/- at the factories.  At the moment the bacon curers are paying 245/-.</P>
    <P>In the name of common sense, what induced the Minister to make the announcement he did make four or five months ago?  Remember, this regulation is not to come into operation until 1st July.  He had in his hand powers which I provided for him in the Pigs and Bacon Act which this House passed at my instance in 1956, powers that were subsequently used.  If the bacon factories would not maintain a steady supply of grade A bacon to the British market in order to foster and develop that market, the Minister for Agriculture had power under that Act to direct them.  In the period during <Col N="168" /> which I was in office, I never found it necessary to use those powers, because there was a voluntary arrangement under which the bacon factories were shipping 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. grade A bacon.  I think the Minister was perfectly right to direct that they should export such extra quality bacon as would compel them to pay a fair and economic price for grade B pigs.</P>
    <P>Now, in the meantime, the panic which the Minister's procedure has created in the pig industry may result in our having far fewer pigs for conversion into bacon next autumn than we ought to have.  That, in my opinion, will be a grave disaster for the agricultural community and for the balance of trade generally.  The Minister says he does not believe that this will have any serious effect on production and I notice that the January livestock census shows a big increase in the number of pigs as compared with January, 1957.  I think that is true.  I think the price stabilisation operated by me and the late Senator Moylan was gradually restoring confidence and people were getting back into pigs. There were more seas, but there has been a slaughter of sows from March right up to this day, and it is only now that people are beginning to get back into pigs.  I would like to ask the Minister, if he wants to check on that, will he inquire from the Pigs and Bacon Commission how many sows were supplied by them in the first half of this year as compared with last year and how many people were looking for sows this year as compared with previous years.</P>
    <P>I observe that the Minister has authorised the importation of the Landrace pig.  Now, I do not give a fiddle-de-dee whether they have Landrace pigs or any other class of pigs in this country, so long as they are the best pigs.  What puzzles me is that up to the day I left the Department of Agriculture, the unanimous advice of all the veterinary advisers I could get in Ireland, and outside Ireland, was that the Landrace pig had an inherent susceptibility to atrophic rhinitis and that, if those responsible for the control of animal diseases in Great Britain and <Col N="169" /> Northern Ireland had their way, they would never have let in the Landrace pig and, if they could get rid of it now, they would.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister is in the position that he finds it extremely difficult to maintain the exclusion of the Landrace Pig from here because of the existence of the Border.  I would like to hear from him now is be satisfied that those responsible for bringing in the Landrace pig here have not also brought into our pig industry a hazard that was not there in the past and which, if it develops, will finish for all time our access to the American and other markets for pedigree stock, a market which was beginning to develop as a result of our disease-free status.  One outbreak of atrophic rhinitis in this country and all that is gone.</P>
    <P>I know that there are certain irrespossible elements here which take a kind of delight in trying to infringe and break regulations made by the Department of Agriculture because they are the kind of cranky imbeciles who believe that the Department of Agriculture makes regulations just for the fun of making them, not realising that so far as the Department is concerned, the optimum desire is to let everybody do what he pleases; and their only reason in intervening in veterinary, or any other matters, involving regulation, is that they conceive it to be the inescapable duty of the Minister for the time being to do so.</P>
    <P>It means more work for the Minister and for everybody in the Department. The enforcement of disease regulations means endless annoyance for everybody in the Department, including the Minister.  Why any rational creature should imagine the Minister or his Department would make a regulation, if they did not conceive it to be absolutely inescapable is a mystery to me. I have yet to understand why everybody believes that the higher civil servants and the technical advisers to the Department want to make a new regulation just for the fun of making it, because, so far as the higher civil servants are concerned and so far as the Minister and his technical advisers <Col N="170" /> are concerned, the existence of that regulation is simply an additional headache for all and an involvement in most disagreeable work, involving the refusal of permission to people whom everybody in the Department would much sooner see quite free to do what they pleased, without having to seek permission from the Department or anybody else.</P>
    <P>We prohibited the import of the Landrace pig for no other reason than the unanimous advice tendered to me that they carried in them the hazard of atrophic rhinitis.  I wonder has that situation changed or does the advice which the Minister now receives differ from the advice that was tendered to me?  I do not believe it does, and the figures which the Minister incorporates in his White Paper, and to which I have referred, as to the improvement in the grading of the pigs delivered to the factories suggest to me that, with the continuation of progeny testing, the Large Irish White pig will give quite as good an account of itself as the Landrace, with the additional immense advantage that the Large Irish White has, up to date, in any case, shown itself to be not utterly immune but largely immune to atrophic rhinitis, and certainly, so far as the records were available to me, has never manifested atrophic rhinitis, except when direct contact with Landrace pigs could be established.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would be able to give us comparative figures for Denmark, Holland and elsewhere, but, taking the average of all factories in the country, I think it would be hard for any breed to beat the record of 67 per cent.  A and 21 per cent. B. When you realise that only two years ago, it was 54 per cent.  A and 29 per cent. B and that these figures have been improved to 67 per cent.  A and 21 per cent.  B, it seems to me to be peculiarly cracked to accept the hazard of atrophic rhinitis to bring in the Landrace pig whose performance I very much doubt will equal, much less exceed, that of our improving strain of Large White pigs.</P>
    <P>There are some matters I want to refer to which have not been dealt with in the Minister's opening statement, <Col N="171" /> which is, to say the least of it, succinct, though I am prepared to concede at once that the Minister's general statement is supported by the White Paper which he has circulated and which I very specially commend to Deputies' attention as being a mine of valuable information.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the first point I want to make.  I hear a lot of talk of people moaning and groaning and it has become a most noxious habit in this country to cry stinking fish about one's own country.  I do not know, why anybody is concerned to do it, but one variety of stinking fish that is habitually shrieked from the house-tops by certain elements is that there is no research of any value done in this country.  I venture to swear that the very warriors who are shrieking the loudest have never opened a volume of the annual report or of the journal of the Department of Agriculture.  They will find in the annual report a long list of the scientific papers issued by the scientific officers of the Department of Agriculture in the leading journals of the world and that is over and above all the research work that is being done in the Albert Agricultural College, which is the Agricultural Faculty of University College, Dublin, and whatever work is being done in University College, Cork.  In fact, all the time, very valuable research is being done and in more instances than one unique types of research are being done.</P>
    <P>I noted with satisfaction that the officials of the British Forestry Commission were glad to come over here and see the research in progress at the Peatland Research Station at Glenamoy.  What often fascinates me and what I have referred to before in this House is that the individuals about whom stinking fish is howled most loudly by our own people in international spheres are held in the highest esteem and those qualified to speak on these matters look with eagerness for the advice of the experts of whom we dispose in this country.  I often wonder how many of them continue to carry on because, if they did not receive the encouragement and admiration <Col N="172" /> of their colleagues from abroad, but measured themselves by the esteem in which they were held by their own fellow countrymen, many of them would throw in the sponge and quit.  I have heard it said in academic circles that it is time this country pulled up its socks, because, if our own are to be habitually denigrated in our own country, there are too many people in the world anxious to get them and to pay a great deal more than we pay them, and they may go.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, commend specially to Deputies, if they have not done it, a perusal of the annual report of the Department of Agriculture which, incidentally, is the only report of any Department of State which is up-to-date, and there they will find an abundance of material, both in detail and in bibliography, which, if they peruse it, will greatly edify them in regard to research.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another matter. One of the things I frequently hear commented on is the lack of agricultural credit in this country.  I wish we could arrive at common ground about that.  I was never short of money for agricultural credit when I was Minister for Agriculture and I do not believe that any successor of mine was left short of money to facilitate the provision of credit for agriculture.  I do not believe that there is anybody concerned with agriculture who is not prepared to get up and clamour that there are no facilities available for agricultural credit, but when you pin him down and ask: &ldquo;What exactly do you want?&rdquo;  I cannot find anybody who will tell me what he wants which is not at present available.  The only person, so far as I know, who cannot get agricultural credit in this country at the present time is the man who does not intend to pay and every community has its fair share of these gentlemen abroad.  Any man who means to pay what he borrows, I think, is able to get agricultural credit and, if there was any loophole that required to be stopped, I introduced in 1956 a new and additional scheme for agricultural credit.  Under that scheme, any small farmer, apart from the larger men, could get credit up to ten times his present valuation without <Col N="173" /> any security at all, except one guarantor, provided he paid his land annuity punctually in the last two gales.  I found to my dismay that that proviso knocked out about 85 per cent. of the applicants.</P>
    <P>I am going to make this suggestion to the Minister.  Quite frankly, I think I made a mistake in putting in that proviso.  I am a great believer in the truth.  <i>Magna est veritas et pracvalebit.</i> What is the history of that? The history of that is that I proposed at first that we should have an agricultural credit scheme for small farmers up to ten times the amount of their valuation, without any guarantor at all, and I said: &ldquo;If we are to have that scheme, we want some evidence that the fellow is reasonably honest, and if he has paid his land annuity punctually twice in the last two gales, I want to suggest that that is sufficient guarantee.&rdquo;  That view was accepted.</P>
    <P>I do not think I am guilty of any breach of confidence when I tell the House that I brought that scheme to the Agricultural Advisory Council, representative of all agricultural interests in the country, and it was they who threw their hands in the air and said: &ldquo;You could not do that.  You would have to get at least one guarantor.&rdquo; To my dismay, the system of guarantors was trust back on me.  The mistake I made was that, if I accepted the advice to take back one guarantor, I should have dropped the condition about the two gales, but the scheme ended up with the two provisos, the two gales of the land annuity punctually paid and the one guarantor.</P>
    <P>The result was and the strange thing was that the block which excluded nearly 80 per cent. of the applicants was that they had not paid the last two gales of their annuity punctually but had waited for the red letter.  I think I made a mistake in providing these two elements of security.  I put it to the Minister now that he ought to drop one of them in respect of the special scheme for credit for small farmers.</P>
    <P>There was another proviso, and this was a good proviso, which the Minister ought to retain and reinforce, that is, that any applicant for a loan under <Col N="174" /> this scheme had to undertaken that, in the use of the money, he would consult the parish agent or the county agricultural instructor.  This proviso was inserted so that you would not have farmers borrowing money and dissipating is recklessly, and while you did not put upon them the obligation to carry out the advice of the adviser &mdash;which I felt would be an excessive interference in a man's freedom to run his own farm&mdash;you did put upon him the obligation that if he did borrow money, he would consult either the parish agent or the agricultural adviser.  You would then proceed on the assumption that a man who was prepared to borrow £100, £200 or £300 and consult the agricultural adviser was approaching the matter in a sufficiently responsible frame of mind and, having got good advice, would carry out most of it, at any rate.</P>
    <P>If that defect is corrected in that last credit scheme, I wish somebody on any side of the House would stand up and tell me, not that agricultural credit is badly wanted, but in what form it can be provided that will make it possible for farmers to avail of it fruitfully.  We are all agreed that there is no use lending out money to a fellow who has not the slightest intention of repaying it, but such farmers constitute a very small percentage of the total number of our farmers. There is no use lending out money to a man who has heaps of idle capital lying on deposit in the bank, because the correct procedure for him is to draw his money out of the bank and invest it in his land.  However, if there is a body of farmers between these two, be it small or large, the time is past for people to stand up and simply say: &ldquo;There is not enough agricultural credit.&rdquo; I believe there is plenty of agricultural credit.  The time is past for saying to us: &ldquo;More credit must be provided.&rdquo;  The problem at present is to get those who could fruitfully use it to avail of it.</P>
    <P>The real key to this problem is to teach the farmers how to use credit. The nightmare that hangs over every Minister for Agriculture and every chairman of the Agricultural Credit Corporation is that in a time of booming prices for cattle, the farmer will <Col N="175" /> borrow £1,000 or £2,000 and buy 40 cattle, only to find that because he came by the money easily, he has paid £3 a head too much for them and that at the end of the season, instead of making the money wherewith to pay interest on the loan and something to amortise the principal, he has in fact lost £100 to £120, and the grass which ought to have yielded him a substantial income has been consumed.</P>
    <P>That is one of the great dangers of agricultural credit, but the solution to that is plain and simple, and it is this. There should be available to every farmer who wants to avail of them the services of a trained parish agent or agricultural adviser&mdash;call him what you will.  What the farmer who contemplates borrowing money wants is what every business man employs, an accountant, to give independent and objective advice, to examine the project and to consult with him as to whether it contains any prospect of profit or success.  The trouble in this country is that a great many farmers who could increase production and increase the income of their own families will not borrow money because they are afraid, and those who do borrow money borrow it improvidently and use it improvidently; whereas the first procedure of the man in business who contemplates the same operation will be to consult a firm of accountants with whom he habitually deals, not necessarily to be coerced by their opinion but to hear their opinion and to review the project he had in mind in the light of their detached view.</P>
    <P>That is what the Irish farmer particularly lacks and that is what the small farmer particularly requires.  So far as I know, there is no way to provide that for him, except through the medium of the parish agent.  The reason I say the parish agent is that farmers are naturally suspicious of advisers.  Until they can become familiar with some individual whom, out of their own experience, they have come to recognise as a good adviser and as a good man and with whom they have become familiar in their everyday dealings, they will not consult him.  Equally, it is true that if the <Col N="176" /> parish agent operating in their own area wins their confidence, such a man could be of inestimable value to farmers, large and small, and in no sphere more so than in that of using credit.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that we are now getting from the university the type of graduates which I was very largely responsible for generating because I wanted agricultural graduates for the parish plan.  Is there any Deputy with any knowledge of rural Ireland who will not agree with me that one of the things most urgently needed is technical advice in respect of credit, crops, husbandry and the utilisation of land?  Yet there are large areas in this country in which there is no technical advice available at all.  Up till recently, there were counties with two agricultural instructors in the whole county and the C.A.O.</P>
    <P>If we provided one agricultural parish agent for every three rural parishes, we would require 300 parish agents.  There is no reason why we should not do that to-morrow and if we did it to-morrow, every available unemployed agricultural graduate could be put to useful work, instead of being sent out to Rhodesia or the other ends of the earth where he has not the slightest difficulty in getting a job and where they are most anxious to get him.  I signed testimonials only last week for one agricultural graduate to go to Canada and for another to go to Rhodesia, and that at a time when I know there are hundreds of parishes the farmers of which cannot get the technical advice without which it is not possible to get the maximum return from the land.</P>
    <P>Surely it should be possible to put that situation right.  I was in the process of doing it when I left office and I am sorry to say that I was harried and blocked in the doing of that work by a number of unscrupulous vested interests.  I regret Deputy Moher is not here so that I could look at him when I am saying that.  The Fianna Fáil Party are in office now and they ought to put an end to that dishonest racket. They can appoint them now as I never had the power of appointing them.  The men are there.  They are leaving the country and they have no difficulty in <Col N="177" /> finding employment.  It is not for the purpose of employing them that I press this scheme.  It is because I am certain that until we have at least one agent for every three parishes, we will be hag-ridden by the inescapable problem of helping the farmers to use the resources that God made available, namely, the land, and that the Government makes available through the services of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Agriculture a question which I think he ought to answer.  Would anybody tell me what is the true story about the abolition of the double byre grant? I think what happened was that when the Minister was pressed by the Minister for Finance to abolish the double byre grant he took the decision to do so and it evoked a violent reaction from a number of his own supporters. I believe that he inadequately perused the file, that he believed that I had abolished the double byre grant, that Deputy Moran, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, was mooching around and in an unguarded moment the Minister for Agriculture said: &ldquo;James Dillon did that&rdquo; and the Minister for the Gaeltacht waltzed in here shouting off his mouth and said a lot more than he ought to have said.  The Minister for Agriculture made some effort to support his colleague and got himself out on a limb when I asked him to produce the document.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly I could not remember but I have so profound an admiration for the Department of Agriculture that I thought: &ldquo;If the Minister was sent in here to say that, I am perfectly satisfied nobody in the Department of Agriculture briefed him if it was not true.&rdquo; But it bewildered me that it could be true and that it had gone so completely out of my mind and I was reluctant to challenge him.  When I examined the record I felt that he had not been briefed and that it was his colleague who had been shouting his mouth off.</P>
    <P>The documents were produced and it emerged then that the fact was that the Minister's statement was based on a memorandum sent by me to the Minister for Finance in respect of a <Col N="178" /> very restricted area which, I think, consisted of Sligo, Roscommon, Mayo and a few other counties.  I recommended that, as it was very necessary to expedite the voluntary participation of farmers in this area, I should be authorised to give them a year's notice that if within the next 12 months they did not all voluntarily participate in the eradication scheme in that area they would not be eligible for the double byre grant after the end of that 12 months.  That is a very different proposition from abolishing the whole double byre grant for the whole antituberculosis scheme.</P>
    <P>The proposal for which I sought sanction was that I would be authorised to give notice that if everybody in a restricted area was not in voluntarily within the 12 months, as a special action against their laziness in joining the scheme they would be excluded from the double byre grant. That is a very different cup of tea from saying: &ldquo;As from to-morrow, the double byre grant is over.&rdquo;  I think it is a silly kind of defence for any Minister for Agriculture to come in here and say: &ldquo;Do not condemn me for doing something I did, because my predecessor decided to do it six months ago.&rdquo;  Even if the Minister for Agriculture is right in saying that I did intend to do it that does not absolve him, unless there are better grounds.</P>
    <P>In fact, I do not believe that the Minister was right.  The document he put on the table merely indicated that my recommendation was that in the restricted area if people did not join within 12 months they would be excluded from the double byre grant. Does the Minister adhere to his decision to abolish the double byre grant?  Consider the picture&mdash;less for pigs, less for wheat, less for barley, more for ground limestone and the double byre grant abolished.  How in the name of Providence can you go to the agricultural community and ask them, as the Minister has done in the last paragraph of his speech to-day, to make a very special effort to expedite the elimination of tuberculosis from their herds if you tell them in the same sentence that they must pay <Col N="179" /> the extra cost, that they must take less for pigs, less for wheat, less for barley, less for milk and pay more for lime and do without the double byre grant?</P>
    <P>Unless they are all angels&mdash;indeed, even archangels&mdash;it is hard to believe you will get the kind of co-operation you ought to get, and must get, if the best job is to be done.  I am hearing rather discomfiting rumours about the state of the sheep and wool trade.  I am told that the price of hoggets is very unsatisfactory, as compared with last year, and that the price of wool is likely to drop below 3/- a lb.  I wonder has the Minister anything to tell us about that?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the pig progeny testing station the opening of which recently took place.  I should like to place on record that the Minister had the courtesy to ask me to go to the opening but I am a strong believer that the Minister for the time being is the Minister for Agriculture and that if anything is to be opened he should do it unassisted and without the ghost of his predecessor.  Doubtless I opened some things in my time which were inaugurated by my predecessor. What I am interested in, and I am sure the Minister is too, is when will the first pig progeny test be available.  That is a matter of great importance, especially from the point of view of the average farmer, and it is one I think which the Minister should lose no time in answering in categorical form.  We are all prepared to take it on its face value, even if we do not fully understand it, that pig progeny testing is a good thing.  I should like to be able to answer a farmer who comes to me and asks me: &ldquo;When can I get a tested sow?&rdquo;  I should like to be able to say how and when the concrete benefit of the pig progeny testing procedure inaugurated by me at Ballyhaise, and carried on in Cork and to be carried on in the additional station now in contemplation, is going to filter down to the actual pig producer.</P>
    <P>The sooner we can formulate an answer to that question the sooner we will have made a good start and get <Col N="180" /> the whole-hearted support of the farming community, which I think is one essential development for progeny testing of all breeding pigs.  I hazard a guess that probably before the end of next year there should be some herds of pigs entitled to some certificate from this station which would indicate the superior strain available from that herd.  I should like the Minister to tell us in greater detail what the prospects are in so far as the individual farmer is concerned.</P>
    <P>I see that the members of the Council of the Agricultural Research Institute are to be announced shortly. I suppose the Minister had his own difficulties in choosing the elective bodies to represent agriculture but they are the queerest bodies I have ever seen together.  However, if they produce the right men, it does not very much matter how they are constituted, but what with pig breeders mixed up with bee producers, I could not help wondering if the Minister intended to go into Egyptian bees.  I suppose the Minister had his own difficulties and here again the best test of his exertions will be the results.  If we get the right people out of these bodies, that is what matters.  The sooner they do it and get under way, the sooner we shall be able to see the quality of the Minister's own nominees and the sooner we shall be able to see the value we may hope to get for this investment in agricultural research.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister noticed &mdash;I hope he did&mdash;that I have asked no parliamentary question about the German trade agreement in the past six or eight months.  I did not do so because I did not think it would help the Minister in his negotiations with the Germans, but I should like to ask him now what has become of the German trade agreement?  I always found negotiating with the Germans quite a difficult business and I had plenty of Job's comforters who would tell me that the proper treatment for the people of the German Reich was to take them by the throat and kick them in the stomach and turf them out of the country, if they would not sign on the dotted line.  To that, I replied: &ldquo;What if they do not sign and do not <Col N="181" /> give a damn?  Where will you go from there?  Do we not attach any importance to the West German market?&rdquo;  I used be reassured that: &ldquo;They will not go.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;That is as may be, but it is better to walk warily.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What has become of the German trade agreement?  I think the present situation is that we have no trade agreement.  If, having announced that we would not sign except on a certain basis we discovered they would not accept, what is the net result?  Is there one fewer German Volkswagen, one fewer German toy or one fewer German steel product that the Germans want to send here coming here?  Not that I know.  But the Germans are no more co-operative with us in our meat trade than ever.  If the negotiations have broken down, I think the House should be told.</P>
    <P>I want to say quite clearly that I have nothing but the warmest regard of the German people and the Republic of West Germany; they are a reasonable people.  I say quite deliberately that if one does one's level best to deal equitably and fairly with the other party, and if they do not deal fairly and equitably with you, then you must see that, if they exclude our goods, we shall exclude theirs until there is something approximating to a fair balance of trade between the two countries.  But there is no rhyme or reason in one country exporting to us £3 to £5 worth of goods for every £1 worth we export to them and then telling us that, although we are only sending them one-fifth of what they are sending us, they do not expect us to discriminate at all regarding the type of merchandise they are sending here but that they feel perfectly free to discriminate against the quality of merchandise we send them.</P>
    <P>It may be that the special circumstances of the countries require consideration and agreement that in their special circumstances such restrictions must be operated and that in our special circumstances corresponding restrictions must operate.  Nobody ought to be able to get 100 per cent. of what he wants out of any negotiations. Good negotiations end by both parties getting somewhat less than <Col N="182" /> they hoped to get and unless it so ends then it is a bad ending and a bad agreement.  I would expect to get less from an Irish-German trade agreement than I would wish to get and I would expect the Germans to express some disappointment with what they had been able to secure, but I would hope that each side would feel that the other had gone as far as it was reasonable possible to meet the other's legitimate desires.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister whether the attitude adopted by him or by his predecessor has improved the prospects of German trade, or whether the absence of a German trade agreement is, in fact, operating almost entirely to the advantage of Germany and to the detriment of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is now almost 15 months since the Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture announced that he was appropriating £250,000 to finance foreign marketing research and so far this mountain has not produced even a mouse.  I hear from the Minister to-day that he is full of hope that something will happen very shortly.  I trust he is right, but I am very anxious to hear some news. I do not know if Deputies believe that there are some revolutionary discoveries to be made in the sphere of marketing, but if they do, they will be greatly disappointed.  Fundamentally, our problem is the sale of good produce at the best prices you can get. Good produce is what really matters.</P>
    <P>I have not the slightest doubt that marketing is very important, but the establishment of marketing machinery, once you have discovered what is desirable, is quite another cup of tea. Without any commission, I could say that if we could harness the marketing organisation of Nestles to our dried milk production we would double, treble, or even multiply by 100 our output of dried milk products and sell them cheerfully.  To get a marketing organisation, such as Nestles, operating for us is, of course, another matter.  I know that in respect of a variety of commodities, if we had at our disposal a world-wide marketing organisation such as operates for certain established firms, we would greatly benefit by availing of their services.  I <Col N="183" /> know what that marketing organisation is, but to create and finance it is another day's work.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, however, our marketing research organisation is assured of the best of my goodwill. Ultimately, what it will have to do is a job analogous to that which I had on hands when Bowaters interested themselves in the Athy wallboard factory and to what the Industrial Development Authority recently achieved in interesting American interests in the Waterford cardboard factory.  God be with the days when the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that if Fianna Fáil ever got into office again he would legislate to abolish the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister a specific question.  I went to Ballsbridge during the Spring Show.  I went into the Simmonscourt extension and there I beheld something which, if it be true and is confirmed, is, in my considered judgment, the most sensational development in the live-stock trade of this country in the last 20 years.  It was an exhibit of the results of a systemic cure for warble fly.  If these results are confirmed the Department has not been too optimistic but, if they erred on that side, more power to their elbows.  Knowing them as I do I would suggest they had very good reasons for suggesting that the cure works.  When I remember that I myself directed the veterinary research stations at Thorndale and Clonsilla to initiate experiments on an American drug, to which our attention had been directed about 18 months ago, I am not without hope that the two heifers I saw at Ballsbridge are the result of that investigation. Conceive what this means.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies are familiar with the damage done to the hides of cattle by warble fly.  Heretofore, if you tried to get the collaboration of the farmers in the elimination of the warble fly, you had to ask a farmer to dress his cattle for his neighbour's sake.  The warble fly had already done its work and burrowed through the hide of the cow on which you put the Derris dressing. <Col N="184" /> It was through the opening in the cow's hide, made by the warble fly, that you put the Derris dressing.  It meant that you dressed cattle which were already damaged and which already had warbles visible on them. I remember saying to the officers of the Department that if we could only find a systemic remedy that would destroy the warble fly in the course of its life cycle, from the time the egg is first laid in September to the following July when it comes out as a warble on a heifer's back, then we could go to the farmer and say: &ldquo;We are not asking you to abolish the warbles for your neighbour's benefit but for your own.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>According to the information available at the Department stand it appears there is now a drench which you can give to a beast in October and, even though her lymphatic system is infested with the warble grub they will never come out on her back, but will be destroyed inside the animal during the winter and early summer months. If that is dependable, and if it is available at anything like an economic price, I have no hesitation in saying it is one of the most dramatic developments that I remember during the last 20 years, and I register a mild rebuke to the Department of Agriculture that they did not make much more noise about it.  It was the most important part of their display at the show.</P>
    <P>When I am talking about that I would suggest to the Minister that he ought to consider asking the officers of the Department who are in attendance at Ballsbridge to wear some kind of identification label, such as the officers of the R.D.S. themselves wear.  The number of times I have gone up to a respectable strong farmer at a stand and asked him the meaning of this and the meaning of that, and he has looked at me and sometimes replied civilly, and sometimes uncivilly, that it is not his business and that he is looking for information just as much as I am, is legion.  Except in so far as the officers of the Department are known to me, I find it extremely difficult to determine who is in charge of a stand, and who to question about the exhibits that are on show there.  A simple indentification <Col N="185" /> button would resolve that problem completely.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Agriculture what are his intentions about butter.  Are we facing a situation now when we are to have a progressive reduction in the price of creamery milk?  If we are, we ought to be told.  There is no assurance that we are not, and I want to direct the attention of the House to what other European countries are charging for butter.  Butter in this country is wholesaled at 438/6 per cwt.  The price in France is 604/- per cwt.  In Germany the price is 535/- per cwt.  The price in the United States is 479/- a cwt., the price in Canada is 578/- per cwt.  It price in Belgium is 584/- per cwt.  It is true that in the United Kingdom the price is 230/- a cwt. and that is the market where we have to sell our surplus.</P>
    <P>Some people ask us why do we not sell it in countries where the wholesale price is 535/-, 604/- or 584/- a cwt.  The answer, of course, is that they will not buy it.  Britain is the only free market for butter.  All other markets are severely restricted, as is our own.</P>
    <P>Remember, the whole trend of agricultural policy in this country for the last ten years has been to try to introduce into agriculture as high an element of security in regard to prices as it was possible to produce.  The result of that policy has been that in the year 1957 we exported more cattle than ever before in our history.  We produced more butter than ever before in our history.  We produced more barley and what than ever before in our history.  We probably had more sheep than we ever had before, and our pig population was rising.  That was the result of a steady policy of seeking to introduce the maximum degree of security into the price structure of the agricultural community, but at a very modest level.  It was by no manner of means a high level and to the certain knowledge of Deputies it has allowed to the farmers and their employees the lowest fixed wages provided under any national fixed wages agreement in Ireland.  It did, however, give them some element of security and even on that modest <Col N="186" /> level it resulted in the record of production to which the Minister has referred in his opening speech to-day.</P>
    <P>Think well where we are going.  If we are to abolish all that, I beg to direct the attention of Deputies to the fact that ten short years ago the total value of our total exports was £39,000,000 and to-day they are £131,000,000.  Though price has played a considerable part in that, the volume of our exports ten short years ago was one half of their volume to-day.</P>
    <P>Can you conceive what will happen if, as a result of the whittling away of the feeling of security enjoyed by farmers, we ever went back to a volume of exports approximating to the level that obtained ten years ago? Remember that, of this £131,000,000 of total exports this year, over £90,000,000 was agricultural produce.  I ask the Minister, before the debate ends and in the light of the motion I have put down, to tell us what are his intentions in respect of maintaining price stability in the agricultural industry. I think he is being pushed off by certain elements in the Cabinet.  I think they are mad&mdash;stark, staring mad.</P>
    <P>I have already said in this House that you have to have some regard to reality and that you cannot take up a perfectly rigid position from which you do not propose in any circumstances to depart.  When the creamery milk suppliers came to me howling about this fraudulent milk costings report&mdash; remember it was brought to birth by Fianna Fáil and was buried by Fianna Fáil; there never was a more noxious political abortion in this country&mdash;I remember saying to them, 18 months ago, that I believed the best they could hope for would be an increase in the domestic price of butter to correspond to ld. a gallon for milk and, thereafter, we would have to let the industry, fortified by that additional 1d., meet the cost of exports whereever they could best be placed.  That did not seem to please them at the time.  I am not so sure that they would not be pleased if they had the same offer now.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be right to demand from the Minister for Agriculture that he would accept for all time <Col N="187" /> a certain rigid price which in no circumstances should be departed from, but I do suggest that there ought to be a very energetic attempt to get back to some feeling of security in the agricultural industry.  In the light of the possibilities mentioned, it would be preferable if it were fortified by the kind of period guarantee which I was authorised to give the pig producers and which ensured that nobody could change the price of pigs without giving pig producers six months' notice and thus give them an ample opportunity of liquidating existing stocks without crushing losses.</P>
    <P>If we are to get a steady output from the land, we want confidence amongst the people who get their living from the land.  We want the certainty that those who are on the land will have the means to exploit it. That involves either their own savings or the availability of credit, where their own savings are not adequate. With the climate and the soil we have, all we need is knowledge and the means to apply it.  That involves fertilisers and ordinary skilled husbandry. The indispensable <i>sine qua non</i> of these things, especially of the small farmers of Ireland&mdash;I make no apology for saying that it is with those I am primarily concerned&mdash;is informed advice.</P>
    <P>I offer any Deputy, however prejudiced, the opportunity to make this test.  I offer it especially to Deputy Moher who did more than his share to wreck the parish plan.  Let him go out and visit any parish agent&mdash;any one of the 256 parish agents who are operating in this country&mdash;and let him judge the fruits of their work by the performance of the least effective amongst them.  I would be prepared to accept the verdict on the result of the least effective, and on that result, to argue that these results justify most amply my contention that the sooner we increase the number of parish agents to the optimum point of having a parish agent for practically every rural parish in Ireland, the sooner will we arrive at the point of full exploitation of the potential wealth of Ireland. Without it, no matter what schemes <Col N="188" /> we adumbrate, no matter what research we carry out and no matter what inquiries we continue, we will not succeed in bringing to the only people who can operate upon the land itself the knowledge and information they really require.</P>
    <P>Let no Deputy doubt that if that kind of help is made available, it will be availed of by 95 per cent. of the farmers, large and small.  It may take time and patience, but I have no doubt whatever that, in the long run, 95 per cent. of them will avail of it.  Approximately 5 per cent. never will.  They are the people who have semi-derelict farms; they are the people who are used as an argument for the claims that the Land Commission ought to go in and take the land over and distribute it.  The people who misuse the smallest fraction of the land are the standing guarantee for the security of tenure for all the others who would use it well if they had the means to do so and there is no means more effective than skilled advice.  They ought to be given that and, if they are given that, I believe everything else can be added thereto.</P>
    <P>If the farmers of Ireland do as much in the next ten years as they did in the past ten years, nobody in this country need cry stinking fish about Ireland.  If the farmers are given a chance, if they are given the facilities they should have and if Deputy Moher and those associated with him, lay and ecclesiastic, let the parish plan develop as it ought to develop, we could afford to put the Minister for Lands out to grass or send him around Europe in a cage as the stinking fish that does not smell because there is no man in this country who did more to denigrate the credit of this country before the world than the Minister for Lands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that he should be exhibited as the stinking fish that does not smell.  He is the person who proclaimed that there is no hope or prospect for this country unless he can convert us to adopt methods which are as foreign to our people as they <Col N="189" /> could be and which I hope they will continue to be.</P>
      <P>I want to recall to this House, before I sit down, two stories.  I get so sick listening to people telling me we should model our lives either on the farmers of New Zealand or on the farmers of Denmark.  Did any Deputy listen to the lecture given by the New Zealand Milk Production Officer at a meeting of the Grassland Association which was subsequently broadcast on Radio Éireann? He said that any good man, singlehanded, ought to be able to milk 50 cows.  What does that involve?  As I understand it, it involves working about 14 hours a day for 49 weeks of the year.  If you are very skilful and get all the cows to calve at the right time you have a reasonable hope of having about three weeks off about once a year.  I often ask myself if that man owns the cows or if the cows own him and the wife as well.  Maybe they like that kind of life.</P>
      <P>There may be people in the world who believe that that is a good life.  I do not.  If you are badly enough stuck for money that you are prepared to live that kind of life to get it for the purpose of having a spree once every year, I suppose New Zealand is a free country.  But remember that there are those of us who are entitled to believe that is the kind of freedom of which the Emperor Hadrian spoke when he said that, personally, he never believed the institution of slavery would ever be abolished in a civilised society but that, if it were, he could imagine people falling into a worse condition, namely, that of illusory freedom in which they accepted the condition that voluntary servitude was the noblest form of life. An involuntary slave at least has his prospect of revolt.  However, the man who has become the personal property of his cows is his own slave-master except in so far as he delegates that function to the cows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second story was the one I was told about Denmark.  A man went to visit a volks school.  He found there was a semester for boys and a semester for girls and then, I think, a semester for married men&mdash;I forget if there was one all the year round&mdash; with a fortnight's semester for married <Col N="190" /> women.  My informant made his visit to the volks school during the semester for married women.  A great many of the women of Denmark speak English. Amongst them was one housewife who conversed with my friend.  He asked her if she was enjoying her semester and she replied that she had never enjoyed anything so much in her life.  My friend was rather surprised to see how excited the lady was about spending a fortnight at school.  He asked her why she considered it such a wonderful time.  She replied: &ldquo;I am 11 years married.  This is the first time I ever put my nose outside the door. I never crossed the gate of my husband's farm since the day I married. This is the first time I have ever got out.  It is the greatest adventure that ever struck me since I became a married woman.&rdquo;  On being pressed for further information it emerged that from the day she married to that day she had never had a day off and her working day was approximately 14 hours every day.  My friend asked her about her husband and she replied: &ldquo;He is a good deal better off. He has more freedom than I have.&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;Yes, twice since we have been married he has spent a night with his brother who lives five miles away.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They boast that they work 14 hours a day&mdash;and for what?  They work that length of time in order to pay off the loan they negotiated because, when they set up home, they got a loan to buy the land, they got a loan to buy the stock, they got a loan to buy the machinery and they got a loan to buy the seed.  From that day forward, their lives were consecrated to the task of raising a family and paying their debt.  If they did not do that which the local co-operative thought was requisite in order to ensure the prompt payment of interest and principal, there was a gentleman on the doorstep to inquire why and when would the necessary zeal and industry be displayed with the reminder that if they were not displayed&mdash;and that promptly&mdash;the road was wide and hard for those who had to walk it and that there were plenty of people prepared to take the holding on which that family stood.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> Land, you know, is good security in Denmark.  It never was good security here.  No man's home is a good security to a moneylender in Ireland.  Which system is the right one?  I was brought up in the tradition that if a landlord or a moneylender sent a bailiff to evict a farmer in this country it was considered a public duty to evict the bailiff.  Therefore, land is not a good security in this country.  I know there are profound economists who deplore that fact.  I do not.  I think it is a good society in which a man's home is no security to the usurer, no matter how exalted his title may be.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to hear the argument for the other system and, mind you, we are coming to a parting of the road.  I hear voices raised in this country to establish the proposition that the day of the small farmer is gone and that it ought to be gone. I hear people propound the theory that one of the great blocks to human prograss in Ireland is that the land is not good security for the usurer and that it ought to be.  I believe these philosophies to be wrong.  I believe the small farmer is the foundation of this nation.  I believe that no man's home should ever be good security for the usurer.</P>

      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is quite wrong.  When I was Minister for Agriculture I must have settled half a dozen credit schemes in which I had to settle the security.  The Minister for Agriculture operates more credits than any other Minister of State, including the Minister for Finance.  However, let us face the fact that that issue will be raised in this country and determined.  I believe, on every theory, that the small farmer is <Col N="192" /> of incalculable value to this country. He is the sheet anchor of its security, stability and, in the last analysis, of the philosophy by which all of us, consciously or unconsciously, live.  I choose that philosophy deliberately in preference to that of Denmark, Holland or New Zealand.  I do it perhaps at a cost, but it is a cost I gladly pay.  I invite the Minister for Lands, who loves the Dutch, who venerates the Danes and who almost adores at the shrine of the farmer who keeps 50 cows singlehanded in New Zealand, to come in and tell us what he believes. Let the issue be joined in this House or in the country and I have very little doubt which will prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, for an agricultural country such as ours, this is the most important Estimate introduced here.  In recent years there has been generally greater appreciation of the value of the agricultural industry than heretofore.  There is a more general realisation of the fact that agricultural production is really the sheet anchor of our whole economy. The availability of machinery and fertilisers has brought about an increase in agricultural production in many European countries.  They have brought about that result in our own farming community.  The whole problem that arises now or that will arise in the near future in such countries is the problem of the marketing of that produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disappointing to find that, while the Minister for Agriculture, in his prudence and wisdom, set aside £250,000 for market research through the Minister for Finance in his Budget last year, only £819 of that money has been spent so far.  It is true the Minister said that the whole question is being examined.  It is typical of Departments to go very slowly in the examination of these problems.  In the present instance, in the case of the marketing of our surplus products, it is very vital and urgent that this matter be taken up with emphasis, energy and expedition.  In is a case of Rome burning while Nero is fiddling. In various parts of Great Britain, Denmark has sales agencies and marketing <Col N="193" /> organisations.  Yet we, next door to Great Britain, have no such thing.  Personally, I think if this £250,000 were handed over to the N.F.A. or some such body, under the direction of officers of the Department, who would go into the Great Britain and pursue the possibilities of markets there and who would appoint their own economic experts and salesmen, greater results would have accrued by now.  It is vital that this matter be tackled with greater earnestness than has been indicated by the efforts so far made.</P>
    <P>In common with other European countries we have a surplus of wheat. I doubt if the Minister's approach to that problem was such as should be adopted in our present circumstances. If agriculture is so vital to this country and if wheat production is so important &mdash;and the Party opposite were the great protagonists of wheat production over the years&mdash;it is nauseating to find out that they come back to the very people who answered the call for increased production and penalise them on their excess production.  It is a sort of false principle.  The Minister said it was an experiment.  I hope some other means will be devised.  He mentioned that the contract system was investigated and various other suggestions contemplated.  But I doubt if the one adopted was the one that should have been adopted.  If we are interested in agricultural production and realise how necessary it is for our national survival to put our agriculture in a stable position here, we should be prepared as a Government to stabilise by price supports any surplus we have of the commodities that are vital to this nation and help to boost their prices abroad as New Zealand has done in the case of butter and Denmark in the case of its produce.</P>
    <P>It is rather paradoxical to find that we had to import oats during the past year.  In this small island it is extraordinary that we cannot regulate our production so that those who produce extra wheat will go in for the production of either barley or oats in order to fit in with our requirements.  The former Minister for Agriculture stated here two years ago that he had made <Col N="194" /> arrangements whereby the millers would contract for their requirements of oats so that something could be done about stabilising production.  I do not know whether that has been done.  It would be ideal if it were done.  At least it would give some stability in oats production.</P>
    <P>I believe we shall be importing barley between now and the beginning of the next cereal year.  I wonder is that wise when we can produce feeding barley here so effectively and prolifically? Had feeding barley been propagated here over the years, this country would have been spared many millions spent on the importation of maize.  The farmer Minister for Agriculture made this barley available when he came into office after 1948.  It has proved to be a very remunerative crop for the farmer and it has fulfilled the need of displacing maize.  It is almost nine-tenths as useful as maize, in so far as feeding value is concerned.  It is unfortunate that the price of barley has been further depressed this year. I have information that the co-operative creameries are preparing to give £20 per ton for feeding barley.  I hope the pig position will be such that when the next harvest comes, they will be in a position to pay that.  It will justify the case against the Minister that his fixation of the price was not at all what it should have been.</P>
    <P>With regard to butter, it is not so long ago since we here were consuming butter from New Zealand and Australia.  We should congratulate ourselves that we are producing all our own requirements now and have a little surplus for export.  I do not at all hold with the view that we should not pay Great Britain to eat our butter. We should support our own prices in the British market in order to hold on to that market.  The Government should be a little more generous in trying to buttress butter prices here so that we will hold the place we have got for our butter in the British market.</P>
    <P>The question of bovine tuberculosis has come into this debate.  There is a good deal about it in the volume distributed here this morning by the Department of Agriculture.  Again our <Col N="195" /> farmers seem to have lost confidence in the Department.  That old prejudice against the Department is there. Before an area is declared an intensive area the farmers in the other areas should be encouraged to get rid of their reactors while they still have an open market by making remote preparations for the application of the intensive clause to their respective areas.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of doubt and worry in the minds of many farmers, even farmers well circumstanced financially, as to how they will get the replacements and pay for them.  I know one farmer with a stock of 35 cows, a beautiful herd he has built up with great care over the years.  In the first and second tests carried out on his herd he had only 5 per cent. of his cows passing.  He was very perturbed. Even if he is paid the market value for reactors, he will never be paid on a scale that will replace them.</P>
    <P>Talking about credit, personally I think the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be empowered to operate a loan system particularly for the purchase of cattle that will have to take the place of these displaced reactors. It would be very helpful.  Loans should be made available at the lowest possible interest, specifically for the purchase of T.B.-free cattle.  That should be operated entirely under the jurisdiction of the local agricultural adviser.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon was a great believer in the parish plan.  I know it is perfactly ideal, but whether it is workable or not, or ever will become workable in our limited circumstances, I see no reason why every co-operative creamery should not have its own agricultural adviser and pay him.  We have the experiment of Ballyroe in West Cork, which is an outstanding example of local effort and local initiative. There the creamery was lucky in getting a first-class man and they are paying him through a very small levy on the milk supplied to the creamery.  The whole thing has reaped dividends for the area.  I see no reason why that example would not be <Col N="196" /> followed in other areas, so that people would be independent and have their own adviser who would understand their needs, who would be friendly with them all and to whom they could go at any time, rather than wait for the Department to make these provisions for them.</P>
    <P>The Irish loaf may be one means of absorbing some of our extra wheat, but whether it will or not, the National Farmers' Association are to be heartily congratulated on pursuing their contention that this loaf would be quite palatable and that it would be possible to bake it from Irish wheat. There may be technical difficulties, but at all events they have justified their claim, speaking as they do now with a national voice.  That is one of the results of organised effort.  It is a great and a very necessary thing for the farmers, in line with every other vocation, to be thoroughly and highly organised.  My advice to them to-day would be to perfect their organisation, to close the ranks, but above all to keep out of politics.</P>
    <P>So long as they are an independent body outside this House, they will be a potent force to be reckoned with; but the day they come in here, if ever they do, to be represented here, they will become a cog in the machine that so often works against the farming interests.  We should all like to see a thoroughly national, virile, organisation built up on the lines of the National Farmers' Union in Great Britain.  It is extraordinary how we follow Great Britain in many of our approaches to problems, but this is one case where we could follow with very good results the pattern set by Great Britain in the shape of the National Farmers' Union there.</P>
    <P>Macra na Feirme deserves congratulations also.  They have focussed attention on the value of agricultural education and they have justified their existence. It would be well if they would work in closer liaison with the National Farmers' Association and other rural bodies.  It would not be desirable to see rural bodies competing with one another, dissipating their energies, their time and their capital.  Macra <Col N="197" /> na Feirme has done wonderful work throughout the country in availing of the adult education scheme&mdash;and particularly that available through the University College in Cork.  Nothing has done more good than the creation of a belief and a conviction, a sense of faith in adult education, than that scheme has done.  It has really brought the university out amongst the people in the remote rural areas and has enhanced the value which people placed heretofore on education.</P>
    <P>The land reclamation scheme initiated by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture has done a great deal of wonderful work.  Land which was waterlogged for years is to-day growing crops in abundance and growing them very effectively.  Unfortunately, flaws have appeared in some of the drainage schemes carried out in recent years.  With a scheme like this, originated on such a big national scale, it is quite natural that flaws should reveal themselves in the gradual working out of the scheme.  These flaws have been revealed now in various instances in my locality.  In the haste and expedition with which the scheme was launched, it was natural that flaws should crop up from time to time. I must compliment the Department on the expedition with which it was launched.  For such a wide national scheme, it was done in the most expeditious way and highly organised within the very minimum of time.</P>
    <P>In regard to the flaws of which I spoke, there was a departure from the traditional methods of drainage.  After the drain was opened and the pipes were laid, the top sod, on which there was herbage of various kinds, was inverted down on top of the pipe and with the air in the pipes and with the water, the growth of the herbage was encouraged and grew through the joints into the pipe, creating a complete blockage.  I would invite the Minister to visit Cork, with his own experts, and see the experiments carried out by Professor Roberts, Professor of Botany in University College, Cork, who visited various farms where those flaws came to light.  He has carried out those experiments, proving that it is fatal to put the top sod with <Col N="198" /> the grass downwards on the pipes after they have been laid in the drains.  It is bad that in a great national scheme of this kind any money would be misspent.</P>
    <P>Before the Department decides to wait for the Agricultural Institute to go into research on this matter, they should come together right away and discuss this matter with the Professor of Botany in University College, Cork. He has done much research per funds allowed by U.C.C. in the interests of the scheme, and he has got very convincing results, which I am sure will satisfy the greatest experts we have in the Department and satisfy the Minister as well.  I am not blaming anyone for this.  These things come to light only after a scheme has been tried over so many years.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to a farmer as late as last Saturday&mdash;I think Deputy MacCarthy knows him&mdash;who had some drainage done about five or six years ago and who got excellent results off the land up to this last year.  Unfortunately, this winter&mdash;and it is not because of the excessive rain&mdash;the land is very much flooded.  Now he has contracted to do some further drainage, but he is insisting that it be done as he directs.  In the leaflet supplied by the Department dealing with these contracts, they talk about putting the top sod down over the pipes.  I think that should be altered now.  Some other material like gravel, stones or clinkers, or the old method of dry straw or furze, would prevent the growth of roots or herbage of any kind into those pipes.  That has been clearly demonstrated in University College, Cork, by Professor Roberts. It is a pity that the experiments and information he has made available there in research would not be utilised now to correct the fault which has appeared and which has really destroyed the drainage done for those people.</P>
    <P>Then there is the point that those who did drainage, under the A scheme or the B scheme, are nevertheless paying for this.  Where these flaws have appeared and where the drainage has been ineffective because of the type of filling used in these drains, the least <Col N="199" /> these people should get is reconsideration of their schemes.  The Department should go back and re-do these things, so that the people would not have to suffer the loss they have to endure.</P>
    <P>We are a small island here and have to face competition from free nations, nations which have had freedom over the years and have had opportunities and chances to build up marketing organisations and contacts over the years.  We are many years behind the times.  We have lagged considerably. We have a lot of leeway to make up. If we hope to keep our place in continental markets and in the British market, then we must revitalise our efforts and redouble our energies.  That is the first serious problem facing the Department.</P>
    <P>Remember the position that arose last year in relation to wheat and in relation to butter.  I doubt if we will have the same amount of butter this year.  Because of the scarcity of grass during the cold weather in March and April, supplies of milk to the creameries this year have not been on a par with last year.  Nevertheless, it is grand that we have increased production to such a point that we must now make every effort to maintain our hold on our markets, no matter at what cost.  But it is most unfair and unjust to come down on the very people who provided the surpluses so vital to the nation and penalise them for their efforts in achieving such grand results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking on the general agricultural position this year, we find that one of our main problems is concerned with the marketing of our surpluses.  Various Governments have done considerable work to help the farmer to increase production.  Scientific knowledge has been passed on to the farmer from various departmental and local government agents and instructors and this, allied to the natural ability of the farmers, has increased output very considerably.  This should be an ideal situation for an agricultural country but unfortunately our efforts to obtain foreign markets and our knowledge of marketing technique, which is highly skilled, has not kept <Col N="200" /> pace with increased output.  The failure in that respect is partly due to the fact that we are young as a nation and we have not had the opportunities that other countries have had to develop markets.</P>
      <P>Our better surplus presents us with a difficult problem and it is a problem which concerns both the farmer and the taxpayers.  It is my view that the marketing of this commodity must bear a considerable share of the blame.  I am aware, of course, that the British Government has geared its policy towards making that country as self-sufficient as possible in relation to milk and its products but, at the same time, that does not explain away the reason why Danish butter is commanding a better price on the British market as compared with Irish butter. In order to sell a particular brand of butter, a taste must be acquired for that particular brand and, to acquire that taste, a particular type of butter of high quality must be available regularly in a given area.  It is impossible for the British people to acquire that taste for our butter if a few tons are sent to one city one week and to another city another week, and so on.  We must ensure a regular supply.</P>
      <P>We learn two things from this.  First, as I said before, we must export a regular supply of high quality butter and, secondly, because of the fact that the amount of butter which we export represents only a very small percentage of the butter consumed in Britain, we should concentrate on certain areas. It would be advisable for us to concentrate on those areas in which there is a larger number of our people living who have already acquired a taste for our brand of butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to discuss the actual exporting of butter, we find ourselves considering the relative merits of exporting in bulk and exporting it packaged.  I have no doubt that exporting butter in bulk under normal circumstances would be the more efficient method, but unfortunately we are not dealing with normal conditions at the present times and it is essential that our butter should reach the foreign consumer efficiently packaged and properly <Col N="201" /> labelled.  A further flaw that I find in our present method of exporting butter in bulk is that we are subsidising the butter without giving proper consideration to quality.  On the home market, we sometimes find that certain brands of butter are not just up to the standard we would like. If we fail to examine the position with regard to quality we shall be encouraging inefficiency in the creamery industry generally.  I appreciate, of course, that if we are to go into this matter as it should be gone into we will have a certain initial expense but, in the long run, this should pay good dividends.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of the exact composition of the Butter Marketing Board, but there should be on that board representatives of the producers and the processers, not just as individuals but as representatives of their various organisations.</P>
    <P>I have made a little research into the sales of Irish butter in a city in North-West England.  Even in a single city, I find there are wide variations in the sales of Irish butter.  It would pay the Butter Marketing Board to investigate the reason why there is a very good sale in certain shops and not so good in others.  I shall give a couple of examples.  In one large firm, 100 per cent. grocers with eight shops, I was told that sales of Irish butter were very good.  An individual family grocer gave New Zealand butter as a best seller and Irish as second, while Danish was one in 20.  I should like to point out that Danish butter sales are largely confined to the South of England and London.  In the particular city from which I am giving examples, sales of Danish butter were small.</P>
    <P>Another small general shop in a poor district sold twice as much New Zealand butter as Irish, but did not sell any Danish at all.  In another good type general shop, where a certain type of Irish slab cake was being sold because of its quality, even though it was much dearer than its English counterpart, there was no Irish butter sold at all and the reason given was that multiple stores in the vicinity were selling Irish butter at less than the cost price at which this <Col N="202" /> shop could buy it.  It was pointed out that, because of the fact that these multiple stores were selling Irish butter at less than the wholesale price to attract customers, the impression was given to people that there was something not just right about Irish butter and, for that reason, it was not being sold.  When I asked why Danish butter commanded a better price than Irish, it was stated that the Danes are more careful in grading and have a better selectivity.  Irish butter is received in cardboard cartons and boxes.  It is subsequently wrapped in greaseproof paper, which is similar to that used by the Danes, except that, in some cases, the Danes use foil wrapping.  It is a matter for consideration whether or not this has a very big effect on sales because very many retailers will not accept foil wrapped butter because it is dearer.</P>
    <P>On the question as to how sales of Irish butter could be improved and better prices obtained, one of the points I have alluded to was mentioned, namely, that supplies were not sufficiently maintained to encourage people to buy Irish butter.  Irish butter is intermittently unobtainable and when a customer is forced to change to another type of butter it is difficult to get him to revert to Irish butter when it is obtainable.  It was suggested that it is Irish butter were branded and advertised it could be sold against any other type of butter but that the public must be conditioned by intensive publicity through the Press and through window stickers and, also, that it would be a good idea to have a catchy slogan.  The New Zealand butter sellers are supplied with that type of sticker.</P>
    <P>I have listened over the last few months to Deputy Dillon and several other Deputies on the Fine Gael Benches advocating subsidisation of butter exports to the hilt.  Of course, this is not really a subsidy on exports; it is a subsidy to the farmer, and I thoroughly agree with that attitude but the Fine Gael Party in general should stop play-acting with this question. Recently a motion was introduced at the Louth County Committee of <Col N="203" /> Agriculture by a Fine Gael councillor urging the Minister to remove the subsidy from exports of butter.  That, in effect, is what the motion meant.  It was supported by Fine Gael members of that committee and passed by the casting vote of the Fine Gael chairman. I could understand a motion of that type coming from practically any other body because, being human, we are all inclined to want the best of both worlds, but that it should come from a body which was specially selected to protect the interests of the farmers is almost unbelievable.</P>
    <P>This motion was a carefully planned attack by the Fine Gael members of that committee on the small farmer.  I admit that the small farmer has supported me and the Party to which I belong, over the years, but I do not feel that that gives any authority to councillors, no matter what their political views may be, to try to depress prices on the farmers, particularly on the small farmers, simply because they do not support them.  It was, in fact, a motion to depress prices on the farmers.</P>
    <P>It was left to Fianna Fáil councillors on the committee of agriculture to point out that the £4,000,000 got from butter exports brought in £4,000,000 worth of raw materials for factories and that were it not for that money, factories would be lying idle, workers would be on half-time or not working at all, that the same applied in the case of the £50,000,000 exports of cattle last year, that that money also brought in raw materials which kept industries going and that the securing of that money depended on the well-being of the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Deputy Dillon and the other Deputies spoke sincerely in the matter and, as I have said, I agree with them but I do think that the type of motion to which I have referred should not be brought in by responsible members of a committee of agriculture. I am aware, of course, that efforts are now being made to suggest that the motion was brought in for some other reason but the fact remains that the motion was deliberately introduced to appeal to one section of the <Col N="204" /> community and to turn them against the farming section.  Our efforts should be concentrated on market research and on the production and marketing of milk products other than butter.  Our reliance on butter production is a weakness in our dairy economy.</P>
    <P>The exportable surplus of bacon presents the same difficulties experienced in the case of the surplus butter. Here, also, we must concentrate on exports of high quality grades and must satisfy ourselves as to the type of bacon required by various countries and endeavour to supply them with that type of bacon.  The introduction of the Landrace pig will help to develop the type of bacon suitable for the British market.  Here, again, it is essential to corner a particular section or a few small sections of the British market and to send continuous and regular supplies to the chosen sections.  At all costs, the supplies must be regular and the quality of the highest.</P>
    <P>There should be a limited number of agents in Britain dealing with our exports of bacon and the present practice of each exporters having his own agent should be discontinued.  It is the opinion of many farmers that a semi-state company should be set up to run the bacon industry, that such a company would have a steadying influence on prices and would be assiduous in seeking better markets. Of course, that is a matter of opinion. The higher the efficiency in the industry, the less need for subsidisation and, of course, the ideal situation would be that in which the farmer would get a fair price for pigs and we would be able to get a good price on the foreign market.  Production of the right type of bacon, increased efficiency in the industry and greater efforts to procure new markets would, in time, lead to this ideal situation.</P>
    <P>A good market is being developed for seed potatoes.  By better study of markets we could increase this very profitable production.  The Dutch, with an inferior quality seed potato, have quadrupled their exports over the past years.  We could learn from a study of their methods.  The British market is open for development and we can <Col N="205" /> supply seed potatoes of a type superior to anything they have got at present.</P>
    <P>Cattle exports have been our economic life preserver over the past years. It is absolutely essential that the overriding importance of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis should be stressed. I am very glad to note that there is an increased amount made available in the Vote for this purpose and also that the compulsory clearance area in the West is established.  It is felt that the constituency that I represent, being on the Border, should be included in the clearance area.  Until quite recently, because we could still export cattle on an open market to Britain, some people felt that the need for anxiety was not all that it was supposed to be, but I am very glad that that view has been corrected.</P>
    <P>Incentives are necessary.  At the moment T.T. stores are fetching a better prices than untested stores. Certain areas in Britain are already T.B.-free and the British farmer is anxious to buy T.T. stores.  I am led to believe that if the British Government were approached and agreed to do away with the differential of 3/6 a cwt. provided Irish cattle were tested and found to be T.B.-free, they would have the full support of the British farmer and it would mean an extra 35/- in the 10 cwt. beast to the farmer here and would encourage him to redouble his efforts to eradicate bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>Another important point which must be considered is that at the present time there is a surplus of milk in Britain and emphasis is being laid on beef production to the extent that a large subsidy is being paid on a beef-type calf.  We exported in the region of 800,000 stores to Britain last year. If we take it that half the cows in Britain are producing milk-type calves and the other half beef-type calves, we can appreciate if the British farmers do not get the requirements of tested stores from this country, they could change over to producing beef-type calves from the lower yielding cows and this would have some effect on us here.  Of course, I realise they would have some difficulty in regard to their <Col N="206" /> foundation stock.  We must remember that we exported only 50,000 T.T. stores last year.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to note that the shipping companies are making space available for the transport of T.T. stores.  It is time that we considered making available sale yards confined to the sale of T.T. cattle.  I am glad to say that in Drogheda consideration has been given to this matter.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to note an increase in the Estimate for seed testing.  The Department are to be congratulated in this matter.  The present scheme for the testing of atle seed for the home market should be extended to other varieties.  We should also try to get into the export market.  We ourselves are at present importing certified seed from countries which have much the same climate as our own.</P>
    <P>With further reference to the question of wheat, I would urge the Minister to expedite the experiments on the 100 per cent.  Irish loaf so as to absorb our whole wheat output.  We have been given a sample of what can be done in the loaf which was sent around to the members of this House by the National Farmers' Association.  There is no doubt that it was as good a loaf as could be produced but we would be foolish to suggest that all our difficulties are over if we are able to produce this loaf.  We must consider whether that can be done with our whole wheat output or not.  The sooner we can increase the amount of Irish wheat in the loaf, while at the same time producing a palatable loaf, the better for our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister had a problem to deal with this year in the matter of wheat but I would urge him to pursue his endeavours for a better solution to the wheat price question.  I have discussed various solutions with different groups of farmers in my own constituency&mdash; the present married price, the idea of a contract system and the setting up of a standard under which wheat would not be regarded as millable. They all have their advantages and disadvantages.  I am concerned mainly with the small farmer, the category in which is to be found the vast majority <Col N="207" /> of the farmers of my constituency which is an intensive tillage area. During the war these farmers produced their quota of wheat and more besides, and they felt very aggrieved when so-called farmers who are now wheat ranching should depress prices, people who during the war would not produce a grain of wheat although at the time it was absolutely essential to save our people from starvation.</P>
    <P>I have practical and personal experience of the difficulties of these small farmers, having been reared on a small farm myself and having lived in the economy which surrounds the small farmer.  Therefore, I realise better than most what the effect of a small reduction in income means to them. Wheat is carefully harvested in my constituency and the farmer there could no more harvest wheat or any other crop in bad condition than a true craftsman could turn out a shabby article.  However, under the present married price, the man who harvests his crop in any old way will be as well repaid as the careful farmer.  For this reason we feel that the setting up of a standard for millable wheat might be considered.  The longer we continue to accept badly harvested wheat, so much longer will it be before we can produce the 100 per cent. Irish loaf.</P>
    <P>Wheat growing is an important part of the rotation of crops for all small farmers.  Extensive wheat growers are not concerned with rotation but with the profit of one or more crops of wheat on their own land and on conacre. This unbalanced type of farming is valueless to our economy.  I have mentioned wheat ranchers and speculators and I would ask the Minister to do all he can to eliminate them, but at the same time not to act as the Coalition did when they used him as a bogey man and as an excuse to pillory genuine farmers at a time when they had no surplus problem.</P>
    <P>I shall not waste the time of the House discussing the Fine Gael attitude towards wheat&mdash;that is well known&mdash;except to say this.  I listened to the debate on the wheat motion by the Fine Gael Party; I listened to <Col N="208" /> some of the debate on a similar motion in the Seanad and I heard the matter discussed by farmers in my constituency. The farmers said that it was very peculiar that Fine Gael were now coming in with motions about wheat prices when they have absolutely no power to affect the price of wheat and that when they had power these very same people cut the price of wheat by 12/6 a barrel.  Those farmers did not see any sincerity in that attitude.  As far as we are concerned with wheat, we have increased the price of wheat by 27/6 a barrel during our time whereas the Coalition reduced it by 12/6.</P>
    <P>During the debate on that motion on wheat&mdash;I do not know whether it is worth referring to this&mdash;a number of remarks were made by Fine Gael Deputies with regard to what they referred to as Deputies who were elected from wheat constituencies.  By the very fact that they mentioned Louth, I presume I was included in that category.  I do not know exactly what they meant by that.  If it was a reference to promises about wheat prices, then it was completely incorrect. If it meant that the small farmers of the constituency supported us, I would agree with it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should mention just what the position is in Louth&mdash;I do not know about the other constituencies referred to&mdash;and perhaps I should give a short history in regard to my county.  In 1937, Fianna Fáil won the second seat for the first time in County Louth, that is, 21 years ago.  During those 21 years, Fianna Fáil held the seat for almost 15 years and Fine Gael held it for less than three.  I am sure that Deputies opposite will admit that even Homer nods.</P>
    <P>The bulk of our wool is of very good quality.  It is a raw material ready to hand; yet we are selling most of it in its cheapest form.  The employment it provides, even selling it in this way, is good, that is, in baling and so on, but it should be clear that employment in the industry would be multiplied if we were to convert the wool into the finished product.  The best Suffolk wool is in the same category as Merino wool.</P>
    <P>Some remarks were made about <Col N="209" /> credit facilities.  The one point which strikes me, and I agree with certain remarks by Deputy Manley with regard to these facilities, is that while it appears to be easy for a farmer to get credit for, say £1,000, if he is buying machinery, it seems to be almost impossible to get credit if he is buying stock.  I should also like to refer to something which I mentioned last year, that is, that it is very difficult for small farmers to make a living by growing crops which are more suitable for larger holdings, because the income per acre is much too low.  He must specialise, and vegetable and fruit growing are ideal for the small farmer. The labour content of this type of farming is high, but, generally speaking, the labour can be supplied by the farmer's family.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there are problems to be faced here, the problem of marketing being the greatest.  The marketing committee which has now been set up should examine the market potentialities and pass on the information to the farmer.  Growing could then be planned in a sensible manner.  The present system of producing first and looking for markets afterwards will have to be changed to examining market possibilities, producing as efficiently as possible and selling in the markets which give the best returns. Last year, we imported £2,500,000 worth of fruit and vegetables, which I think is wrong for an agricultural country.  We have in Britain an unlimited market for this type of produce.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that I am in agreement with the suggestion that we should have as many technical advisers as we can afford.  I believe technical advice is absolutely essential at present, but we should also remember that one of our big problems is the marketing of our produce andno effort should be spared in examining the possibilities of various countries and getting as much knowledge of marketing techniques as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad this debate has been conducted in the way it has been conducted.  There is not so much ranting and raving as there <Col N="210" /> usually is from Fianna Fáil Deputies. Just to comment on what the previous speaker said, it is not of great moment what one committee of agriculture does&mdash;it might be down in our own county&mdash;and it does not affect Government policy.  They can pass resolutions until they are blue in the face.</P>
      <P>Wheat has been put in the forefront as an issue here for years and we are always blamed as the bogey-men who would have nothing to do with it.  I will grant that to the people who say that, but I will say that they were the bogey-men of the cattle trade, and I put the total value of the wheat crop as against the total value of the cattle exports.  We will see then which was a better line to take.  There is a place for both of them and the sooner we say that to ourselves and stop the recriminations, the better.</P>
      <P>What I am concerned about this year is the surplus of wheat.  The Ministers in this Government had a solution for all problems which they were trotting out at chambers of commerce dinners and other functions throughout the country.  That solution was increased production.  The farmers gave the increased production and now they know where they are.  This surplus of wheat has to be disposed of and it was offered, first of all, at £26 a ton in six-ton lots to the Irish farmer and pig feeders.  There must be an enormous number of pig feeders who would not have the price of six tons and there must be an enormous number more who, if they had the price, would not have the place to store it.  It is ridiculous to mention a figure such as this.  Now it has been reduced to £23 a ton.  I suggest to the Minister that if the farmers go to a mill and ask for a ton, they should be given it, at the price at which it is being exported or at the price at which it was bought, £18 10s. a ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed that this surplus of wheat was sold to biscuit manufacturers, and there could not be more than one or two of them, at £20 a ton, the justification for that being that the Irish biscuit manufacturers would then be in a position to compete in foreign markets.  That is very good, but I submit that the Irish farmer is a manufacturer, <Col N="211" /> too, because it can be said that he manufactures bacon out of feeding stuffs.  Would it not be better to give the Irish farmer cheap feeding stuffs than to send them to people outside?  I do not say send it out &ldquo;to the foreigner.&rdquo;  Deputies use that expression here in a most hostile way and their in the next breath speak about developing markets outside. They do not use the word &ldquo;foreigner&rdquo; there.  I feel we should approach this in a business-like way and should not take up a hostile attitude to people to whom we sell and from whom we buy.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government allocated £250,000 in the Budget for the investigation of new markets and the improvement of our marketing system. That was welcomed by the House and the country.  Many people had no doubt that a Government that was to &ldquo;get cracking&rdquo; immediately with £250,000 to set up a sales organisation would have something to show after 12 months.  Only three weeks ago a parliamentary question was asked to ascertain how much of the £250,000 had been spent and the answer was £890.  That is a frightful confession of ineptitude.  Here we had a Minister for Agriculture with surpluses on hands and a Government allocating £250,000 to be spent in finding new markets or better markets and in the entire 12 months all that was spent was £890.</P>
    <P>I think what is wrong here, and it is wrong in connection with industry also, is our salesmanship.  That is the key to the situation.  People who know their business and how to sell products will not be found if the necessary qualification is that they be sons of Ministers or members of a certain political Party.  When such people are being selected they should be selected because they are salesmen and when they are selected it should be put in their contracts that if they are not selling after a certain period they will be &ldquo;fired&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When in London recently, early one morning I visited as many grocery shops as I could to see to what extent Irish butter was on sale.  I found magnificent pyramids of butter on display <Col N="212" /> from practically every country under the sun but I had great difficulty in finding any Irish butter.  Wherever the shopkeepers were not too busy, I asked them about Irish butter and many of them said they had not handled it for years&mdash;nobody had called about it.  I know we did not have a surplus then.  I admit Danish butter is making more money.  I bought some, took it to the house where I was staying and we tried it.  I am not being prejudiced as an Irishman when I say that our butter is as good if not better than any other.</P>
    <P>I was unable to get Irish bacon, but I sent home for some and I bought various cuts of the wonderful bacon that is supposed to come from Denmark and the Continent to Britain. In my opinion, while the texture is good and it appears to be leaner bacon at the rasher end, it is harder. It is not as tasty as ours.  I should not like the Minister to think that I am prejudiced in favour of our own bacon. I have all the Irish penchant for &ldquo;knocking&rdquo; things that we have ourselves and in this case I was surprised, and so were the people with whom I stayed, that our bacon was so very good by comparison with the others. To my mind the taste was better.</P>
    <P>We have had a cold spring and it seems as if we shall not have a big surplus, but if we have a big surplus of butter or bacon, surely some effort should be made in regard to the sale of it.  There must be districts where the people responsible for selling our butter could find a big Irish population and a special drive should be made to sell the butter and to ensure that it would not be put on a back shelf where it would wait for somebody to come in and ask for Irish butter.  There should be some promotional effort put into it.</P>
    <P>So far as research is concerned, I think wonderful work was done by the Department of Agriculture.  It is most important&mdash;probably this is being done &mdash;that we should develop the sale of other milk products and even attempt to produce new products such as chocolate crumb.  It provided great relief for the dairy farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> We have a big population of sheep and lambs&mdash;and this ties up also with the £250,000 allocation&mdash;and the owners are sceptical about the prospects.  A market was found in France a couple of years ago and an agreement made with the French Government.  A good number of lambs were exported to France and this resulted in firmness of prices.  I think the Minister should use some of the £250,000, get in touch with the French Government and see if an arrangement can be made to sell more lambs to them.  The same could be done perhaps with other countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned Germany. It appears the Minister is having great difficulty in regard to the German trade agreement.  Maybe it is wrong to say this, but I do not see what difficulty the Irish Government should have in dealing with the Germans when we are buying four or five times as much from them as they are buying from us.  It would be different if we were under an obligation to them.  In those circumstances I think the Government here was very ill-advised in their recent purchases when they bought Mercedes, German manufactured cars, while there were other countries who were excellent customers of ours and with whom it was much easier to deal.  A sterner line should be taken with such people.  We are often inclined to take a stiff line with people with whom we do our best business.</P>
    <P>With regard to bacon and pig production, if the Minister had been trying to do away with pigs, or was afraid there was going to be a surplus, he could not have done a better job than he did when he took away the 5/- from Grade A pigs, and then allowed the bacon curers to get away with what they did in docking people £2 to £2 10s. a cwt.  I have an old fashioned way of finding out people's reactions to this type of thing.  I never ask are sow services falling.  I look in the newspapers after a week or two and I see the price of sows is falling to £4 10s. a cwt. and that in the spring of the year.  Those are the sows that should have had the pigs in the coming summer, but they are fattened up, and a lot of them sent into the factories <Col N="214" /> only half-finished.  That was a bad thing to do and whatever happens he should not do it any more.  He has made a mistake and let us write it off.</P>
    <P>We have been told much about the wonders of the Landrace pig.  I know very little about it.  Maybe the people who brought that breed of pig into the country did it for pure cussedness and probably know less about it than I do.  I did not agree with the type of pig developed by the Department at one time.  I remember having a type of pig which had a few black spots on it.  Maybe I was very young, but I thought it was a wonderful thing to have.  The Department eventually got that out of them, and I think they were right.  The Department did a good job with the type of pig we had. It was built up over the years, but now it has been smashed down by a few irresponsible people.  We have yet to see what will happen, but I do say that the Irish Large White can produce as good a breed as any of the Landraces.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of Irish people going abroad to foreign countries. Deputy Dillon mentioned it here to-day.  They go to Denmark, Holland, and all these far-away places, and come back to tell us about the wonders of the farmers there.  I want to describe the experience of one young man who went out there and lived with them. He had always been pressing his father to put up the money to allow him to do so.  It was a great deal of money in the days I speak of.  He stayed and worked with a farmer for five or six weeks and when he came home he &ldquo;moidered&rdquo; everybody talking about the wonders of the foreign farm.  They got up at 5 o'clock in the morning and had half a day's work done before they came into breakfast.  It was like what Deputy Dillon said&mdash;one man looking after 50 cows&mdash;he had a 365 day job.  He described how the farmer went out to work in the morning wearing sabots and pants, and how he milked the cows.  His father, being an old-fashioned Irish farmer, asked his son: &ldquo;Did you go to any race meetings?&rdquo; The young fellow said: &ldquo;No, there was no place to go.&rdquo;  He then asked his son did he go to any football <Col N="215" /> matches and the young fellow only then discovered that he had not got to a football match or anything else like that&mdash;they had to get up at 5.30 in the morning to milk the cows.  The father's reply to the son then was that he should have tethered himself to a cow and stayed with her all night.</P>
    <P>The Irish farmer is all right.  It is pointed out, however, that he should be a dynamo like the foreign farmer, but it is usually young men in universities who tell him the number of hours he should work&mdash;14 to 17 hours a day. Those young men in universities are themselves very anxious to secure jobs in which they will work only four or five hours a day.  I know one man who got into a very highly paid job where he had a 38 hour week.  These people should leave the Irish farmer alone.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manley made a very good statement on land reclamation.  He referred to a case where pipes became stopped and I would say it was the topsoil which was put on them that caused weeds to grow inside them and cause the stoppage.  The farmers who have committed themselves to this are in a very precarious position and it looks as if they will have to dig up the whole thing themselves.  Even at this stage of the race, the Minister should investigate these cases because if it was soil that was put on top of them it was not a good job.  The old system of putting down a carpet of clinkers should have been followed.</P>
    <P>I have asked this before, but I should like to ask again what happened the photographs of the land reclamation scheme which were on display in the hall of this House.  I do not know enough about the machinery for that work or how it is done.  They were there during the term of office of the previous Government but they have been removed.  I should like to know how that has happened.  Is it the Board of Works is responsible?  Is it you, Sir, or is it the Minister for Agriculture?  I was intrigued to know where they went and I could not find out.  Then I discovered them in a farming supplement of the <i>Irish Press</i>, published on 20th February, <Col N="216" /> 1958.  The wilderness blossomed and there they were, the pictures that were in the hall in Dáil Éireann&mdash;&ldquo;Winning Back Ireland's Lost Acres&rdquo;.  I should like to know who took them out and how they were got out.</P>
    <P>I want to find fault with the Government in that, when Deputy Dillon finished his address to-day, nobody offered.  There were very few Government Deputies in the House at the time to hear even their own Minister. There were twice as many Fine Gael Deputies here as Fianna Fáil Deputies who listened to the statement of the Minister for Agriculture.  I was disappointed with that because I consider there is but the one bond between certain men in Fianna Fáil and certain men over here.  There is a big agricultural interest in this House, and the agricultural section should pay more attention to their business in Dáil Éireann, especially when the important Estimate for Agriculture is before the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to the double byre grants, the Minister should see to it that they are restored.  What I am going to say now I have said twice already this year, but I repeat it.  I was called to order by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who said it would be more appropriate to raise it on the Estimate for Agriculture.  I refer to the tuberculin testing of cattle.  I will not go into all the details of this matter.  We all know it must be done and the sooner it is done, the better.  If anybody should give a lead in this matter, it is the Minister for Agriculture.  He should be the foremost banner-bearer in the business.</P>
    <P>Let me quote from the <i>Sunday Express</i> of January 12th, 1958, an article headed &ldquo;Minister orders &lsquo;raids&rsquo; on Cattle.&rdquo;  Let there be no wise-cracks from the Government Benches to the effect that I should not read the Sunday papers, unless they want to put a ban on me, just as was done in the case of Émonn Young. The article goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Republic's new Minister for Agriculture, 57-year-old Mr. Patrick Smith, has ordered &lsquo;softening-up raids&rsquo; as a prelude to his inspectors <Col N="217" /> moving into the newest battle areas in their fight to wipe out tuberculosis in the nation's cattle.</P>
    <P>In a special interview, the Minister told me he believed the only sure way to the complete success of his Ministry's scheme was to mop up the disease county by county.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;It has to be a step-by-step operation,&rsquo; he explained, &lsquo;and to win it we have got to tackle the whole question in a systematic manner.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Smith is not unduly perturbed by the forecast that Britain's herds will all be fully certified by 1962.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;We are facing this job realistically, and a lot of things can happen in the next four years.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>And because he believes that the scheme must be run on a systematic basis, the farming Minister has deferred attestation of his own herd at Cootehill, County Cavan, until Government inspectors begin a mass test in his native county.</P>
    <P>Said Mr. Smith: &lsquo;I have not had my own cattle tested up to now because as the odd man out it would be futile.  A single attested herd has little chance of remaining diseasefree when there is so much movement of cattle to and from farms in an area not already cleared.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>So he is throwing the whole weight of his Department this year into an intensive fight against the disease in the ten main breeding counties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister would do better if he would throw his own weight into the fight and get his cattle tested.  He did not have his own cattle attested because, as the odd man out, it would be futile.  I think the odd men out are the brave men who are doing a really good job for the country.  A lot of people in Cavan have had their herds attested.  The more people do that, the easier will be the job of the Department's inspectors.  Therefore, I say to the Minister now that he should take the lead from Father Mathew and pledge himself to get his herd tested saying: &ldquo;Here goes, in the name of God&rdquo; and let the rest of the farming community follow.  Many farmers will <Col N="218" /> be very doubtful about it when they see the Minister holding back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister has to face a very difficult job this year.  I am very grateful for the statement we have from his Department.  I heard Deputies talking about marketing conditions and all the rest of it.  I wonder what are they for?  What is the present price of butter sold in Great Britain?  Is there any farmer in this country prepared to produce butter at that price or anything like it?  What is all the talk of the marketing of surplus dairy produce about? Let us explain this thing and deal with it boldly if we can.</P>
      <P>Last year, we exported 315,000 cwt. of butter.  Evidently in future all surpluses are to react on the producer. The more they produce, the bigger the wallop they will get.  I now say to the agricultural community that they never had a better opportunity of putting things in order, particularly in so far as butter is concerned.  There is a T.B. scheme going through which will definitely wipe out about 30 per cent. of the milch cows in this country.  My suggestion to the farmers is not to replace them.  If they sell a cow for £20, let them not chase around the country to buy a £100 one to replace it.  If they do that, there will not be any butter surplus of 315,000 cwt. to depreciate further a price which is too low already, namely, the price of dairy produce.</P>
      <P>That is the one remedy.  It is a simple one, but it is one which should, I think, be adopted in the present circumstances. Every extra gallon of milk produced to-day means a cut in price.  Therefore, do not produce it. Perhaps when we have got back on Brian Boru's butter again, there will be a better estimate of the dairy farmer's position in this country.  I know it is a hard policy to suggest, but I can see no other remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a long number of years, we had in this country a farce known as the Milk Costings Commission.  Unfortunately, it fell into wrong hands.  The farther Governments and Government <Col N="219" /> Departments are kept away from this kind of thing, the better.  I remember a very courageous job being undertaken in Cork away back in 1947.  It was to find out the cost of production of an acre of beet.  The two boys concerned got together, fixed up their tribunal, appointed a referee, got to work in 1947 and, in 1948, we were paid for our beet on the cost of production &mdash;after one 12 months.</P>
    <P>Since 1948, on costings, the price of beet has gone up from £4 8s. a ton to over £6 a ton.  According to the glimpses I could get through the 3,000 or 4,000 pages of the Milk Costings Commission report, it takes roughly the same number of labour hours per cow as per acre of beet.  The increases from £4 8s. up to £6 1s. a ton on beet are due practically altogether&mdash;90 per cent, at any rate&mdash;to increased cost of labour.  Therefore, the price of milk as between 1948 and to-day should reflect a pretty hefty increase.  Let us go further in our inspection of that problem.  Let us take the costings done in the Cork Milk Board area in 1945 by Professor Murphy.  They work out practically the same and give us the same result.</P>
    <P>We are now up against a position in which, because they succeeded in producing 315,000 cwt. of butter more than were required, our farmers are to be cut in the price of their milk. There is only one cure for surpluses and that is not to have them.  If our farmers, in regard to these matters, can manage to produce about 90 per cent. of their requirements, the other 10 per cent. will keep the boys paid. If ever you wanted a perfect example of that, I suggest for consideration the attempt made in 1948 by the then Minister for Agriculture to induce the farmers to grow potatoes.  They grew them; they got rid of some of them. I remember even Labour Deputies commenting on the fact that the price the farmer got for his potatoes that year was £5 a ton.  The farmers never forgot it and now they are £30 a ton for anyone who can buy them.</P>
    <P>If you want another example, take oats.  I remember, about four or five years ago, I was informed in this <Col N="220" /> House that &ldquo;the quantity of oats marketed was inadequate to meet the requirements of the oatmeal millers and the horse owners.&rdquo; It is some years since I was over in the Department of Agriculture considering that very matter and that very problem: I think Deputy Dillon was then Minister for Agriculture.  We made a proposition to the Minister&mdash;speaking for the Grade 1 farmers of this country&mdash;that we were prepared to produce the full requirements of the oatmeal millers and the gentlemen in the Curragh, under contract.  The Minister said it would be a very good idea if we would do so.  We wrote to them.  We met them.  They were not prepared to grow under contract.  They were quite satisfied to take the open market.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any justification for people like the oatmeal millers, who are dependent for their market on the people of this country, leaving themselves in such a position and putting a Department of State in such an awkward position that that Department must gives those people licences to import oats.  There is no justification for it; there is no justification for allowing the importation of one lb. of oats into this country to-day or at any other period.</P>
    <P>We are now in the month of May. Have the Department taken any steps, as yet, to have the requirements of the oatmeal millers grown under contract for the coming harvest?  Have they informed the oatmeal millers to provide their requirements here at home and to make provision for them now, as they will not be given a licence to import next year?  Have they even taken that step?  If they have not, for what, in the name of heavens, are we passing this money?</P>
    <P>With regard to agricultural advisers, where is the agricultural advice?  Oats are being imported at present, I believe, at up to £25 or £26 a ton.  What is the price of the oatmeal to those who have to buy it?  What would be the price of the oatmeal had those people contracted for their requirements among the farmers?  Why was this money sent abroad?  Knowing the situation, have any steps been taken this year by the Department of Agriculture <Col N="221" /> to remedy the situation in view of their knowledge of the difficulties and of the number of licences they have had to give to oatmeal millers since last harvest and up to now? Have any steps been taken by them to ensure that the same position will not arise in the coming harvest?</P>
    <P>We are shouting about surpluses and talking about selling what we have got.  Here is a market which can be opened to us by the very simple expedient of the Department of Agriculture notifying the oatmeal millers and horse owners of this country that they have an opportunity between now and the harvest of contracting for their requirements as they will not get a licence to import.  That is one way in which some of the land now being badly used for grain can be put under profitable production.  Has it been done?  If the Department spent a third of the time they spent messing about with the wheat problem, and making it worse than it was, on this matter, there would be a lot more satisfaction amongst the agricultural community to-day.</P>
    <P>Four or five years ago, it was left to the grain committee of the Beet Growers' Association to take those steps.  We took them, but the boys were not prepared to pay the price. All that was needed at that time was notification from the Minister that they would not get a licence.  All that is needed to-day is a notification from the Minister that they will not get a licence.  But no steps have been taken. That is the difference between a Department of Agriculture that should be watching market and prepared to assist the farmer and a Department of Agriculture that sits down on its tail and lets everything carry on.</P>
    <P>That is my complaint about oats. There was a reduction of 110,000 tons in oats last year.  There is a market that could be very easily filled if any attempt were made to sell the oats, but those gentlemen can depend on this position.  The farmers come along and say: &ldquo;They had to import oats; they are £25 per ton.&rdquo;  They grow oats but when they are grown the price is £5 instead of £25.  Farmers are entitled to the security of having that <Col N="222" /> market, which is there, placed at their disposal through an honest contract.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the attitude of our friends over there is on the butter question.  What did Deputy Dillon do, during the two periods he was in office, in connection with the surplus of butter?  Mark you, there was a surplus before he came in.  Did he do anything about it?  Here is Deputy Dillon's own statement on that, from Volume 106, column 2048 of the Dáil Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are subsidising butter production to the tune of £2,000,000 per annum.  How long will that go on? Do we expect butter to get dearer in the markets of the world?  Do we expect the time in the early future when the price of milk will become so adjusted that it will be possible to suspend this subsidy or do we intend to continue producing milk for conversion into butter in creameries at an annual cost to the taxpayer of £2,000,000 per annum?  I want it to go on record most emphatically that I think such a policy is sheer insanity and is purely pursued for the purpose of maintaining the prestige of incompetents in the offices of the Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is Deputy Dillon's statement in regard to the butter subsidy.  That was his attitude when he was outside looking in at Merrion Street, but he spent six years there since then.  That £2,000,000 a year subsidy was being paid in 1947.  There was no growling about it, only pay it.  When Deputy Dillon was in office from 1948 to 1951, he paid that subsidy every year and said nothing, except on one occasion when he offered us a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; a gallon for five years as a way out.  He was back again from 1954 to 1957 and he paid the subsidy.</P>
    <P>What is the use of putting £250,000 into an Estimate to send somebody over to England to sell butter at a price which would not leave the farmer 4d. a gallon for milk?  The only reason there is a milch cow in this country to-day is the price of our calves and the price of our stores.  If they were not there you would be eating bread without butter.  The Department sits <Col N="223" /> there and the only remedy it can find for this export subsidy is to say this year: &ldquo;Very well; we will pay so much of it, but the balance is to come out of an already uneconomic price being paid to the farmer for his milk.&rdquo; Are there any plans over in that Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am coming to.  Does this Book of Estimates show me how much is being paid for administration there?  In that, there is £250,000 for sending fellows over to England to secure over there that they will get 1d. more than 2/11 for butter. I suppose they will come back with a great success when they secure it.</P>
      <P>There is also a pretty hefty sum for the export of Grade A bacon to Britain. They exported 300,000 cwt.  Evidently the price on that was so bad that we had to subsidise it, despite the fact that the price of feeding barley is £10 10s. per ton less than the English farmer gets for it.  We will go into that later.  Is it on this article again we are to go off and spend £250,000 looking for a market?  Is any farmer prepared to produce Grade A bacon to-day at the British price?  If not, let us cut down on that, too.  That is the remedy, barring any definite statement of policy to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to discuss grain, I should like to make what I consider a fair comparison as between the farmer here, the farmer across the Border and <Col N="224" /> the farmer in Britain.  I think it is an honest and a fair comparison.  The farmer was told this year that he would get 37/- a barrel, that is £18 10s. a ton for his feeding barley.  Let us see what his brother across the water gets.  The following is taken from the <i>Guide to Farm Prices</i> issued by the <i>Farmer and Stock-Breeder</i>, May, 1957:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deficiency payments are here also paid on an acreage basis.  The guaranteed standard price is 26/2 per cwt. (on the old basis of including only lower priced barleys) for the 1956 crop and 29/- per cwt. (on the new basis of including all barleys) for the 1957 crop.  The difference between the guaranteed price and the United Kingdom average actual realisation price will be converted to an acreage basis and paid to all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There you have a difference, in the first instance, as between the £29 a ton paid to the English farmer for feeding barley, a guaranteed price; and the £18 10s. paid to the Irish farmer.  That is £10 10s. of a difference.</P>
    <P>We came up against this problem in dealing with the price of malting barley this year.  We came up against it in a rather serious way, because Messers. Arthur Guinness assured us that 60 per cent. of their stout manufactured in this country is made for export to Britain.  They also pointed out to us that the price their competitors in Britain were paying for malting barley, despite the fact that the English farmer gets his handover, is only 48/- a barrel.  They said: &ldquo;If we are to continue this export market and hold it, we must get the malting barley at the same price as our competitors can get it.&rdquo;  That was 60 per cent. of their requirements.  &ldquo;Otherwise&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we will have to get out of that market and that means that your contracts will fall from 600,000 barrels down to 250,000 barrels.&rdquo;  It was a fairly serious problem we had to face.</P>
    <P>We discussed with them what the price of barley for the home market, to produce the stout to be consumed at home, would be.  We came up against a situation where these figures proved very handy to us.  We said the British standard price was 58/- a <Col N="225" /> barrel.  That goes down as a basic price.  &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the British farmer is offered advantages besides that which, in my opinion, will have to be converted into cash.&rdquo; We discussed the other problems.  As a matter of fact, I made them a present of this little book to bring them up to date. On page 28 there is a thing called &ldquo;Fertiliser Subsidies&rdquo;, which is the subsidy paid to the British farmer for every cwt. of fertiliser he puts out. That was duly valued as between Messrs. Arthur Guinness and ourselves. I will read their statement on it:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We will be prepared to consider an addition above the &lsquo;standard price&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the standard price being the 58/- mentioned here&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;of 2/6 per barrel, which is based on the use of three cwt. of granulated 3.30.20, which is the most generally used fertiliser in compound drilling with malting barley.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, we took as our basis 12 barrels of malting barley to the acre and on fertiliser subsidy alone, therefore, the English farmer is 30/- per acre better off than his colleague here.</P>
    <P>The last page of this very handy document, page 32, contains the following statement:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ploughing up: £7 per acre for ploughing up grassland of at least three years' standing, between June 1st, 1956, and May 31st, 1957.  Inform A.E.C. within three weeks of doing the work.  The land must subsequently be sown to a tillage crop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They did not make that difference on a six-years rotation.  Here is the decision between Messrs Arthur Guinness and Son and the representatives of the Irish Beet Growers' Association Grain Committee on that:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We will be prepared to consider an addition of 2/- per barrel above the &lsquo;standard price.&rsquo;  This is based upon a ploughing grant of £7 per acre, which is spread over a rotation minimum length of six years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is 24/- an acre.</P>
    <P>We come then to the third problem, which was rather an extraordinary one, namely, that our colleagues, <Col N="226" /> across the Border, in Northern Ireland and, across the water, in Great Britain, pay no rates on their agricultural land.  Here is the decision on that:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Your committee submitted a figure of 2/10 per barrel as being the cost of rates to our growers.  Bearing in mind that there is complete derating of agricultural land in the United Kingdom we accept this and would agree that 2/10 is a reasonable addition to the above mentioned &lsquo;standard price.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To sum up, therefore, we would agree that the price of the &lsquo;home barley&rsquo; should be calculated at the British &lsquo;standard price,&rsquo; plus 7/4, for 1958.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, 7/4 a barrel on the 12-barrel basis works out at £4 8s. per acre. Add that to the £10 10s. per ton higher price paid to the British farmer than is paid here and you get a total of £20 18s. an acre by which the British grain growing farmer is better off than the farmer here.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we can come up to that, but I do say that, as between the 40/- barley bought last harvest&mdash; £20 per ton&mdash;from the Irish farmer and the £28 per ton at which Grain Importers, Limited, are now requesting that farmer to buy it back leaves gap enough to fill in and does not leave any gap sufficient to justify a reduction from 40/- to 37/- in the price of feeding barley.  The gap is there &mdash;£8 per ton and £20 per ton is rather sweeping.  I have discussed this with the ordinary grain buyers in the rural areas who have purchased barley and dried it.  Their estimate as between loss in weight and cost of drying is around 6/- a barrel.  There is no justification that I can see for the price paid for the barley to the farmer and the price at which it is sold back to the unfortunate pig feeder.</P>
    <P>With regard to wheat, the scheme adopted is, in my opinion and in the opinion of the farmers I represent, the worst scheme that could have been found.  We do not know whose brain-box evolved it and I do not want to say anything here about any organisation that stepped in or made a mess of <Col N="227" /> it.  I certainly do say that I do not see any justification for throwing overboard the ordinary tillage farmer here. There are two classes of farmers growing wheat to-day: there is the ordinary tillage farmer who went into wheat away back during the First World War and there are those who went into it since, because of Government propaganda and otherwise.  They have been growing a pretty consistent quantity of wheat.</P>
    <P>During the emergency, a considerable quantity of wheat was grown compulsorily and during the whole of that period we never grew 300,000 tons of wheat.  Where does the wheat come from now?  Who are the growers?  I suggest that the 75,000 tons of bad wheat were produced by the certain gentlemen about whom I am going to speak now.  It was produced by the gentlemen who refused to plough or, as they said, to ruin their good land during the emergency.  When this country wanted bread, these were the gentlemen who said: &ldquo;We will give you no bread.&rdquo;  These were the gentlemen who left us in the position that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had to stand up here as late as 1946 and state that he found grave difficulty in getting any wheat from anywhere, and the only thing he was able to buy was flour from Canada; that our dearly beloved brethren, the United States Government, had sent us over so much maize meal, which they considered good enough for the Irish people, and they wanted to know why the Irish people were not eating it.</P>
    <P>The gentlemen to whom I have referred are the gentlemen who are getting £3,000,000 odd for wheat.  That section of the community that owns 300 acres and 500 acres of land is composed of the gentlemen who sat down on their tails and said they would not grow wheat.  They were the men whom the present Minister had to threaten that he would break in their walls and go in and plough it for them. They did the bullock ranching at that time because it was the fattest and softest job they could find and the easiest way of making money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Two years ago, the price of the stores reared in the South went up as well as the price of beef and the boys sold the bullocks, but they were not prepared to pay the farmers in the South the increased price of the stores.  They brought in a tractor, or, rather than work themselves, got a contractor and let the land in 400 and 500-acre lots for the growing of wheat. English companies have come over here.  One company in particular bought 500 acres of land in Country Kilkenny, sold all the timber off it, ploughed it up and grew three or four crops of wheat in succession&mdash;what my friend, Deputy Dillon, would call mining it.  Having successfully mined it and drained whatever fertility was left in it, they divided it into 40 acre lots and resold it and bought another 200 acres adjoining.  They are now actively pursuing the same policy.</P>
      <P>That is the reason for the surplus of wheat.  It is not the ordinary tillage farmer who farms on the rotation system from year to year, but the gentleman who refused to plough when the people wanted bread who is producing the surplus wheat.  It should not be beyond the intelligence of the Department of Agriculture to invent a remedy for that.  There are several ways of meeting that problem.</P>
      <P>Messrs.  Arthur Guinness want some 700,000 barrels of malting barley every year.  They come out on the market and contract for that amount&mdash;no more, no less.  The Irish Sugar Company contract each year for an acreage of beet. There is a limit to that also&mdash;no more, no less.  It should not be beyond the intelligence of the Department of Agriculture to devise a scheme, even a contract scheme, on the same lines, to cover the requirements of wheat.  That is one way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another, far simpler, way of dealing with the matter.  Long ago, when we were mad to grow wheat, the Department of Agriculture introduced a scheme to give 2/6 bonus on every barrel of wheat produced.  Of course, they forgot to pay us for a long time. It was four or five years later that <Col N="229" /> they paid, but they succeeded in paying every farmer, five years after he grew the wheat, 2/6 on every barrel of wheat produced.  Where is the difficulty in the Department of Agriculture sending instructions to the millers, as follows: &ldquo;In 1947, you collected 200,000 tons of wheat grown in this country&mdash;100,000 tons less than we want now.  Take from each farmer now the same tonnage of wheat as he delivered then, plus 50 per cent., and let the new plantation which has come over here from John Bull find some other use for the 1,500 acres.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are two simple remedies by which no farmer who came to the rescue of the nation from 1939 to 1947 would be victimised now.  They are remedies which it is quite open to the Department of Agriculture to apply, if they wish to do it.  Why has it not been done?</P>
    <P>I think the Department's proposals in respect of wheat are wrong and that will change very severely the attitude of farmers who are growing wheat.  It is not so many years ago that the United States Government, having sent us maize meal, wanted to know why we did not eat the maize meal and not look to them for wheat.  Some of us have rather inconvenient memories.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the notes issued by the Department that the surplus of wheat last year amounted to approximately 95,000 tons.  I think something more than that is being budgeted for. I cannot imagine the mentality of a Department that imports wheat offals at over £1 a cwt.&mdash;I think it is £22 a ton at present&mdash;and sends out wheat at £18 10s. to £19.  There was never anything better for pigs than wheat. I remember a long number of years ago the weather was bad at harvest time and wheat started to sprout.  I went to the Department and Dr. Ryan, who was then Minister for Agriculture, had not the slightest hesitation in giving a licence for the conversion of the wheat into wheat flakes.  There was a considerable amount of it.  It was held for exactly 16 days when it was whipped up on the market.</P>
    <P>If members here have any great <Col N="230" /> doubt as to what will be done with our surplus wheat, again let us fall back on this booklet, &ldquo;Farm Prices and Grants.&rdquo;  According to this publication, the following is the standard ration in Britain for pigs: feeding wheat, 20 per cent; barley meal, 40 per cent; feeding oats, 10 per cent.; maize meal, 10 per cent.; wheat offals, 10 per cent.; fish meal, 5 per cent.; and soya bean meal, 5 per cent.  There is exactly 30 per cent. of wheat and wheat offals in the pig ration in Britain.  Why should the pig ration here for the next 12 months not be made up of the wheat which we are now sending out at from £18 10s. to £19 to Britain?  Is it in order to keep the boys at the ports busy that we are sending out good wheat and bringing in the skin of it and losing £3 a ton on it?  If I may borrow a word from my friend, Deputy Dillon, I would say that the policy is daft.  I see the Minister has mended his hand in this connection during the past week.  I can see no justification for sending out wheat at £19 a ton, whereas if you want to buy it here, it is £23.  I suggest to the Minister that the remedy for the wheat problem is that the farmers who grew wheat from 1939 to 1947&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not what I intend to say now.  The farmer who grew wheat from 1939 to 1947 is entitled to expect from any Irish Government that his crop will not be interfered with.  You should weigh in the scales the difference between that man and the man who refused to grow wheat during the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two subsidies to which I want to allude.  In regard to the subsidy on fertilisers, might I suggest to the Minister that he have a quiet chat with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and ask him to transfer that subsidy to where it should be, namely, the Vote for Industry and Commerce?  This is not a subsidy to the advantage of the farmer.  This is simply a subsidy to enable an Irish manufacturer to produce and sell at as cheap a price as his competitor across the water.  When you come to the <Col N="231" /> question of agricultural prices and the amount of free grants given to the farmer, I do not see why we should be saddled with what properly belongs to the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The other subsidy is that in relation to ground limestone.  A fairly considerable amount of money was given as a Grant-in-Aid by the American Government for this purpose.  Again it appears here for a number of years as a subsidy to agriculture which it was not.  Some of it might have been, but the bulk of it was not.  It was a subsidy to the incompetent C.I.E. organisation.  Ground limestone manufacturers down the country found themselves in this extraordinary position.  Although they owned their own lorries, transported the lime in their own lorries and spread it, on every ton of lime leaving their yards, they had to pay 7½ per cent. of the cost of the transport of that lime as a present to C.I.E. That has continued down through the years.  Perhaps we did not mind it so much when somebody else, the American Government, was paying for it.  Now that we have to pay it ourselves, might I suggested to the Minister that it is time the whole question as to the manner in which that subsidy is being expanded was examined carefully and dealt with fully?</P>

      <P>It has not been <Col N="232" /> considered necessary to give any specific instructions or to make any special arrangements for the examination of possibilities of co-operation with the Six Counties in economic, social and cultural matters.  The position is that, in the normal course of their duties, the several Departments concerned with such matters have, from time to time, occasion to consider questions of co-operation with the corresponding Departments in the Six Counties.  They are fully alive to the importance, in the common interest, of that co-operation.  Nothing new has emerged in that regard since the date of my statement in Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <P>Arterial drainage of rivers varies in its effect according to the local condition of soil, river flow and other factors.</P>
      <P>Measures taken in the interest of fisheries may have the effect of limiting the reduction of the spawning stocks to a shorter period.  Restocking from a hatchery will assist in the rehabilitation of the fisheries.</P>
      <P>A great deal depends on whether the river after drainage is so designed as to permit the reformation and retention of spawning beds and whether sediment will continue to affect fish flow adversely.  This cannot always be guaranteed.  Negotiations are in progress with the Board of Works to coordinate drainage and fisheries development more closely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy) Michael Joseph Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring last night to the fact that Deputy Larking spoke about home assistance.  No direction good, bad or indifferent, indirect or otherwise, has been given by my Department, by myself or by the Minister, in relation to the administration of home assistance. Home assistance is administered by the local authority and the amount they pay and practically everything else connected with it is their own concern.  In this connection it may be said that the amount paid out in home assistance in the latest year for which we have the information, the net amount apart from administration costs, was £633,570.  If one takes into account our contribution to other matters such as the fuel scheme and the footwear scheme, the net expenditure for the year was in the vicinity of £1,250,000.  Local authorities supplement many of the schemes for social welfare and the amount they spend on these matters is a question purely for the local authorities.</P>
      <P>There is no special investigation of the cases of recipients of unemployment assistance.  The normal reinvestigation goes on year after year. Officials of the Department are obliged to question whether a recipient, whether of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit is genuinely out of work.  This applies especially in the case of persons who have had no employment over a protracted period and who have a very poor employment record.  That has been the practice of the Department and it will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> Deputy Moloney said that social welfare officers hold inquiries into claims only when they have a cadre of recipients in a particular area.  That is not so.  Officials have special instructions to deal with every case as soon as possible.  Claimants or employers are frequently not available when the officer calls.  All claims for unemployment benefit or assistance or old age pensions are dealt with objectively by the officials and I commend the Deputy for his statement that a Deputy should not set himself up as judge and jury in every case. The social welfare code is there, the means test is laid down and the officers of the Department act in an unbiased fashion in administering the code.</P>
    <P>Deputies have no trouble where the applicant for an old age pension, widows' and orphans' pensions or for unemployment assistance has a genuine case, but what Deputies do is to apply themselves to getting borderline cases decided in favour of the applicant.  I knows that myself, having been a long time a Deputy, and I have done it myself.  Deputies fight the borderline cases and the proof of that, as stated by one Deputy during the debate, is that the percentage of those over 70 from the time the State was established up to the present day has risen from approximately 63 per cent. or 64 per cent. to 78.8 per cent.  That is the latest figure we have.  If there is a doubt, the official leans over all the time in favour of the applicant and the agitation is directed towards getting him to lean over still more in favour of the applicant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gogan referred to the recruitment of assistance officers.  He wants appointments made by the Local Appointments Commission.  That problem has occupied the minds of some of the Minister's predecessors and is engaging the careful attention of the Department.  The administration of home assistance is a very involved matter and we have stood for the principle that those administering home assistance should be whole-time officers and not Jacks-of-all-traders, rate collectors with occupations of their own and various other occupations, <Col N="242" /> people who spend only part of their time on the administration of home assistance.  We have urged strongly that what obtains in Dublin and some other places should be the universal practices, that the officer should be a whole-time employee of the local authority and devote his full time to the administration of home assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">

      <P>One of the conditions of appointments is a good, sound education and now, that vocational education is available to the poor man's son in practically every district, we are considering prescribing a better standard of education for those appointed than that which obtained up to the present.  Deputy Gogan referred to the social welfare courses for the working-man obtainable in Dublin and Cork and I am recommending to the Minister that should be taken into account in future appointments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a note of what the Deputy has said and we will try to correct that.  Deputy Larkin said that we spent more on the alleviation of suffering in animals, and on looking after animals, than we do on looking after human beings.  On reflection, I believe the Deputy will see that is a misstatement. We are dealing here with £25,250,000, out of a Budget for capital expenditure and ordinary expenditure of £110,000,000.  The total Vote for Agriculture is £9,500,000 and £2,750,000 of that is devoted to moving rocks and making land arable to produce food. A large portion of it is devoted to agricultural education, and the sum devoted to the eradication of bovine tuberculosis is necessary for the health of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of this part of Ireland are the biggest customers for our agricultural produce.  It is very necessary that milk and its by-products come from healthy herds and it is money well spent.  We who give out free milk and other things should see that the food we supply to country homes and <Col N="244" /> other institutions should come from healthy animals.  I think, on reflection, Deputy Larkin would not repeat that statement.  I do not wish to anticipate the Minister for Agriculture, beyond making the point&mdash;coming as I do from a rural area&mdash;that we will have to spend more than the £1,600,000 we are spending primarily for the health of our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin referred to social services in Britain and compared them with what we have here.  Deputy Sherwin is a new Deputy and he has a good national background.  I want to bring it home to him that the people of India, Pakistan, Egypt and Ghana who have got out from under the cloak of the British Empire, do not point to the fact that there are far better services in Britain, that they would be far better off under the Union Jack.  I would ask him to think on these things because these people valued freedom better than we.  As a nation, we have to cut our cloth according to our measure and we have not an empire to work and toil for us and give us big dividends.  We are a small nation and we are doing very well in the health services we give, both directly and through the local authorities.  I believe, and I am sure the Deputy believes, that the less the burden bears on the taxpayers, the more progress we will make.  We can come to a point where the last straw will break the camel's back and we are getting very near that point.  It is a point that has been taken into consideration by the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish asked for a statement on the scheme for the welfare of the blind.  The Board for the Employment of the Blind was set up by the Minister on 25th April, 1957.  It will operate a central workshop for the blind as a joint body on behalf of the local authorities, as provided for in the Blind Persons Act, 1920.  It is a permanent institution which will provide employment for blind workers from any part of the country.  The members of the board are: Mr. Archibald J. Robinson, who was chairman of the Richmond National Institution; Rev. C. Cottrell, O.C., Rector, St. Joseph's School and Home; Councillor D. <Col N="245" /> Larkin, T.D.; Alexander O'D Shiel; Mr. R.B. Eaton; Mr. Patrick L. Burke; Councillor J. Bermingham; Councillor William Walsh; Councillor Martin Quinn; Councillor William Ryan; Councillor Mrs. K. Nix; and Senator Gerald L'Estrange, for the general council of county council.  Mr. Robinson and Senator L'Estrange, together with Mr. Patrick L. Burke, have been appointed as trustees of the board.</P>
    <P>The Richmond National Institution closed down as from the end of December, 1957, and the Board commenced operations as from 1st January, 1958, when it took over the former Richmond workers.  The board carried on temporarily in the premises of the Richmond Institution, but has now acquired larger and more suitable permanent premises at Upper Baggot Street, Dublin.  The board transferred its operations to these new premises as from 1st April last and on the same date, took over the out-resident blind workers formerly employed at the St. Joseph's School and Home for the Blind, Drumcondra.  The board now employs a total of 60 blind workers.  A grant of £15,000 was made from the Exchequer in the year 1957-58 towards the initial working capital of the board and Dublin Corporation advanced the sum of £5,500 on account of its liability to the board in future years.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the existing workshop capitation grants of £40 a year will continue to be paid by the State and the appropriate local authorities in respect of existing and future out-resident workers, and the net annual expenses of the working of the board thereafter will be met by a contribution from each county council and county borough council in proportion to the rateable value of its area, subject to a limit of the product of a rate of one halfpenny in the pound.  That rate will yield a total of £25,600 per year and it is considered very unlikely that the working expenses will normally approach that amount.  Of the 31 local authorities, 27 have already agreed to this arrangement, some with minor reservations.  It is hoped to secure the agreement of the outstanding local authorities and to dispose of <Col N="246" /> the reservations shortly.  That is as far as I can give information about it.</P>

      <P>A tribute should be paid to the work of this board who take over responsibility.  I stated last night, and I want to repeat now, that it is the duty of an employer when he employs a man, let it be for a day, a week or a year, to demand that man's insurance card.  It is the duty of the employee, when he goes to work, to surrender his card.  If we had that principle accepted, we would have less trouble in the Department.</P>
      <P>I remember in the early 1930s, when the comprehensive social welfare code came in we had people crowding the labour exchanges registering for unemployment benefits of one kind or another who were not entitled to them. It took a long time to weed out the genuine cases from those who were claiming wrongly.  All the time we are up against the problem that we are human beings and the likelihood is that we may not always do the right thing.  That being so, there is this fraud about which so much was said in the debate.</P>
      <P>I was hauled over the coals here a couple of times.  It was repeated here the other day.  I am not going into any more explanations about it, beyond saying that it exists.  The figures are there.  Normally when we get a case of fraud and where money has not been taken out of the Exchequer and we detect it in time, we do not prosecute; and when there is a genuine pay back of what has been wrongly taken, we often do not prosecute.  We have no desire to pursue people.  Let me give some figures.  It consists on a scale which we cannot view with pleasure. The number of cases in 1955 was 676; in 1956, 1,706 and in 1957, 2,966.</P>

      <P>It would be a very small percentage, but it is enough to cause us a bit of a worry.  Let us take the approximately figure of 3,000.  That represents detected cases.  We do not say they occur in Cork City or in Dublin. When I used the word &ldquo;widespread&rdquo;, <Col N="247" /> I meant my own parish and my own county, as well as Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell you the most common case of fraud.  A man in a rural area buys 13 stamps at a post office for an expenditure of about £2 and he never works a day for the 13 weeks or works for himself.  He then proceeds to draw £80 out of the public funds until his benefits are exhausted. That is the type of fraud which I refer to as being the most prevalent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position we want to end.  Deputy Corish says that fraud can occur in every other Department.  It does, but when fraud occurs in other Departments, let the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party or the Independents expose it and we all say: &ldquo;Hear, hear!  It is time to end that.&rdquo;  There is unanimity in the House in putting down fraud, except when it comes to the Department of Social Welfare.  We want to create a public opinion which will cry down a condition of fraud in Social Welfare to the same extent as it is cried down in other Departments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the really poor man who does it.  It is the clever man who goes out, puts 13 stamps on his card and has the money to do it. It is not the really poor man who does it.  I will not go beyond that.  Everybody knows that what I am saying is the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Palmer referred to the economy with which the Department was run.  We are grateful for his co-operation in that.  The first time I <Col N="248" /> spoke since I had the honour of being appointed Parliamentary Secretary again, I paid tribute to the integrity, honesty and hard work of the Civil Service, 99 per cent. or more of whom will care, but then there is, like every other section of the community, a percentage of idlers who want two men to carry a file where one could do it. They are not going to rule the roost. If we have 2,800,000 people, it is not to their benefit to increase the Civil Service, because, when we increase the Civil Service and put a bigger burden on their shoulders, more have to take to the emigrant ship.  The cheaper we can run the Civil Service the better.</P>
    <P>When we deal with social welfare and social insurance, we are not like a limited liability company going out spending money on advertising, paying canvassers and competing in business with rival companies.  We are sustained by the State and are obliged by law to do certain things.  The cost is not, or should not be, comparable with that of a commercial company. It is all the better for the nation the more economically we run it.  If we have the co-operation of the people, the employers, the employees and the public representatives in running this honestly and above-board, without injuring any man in his occupation, then we will get ahead and we may be able to do better for the genuine applicants for social benefits.  I repeat that we have given no direction to anybody in the local authorities to be severe in regard to home assistance or anything else.</P>

There have been complaints about delays, but if we are to have oral bearings in every case, complaints will be much more numerous.  With regard to the delays mentioned by Deputy Brennan, I can assure him we will investigate them as quickly as possible.  Deputy Corish made a point about the free footwear scheme.  He made a useful suggestion last year and we passed it on to the local authority.  Our information is that many of them have acted on it.  We intend to see, as far as we can, that they will all act on it in the coming year.  There will be a particular date by which all applications shall be in.  These will be examined.  The most deserving cases will be picked out and there will be a reserve for anything that might crop up in the hard winter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin referred to children &mdash;that is how he described them and perhaps it is the right term for the members of a family who are mentally defective.  Our Department does not deal with that matter.  I have great sympathy for such people.  I hope I am human enough to have the same approach to the undergo as Deputy Larkin has.  However, it is not a matter for our Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the ground limestone subsidy.  I should like to suggest to the Minister now that, as this subsidy has to be paid directly by the people of this country in taxation, there should be a minute investigation into the manner in which <Col N="251" /> the money is being spent.  If it is to appear here as a subsidy to agriculture, I submit it should be a subsidy to agriculture, direct and not a subsidy to an incompetent transport service.</P>
      <P>The owners of ground limestone plant who take out the lime on their own lorry and spread it on the farmer's land should be paid directly from the Department. It is scandalous that from 7½ to 10 per cent. of the transport cost of every ton of lime taken out by a private owner of a limestone plant and delivered on the farmer's land must be paid as a fee to C.I.E. for the honour of taking it out.  An enormous amount of the money given by the American Government in this connection has in my opinion been misspent as the benefits did not go to the farmer but went, instead, to support C.I.E.  That should not happen.  I have had general complaints in regard to the matter.  I have raised the subject in this House repeatedly.  I consider it a grave injustice.</P>
      <P>I want to deal now with the farm buildings scheme and water supplies. The amount of the subsidy for that purpose this year is £713,536.  Again, I question whether that amount or a large proportion of that money should appear here as a subsidy to the agricultural community.  Where we have to subsidise any firm of manufacturers who bring blank iron sheets into this country and then turn them into corrugated iron, and who must pay an exorbitant figure for that raw material due to a cartel, it should not be passed on here and for that reason I think a great proportion of the subsidy for hay barns should appear in the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce and not here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount for the coming year which is to be paid to the Pigs and Bacon Commission is £650,000.  I find that the total amount of Grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; bacon exported was 315,000 cwt. Therefore, that represents a subsidy on bacon of over 40/- a cwt.  I do not think any advisory service or marketing service, for which we have quoted here a sum of £250,000 will get over that gap. Again, I suggest we should control production. <Col N="252" /> I am totally opposed to the policy of endeavouring to sell surpluses to foreigners at give-away prices.  We get nothing from foreigners at give-away prices.  I think that it is wrong and the subsidy works out at well over 40/- a cwt. in this connection.</P>
    <P>In regard to feeding barley, it is stated in the trade statistics this year that some 683,000 cwt. of feeding barley have been imported at a cost of £840,000.  That works out around 47/- a barrel for the imported material.  I am sure if our farmers got a little incentive in the shape of a better price there would be no need to import that barley.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister will be troubled after this year with any surplus wheat.  I admit that when the prices are not known until March and farmers have their land ploughed, they have no option.  But the ordinary small farmer, the man who grew the wheat during the emergency, will be compelled to get out of it for economic reasons.  He would not grow it at Deputy Dillon's price; neither will be grow it at the present Minister's price. It is an uneconomic price and there is very little good in pursuing it further than that.  Where it might pay a man with 500 acres to turn them over to wheat and have a clear profit of a £1,000 it would not pay the ordinary farmer with 30 or 40 acres and with ten acres under wheat to devote a quarter of his total acerage to making a profit of £20.  It would pay him better to go on the dole.</P>
    <P>What is required by the agricultural community at present is a definite agricultural policy covering a definite number of years so that we will know what the Government want us to grow and do not want us to grow.  It is very evident they do not want wheat.  It is equally evident, for a reason I do not know, that they do not want feeding barley.  If they wanted it, they would not be offering £18 10s. 0d. a ton.  It is also evident that they want no more butter.  On those commodities, at any rate, farmers have got to cut down.</P>
    <P>If the farmers must evolve a policy for themselves, it should be a definite policy of producing only somewhere <Col N="253" /> around 75 per cent. of your requirements. In that way, like the oats, you will be paid for what you grow.  Otherwise, you will not.  I do not agree for one moment with this idea of paying enormous sums for putting on the market a product which cannot be produced here at an economic price. What would be the price of milk at 2/11 per lb. for butter?  It costs 40/- a cwt. to market Grade A bacon in Britain.  There is no use in increasing production of milk if the increase means that with every extra gallon there is a further cut in an already uneconomic price.</P>
    <P>Farmers are entitled to a fair crack of the whip and I do not believe they are getting it.  I went into this matter as reasonably as I could.  I found that from 1951 to 1957, on the production of wheat and feeding barley alone, the farmer has dropped somewhere between £4,500,000 and £5,000,000 in the price he is getting for his product. On the other hand, during that period his rates have gone up by something like 14/- or 15/- in the £ and everything else he has to buy has gone up.</P>
    <P>As for this educational service, I was rather amused to read in the paper to-day about Senator Ahern's cows. Some genius made out that it was the grass produced from all those fertilisers was the cause of setting the cows crazy. In East Cork we have another way of putting that.  He was advised to get rid of those fertilisers and go back to natural grass.  Which is right?  If all the cows in the country are to go &ldquo;daft&rdquo; after these fertilisers, the farmers will be obliged to have a special insurance policy for milking them.</P>
    <P>I do not think it just or fair that we should have that reduction in the farmer's income at a period when the farmer's costs are steadily increasing. We come along with a glorious gesture and tell him he can go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for a loan. Is there any Agricultural Credit Corporation in Europe who would give the farmers the £4,000,000 a year by which their prices have been cut?  Look at the treatment meted out to other sections of the community.  We turn over the Estimates here and find <Col N="254" /> £400,000 and £500,000 being offered on a platter to some fellow to come in here and make hooks and eyes on condition that he exports them abroad. There is that treatment for one section of the community and this for another. It is neither just not fair to the ordinary farmer.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to come forward now and give us a definite agricultural policy.  Tell us plainly: &ldquo;We have too much wheat, we do not want any more, cut it down.  We have too much butter, cut it down.  We have too much barley, cut it down.&rdquo;  Let us know exactly where we stand instead of this attitude of penalising production. It is a wrong policy.  If another emergency arises we shall find ourselves back in the self-same position we were in in 1945, 1946 and 1947.  There is this difference, that we will not have the ordinary small farmer coming to the rescue and growing the bread for us.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the attitude of other industries towards agriculture. For the past 30 years, as long as I have been in this House, we have been listening to appeals here year after year for increased production, particularly in wheat.  In the Estimates each year, a large amount of taxpayers' money has been voted for research councils and so on.  Surely, during the past six years, the Governments should have known we were reaching a period when the farmers would produce our full requirements in wheat.  Why, then, have we the extraordinary position that the industrial and manufacturing people have fallen down on their side of the job?</P>
    <P>The enormous combination of millers and bakers say we cannot have an all-Irish loaf but must be satisfied with what is not an all-Irish loaf.  I would advise Deputies interested in this to look up the official Dáil reports for 1946, when this country was crying and begging for bread from foreign nations. Look at the replies received then and compare that with the present situation. It is extraordinary that all Irish wheat produced a satisfactory loaf in 1946 and 1947 and cannot do it now.  I am relying on the published statements made here by the then Minister for <Col N="255" /> Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass.  It was in the Official Report, if anyone wishes to read it.  That was good enough for the Irish people in 1946, and we have spent a few million pounds since on research and standards, so surely we should be able to finish the job.</P>
    <P>We paid £3,400,000 from January to December last for foreign wheat to feed the Irish people and £3,500,000 more for animal feeding stuffs.  That is £7,000,000 which should be the property of the Irish farmer.  He has not got it and evidently he is not going to get it.  If there is to be a revision of policy in that direction, we should demand a revision of policy in other directions as well.  We have no intention of subsidising the production of fertilisers.  If the market is not there for us, the market is not there in fertilisers for Gouldings either.  If we have to cut down on production, I suggest the Irish farmers' first cut should be on fertilisers and then he will have less and a smaller surplus to suffer a cut in price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister this morning and his statement took only ten or 15 minutes.  He is in full control of the Department and is the accepted adviser of the Government on agricultural policy.  I remember that in 1948, I listened to him speak for four hours on agriculture, when he was in opposition and was not adviser to the Government.  To-day he is satisfied with ten or 15 minutes and even then he did not go very deeply into the policy of the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry, who has just finished, said that the policy of the Minister and the Government on agriculture is &ldquo;daft.&rdquo;  Could anyone imagine a very prominent supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party, a man recognised as in the running for the position of Minister for Agriculture, stating here that the policy of the Fianna Fáil Minister and Government on agriculture is &ldquo;daft&rdquo;? That is the greatest condemnation that could be uttered of this Government. If it came from me or some other Opposition member, one would say it <Col N="256" /> was biassed and antagonistic to the Government and that it did not see the good points in the Government's policy.  Coming from a Deputy who has been here for many years, a prominent spokesman of the Government, it seems very strange.  That is his opinion and I have no doubt it is the opinion of many farmers.  If the Minister's speech were made 12 months ago, we would have accepted it, as he would have been only two or three months in office and would have been bringing in an Estimate prepared by his predecessors and could not be expected to make many material changes in a month or two.  However, after 12 or 15 solid months in the Department, one must expect something more than we had this morning.</P>
    <P>Since the present Government came in, prices in general have increased substantially.  The cost of living has gone up by nine points.  Bread, flour, butter and other things have increased in price.  Other sections of the community&mdash;the workers and others&mdash;have been compensated during that time for those increases.  The cost of living increases must have borne equally on the farmers as on other workmen, business men, company directors and civil servants. Only recently civil servants were granted by the Minister for Finance an increase of £250,000 to cover increases in the cost of living brought about by the deliberate action of the Government in removing the subsidies in the Budget of 1957.</P>
    <P>The only one who has not got compensation is the farmer.  Indeed, instead of getting compensation, he is being asked to stand a reduction in four very important items&mdash;wheat, barley, butter and pigs.  It has been suggested that, in order to balance the Budget this year, the Minister called on the creamery suppliers to take a reduction of 1d. per gallon for milk so that he might have £1,000,000 more in the coffers of the State.  The farmers have to stand that.  Instead of getting an increase, as other sections did, they had to make a contribution towards the Budget.</P>
    <P>There was, too, a cut in the double byre grant.  When that was first announced, <Col N="257" /> the Minister thought to push that over on his predecessor.  He did not know then that the precedent was established here that, if something is brought out in public here and there is a file in the Department dealing with the matter, that file must be produced. In this instance, the file was produced and it was clearly shown that the Minister's predecessor had nothing whatever to do with the matter.  It was solely and simply the action of the present Minister, in consultation with his Government.</P>
    <P>No wonder there has been a reduction of 10,000 in the numbers working on the land in the past year.  If the farmers are not given the money to enable them to employ labour, how can they be expected to increase employment? In answer to a question last March, the Taoiseach stated there was a reduction of 10,000 in the numbers working on the land.</P>
    <P>There has not been one word about land reclamation in the Minister's speech.  That was one of the greatest boons ever brought to this country.  It was due to Deputy Dillon but, being known as the Dillon Plan, that was enough to damn it in the eyes of the Minister and his Government.  He did not say one word to-day about land reclamation, and land reclamation has been responsible for the enormous increase in agricultural production.</P>
    <P>Last year, there was a great deal of flag waving during the Budget debate. It was stated that £250,000 had been allocated by the Government for the purpose of finding new markets for agricultural produce.  To-day, 12 months later, we find that a mere £900 has been spent.  That money could have been put to good advantage in finding markets for surplus agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>Last January, the Minister announced a reduction of 5/- per cwt. in the price of pigs, to take place in July next.  Were it not for the fact that his predecessor had made a stipulation that farmers and pig producers should get six months' notice that reduction would have taken place immediately. At the moment the price of pigs has gone up considerably.  Not so long ago, there was a very big difference between <Col N="258" /> Grades A, B and C bacon&mdash;in some factories, 60/- to 80/- per cwt. People sold pigs about ten stone in weight and the most they received for them was about £10.  It was impressed upon them that they must produce Grade A bacon.  Grades B, C or X were not wanted.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the farmers must think of the position of the bacon industry at the moment.  They were told they must produce Grade A bacon, that they would ruin the industry if they did not.  We could not export Grades B and C.  Now, when there is a demand for bacon, the people producing pigs are getting practically the same money for Grades A, B and C. A friend of mine who sent a considerable number of pigs to the factory within the past week received 240/- per cwt. for Grade C bacon.  The Department should have some control in this. They are the people who should direct the marketing of this bacon, and it is not right for the Minister to advise, on the one hand, that one must have Grade A pigs only and Grades B and C will be cut very substantially when, in a few months, the demand goes up and one gets the same price for Grades B and C as one gets for Grade A.  It would appear that it is demand that controls the position, and not quality.</P>
    <P>If the price of Grade B pigs is pushed up, then the price of Grade A should be pushed up as well to ensure that producers would continue to aim at producing Grade A bacon.  There is no purpose in producing Grade A pigs, whether by reducing the feed in the last fortnight or something else when he gets the same price for Grades B and C.  A few months hence, if there is a surplus of bacon, we shall have the same procedure again.  What the markets want is a regular supply of a good quality graded article, irrespective of whether the demand is small or good.</P>
    <P>We had a very big surplus of wheat this year.  I put the blame for that on the Government.  It is they who created this surplus by discouraging the production of feeding barley.  Deputy Corry has dealt fairly extensively with that, but I think I should follow him a certain distance.  The first year this <Col N="259" /> Government came into office, they cut the guaranteed price of feeding barley by 3/- per barrel and, instead of getting 43/- for barley bushelling 23, one got only 40/- for barley bushelling 20. Although the requirements of barley were not met in full last year, the Government have adopted the same approach this year and there is a further reduction in the guaranteed price of barley.  This year it is down to 37/-, and that is 37/- for barley bushelling 20, a reduction of 10/- per barrel under this Government.</P>
    <P>What do we find?  At the present time, Grain Importers Limited, are charging close on £3 per barrel for feeding barley to the farmers and pig producers.  Now, £3 per barrel at the moment is no good to the barley grower.  He wants the price when he is cutting the barley, in the harvest time. Very few farmers have the way or the means of carrying over their barley crop into the Spring.  It is an advantage to Grain Importers Limited to get that price now, but there is no point, in my opinion, in cutting down one year after another on the price of barley.  The Minister should have continued his predecessor's price and, if a surplus was produced, there might then be some point in having a reduction. We have not had a surplus in barley for a number of years and we have had to import other feeding stuffs to fill the gap.  It is hard to understand that policy.</P>
    <P>One of the first acts of the Government in their first Budget was to increase the price of butter by 7d. per lb., thereby reducing consumption. According to the Minister's statement, we are the second largest consumers of butter in the world.  The Government is trying to make us a much larger consumer of margarine than of butter and at the moment, when there is a glut of butter all over the world, we have to export much more butter than we would in the normal way, had the Minister not interfered with the subsidy.  The Irish consumer of butter was not subsidised to the extent of 7d. per lb. but the English consumer is now subsidised by the Irish taxpayer to the extent of over 2/- per lb.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> This year, for the first time for many years, the guaranteed price for wheat was withdrawn.  Up to this, the farmers knew, when sowing the wheat, the price they would receive when it was harvested.  That guarantee has been withdrawn by the Government. The farmers will not know that price they will get, until the Minister or his officials make an estimate of the likely yield in July.  That is a very bad principle.  If the Government feel that there is too much wheat in the country and that a reduction is necessary, they should make the decision early in the year and not wait until farmers have sown the crops.</P>
    <P>We do not want to see again farmers having to crave somebody, having to go to the millers or brewers with samples of barley.  We did that long enough.  It was a grand thing for the farmers to have stability of price and to know that they could sell their crop.  They should not be put back in the old position of having to go with their samples to this one and to that one, to give a hand-over here and a hand-over there to get their barley accepted.  It is coming very like it when that guarantee has been withdrawn. The farmers have to tolerate weather conditions and many other things.  The crops may not be coming on as they should be.  At least, they should be promised a guaranteed price when the crop is ready for marketing.</P>
    <P>This year, the sheep trade has suffered a set-back.  The Government have allotted so much money for the promotion of markets and it is felt that they should try to recapture the market which existed some years ago in France for the export of lambs and thereby stabilise the price of lambs on the home market and stabilise the price of sheep.  This Government seem to be complacent in every respect and do not seem to be bothering about markets. They are very lucky that the price of cattle has held and is rising, but that is no thanks to the Government.  The Government would not bother as to whether the price went up or down.  In spite of all the reductions the farmers have had to suffer in respect of wheat, barley, butter and pigs, there has been an increased tax on machinery.  The <Col N="261" /> farmers have had to subsidise the manufacture of machinery in this country and to pay out of their reduced prices this year for the purchase of new machinery.</P>
    <P>Exports of agricultural produce have risen from £39,000,000 in 1947 to £90,000,000 in 1957 and the Minister should direct his Department to look for markets for sheep or lambs in France at the present time.</P>
    <P>The National Farmers' Organisation over the past few years have started to improve marketing of cattle by opening auction marts.  That has been done at very heavy expense and in a very enterprising way all over the country.  Having tried to improve marketing conditions of cattle, they find that they are not allowed to use their own lorries to bring cattle to the marts.</P>

      <P>I will put it to him but I want to get the support of the Minister for Agriculture when I do put it to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The mart committees are being hampered every day by people inquiring who brought in the cattle and what lorries were used.  In Kilkenny, if one wants a C.I.E. lorry, one has to bring it 30 <Col N="262" /> miles from Athy, where they are based.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have gone a bit far on the point, but all I am asking the Minister is to advise the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  A creamery can send out its own lorry to collect milk and to return the skimmed milk.  Likewise, special permission is given for the collection of wheat at harvest time to wheat assemblers to use their lorries and employ lorries to bring in wheat.  The same should apply in the case of cattle being brought to and from marts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give stability to the farmers.  The farmers have proved their worth over the past ten years.  There were 16 years of Fianna Fáil Government up to 1947 and <Col N="263" /> the exports of agricultural produce at that time stood at £39,000,000.  Since the change of Government, since a new outlook was brought to agriculture, these exports increased to £90,000,000. I would ask the Minister, if he has any policy, to frame that policy and to give it to us when he is concluding.  The main thing is to give stability to the farmers so that they may know, when they are sowing, what price they will get when the crop is harvested.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister was quite pleased in making the statement this morning that he had increased his Estimate by £2,500,000 as compared with 1957-58.  Looking <Col N="264" /> over the Estimate, I find that it falls very far short of the Estimate away back in 1952 when the total amount voted for Agriculture was £13,621,000. The value of money has decreased enormously over that time and no other Estimate shows such a reduction over that period as the Estimate for Agriculture.  In looking at the Book of Estimates one would think that agriculture was not really as important an industry as we all claim it to be.  The amount of money voted, while it may show an increase this year, is relatively small compared to the Estimates under other heads and compared to what it was in 1951 and 1952.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the decrease in the amount of money allocated for agriculture the farmers have succeeded in producing £90,000,000 worth of our exports out of a total of £131,000,000.  If figures count for anything that should be sufficient to make all of us realise that the future of this country depends on what the Irish farmer can produce.  It is up to us in this House to see that he gets every encouragement and every protection.  There is no use in shouting here or in shouting down the country: &ldquo;Increase production&rdquo;, unless there is a sound marketing system to cater for our agricultural produce. This greatly increased agricultural production cannot be brought about without increased capital expenditure. The lack of capital was the great drawback all down the years.  No matter what Deputy Dillon may have said here this morning about the necessity for capital, I have no doubt that if more capital were thrown into Irish agriculture all down the years, we could compete with any country in the world with our agricultural produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must realise that we cannot have capital development without credit, especially for the small farmer.  The change over which is taking place needs a tremendous amount of capital.  If a man is to buy modern machinery, it means the investment of at least £1,000 or perhaps up to £2,000 in some cases. Unless he is able to procure that money at a reasonable rate of interest and is assured of a ready market for his produce afterwards, we cannot expect much progress.  I appreciate <Col N="265" /> what is being done by the new marketing committee.  I hope for the best and that the Minister will help them to secure the markets so essential to us all.  If we can market our produce in any country in the world, even at a subsidised rate, we shall be doing a good job of work.</P>
    <P>From the figures for artificial insemination last year.  I notice that the shorthorn breed of cattle is very much on the downward trend.  Of the total number of cattle inseminated, 351,539, only 87,505 were of the shorthorn type. The production of beef is a far greater attraction nowadays than the production of milk and the breeding of Herefords and blacks holds a greater future than the production of milk.  I come from an area which is a traditional dairying area and where the shorthorn breed of cattle thrived all down the years.  They are looked upon as the mother breed, so to speak, of the whole cattle population of that area.  I would be very sorry indeed if the shorthorn breed of cattle were to lose their importance as the foundation cattle of this country.  In most areas, for producing milk and producing a good store, it is very hard to beat the good type of shorthorn cow.</P>
    <P>When I speak of the good type of shorthorn, I do not mean some of the breed which came in from England and which did not give such satisfactory results.  I speak of the old breed of shorthorn cow, the older breed which was developed and kept by our ancestors down the years.  It produced a good deal of milk and it was a good store beast, whether it was a polled Angus or a Hereford.</P>
    <P>With the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, I can foresee a great scarcity of this very valuable breed in my area.  Should they become so scarce that there will not be sufficient numbers of them, I wonder where our future cattle exports are to come from. I am sure the vast majority of our cattle exports are bred from the shorthorn cow.  Whether they are Hereford or Polled Angus, they are the foundation in the dairying districts and everything possible should be done to maintain that breed.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht did bring in a scheme, <Col N="266" /> Scéim na Muc, for the Gaeltacht and before the eradication of bovine tuberculosis is completed in the poorer areas, the Minister for Agriculture will need to do something to preserve the foundation stock of this country, the shorthorn cow.</P>
    <P>Deputies from other areas may not see eye to eye with me in this respect. They are more interested in the all-out dairy breeds, but if we went all out for the dairy breeds three years ago, our Government to-day would be faced with a far greater problem than they are faced with in subsidising our butter exports in the English market.  We are very fortunate that we did not lose our heads and go all out, as we were advised to do by many men in high positions, for the all-dairy breeds which were to flood the English markets with butter in the same fashion as we drowned them in eggs.</P>

      <P>A Milk Costing Commission was set up several years ago to inquire into the cost of producing a gallon of milk.  The report of that commission was published several months ago, but the extraordinary thing about the report was that seven of the eight members signed a document repudiating any confidence in that report.  They decried the truth of the whole thing at a time when the dairy farmers were expecting an increase for their milk.  I do not know if that went home forcibly to the dairy farmers, but it was published in the <i>Irish Press</i> and the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> at the time, that those men did not stand for the truth of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, I was very sorry that the Minister did see fit to reduce the price of milk knowing as I do that no farmer has yet made profit out of milk production.  I know from experience, and from my childhood days, that if the production of milk <Col N="267" /> was paid for, having regard to the man hours entailed, they would be very much at a loss.  The production of milk by the farmers in the county from which I come is not carried on for the sake of the milk alone.  There are other factors which govern it.  It has been traditional for generations to produce milk, to produce pigs, poultry, turkeys and eggs.  Unfortunately, we have to rely on those small sidelines to maintain a reasonable standard of living which, indeed, is very moderate and very low compared with the standards in other societies.</P>
    <P>I know that when our esteemed Bishop of Cork goes down to West Cork he always strikes a very strong note on the subject in that area.  When he goes to other areas, South Cork or East Cork, where there is good land, he does not speak in the same terms. When I speak as a West Cork man, and when Dr. Lucey speaks in West Cork in those terms, I think they are words that should be considered in the light of the manner in which they are spoken, because they are applicable really to those congested areas and do not apply to the other areas where big farmers can make a living in a different fashion.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to understand the great difference that exists between the different areas.  One would need to travel to realise the vast differences in the ways of making a living in the various parts of the country.  Reducing the price of milk at this time, when the cost of the bovine tuberculosis scheme is going to be a great burden on the small farmer especially, will have a serious effect on those who are trying to eke out a mere existence on those small dairy holdings.  I hope the Minister did not take the milk costings which were turned out by the Milk Costings Commission too seriously and base his prices on that report because other technical experts who went into the figures had no hesitation in saying that the cost of producing a gallon of milk was 1/10.</P>
    <P>I said before, but it is no harm to say it again, that what is necessary for our agriculture is a long term policy, <Col N="268" /> if it can be brought about.  In framing such a policy it is necessary to talk with our customers abroad, in France, Britain, Scotland and Wales.  If they can assure us that they have a market for our products I have no hesitation in saying that in the next ten years we can again double our production of these products as we did over the last few years.  The farmers are not geared to full production.  They are afraid to do that lest prices would slump when increased production came on the market.  That happened in the case of pigs, eggs and turkeys and in the case of practically every commodity except cattle.</P>
    <P>We should concentrate therefore as much as possible on increased cattle production for the export market and we must base those exports on dairy cattle.  The trade is too valuable to risk cutting the price of milk because, when we do so, we lose the confidence of the dairy farmers and we lose the cattle population which is so vital to our economy.  Without exports we cannot import, as otherwise we could not balance our payment.  Fortunately that balance was achieved this year through our cattle and I hope that balance will continue.</P>
    <P>In West Cork we had a very flourishing industry some years ago, the flax industry.  I see that the acreage has dropped to an insignificant figure.  The flax industry brought more wealth in its time into my constituency than many another industry although some Deputies may not be familiar with it. It is unfortunate that such an industry has been allowed to dwindle and eventually die.  If the Minister for Agriculture would confer with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I think some good could be extracted from such an industry.  The raw material is produced in soil which is very suitable.  We can produce the best flax in Europe in my constituency, but the mils are now idle; so are the ponds, and most of the men who made a profitable living out of flax have emigrated. Before the art of growing flax and saving it dies completely, some serious step should be taken by the Government to develop an industry based on flax as its raw material.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> Deputy Briscoe is returning from America with plans for some industries one of which, I am informed, is chewing gum.  I do not know where he will get the raw material for that but we can produce the raw material for the great industry of making good Irish linen from Irish flax.  This would give good employment in rural Ireland if the matter were tackled seriously and if Government finance were forthcoming, or even if outside interests were induced to support it.  We hear much talk about capital from America, Holland and elsewhere but if we can get capital from an Irish linen industry it will be a great asset to West Cork and will help to maintain a declining population.  I hope something will come of this because the tradition and the skill are there and the anxiety to live in their native place is still deeply enshrined in the hearts of the people of the area.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have any reason to become excited over our butter exports.  We produce less than 50,000 tons of butter altogether and 35,000 tons of that, I presume, are consumed at home.  I am glad we can afford that; I am pleased that we are the greatest butter-eating population in Europe because we can get no better food.  The amount of butter we have for export is negligible.  Possibly we can send 7,000 or 8,000 tons to feed our fellow-countrymen in the North and the remainder goes to Britain.  I feel that we should not lose our head about that. <Col N="270" /> Instead of reducing the price of milk by a ld. a gallon, I would strongly recommend the Minister to increase it by a ld. and so give an inducement to dairy farmers to increase the production of milk, cattle and pigs.  I would also ask him to guarantee such prices that poultry-keepers producing turkeys for next Christmas will at least get a reasonable return for their labours.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The past year,&rdquo; said the Minister, &ldquo;has seen a further rise in agricultural production and exports.&rdquo;  How delighted we should be at that, but some people seem to think it is a burden to have this extra production. I could not agree with Deputy Corry who advises the farmers to reduce production because if they do, the same thing will happen as happened in regard to potatoes and every other commodity the production of which will be reduced.  It happened with pigs. It is far better for every section of the community to have prices stabilised. It is no use getting £13 per cwt. for pigs to-day when we got only £8 a month ago.  What we want is more stability so that when we invest our money in any line of agricultural production we will be assured of a reasonable return for it.</P>
