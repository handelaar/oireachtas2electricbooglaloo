      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I must invite the attention of the Deputies to my reply to a question on the same subject which was addressed to me in this House on the 5th June last.  What I then said applies now both to the Ministers who were at that time in office and to the two Ministers who have since been newly appointed: namely, no Minister holds any position that could reasonably be regarded as interfering, or being incompatible, with the full and proper discharge by him of the duties of his office, such as a company directorship carrying remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, perhaps, right that I should add, however, that, as the culmination of work which was begun by a Minister over two years ago&mdash;that is, about a year before his entry upon office as a Minister&mdash;a certain private company was formed and recently registered.  In the Articles of Association of that <Col N="3" /> company, the Minister was named as one of the first directors.  He has, however, resigned from that position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I inquire whether the Taoiseach has seen the report published in the daily papers on last Thursday to the effect that a certain business establishment in County Donegal gives the name of a citizen, &ldquo;N.T. Blaney&rdquo;, as director? Can the Taoiseach say whether the person so named is the present Minister for Local Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to what establishment the Deputy refers. I made a statement in answer to the question put down that a certain private company was formed as a result of work done about two years ago and that one of the Ministers was mentioned as a director and that he has since resigned.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>Between mid-February, 1957 (the nearest date to March for which data are available) and mid-November, 1957 (the latest date for which figures have been compiled) the national average retail price of flour increased by 3/1 a stone and the price of bread increased by 4½d. a 2 lb. loaf.  These increases accounted for a rise of 3.16 points in the Consumer Price Index (base: mid-August, 1947=100).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the percentage increase in the cost of living caused by the Budget of (a) 1952 and (b) 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain (thar cheann an Taoisigh) Donnchadh Ó Briain (thar cheann an Taoisigh)">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain (thar cheann an Taoisigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The increases in the retail prices of bread, household flour, butter, tea and sugar between mid-May and mid-August, 1952 were responsible for a gross rise of 7.1 points in the Interim Cost-of-Living Index (Essential Items) to base August 1947=100 and this was equivalent to an increase of 6.2 per cent. on the mid-May 1952 figure.  (b) The increases in the retail prices of bread, household flour, butter, tobacco, cigarettes, beer and petrol between mid-February and mid-August 1957 were responsible for a gross rise of 5.0 points in the Consumer Price Index to base August 1947=100 and this was equivalent to an increase of 3.7 per cent. on the mid-February 1957 figure.</P>
      <P>These increases cannot be taken as entirely attributable to budgetary changes as it is not practicable to segregate precisely the effect of Budget changes from other variations between the dates of the inquiries.  The Interim Cost-of-Living Index was not affected by changes in indirect taxes in the 1952 Budget, since such items as drink, tobacco, etc., which are included in the Consumer Price Index, were not covered by the Interim Index.</P>

      <P>With reference to parts (a) and (c) of the question I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the percentage change between mid-February and mid-November, 1957, in the prices of the items entering into the Consumer Price Index.  Mid-February is the nearest date to 1st March for which such figures were compiled and mid-November, 1957, is the latest date for which they are at present available.</P>
      <P>With reference to part (b) of the question I propose to circulate in the Official Report a second statement showing the national average retail prices of certain items of food in mid-February and mid-November, 1957.  In the case of the other items in the Consumer Price Index no attempt is made to obtain quotations for an identical quality of the different articles in all areas and, therefore, any average prices computed would not be meaningful.  The correctness of the percentage price changes is ensured by the fact that at each source the identical article is as far as possible priced at consecutive inquiries.</P>

      <P>It is estimated, on the basis of the present Consumer Price Index and the previous cost-of-living index numbers, that the quantum of goods and services which could have been bought retail for £1 in mid-February and mid-November, 1957, would have cost 8/- and 7/8 respectively in 1938.

      <P>The law requires that bread shall be sold by weight only and not by measure, and if bakers adopted the practice referred to by the Deputy they would not be contravening the law provided they did not misstate the weight of the loaf.</P>
      <P>A purchaser of bread may ask the seller to state the weight of the loaf and it is then open to the purchaser to have the loaf weighed by the local inspector of weights and measures.  If the weight so ascertained is less than the weight represented by the seller proceedings may be taken against him.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the Ceann Comhairle's permission, to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.  Under the provisions of Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1923, the Revenue Commissioners are empowered to require an employer to deduct arrears of income-tax from an employee and to pay it over to the Accountant-General of Revenue where the tax is charged on the employee under Schedule D or Schedule E and where it is more than three months in arrear.  I am not aware, apart from a few isolated instances, that the obligations imposed by the section are resented by employers.  A collector of taxes has power under Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1924, to institute court proceedings for the recovery of income-tax, and in appropriate cases action is taken under that provision rather than under Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1923.</P>

      <P>I do not think it necessary or desirable to introduce such a system of licensing as is envisaged in the resolution in question of which I have seen reports in the Press. It is unnecessary to introduce such a system of licensing because the principal distributors are well known to the trade and to my Department and it is undesirable to do so because this, in my opinion, would have the effect of weakening the sense of responsibility of the actual seller which is the best protection against the sale of objectionable publications that the public can have.</P>

    <P>The attention of the Land Commission was drawn to the amount of lands unallotted in this and some other counties and suitable action is being taken.  The selection of allottees is governed by Section 31 of the Land Act, 1923, which sets out the various classes of allottees to whom advances may be made.  The following order of <Col N="37" /> priority operates:&mdash; displaced employees, evicted tenants, uneconomic holders within one mile of the estate, <Col N="38" /> migrants, trustees for communal purposes, and other categories.</P>

      <P>There is no turbary on hands in the townland of Raheenbar. A scheme has been approved by the Land Commission for the provision of turbary facilities in Lenavea for some 130 families from the district, but its operation must await the completion of the extensive and costly development works in connection with such a project; the necessary funds have been sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is only the first step towards the provision of turbary for deserving tenants in this part of County Mayo: <Col N="39" /> further measures to provide turbary on bogs already on hands or in course of acquisition will be taken as circumstances permit.</P>

      <P>Acquisition statistics are kept on a county basis and I am unable, therefore, to furnish separate figures for West Limerick as requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The position for County Limerick as a whole is that four offers of land for forestry purposes with a total area of 174 acres were received in 1957 and in addition an area of 68 acres was offered on an exchange basis.  One offer involving an area of five acres has been received so far in 1958.  All of these cases are at the preliminary investigation stages.</P>
      <P>As regards immediate acquisition prospects in the county, the position is that possession is about to be taken of an area of 197 acres, offers have been accepted and the legal formalities are being completed in the case of six areas with a total area of 1,566 acres and negotiations are in progress for the purchase of 17 further areas with a total area of 1,370 acres.  Acquisition of forestry lands in 1957-58 totalled 649 acres in County Limerick.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) All training courses in 1st Western Battalion are conducted solely through the medium of the Irish language.  A Young Officers' Course, at present in progress in the Military College, is also being conducted solely through the medium of Irish.</P>
      <P>(b)  All lectures given in the Cadet School, the Military College, are conducted through the medium of Irish, but instruction given to cadets in technical subjects (i.e., at the Artillery School, etc.) is conducted mainly in English.  A recent refresher course in the Military College for officers in platoon weapons was conducted mainly in the Irish language and partly in the English language.</P>
      <P>The training courses conducted in 1st Western Battalion are given to both officers and enlisted personnel. The training courses in the Cadet School, the Military College, are given to cadets, and other training courses in the Military College are given to officers.</P>
      <P>The courses are carried out at the Military College, Curragh Training Camp, and in the 1st Western Battalion in Galway.</P>
      <P>The current method of imparting instruction was adopted in the 1st Western Battalion from its inception over 30 years ago.  In the case of the Military College, instruction to cadets was mainly through Irish during the period from 1935 to 1940, but, during the emergency and since, instruction was through English.  The present system started in January, 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of the instruction in the 1st Western Battalion have always compared favourably with those obtained from instruction in English.  At <Col N="51" /> this stage it is not possible to compare fully the results in the Military College with those obtained from previous courses, but the staff of the college believe that instruction given through the medium of Irish will be as effective as in English.  When Irish was used as a medium of instruction in the college previously the results were satisfactory.  The only course completed in the Military College since January last was the platoon weapons refresher course and the results were satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Minister's reply correctly, if one leaves out the Western Battalion whose courses were always done in Irish, the other courses are purely for cadets and officers.  If that is so, will the Minister explain what purpose is being served if the men are not undergoing these courses and if they do not know Irish what is the object in having the officers' work done through Irish? Secondly, is the Minister in a position to give an assurance that the prospects of promotion among officers are not going to depend on proficiency in the Irish language?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary&mdash;the object is eventually as far as possible to expand the use of Irish to other ranks in the Army.  I have already corrected a misstatement with regard to the question of promotion. I have already made it quite clear that the promotion does not depend on a knowledge of Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister making it quite clear in his recruiting campaign, which I understand is taking place at the moment, that it is expected of the private now going into the Army that he will have a working knowledge of the Irish language?  In view of the fact that pressure has been brought to bear on the officer personnel to speak Irish, is it made clear <Col N="52" /> in the recruiting campaign that those who wish to join are expected to have such a knowledge of Irish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, in view of the fact that a tremendous programme is being brought into operation to revive Irish amongst the officer personnel, it is appropriate to suggest that a similar programme be brought into operation so far as those who join the ranks are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Soldiers joining the ranks are expected to have an education up to the standard of the primary school leaving certificate and they would obviously have that standard of Irish.  It is hoped that the officers will be able to improve their standard of Irish while in the Army.</P>

      <P>The three-minute minimum is in accordance with international <Col N="55" /> convention of long standing. We would only cause needless difficulties for ourselves without any compensating advantage by raising the minimum period as suggested.  The question of increasing the minimum charges would also arise.</P>

    <P>The Vote on Account is an annual feature of our financial system and, as the name implies, represents a provision on account&mdash;usually a four months' provision&mdash;towards the cost of expenditure on the Supply Services <Col N="60" /> during the next financial year.  The four months' period covered by the Vote on Account is normally adequate for the House to consider the individual Estimates and to pass the Appropriation Act.</P>
    <P>The Vote on Account is based on the detailed estimates of public expenditure set out in the Volume of Estimates for the year 1958-59, which has recently been circulated.  The amount of the Vote on Account I am now asking for is £36,500,000, that is, roughly one-third of the total Estimates for the Supply Services, 1958-59.  The items covered by the Vote are set out on the Order Paper.  As Deputies are aware, the Dáil grants supply only for the service of a particular financial year and consequently moneys granted by the Central Fund and Appropriation Acts are available for use only in the year for which they are granted.  In order, therefore, that Government services should not be without finance after the 31st March, it is necessary for the Dáil to pass the Vote on Account.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Estimates Volume, Deputies will have noted that the total of the Estimates for the Supply Services for the coming year is £110,002,220. Last year the total of the Estimates in the Volume came to £112,570,620. Revised Estimates subsequently passed to take account of the abolition of the food subsidies and other matters, brought this total down to £106,196,620 but the addition by way of Supplementary Estimate of £2,023,000 mainly for the increases in social assistance payments granted to compensate for the abolition of the food subsidies put it up again to £108,219,620.  Compared with this latter figure the 1958-59 total shows an increase of £1,782,600 and when capital items are segregated, the provision for non-capital services shows an increase of roughly £500,000.</P>
    <P>While the variations as compared with 1957-58 will be apparent from a perusal of the Estimates Volume, it may be helpful if I refer briefly to the major changes which are revealed.  I shall do so without distinguishing between capital and other items, except <Col N="61" /> to refer to items not hiterto described as capital.</P>
    <P>The chief increases are in the Estimate for Agriculture which is up by over £2,500,000.  As Deputies will observe, an additional £1,115,950 gross is being provided next year for the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme.  When account is taken of receipts from the sale of cows slaughtered under the scheme the net additional sum for which provision is made comes to £489,250.  I know that Deputies on all sides of the House will welcome the decision to provide additional moneys for this scheme and will lose no opportunity to impress upon those directly concerned the desirability both in their own interests and in the interests of the country of co-operating to the fullest extent in the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  The allocation in the American Grant Counterpart Special Account from which expenditure has been recouped in recent years is now exhausted.  As the expenditure is necessary to preserve our productive capacity and external earnings power, and must be concentrated in a short period of years, it is proposed to treat it henceforth as a capital item.  The amortisation arrangements attached to &ldquo;capital services&rdquo; provide for redemption of the relevant borrowing over a period of 30 years.</P>
    <P>The amounts provided for the subsidisation of bacon and butter exports are up by £580,000 and £734,000, respectively, as compared with the original provision for the current year. As Deputies are aware, however, from the Supplementary Estimate for Agriculture which is at present before the House, substantial supplementary sums will have to be provided in the current year in respect of bacon and butter exports.</P>
    <P>Losses arising from the disposal of surplus native wheat by export and by sale as animal feed, etc., require the provision of an additional £650,000 next year, while an extra £140,000 is being sought in respect of grants for the pasteurisation of separated milk.</P>
    <P>A lump sum provision of £250,000 in the current year as a grant-in-aid of <Col N="62" /> the marketing of agricultural produce does not require to be repeated in 1958-59.</P>
    <P>The use of ground limestone continues to increase&mdash;it has risen from 75,000 tons per annum to a current figure of about 1,250,000 tons&mdash;and the indications are that farmers now fully realise the beneficial effects which accrue for its use.  The scheme by which ground limestone was delivered free to farmers was one which up to this had the benefit of American Grant moneys.  These were exhausted in the course of 1957-58 and subsidy could be continued at the full rate only with heavy recourse to the Exchequer.  In these circumstances, it was reasonable to expect farmers to make a modest contribution towards the delivery costs.  Despite this contribution, the net charge to the Exchequer in 1958-59 will be up by £270,000 as compared with 1957-58.</P>
    <P>The provision for the farm buildings scheme and water supplies shows a reduction of over £140,000 which, however, is attributable in the main to over-estimation in the amount provided in the current year.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for Industry and Commerce, sub-head J (1) shows a reduction of over £1.9 million, being the amount paid our during the period in 1957-58 when flour and bread subsidies were in operation.  On the other hand the provisions for Industrial Grants, in sub-heads O (4) and Q (1), show a combined increase of £100,000.  It will be observed from the Capital Services Summary at the front of the Estimates Volume that the provision for these grants will be treated as a capital service in the coming year.  They, in fact, constitute part of the new capital invested in industrial production.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for Transport and Marine Services the amount provided for C.I.E. shows an increase of £358,000 as compared with the original provision for 1957-58.  A Supplementary Estimate for £2,000,000 was, however, necessary in the current year and, when account is taken of this, the provision for C.I.E. shows a decrease of £1,642,000.  Last year's figure included <Col N="63" /> an exceptional non-recurrent provision of £803,000 for repayment of a temporary advance and also various capital payments which will not arise in 1958-59.  As is explained in a footnote to the Estimate, next year's provision is intended to be adequate to enable C.I.E. to pay all interest on Transport Stocks without seeking any advance from the Exchequer under Section 30 of the Transport Act, 1950. The provision for the G.N.R. shows a reduction of £345,000 as compared with the original provision for this year. Savings of £185,000 are expected in the current year, thus reducing the decrease to £160,000.</P>
    <P>In the Vote for Aviation and Meteorological Services an extra £264,000 is being provided for constructional works, etc., at the Shannon, Dublin and Cork Airports. Telephone Capital Repayments in the Vote for Posts and Telegraphs show an increase of £100,240.  The Estimate for Social Insurance shows an increase of £596,000 as compared with the original provision for the current year but if account is taken of the Supplementary Estimate for £872,000 which has passed the Dáil, the provision shows a reduction of £276,000. This reduction is partly due to the fact that the influenza epidemic which occurred in the course of the current year resulted in abnormally high payments of disability benefit and partly to the expectation that the recent improved trend in unemployment will continue.  The provision for Social Assistance shows a small decrease of £1,000 when compared with the original provision for the current year plus the Supplementary Estimate which was necessary last week in consequence mainly of the increased rates in certain Social Services following on the abolition of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>The post-war backlog of private housing has now been worked off and applications for grants for private housing have fallen.  The amount required for this purpose in 1958-59 is down by £700,000.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Estimate shows a net <Col N="64" /> reduction of £36,450.  This does not mean a reduction in forestry operations. The acreage planted in 1958-59 will, in fact, show an increase and an additional £50,000 has been provided for the acquisition of land but, thanks to various steps taken to promote efficiency and economy, a reduction in the total cost has been found possible.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for Defence the provision for defensive equipment is reduced by £164,134, while in the Estimate for Public Works and Buildings £161,200 less than in the current year is provided for new works, alterations and additions.  The provision for supplementary agricultural grants is down by £140,000 because the current year's provision was based on estimated rates which, in the event, proved to be too high.</P>
    <P>I think that is sufficient as a general indication of the changes shown in the Volume of Estimates for the Supply Services for 1958-59.  I ask the Dáil to agree to the Vote on Account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we come to discuss details arising on the Book of Estimates which has been circulated by the Minister, there are one or two matters to which we might draw attention.  In the first place, I regret that the Minister informed the Dáil on 12th February, and has confirmed now, that he did not propose to segregate the taking of the capital and current Budgets.  The House is aware that that is a change in the administrative procedure which I proposed to initiate last year and which I was prevented from initating by the general election. However, I think it was a change that, without any regard for political loyalties, was welcomed by people on all sides of the House at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had too little time devoted to the consideration of our capital position.  It is quite inevitable that if the capital Budget is presented at the time when the current Budget is presented at the end of April or the beginning of May, the proposals of whatever Minister for Finance may be there at the time for current purposes will far outweigh in interest the proposals there may be as to the capital to be spent and the manner in which that <Col N="65" /> capital will be raised.  The provisions that are made in any Budget for current purposes touch the immediate future of every individual in a much more intimate way than the capital provisions do and it is natural enough that interest will tend to focus on the current rather than on the capital Budget.  It would, therefore, have been wise this year for the Minister, particularly when we were not faced with any other administrative difficulties due to an election, to have adopted the plan to segregate the two.</P>
    <P>The Minister must also be criticised severely for the fact that he has not published the Capital Investment Committee's Report which he acknowledged he had received some time ago.  I do not know the date on which the Minister received that report but I do know that he admitted in this House on the 12th February last that the report had been received.  It would have been highly desirable if the report and the views of that committee, to whatever subject they were directed in that report, had been available for the members of this House when discussing this Vote on Account.  That does not necessarily mean that either this side or that side of the House would have accepted the views but, before coming to conclusions on the first of the stages set for the coming financial year on financial policy, it would have been desirable when the views of this committee were available that they should have been put openly before the Dáil and, indeed, before the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Vote on Account is usually the first indication that the House and the country can get, with the publication of the Book of Estimates, of the intended financial and economic policy of the Government.  One of the things that is particularly noticeable is that the secret, to which Deputy Norton on a previous occasion referred as the best kept secret of modern times, the policy of Fianna Fáil, does not emerge even in this Book of Estimates or in the speech that the Minister has just made.  In fact his speech was confined solely to a factual recital of certain arithmetical figures which we could all have taken out, and most of us have <Col N="66" /> already taken out, from the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>Whether people liked the economic policy which we put into effect in 1955 and 1956, is not the point I want to make now.  Whether they liked it or not, it was perfectly clear that the policy we embarked upon at that time was one that ran through all the measures we put to the Dáil then.  The policy was designed, of course, to ensure that, as a primary objective and as a first essential, we would achieve a balance in our external payments, a balance which in fact was achieved in the financial year ending 31st March, 1957.  I mention that now merely to stress that the policy adopted in relation to bank interest in December, 1955, the Book of Estimates published in February, 1956, the Vote on Account that was taken in March, 1956, the Budget, and the levies in July, 1956, was all part of a cohesive and coherent policy.  It was possible from any one of those to know exactly the financial and economic policy upon which we were then set.  No such possibility arises from consideration of this Book of Estimates.  No such possibility arises from any consideration of the speech that has just been made by the Minister for Finance or any other speeches that he has made in recent months.  It is unfortunate that that is so because it means that the House and the country as a whole are still left in the dark as to what is the economic and financial policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>The second main criticism I want to make in relation to this Book of Estimates is that it is the publication of the self-confessed failure of the present Minister.  I was not quite able to follow the figures which he mentioned in relation to non-capital services but I will take the figures as they appear in the Abstract of the Book at page xv.  The Minister will remember that in his Budget speech at column 947 he admitted that food subsidies were at that time running at something over £9,000,000 a year. In cutting out food subsidies&mdash;in defiance, let me add, as the Taoiseach is sitting next to him, of the promise that was made by the Taoiseach at <Col N="67" /> Belmullet during the general election and by the Tánaiste at Waterford&mdash; the Minister saved £9,000,000 a year, not for the current year but £9,000,000 for a full year.  There were compensatory social welfare benefits given to the extent of £1.95 million in the current year and, though I have not seen the exact figure at which they were estimated for a full year, I think I am not being unfair to the Minister if I say that £1.95 million for a part of the year is the equivalent of £2,500,000 for a full year.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  It means that the Minister had by reason of the action taken by him in the last Budget £6,500,000 by which the non-capital portion of this Book of Estimates should have been reduced and that, if it is not reduced by that amount, the Minister for Finance has frittered away all the benefits that would have arisen or could have arisen to the Exchequer and of which he spoke last year at Budget time.  It means that, notwithstanding all the real hardship which the decision he took in the Budget involved, the Exchequer benefit that could have been anticipated to come for the coming year has now gone.  It is perfectly clear from the Minister's own phraseology, the Minister's own statement, that there was to be £9,000,000 saved in the full year to be offset by, say, £2,500,000 on social welfare, a net reduction of £6,500,000&mdash;a course which, I might add, was taken by the Minister notwithstanding the fact that it was liable to jeopardise, and has in fact jeopardised, stability in relation to prices and wages which was clearly so very desirable for the national economy.</P>
    <P>We warned the Minister at that time that there was the gravest danger that his action would jeopardise that stability and events that have taken place since, and even questions answered by the Taoiseach to-day in relation to prices, have made it perfectly clear that the warnings we gave at that time have been fully justified and have in fact, unfortunately, demonstrated that what we then suggested would come to pass has come to pass.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> Where do we find ourselves?  In relation to the £6,500,000 by which the Minister should have been able to reduce current Estimates, on page xv of the Abstract we find there is a net decrease of £1,700,000 as set out in the Minister's own publication and, if we turn back to the Summary of Capital Services in the earlier pages, we see that in relation to Capital Services there is a decrease of £478,000.  That decrease of £478,000 is included in the decrease of £1,714,000 on page xv and one may accordingly say that roughly the decrease in current services on the figures published by the Minister is approximately £1,250,000.  The figure is actually £1,236,000.</P>
    <P>There is more than that.  There is something which the Minister tried to gloss over in his speech a few months ago; he has taken three services which were previously met from current account and he has transferred those services from current account to capital account.  I know very well the ballyhoo there would have been had I done that. The welkin would have been made to ring with accusations that I was plunging the country into debt; that I, instead of paying for things when payment fell due, was putting them on the &ldquo;never-never&rdquo; system.  We all know the dishonest propaganda disseminated by Fianna Fáil in relation to other items in that respect.  If these three items, which total no less than £1,534,000 on current account, had been transferred by me to capital account I can visualise Deputy de Valera and Deputy Dr. Ryan on these Opposition Benches almost breaking the furniture in their indignation at my action.  We would have been treated again to the spectacle of Deputy de Valera stamping out through the door in his annoyance at my temerity in doing such a thing.</P>
    <P>The present Minister has done it and, in so doing, he has faked the current as against the capital account to the extent of £1,534,000 as compared with and in relation to the position that obtained 12 months ago.  The three items to which I refer are M (11) in Vote 26, £884,000: O (4) in Vote 50, £200,000 and P (1) in Vote 50, £450,000, making a total of £1,534,000.  We see, <Col N="69" /> therefore, instead of having the saving on current account that a frugal Minister for Finance would have of £6,500,000, when one takes that transfer of services from current to capital account and takes into account at the same time the £1,250,000 deduction on the face of the general abstract, in fact current services for the coming year are up by £300,000 instead of being down by £6,500,000.</P>
    <P>I can imagine what great joy it would give to the members of the present Government if they were on this side of the House now and in the position of being able to criticise me in that respect.  The fact is the Book of Estimates shows the failure of the Minister for Finance to grapple with the problem.</P>
    <P>Let us turn now to some of the reductions that have been made in relation to capital services.  Where are they?  There is a reduction in Vote 9 for new works, etc., under sub-head B of £130,746.  What do we find when we look at the details?  From where does that reduction come?  That reduction is a reduction offset by certain small increases in other respects, but it is a reduction that comes primarily from a decrease in the amount that the Minister is proposing to make available next year for new schools of £174,000.</P>
    <P>We have heard from time to time in this House and during the general election campaign what great things the Fianna Fáil Party would do in relation to new school building works, what great things they would do in relation to speeding up the building programme, what great things they would do to ensure that people would be put back in work on building programmes without delay.  What do we find in this Book of Estimates?  All that has happened in that respect is a reduction of £174,000 on the amount that will be made available through the Department of Education for school building in the next financial year.  The Minister has already referred to the reduction of £700,000 in private housing grants.  The Minister and the Taoiseach again and again in this House hurled allegations at us <Col N="70" /> when we were in Government because we were not providing sufficient money for housing.  But the first Book of Estimates that the Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance present to the country shows a reduction of £700,000 for direct housing grants in the Department of Local Government Estimate and, let me emphasise it, a reduction of £27,000 in the Estimate for Gaeltacht housing&mdash;sub-head F (1).</P>
    <P>How will these reductions help the building trade?  How will these reductions ensure that the various promises made by the present Ministers during the general election campaign will be carried out?  Remember Deputy Lemass speaking at Castlecomer on 24th February, 1957:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The new Government must at once stimulate employment by the institution of a capital investment programme designed to put men to work, to put wages into their pockets so that these wages will be spent in the shops and so that the whole national economy would get a boost.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What do we find?  In relation to building, we find £174,000 less for building schools and £700,000 less for ordinary housing grants.  Even in relation to the West, we find a reduction of £27,000 for Gaeltacht housing.</P>
    <P>As I am dealing with specific promises made by Deputy Lemass speaking in Castlecomer during the last general election, I might perhaps take advantage of this opportunity to refer to a speech made by the present Minister for Lands here in this House on the Adjournment Debate before last Christmas.  In that debate the Government had been challenged that there was no sign whatsoever of the £100,000,000 plan that had been advocated by Deputy Lemass on an earlier occasion when he was in opposition. The Government was challenged before Christmas with the absence of any move in that respect.  We said then, and I repeat now, that the proposal put forward at that time was put forward as a specific policy of Fianna Fáil designed for the purpose of catching votes.</P>
    <P>When that case was made in the House just before Christmas, the <Col N="71" /> Minister for Lands said that the proposals were ideas for consideration and did not constitute an official political policy.  Since then I had the opportunity of checking some of the speeches made by Deputy Lemass, as he then was, in relation to those plans.  It shows perfectly clearly, beyond any question of doubt, that they were not the proposals indicated by the Minister for Lands but were a policy then adopted by the Fianna Fáil Party deliberately for the purpose of ensuring that by so doing they would represent the policy we were putting into operation as a wrong policy and that, if only they were given the chance, they would do all these things.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, speaking at Graiguecullen, Carlow, on the 11th of November, 1956, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He had published, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, proposals for a full employment policy designed to secure that in five years capital investment would be extended until jobs were available for every boy and girl leaving school as well as absorbing those unemployed at present.  These proposals still stood.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;on the 12th November, 1956, mark you&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and represent Fianna Fáil's idea of how national affairs should be conducted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I notice we have not got Deputy Medlar in the House at the moment. It was partly as a result of that speech that Deputy Medlar was returned to this House as a Deputy for Carlow-Kilkenny. Perhaps he will get up in the course of this debate and explain through this House to the people who voted for him in 1956 how it was that the policy, on foot of which votes were asked for him, has been thrown overboard.  Let me say quite frankly: thank God it has been, because it was the most lunatic proposal ever made by any public man who should have been responsible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass went on in Graiguecullen to add another thing which was not true.  As it was in the same speech, it might be as well to correct it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In addition they (Fianna Fáil) <Col N="72" /> had set up the National Development Fund which they had financed out of current revenue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass should have known the facts, or if he had not known, he should not have been so reckless as to say something so obviously untrue. That was not the only place in which Deputy Lemass suggested that the proposals were in fact the official Fianna Fáil policy.  He went down to Edenderry and, speaking on behalf of Mr. Kieran Egan, as he then was, Deputy Egan now&mdash;again I notice Deputy Egan is not here either&mdash;Deputy Lemass said, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i>, otherwise <i>Pravda</i> of the 23rd April, 1956:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil had published proposals for a full employment policy. They were the only proposals which had been made and nobody had attempted to show any serious defect in them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us be quite clear that they were the official policy of Fianna Fáil, designed for the purpose of catching votes and now happily thrown overboard but let us not adopt the dishonest substerfuge the Minister for Lands adopted just before Christmas in trying to pretend that they were not the policy at all.</P>
    <P>Let us go back again to the capital services summarised in the front of this Book of Estimates.  We find not merely is there the reduction of £700,000 in housing grants to which I have referred, but, in addition, that there is the complete elimination of grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, except for a figure of £50,000 obviously for the purpose of tidying up outstanding liabilities.</P>
    <P>The antipathy of Fianna Fáil to that work has been long known.  This scheme was not designed by them.  It was put through this House by the late Deputy Tim Murphy, Lord have mercy on him, when Minister for Local Government, and it was put through in the teeth of the fiercest opposition from the Fianna Fáil Party.  Up and down the country wherever one goes, one can see benefits that have accrued to local areas as a result of the work done under that Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> I shall not suggest for a minute that some mistakes were not made in relation to drainage work done under that Act.  There was not a single measure passed through this House in respect of which there was not some mistake made in the administration of it.  But I do say, and say it without challenge and fear of contradiction, that there was more good work done under that Act for the purpose of making land adequately productive than has been done under very many other schemes throughout the country. Quite apart from anything else, were it not for the fact that the grants were available under that Act, there would be innumerable cases in which land project work could not be done at all because there would not be the outfall to get the water away from the fields and so ensure that the land project work could be done.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating the retention or the putting back of those grants for the employment content they gave alone, but because I believe that what was needed in respect of that work was proper supervision.  Further supervision may have been necessary, but it is quite clear to me, and I think will be clear to every unprejudiced member of the House, that there was, and is, a clear need for some type of drainage work between the large scale arterial drainage, on the one hand, and the field drainage carried out through the land project, on the other.</P>
    <P>As far as these Estimates are concerned, and as far as the Vote which the Minister for Finance has asked the Dáil to pass is concerned, nothing will be included for those works.  That decision is a pity and one which will not assist production in the future. Perhaps this is a detailed matter we might discuss more on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture itself, but I would like to know clearly what will happen in cases&mdash;and I have many in my own constituency&mdash;where the land project people cannot do the work until the outfalls are cleared as they were cleared in respect of other minor rivers in earlier years under the Local Authorities (Works) Act?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the reason <Col N="74" /> for the reduction of £163,000 for farm buildings was over-estimation in the current year.  I hope the Minister does not think that we are altogether so naïve.  Is it not quite clear that the reason for that reduction is because the Minister for Agriculture has cancelled the double-byre grant for those who, outside the intensive areas, are prepared to go in for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis?  We all know that the Minister has made that change and we all must accept the fact that when the double grants have been cancelled the amount to be paid out of the Exchequer will be less than if they had been retained.  It is altogether too naïve to expect us to believe that the reason that farm building grants are down is because of over-estimation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture when he was making that announcement stressed the fact that he had substantial lists of applications for such grants on his books at the moment.  If the Estimate for the current year is not being fully taken up, would it not be a good plan if the Department of Agriculture woke up and hurried up on the many applications for grants for farm buildings that are on its files and that have not been dealt with because of the policy of delay?  If there is more money than is necessary how is it that Deputies are getting regularly, in their daily post, communications from constituents asking them to request expendition in the payments of grants by the Department of Agriculture under this scheme?  How is it that if there is a real desire to deal with this problem adequate steps are not now being taken to deal with this during the coming year?</P>
    <P>The double-byre grant is given to those people outside the intensive area who are prepared to take part in the accredited herd scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  It is the only inducement to those outside the intensive areas to undertake that work and to proceed with it and that inducement is now being stopped by the present Government.  In so far as there is anything additional in the Book of Estimates for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis it is most heartily <Col N="75" /> welcomed by this side of the House but it is a bad example of blowing both hot and cold that the only inducement outside the intensive areas has been deliberately ourtailed by the Minister for Agriculture and the present Government.</P>
    <P>If I may digress for a moment from capital to current saving in the Department of Agriculture, I notice that the Minister for Finance proposes to provide £18,000 more this year for the salaries of civil servants in the Department of Agriculture and to provide £5,000 more for the travelling expenses of those civil servants.  Curious as that is, more curious still is the manner in which the provision for ground limestone has been manipulated so that there will be £282,000 less available for ground limestone next year than during the current year.  The Taoiseach may well raise his eyebrows because I am going to remind him of a speech he made just on the eve of the general election.  Speaking on the 24th February, about a week before the general election, in his own constituency of Ennis, he is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We must get the farmers to bring the soil to proper condition by the use of ground limestone.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the ways in which it is now proposed to do that is the imposition of a transport charge of 4/2 and a proposal to provide £282,000 less than the amount provided for ground limestone in the current year.  That was not just a case of the Taoiseach speaking in Ennis, off the cuff, and without having thought about this matter.  The Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis was held in November, 1956, and in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 21st November, this appears:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Stressing the need for increased agricultural production, Mr. de Valera said that if Fianna Fáil were returned to office they would do everything they could to extend the application of limestone to the land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Everything they could&rdquo; apparently means a reduction in the amount to be made available this year to induce the farmers to take it and also the <Col N="76" /> imposition of a charge for transport. In case there might be any thought that the Taoiseach might feel that the <i>Irish Independent</i> had misquoted him in that respect I should like to take the opportunity of reading a sentence or two from his own newspaper of the same date:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we are the Government again, there is one thing I will promise and that is that everything we can do to push this ground limestone for the land we will do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach, when he comes to speak, will explain to this House and to the country exactly what is the meaning of the word &ldquo;promise&rdquo; in that context.</P>
    <P>We had some discussion on another occasion and we shall have some discussion also to-day on a part of Vote 26 &mdash;that part of Vote 26 which deals with the production of those products which are so urgently needed at the present time and which the farmers have been producing in such good measure during the current year and without any thanks to the present Government.  Before I deal with that matter may I say that I have seen in the newspapers a report that the Taoiseach is receiving a deputation to-morrow from the National Farmers' Association?  I do not know whether it is true or not, but if true, I suggest that the Taoiseach before he does so, would take advantage of the opportunity of looking again at a speech made by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, which he broadcast on February 26 last, when he suggested that &ldquo;a Fianna Fáil Minister would keep in constant touch with farming organisations.&rdquo;  That was one of the things held out by the Minister when he was seeking the suffrages of the electorate almost on the eve of the poll.  If the Taoiseach has any doubt about that being in the Minister's broadcast he can ask the Minister now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I said earlier I could not find in the course of an examination of this Book of Estimates any indication of the policy of the Government.  I want to repeat that, unless there is the indication given by the Minister for Agriculture across the House the other day when he said, in relation to question dealing with the price of milk, with a recrudescence, I thought, of an old mood of his: &ldquo;The farmers have their cows and they have got to milk them anyway.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one takes the actions of the present Government in recent times and compares those actions with some of the things that Government members have said when seeking votes, it is easy to see why people, regardless of political creed, have no faith whatsoever in the approach of this Government to any of the national problems. Where are we going to-day in relation to agricultural production?  The price of wheat, as we all know, has been cut. It is not necessary for us to go back <Col N="78" /> over the discussions we had the other day, but there are a few questions I should like the Taoiseach to answer when he speaks later in this debate. For example, I should like him to say why Senator Cogan, then a prominent member of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; and, shall I say, a prominent speaker on behalf of Deputy Dr. Humphreys who is listening to me now, a speaker who aided very much in returning Deputy Dr. Humphreys to this House in the last general election&mdash;got up at Rathoe on February 24 and said: &ldquo;The first task of the new Fianna Fáil Government will be to restore the price of wheat to what it was when the late Deputy Walsh left office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy Dr. Humphreys will explain to the House in this debate how it is that he allowed his main speaker in Carlow to make that promise for him if he was not prepared to fulfil it.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will explain how it was that Senator Cogan, then a member of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Oireachtas, made that spech if he had not heard the same promise made behind closed doors&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite evident that Senator Cogan was not speaking for himself on that occasion but for the Fianna Fáil Party as a whole.</P>

      <P>I take it the Minister does not accept any responsibility for speeches made outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must accept responsibility for what he has in the Book of Estimates and one of the things he has in that book is a change in that regard.  But if the Minister would rather that I should quote for him his own broadcast in which he said that the wheat price cut was &ldquo;cruel and unjust&rdquo;&mdash;that was on the 25th February&mdash;I am quite prepared to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to <Col N="79" /> remind some of the Deputies over there of a speech made by Deputy Lemass at Abbeyfeale on October 31st, 1955.  It shows the hollowness of the criticisms that were made by Fianna Fáil at that time.  When they were in opposition they were prepared to say anything that they thought would suit regardless of any responsibility they should have had as an Opposition.</P>
      <P>Speaking at Abbeyfeale, Deputy Lemass said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is a striking commentary on the Coalition's management of affairs that the price of bread should be going up as the price paid to the Irish farmer for wheat is cut&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In fact, the only difference about the thing was that at that time the price of bread did not go up&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The loaf went down instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of bread and the size of the loaf remained exactly the same in 1955 when Deputy Lemass was speaking.  We now have an entirely different situation.  We all know that the price of bread has been going up while the price of wheat is coming down.  But in relation to all these general questions of prices it is difficult to reconcile many speeches that were made, but it is most difficult, perhaps, in the case of the Minister for Lands, who said on November 21st, 1956:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that one of the biggest problems was to convince farmers that if they produced more, prices would not come down disastrously.  If Fianna Fáil came into office they might offer a large price for wheat and further inducement to barley growers in an effort to stimulate production.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>But the Minister and his colleagues were not content merely with the announcement in relation to wheat which they made recently, but they have brought down the price of barley by 3/- per barrel with an additional penalty clause for moisture content in excess of 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that was not enough on the agricultural <Col N="80" /> front we have a matter to which the Minister for Finance made some reference before.  We have an official reduction by the present Government of the floor price for Grade A pigs of 5/- a cwt. on the prices that were in operation before the present Government took office. Quite apart from that reduction in relation to Grade A pigs, anybody in the country knows that it is virtually impossible to get anything near the Grade A price for Grade B pigs. Although there is a 5/- reduction per cwt. in relation to Grade A pigs, 50/- would probably be nearer the reduction in relation to Grade B&mdash;somewhere about that.  It is difficult enough to get them bought at any price if they do not qualify as Grade A.</P>
    <P>That is a peculiar contrast when set opposite two speeches made by the present Minister for Finance during the Carlow-Kilkenny by-election, speeches designed to get support for Deputy Medlar, as he is now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>He did very well and anybody would do well if he were prepared to go out and use the false propaganda that the Minister for Finance was prepared to use: &ldquo;The reason pig production had dropped was that the farmers thought they were not getting enough for them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Deputy to know that I did say in that speech that one of the good things Deputy Dillon did was to bring in a pig scheme.  I always give credit where it is due.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has interrupted me to that extent because I want to add the rest of the quotation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The easiest course to remedy this would be to reduce the farmers' costs.  Since the Coalition had come into office they had driven the price of bran and pollard out of reach of the farmer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is ture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What has the Minister <Col N="81" /> done in relation to bran and pollard?  Perhaps he would like to go back again to Hacketstown and explain that to the people in Hacketstown or perhaps he would like to go back to Glenmore, Kilkenny, where he spoke on the following Sunday, and explain that he did not really mean all those things he was saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that when he got into office and got the chance he would throw everything overboard in the way that he has suggested.</P>
      <P>I was going to refer to another matter about which the Minister was pretty vocal in other parts of the country but I shall spare his anxiety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall spare him and his colleagues because they organised a campaign and they are now being hoist with their own petard.  Everyone knows that the campaign in relation to the Milk Costings Commission, while Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, was a campaign organised from Fianna Fáil.  Everybody knows now that Fianna Fáil are getting the results of their own campaign and no one can have any sympathy for them for what they are receiving.  What we do realise is the danger there may be to our basic production, the danger that there may be to the whole live-stock industry, the danger that there may be to the necessary eradication of bovine tuberculosis by 1960 or 1961 as a result of a foolish and intemperate method which the Minister has adopted.  These are matters that will affect the national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members on this side of the House will read without any reminder from me but I would advise every member of Fianna Fáil to read the statistical information that was given by the Taoiseach on 20th February, 1958, in replies to questions, columns 597 onwards.  It will be seen that £45,000,000 of our exports in 1957 were due to live cattle; £2,700,000 due to frozen beef and veal; £3,243,000 due to exports of fresh or chilled beef and veal, all of which have their foundation in the dairy industry. The risk that, because of intemperate action, that vast export might be <Col N="82" /> affected is a risk that no Government should have taken if it had any real regard for the position.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party are sometimes wont to speak as if they were the sole custodians of increased production in certain aspects of agriculture.  It is an astonishing thing that 1957, when everyone must admit and when the Minister for External Affairs said in this House that the Fianna Fáil Party came into Government too late to influence the course of events in relation to the 1957 agricultural season, was the most successful season we have ever had.  Live-stock exports were greater than ever; there was a greater crop of wheat; feeding barley was higher; there were more pigs going to the factories; more exports of butter, more exports of bacon.  All these things happened in 1957 after the Minister for External Affairs said in reply to a question in this House last April that the Government had got in too late to influence in any way agricultural production for 1957.  They had got in too late, thank God, to influence agricultural production as they are influencing it now for the coming season.</P>
    <P>In relation to economic policy, I thought, for example, that we might have heard to-day from the Minister for Finance something that would have indicated, at this stage of the economic and financial business of the current year, that when Deputies of Fianna Fáil were speaking this time last year about the then position they were right.  No, we have not heard anything from the Minister to suggest that he was going to abolish the levies that were imposed by me.  We have not heard anything from the Minister to suggest that Deputy Traynor, the present Minister for Justice, was right when, on Monday, 24th February, 1957, at the North Strand, he said, referring to the inter-Party Government:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The remedy they applied was the levying of 37 per cent. in respect of goods coming from the British Commonwealth and 60 per cent. on goods coming from outside.  In other words, they increased the housewife's cost of living by 7/6 and 12/6 in the £. If the electorate gave Fianna Fáil a chance, they would tackle the task <Col N="83" /> in the same manner in which they tackled it in 1951.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister for Finance to explain how it is that he has not taken the levy off any of the articles which the housewife purchases and to which Deputy Traynor referred 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>One can refer to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Lemass, speaking at Graiguecullen when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government seem to have set out on a deliberate policy of reducing consumption by curtailing employment and putting up the price of goods.  Under that policy it was natural that the wage earner should suffer because the well-to-do could afford the higher prices.  Such a policy was not necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In relation to that I would like to hear from the Minister for Finance of any single item subject to levy which the housewife has to buy and in respect of which he has changed in any respect the levy that was in operation when he took over office.  I know in certain respects he changed one levy and transferred it from a temporary charge going to capital account into a permanent charge going to revenue and by so doing earned £530,000 for ten months of this year as he admitted in answer to a question the other day.  It was in relation to the housewives that Deputy Traynor was speaking.  Is there any single item which the Minister has made easier of purchase for the housewife as Deputy Traynor deliberately tried to give the impression he would do if he became a Minister in the Government?</P>
    <P>As we are on that subject of the cost of living, may I recall to the Taoiseach's mind the exact words of his reply on the 26th February: &ldquo;There is no evidence that the cost of living is at the moment increasing&rdquo;?  That was his exact reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  &ldquo;At the moment.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Taoiseach&mdash;I do not think <Col N="84" /> he does as I do sometimes&mdash;goes into certain establishments, but if he went out and said anywhere, in any licensed premises up or down the country where you get a body of men gathered together or in any milk bar where you get a body of ladies gathered together, or in a café: &ldquo;Ladies&rdquo; or &ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo; as the case may be, &ldquo;do you think there is any evidence that at the present moment the cost of living is increasing?&rdquo;  I know very well the answer the Taoiseach would get.  In fact, something amused me recently after that was published in the paper. I was down in a part of my constituency that Deputy Dooley knows very well and I was asked was it really true that the Taoiseach had said such a thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

I hope the statistics that will be quoted in this respect by the Minister for Finance and by the Taoiseach will be more honest than the statistics they were prepared to quote this time last year in the general election for the purpose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Remember the advertisement: &ldquo;For a Government that means business give Fianna Fáil a majority.&rdquo;  Does that mean business in relation to wheat, business in relation to barley, in relation to milk, in relation to the double-byre cowshed grants, in relation to pigs, in relation to the local authorities' works drainage, in relation to greater taxation, in relation to higher food prices?  Was that the kind of business the Taoiseach tried to pretend to the people a year ago he was going to introduce if only he took over the reins of office?  It is not only the selected audience favourable to us that tells of these things.  Here is a selected audience, deliberately selected by Fianna Fáil, the Fianna Fáil constituency convention in Nenagh.  The Minister for Defence was down there so that he can tell us exactly what occurred and he can tell us where and how the <i>Nenagh Guardian</i> is incorrect in its statements.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, may I congratulate the Minister for Defence on the epoch-making discovery he made as evidenced by the heading to his speech in Nenagh: &ldquo;Unemployment Was Still Too High.&rdquo;  An epoch-making discovery !  I am quoting from the <i>Nenagh Guardian</i> of Saturday, 1st March, 1958:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Kilbarron cumann moved a motion expressing dissatisfaction <Col N="87" /> with the wheat price arrangement for 1958 owing to the injurious effects on the small farmer....  A Kilbarron delegate said they had been told at the last General Election to produce more wheat and they put in a Government that docked the price by 10/- or 11/- a barrel.  The more they produced the less they were paid.  The same argument applied to pigs and poultry.  Why were the Government hitting the farmers so heavy at the present time?</P>
    <P>Mr. Brennan said that the general public was dissatisfied with the price of wheat, and the present arrangement hits, in the first instance, the unfortunate poor, small tillage wheat-grower whose livelihood was going to be reduced by the big ranchers.&rdquo;</P>

Is it not clear from those records that the peak in relation to unemployment had already been passed two months before <Col N="89" /> he took office and that the reduction in the two months before he took office showed that unemployment was down by some 8,000 from the peak?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The peak had turned, just as we knew the corner had been turned in relation to our external balances before we went out of office in March last.  So much for the position as it was misrepresented last year by those who are now Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now facing a situation in which this Government has been in office for nine months and during that period they have shown to the country no evidence of a constructive policy to deal with the problems facing the country.  We have during that period, thanks to Providence, had a situation in relation to our external trade in which the terms of trade have moved considerably in our favour.  When speaking on the Budget here last year I said that if the terms of trade moved against the Minister I would not hold him in any way blameworthy for that. No Minister can in any degree affect the terms of trade.  They are a matter <Col N="90" /> entirely outside the scope of any power we may have here.  The index price of imports has dropped steadily from the peak of 117.2 in February, 1957, to 113 now.  That is a drop of some 4 per cent. in the prices of the commodities we import.  At the same time the index price in relation to exports has risen by about 1 per cent.  That improvement has increased the national possibilities and it has done so without any action by the present Government.  The tragedy of it is that if the Government were able to grapple with the problems that are there we would be able, as a people, to take advantage of that improvement.  I do not believe the Government have taken any advantage of it.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister that he would economise in the Civil Service.  The only economies I can find in relation to Civil Service personnel are two&mdash;one in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, arising from a scheme introduced by Mr. Keyes, and the other in Gaeltacht Services where there is a reduction of 179.  Why? Because these staffs have been transferred from the Civil Service proper to the offices of the new company. Scarcely a genuine reduction!</P>
    <P>In relation to the Exchequer position, up to Christmas both the Minister and the Taoiseach were trying to curdle our blood.  The fact is that, far from there being the deterioration about which we were told, there has been an improvement.  This year total revenue is £112.94 millions as against £108.07.  If one takes out the Special Import Levy of £2.27 this year and £3.81 last year, and the Road Fund revenue of £5.47 this year and £4.67 last year, one finds that the Government have increased revenue from taxation this year by £5,610,000.  Take the other side of the picture, current expenditure.  This year the total current expenditure from the Central Fund is £25,000,000; last year it was £24,490,000.  Deducting from that the amount that came in for the Capital Account under the levy and the Road Fund, £7,774,000 this year and £8,480,000 last year, we can find that the Central Fund expenditure on current account this year is £1,250,000 <Col N="91" /> up on last year at a total of £17.26 millions against £16.01 millions.</P>
    <P>Supply Services: I have not got the information to differentiate between capital supply and current supply; only the Minister for Finance knows that.  But taking the same period for last year, we find this year that the totals are £88.99 millions as against £92.97 millions.  Assuming that the Capital Services are the same, the total current expenditure this year shows a reduction of £2.73 millions.</P>
    <P>If you add that to the increase in revenue, the total is an improvement in the first 11 months of this year of £8,430,000.  Deduct if you like the whole of the deficit of £6,000,000 last year.  It means that in the first 11 months of the year the Minister has, by comparison with last year and over and above the deficit, a surplus of £2,430,000.  That is the position up to the 1st of March as is published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  I do not know what the Minister will do between the 1st and 31st March.  Only the Minister can tell that.  Those details are not published at this stage.  But the position on the 1st March is that the Minister, in relation to current revenue and expenditure, is £8,430,000 better than the Exchequer was on the same date last year.  What the Minister will do in the last month, time will tell.  But with one month to go that is where he stands.</P>

In view of the general improvement in relation to the terms of trade, all the country needs now to set it on the right road is a Government that knows its job, that will set out clearly what will be its policy, so that everyone will have the certainty of getting the lead they require, having put clearly before them the objectives and knowing that there is a Government there that will fulfil those objectives.  I have not seen any evidence of that in the 11 months that this Government have been in office. They have got a majority here that enables them to keep in office.  But the people want more than that.  They want them to fulfil their existence as a Government.  It is not only those who feel like me politically who feel like that, but those people up and down the country who were misled last year by false promises to vote for Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>It would be reasonable to expect a more objective approach from the Opposition than we have heard from Deputy Sweetman.  As he has pointed out, it is 12 months since the last general election, and it is four years until the next one.  We could reasonably expect then that this debate would be conducted in a more realistic atmosphere and that we would not have this continuous attempt on every occasion to utilise these debates for the purpose of trying to establish that the last election campaign was fought by Fianna Fáil on the basis of reckless promises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;similar to those which put the Coalition Government <Col N="93" /> into power in 1954.  We still have the same tactics from the Opposition of trying to make political propaganda out of everything instead of making an honest effort to contribute something towards the solution of the difficulties they left for this Government to solve. So far as we are to judge by Deputy Sweetman, it appears that this debate will take the same familiar lines.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman has attempted to establish that this Government made specific promises in relation to different matters.  I would think that the last election campaign would have taught them a lesson in that regard.  The fact of the matter is that they were removed from office primarily because of the fact that they had adopted these tactics before.  The public memory is not quite as short as they apparently believe it is.  Irrespective of what they say here, our main effort in the last election campaign was to try and get rid, once and for all, of the idea which had been implanted in the public mind that it was possible to achieve prosperity, a higher standard of living, higher social services and full employment, merely by voting in a particular way at election time.  That was the whole trend of our election campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole trend of our election campaign was that these things could not be achieved by voting in a particular way at election times. It is true that the evils, particularly of unemployment and emigration, had become so acute during the last days of the Coalition's period in office that they were the main topics of discussion during the election campaign.  But in so far as we were concerned, they were referred to merely for the purpose of convincing the public of the disastrous results of believing in those reckless promises that all these desirable things could be obtained merely by voting for a particular political Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We pointed out to the people that <Col N="94" /> it was only by hard work and by increased production higher standards of living and higher employment could be achieved.  We did not say, as Deputy Sweetman has tried to make out, that these things would be achieved by voting for Fianna Fáil. The whole basis of our campaign was that only disaster could come from the belief that everything could be achieved overnight by voting for a particular Party.  We hoped that the success which attended our efforts in the election campaign would have brought a new note into debates in this House and in election campaigns.</P>
    <P>Judging by what we have heard to-day there is still an attempt to convey that same impression that the huge figure of unemployment could have been done away with overnight if Fianna Fáil had decided to do so.  I think it is very desirable that that idea should be dissipated once and for all. That was the basis of our election campaign&mdash;to get away from that idea and to have elections conducted in future on the basis of what had been done by Governments and the policies they had for the future.</P>
    <P>The first part of Deputy Sweetman's speech to-day consisted, as far as I could see, of demands for increased expenditure.  All the items I heard criticised by him were items where savings had been made.  Apparently he sees some special virtue in an ever-increasing figure in the national Estimates.  There were demands for increased expenditure under practically every head, but there was no indication given as to how the money to provide that increased expenditure was to be raised.  We are in the position, as the Government, of having to examine the expenditure that is desirable and the means by which it is possible to raise the money.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question which he raised of full employment, Deputy Sweetman tried to convey that Fianna Fáil had based their campaign in the election on the promise that they would do away almost overnight with the unemployment that had arisen during the period of office of the Coalition.  The fact of the matter is <Col N="95" /> that in the document which he had in his hand when speaking it was clearly indicated, both in the document itself and in subsequent speeches by members of the Government, that these were proposals which were put forward for discussion by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>We all know the efficiency of Fine Gael Deputies in misrepresenting statements like that; we all know their efficiency in taking statements out of their context and in trying to make them to appear to convey a meaning which they were never intended to convey.  Another example of that is the deliberate attempt that has been made to-day to put into the Taoiseach's mouth a statement which he did not make.  The Taoiseach stated, on the basis of evidence from the Statistics Office, that the cost of living is not rising at the moment.  He did not say that there has been no rise in the cost of living since this Government took over.  We all know that there has been and if that question had been asked the proper answer would have been given.</P>
      <P>The question was put down and framed in such a way as to give Fine Gael Deputies an opportunity for misrepresentation. The question was put down to get the answer which it was known was the only answer that could be given and then it was tried to misrepresent it.  That is typical of the whole speech by Deputy Sweetman to-day. We have statements and alleged statements taken out of their context and an attempt being made to read something into them which was not in them at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> With regard to the grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act mentioned by Deputy Sweetman, it is a fact that there was a great deal of wasteful expenditure under that scheme.  I do not claim that it was all waste but a great deal of it was.  The financial position of the country at the moment is such that we cannot afford to waste money in that way any longer.  Any capital moneys that have to be spent in the future will have to be used for productive purposes.  We will have to get some production from money expended in that way in order that such money will make some contribution towards the huge cost of servicing the national debt.  The cost of that, this year, is in the neighbourhood of £17,000,000 and it is essential, in view of the fact that our capital resources have been so far depleted, that we try to get some return for capital moneys spent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman went on to complain about the fact that it has been found necessary to require farmers to make a small contribution towards the transport of ground limestone.  There again he has attempted to misrepresent the position by claiming that there has been a decrease in the amount provided by the Exchequer for that purpose in this year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on this Supplementary Estimate last Thursday and since then protest meetings have been held all over the country against the reduction in dairying incomes in the coming year by the levy of 17/- per cwt. on the amount of butter which will be exported in the coming year and which obviously is to come out of the pockets of the most industrious section of the community&mdash;the dairy farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole sum required to subsidise butter was £2,544,000.  Of that sum £1,124,000 was required to subsidise butter produced in the 1956-57 period which was held in cold storage and subsidised in the 1957-58 period.  If we deduct that amount from the total, we find that only £1,420,000 was the actual amount required to subsidise the butter produced and exported in the 1957-58 period.  That was a very small sum, which we should stand over on behalf of this section of our people because they are engaged in the most important industry, responsible for producing <Col N="98" /> most of the wealth of the country. Everybody should know that after our experiences last year when the cattle industry saved the whole economy.  If the income of the dairy farmer is to be reduced&mdash;and I have no doubt it will as a result of the reduction of 4/5ths of 1d. per gallon on his milk&mdash;the obvious thing for him to do is to reduce output.  If the dairy farmer goes out of production we will have fewer cattle for export and perhaps will not be in the favourable position again of having cattle to save the day.  It is &ldquo;penny wise and pound foolish&rdquo; not to come to the rescue of the dairy farmer at this stage; instead of hindering him in his efforts to increase production, everything possible should be done by the Government to increase production of dairy produce and the number of cattle because these are the mainstay of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be misled to some extent by this farce of a Milk Costings Report issued a short time ago.  One gentleman who professes to be a farmer, but who, I am informed, is not actually a farmer at all, is able to produce milk, according to the costings, at 4½d. per gallon whereas the sum allowed for separated milk by the costings commission is 5½d. per gallon.  Does it sound like common sense to anybody that a farmer could produce milk at that price when the price of separated milk was found to be 5½d.?  Of course it does not, and I hope the Minister will not pay too much attention to that gentleman.  He was not a farmer and he should not be costed at all as a farmer, because his income was not derived from farming. It is figures like those which mislead the whole community in regard to milk costings.  If costings are to be taken out on any farmer he should be a genuine farmer, deriving his living solely from farming and not somebody who has income from other sources.</P>
    <P>The actual sum required for the subsidy is very little and should not be reduced in any circumstances.  Were it not for the dumping of butter here from other sources I doubt if any subsidy would be required.  It is a very strange thing that so much foreign butter should be dumped here to the <Col N="99" /> detriment of the dairy farmer.  I would ask the Government to look into this matter because if our butter were consumed here, instead of using imported stuff, there would be very little need to subsidise butter.</P>
    <P>Where is this 4/5th of 1d. which I presume is to be collected from the dairy farmers from the 1st April to come from if there is no butter to be exported in the coming year?  Whatever help the farmers will get they are entitled to it.  They are entitled to whatever protection can be given to them in doing a good job for Ireland. I hope the Minister will not take the ridiculous Milk Costings Report too seriously; it has been proved to be what I can only call the greatest farce from which the veil has ever been lifted.</P>
    <P>The limestone scheme for which there is a subsidy and an additional Suplementary Estimate, is a good scheme but I am afraid a body other than the farmers is deriving great benefit from the subsidy.  I understand that C.I.E. get as much as 7½ per cent. even on lime they do not carry at all.  If that is true I do not think it is fair to the farmers to leave them working under the illusion that they are getting so much money for lime subsidy when, in fact, C.I.E. is being highly subsidised as well.</P>
    <P>Since I spoke in this debate the levy of 4/5th of 1d. was announced. I think that is a very foolish step. Instead of cutting down the income of the most industrious section of the community I strongly appeal to the Minister and the Government to reconsider the position because if they do not, the dairy farmers will have fewer cows, fewer calves, less milk and less butter for export and the country will be the poorer as a result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The main figure in this Supplementary Estimate is for the subsidy on dairy produce.  No doubt it is a very big figure and I believe one of the fatal mistakes that the Government made was to withdraw the subsidy on butter last year.  Consumption of butter dropped considerably. It seems extraordinary from <Col N="100" /> the consumers' point of view that the Government is not prepared to pay 5d. per lb. subsidy while it costs 1/6 per lb. in Britain to subsidise the same butter for the British consumer.  That was something that should not have happened.</P>
      <P>Since we discussed this Estimate last week we have had a statement on the future of the dairy industry and it seems that the dairy farmers are now going to take a rap as well as the other sections of the agricultural community. It seems now that it is Government policy that when the farmers succeed in increasing production, as they have been asked to do for a number of years, their prices will be reduced.  It is very bad policy.  It will have the effect of putting us back to the position in which we were some years ago.  It will mean that we will have no butter to export.  The dairy farmers' costs have been increasing in recent years.  Every other section of the community is being compensated in one way or another for increased costs.  The farmer will not be allowed any such compensation; the scales will be weighted the other way in his case.  He will receive less for what he produces.  That is a very bad position and the dairy producer is feeling very hurt about it. As the last speaker indicated, it will have the effect of reducing output in the dairy industry and in that way will affect live stock and our whole economy.</P>
      <P>There is an amount in the Estimate for ground limestone subsidy.  There has been a statement on that matter in the last week.  We find now that there will be a substantial reduction in the freight subsidy in that connection. Previously, the entire freight charge was carried in the form of a subsidy. Now, four shillings, will have to be carried by the user.  That is disastrous. The good that ground limestone has done in increasing production need not be stressed.  The ground limestone scheme was one of the greatest schemes ever introduced.  The farmers are being hit on all sides and now they will have to pay more for lime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole arrangement is very bad because the subsidy is being paid to C.I.E.  If it were paid to the manufacturers <Col N="101" /> of ground limestone, there might be a possibility that they would be able to bear some of that reduction. The number of people who engage in the haulage of ground limestone is very limited.  Most of them are allowed only one lorry to haul their produce while there may be 20 C.I.E. lorries employed in the same business.  It is very unfair that the producer should have to carry the increased burden.  There is no hope whatever of the price being reduced because at 16/- a ton it is very competitive and any little profit that was in it was in the haulage.  Obviously, the reduction in this matter will be very detrimental to the agricultural economy.</P>
    <P>There is an amount provided in the Estimate for seed testing and seed certification.  I compliment the Department on the progress and success of that scheme.  It is now accepted that the seed produced is first class. Previously, there were some farmers who were anxious to get imported seed. Now they are quite satisfied, and rightly so, that the certified seed is first class and can compare with the seed produced in any country.  The scheme has been very well organised and the results are excellent.  The produce is first class.  I should like to compliment the Department on the success of that scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an Estimate, apparently, for an under-estimated amount in last year's Estimate for Agriculture.  It is a pretty hefty sum that was under-estimated&mdash;£3,000,000 odd.  I am wondering by what machinery the Estimate for Agriculture was introduced last year with such an under-estimation.  It is a commentary on the manner in which the Estimate was prepared last year, that we have this Estimate for an additional £3,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For dairy produce subsidies, the revised Estimate is £3,210,000.  That seems to be a pretty considerable amount of money and I know the steps the Minister has taken this year, but I should like to make a rather general estimate of what is happening in other Departments of State.  There was a Bill brought in in 1956 to give grants to people who were prepared to start industries <Col N="102" /> in order to export.  Here we have an instance of an industry out of which for the first 11 months of last year exports amounted to £75,000,000.</P>
    <P>The total here is £3,210,000, the additional sum required being £2,544,000. I am amazed that any Minister of State would estimate that the total amount he would require for subsidies on dairy produce for the last 12 months was £666,000.  It is a rather amazing mistake to make, particularly for a Minister who was boasting about the large number of cows he had got and the manner in which he had brought up production, that he should estimate that he would require only £666,000 for a butter subsidy which amounted to £3,200,000.</P>
    <P>You have here an industry, the dairy industry, out of which there were exports valued at £75,000,000.  I do not think that even £3,000,000 is anything out of the way to pay for that large export considering that we have gentlemen coming here from abroad and starting twopence halfpenny industries. No notice is taken of giving them a grant of £100,000 or £200,000 although such industries will not carry as much as £50,000 a year in exports.  I have studied the question as closely as I can and I make the prediction that within three years we will be back again on Danish butter.  I would make a complaint against the Minister who brought in the Estimate at that time which is in keeping with the other burdens that were left one after another by the Party going out of office.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provision for a research grant to University College, I should like the Minister to tell us what research they are carrying out in regard to agriculture.  If the Government decided here as far back as 25 or 26 years ago to advocate the growing of wheat, we would expect that any money that would be leaving the Department of Agriculture for research would go towards keeping up with the increase in the acreage of wheat and keeping up with each step that the agricultural community was taking, so that it would be unnecessary to be paying millions of money abroad for wheat.  I should like to know if this money is being directed towards that end and also how much has been given <Col N="103" /> in the past 26 years towards endeavouring to see that the millers and bakers are brought into line and brought to the position where an all-Irish loaf can be produced.</P>
    <P>I should like to add my commendation to that of Deputy Hughes in regard to seed testing and certification. A very good job has been done there and we should be at the point now where it would be absolutely unnecessary to import seed from abroad.  As regards live stock, I should like to be more sure as to the improvement there.  The National Stud seems to be paying for itself.  We had four winners at Cheltenham to-day.</P>
    <P>In connection with the ground limestone subsidy, I have been for a long period commenting in this House on the manner in which that subsidy was being spent.  It reminds me of an old neighbour of mine long ago who took the wife's cheque for the geese at Christmas and went off on a three-day spree.  When he was apprehended he said: &ldquo;Sure, it was only goose money, anyway.&rdquo;  Apparently the attitude in relation to this money is that it is only American money, anyway.  To take money that was given to the agricultural community and to subsidise with that money an incompetent, useless machine known as C.I.E. is a scandalous waste of public money.</P>
    <P>It is a sad commentary that, if the owner of a ground limestone plant has three or four lorries of his own drawing out that lime and distributing it for the farmers, C.I.E., without even having seen the plant or the lorry, are drawing 7½ per cent. of the money paid.  It should be very easy and should not be beyond the intelligence of the Department of Agriculture to zone those areas.  I know that there is lime going from Mallow within a mile of two limestone plants in Carrigtuohill. The State is paying for the hauling of that lime that could be and should be supplied locally.  It is all very well when your hand is in another man's pocket.  In this case the hand is in the pockets of the Americans who gave the money to subsidise lime to farmers. This is the fourth occasion on which I have called attention in this House to that anomaly and steps should be <Col N="104" /> taken by the Minister even now to see that those areas are zoned and that an area, say, within 20 miles of a ground limestone plant should be stipulated for the delivery of lime from that limestone plant, so that you would not have the joke of seeing lorries using petrol, rubber and American funds for that purpose.  If the Minister examines the books he will find that the £60,000 extra that is being sought here has been spent in that manner.</P>
    <P>I notice a sum for the purchase of stock bulls, other than dairy bulls, for leasing to cattle breeders.  I am wondering what good that will do? How many of the progeny are kept? Is one in a hundred kept?  It is a waste of public money, at a time when we have not got public money to waste, to go abroad and pay anything up to £1,000 or £1,500 for a bull particularly when the progeny are not kept for breeding.  Very few people have pure bred herds and those who have provide their own bulls.  What are these bulls for?</P>
    <P>I am wondering, too, about this £60,000 compensation to the owners of animals slaughtered because of swine fever.  I know farmers in my constituency and elsewhere in County Cork who illegally imported pigs. Those pigs got swine fever.  They were duly slaughtered by the Department. Have the owners of those illegally imported pigs been compensated? I know one particular place in which compensation amounted to a pretty hefty sum.  When these animals were discovered, was there any prosecution taken against those who had illegally imported them?  Were any steps taken?  I know of none.  There were public advertisements in the papers every day offering these boars and sows for sale.  Surely they read the papers in the Department of Agriculture. Surely they saw these advertisements. Were any steps taken?  In the end, after compensation had been paid, the Department legalised the animals, but they took no steps during the period in which these animals were illegally in the country.</P>
    <P>In the Appropriations-in-Aid I see a recoupment figure in relation to the American Grant Counterpart Special <Col N="105" /> Account for bovine tuberculosis eradication. I should like to know how that money has been spent, where and why? Would the Minister be kind enough to tell us now the results of the Bansha scheme?  How many reactors are left in Bansha to-day?  It is time that other areas who derived no benefit from any Grant Counterpart Fund for bovine tuberculosis eradication should be made aware of what the position is in Bansha and how long it will take to clear any particular area elsewhere. The information at my disposal is that there are more reactors in Bansha to-day than there were five or six years ago, when the scheme started.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The House, whether it agrees or disagrees, must appreciate the difficulty of the Minister's position. He must maintain prices for the reasons that have been mentioned and, at the same time, he must have regard to the capacity of the community to pay the subsidies required. A large part of the community paying these subsidies are the farmers themselves and, therefore, there must be a limit to which the country can go in order to subsidise the export of dairy products.  Furthermore, the Minister is faced with the problem that farming here is under-capitalised and the farmer, with the best intentions in the world and irrespective of how hard he works, cannot produce more because he has not got the capital to invest in the land.  That is a problem that cannot be settled in a month or a year; it is one that will be with us for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference have been made to surplus production.  Now &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; is a word which should not be used in an agricultural country.  After all, we all of us exhort the farmer to produce more and tell him that the economic survival of the country and the wellbeing of every section of the community is dependent upon increased production on his part so that we can export more and import the things we do not produce ourselves, mainly the raw materials for our factories, on which hidden subsidies are paid by way of high tariff walls.  It is wrong to talk about a surplus because if the farmer does not produce more than is sufficient <Col N="106" /> for our needs we shall not be able to export to buy the things we cannot produce ourselves.  It is largely a question of costs.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that a few years ago we would have had no difficulty in selling all our so-called surplus of butter on the Continent of Europe at very fancy prices.  As certain Deputies have pointed out, it is not many years since we were faced with the possibility of having to import very inferior butter.  These things go in cycles.  I agree with the view expressed by Deputy Dillon that we are now in the position of going through an artificial slump in dairy products in which all the countries in the world, or at least those competing with us such as Denmark, Holland and New Zealand, are heavily subsidising their exports of milk and bacon products.</P>
    <P>We have got to decide whether to stay in the race or get out of it.  Even though it is a severe strain on the country's economy, I do not think we have any alternative but to stay in to the limit of our financial capacity.  It is a very big burden on the taxpayer, both direct and indirect, but as an agricultural country whose main&mdash;I might say whose only&mdash;asset is 12,000,000 acres of arable land, we have no other course but to remain in this until the normal laws of economics assert themselves and proper, rational prices are received for agricultural products.  As was mentioned by other speakers, it is not purely a subsidy on butter or on pigs.  It is really a subsidy on almost all agricultural production. The cow is the basis of all agricultural production.  Everything comes down to it.  In fact, we are subsidising not only the milk producer, but virtually the whole agricultural economy.  For that reason £3,000,000 is not a very big sum of money in those terms.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency our prosperity is based on two things&mdash;on milk and on pigs.  As Deputies are aware the only condensed milk factory in the country is situated in Limerick City. If anything were to happen to interfere with the flow of 10,000,000 or 12,000,000 gallons of milk to that factory every year, it would have very <Col N="107" /> serious repercussions on the already serious unemployment position in Limerick.  Three of the largest bacon factories in the country are situated there, and there are other analogous industries such as grain milling, feeding stuffs, distribution and transport by sea, road and rail which are also dependent in the final analysis on the production of milk and bacon.</P>
    <P>There are two things in regard to which we must, as an agricultural community, stand by the farmer even in difficult times and give him a chance. I am sorry the Minister found it necessary to ask the farmers to bear some of the subsidy on the export of butter. I know he is faced with a difficult problem, but I think I am correct in saying that, as against subsidies, the price of milk in this country if not the lowest must be very nearly the lowest in Europe and possibly in the whole world.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect.  If you depress the price of milk any lower, there is great danger that those producing it will go out of it altogether. In my constituency the producers of milk are very largely, almost entirely, people who either rely on family labour or bachelors living alone who have a tradition of milk production.  If they go out there will be nobody there to take up the production of milk after them.  I do not know how far down you can go in the price of milk.  It strikes me that the minimum of 1/6 per gallon is very low indeed and to go below that is gravely endangering the whole milk industry.</P>
    <P>One of the things we must do is to ensure that in our exports we try and get the best prices for butter and bacon.  I am not satisfied we are doing that at present.  I would like to see the farmers themselves take a more active part in procuring markets, particularly in England, for the wholesale and retail sale of bacon and butter.  I know that every section of the community thinks that the proper thing is to appeal to the Government. The Minister must do everything.  If he does not do it, he is the worst in the world and is threatened with being put out of office at the next election or with being asked to resign.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> There is a lot to be said for the old policy of self-help.  That applies to the farmer as well as to the section of the community I represent myself.  There is a lot more to be done on the marketing side.  It is rather disconcerting to find that not even a small amount of the £250,000 which was ear-marked 12 months ago in connection with marketing&mdash;I think I am correct in saying this&mdash;has yet been spent.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister but I warn him that any further interference with the price of milk will have disastrous consequences.  The Minister and the Government in general should take the long view.  These price difficulties come in cycles.  I do not think one would have to be a visionary to see that in two or three years' time, or perhaps less, the outside world might be glad to pay far higher prices for butter and bacon than they are paying at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Russell, the constituency which I represent is predominantly a milk producing constituency. In the Estimate we have before us there is reflected the contribution which the dairying industry has made in increased production in recent years.  It is an extraordinary thing that, within a matter of days of the Minister for Health and Social Welfare bringing in a huge Estimate to cope with the amount of illness that existed in insurable occupations last year and as a consequence of which, we presume, there was a proportionate decrease in industrial production at the time because of the 'flu epidemic so jeopardising industrial production, the farmers of this country, and in particular the dairy farmers, should succeed in making such a dramatic contribution to the national production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here, as was pointed out by other Deputies, the very core of the agricultural industry reflected in dairying.  We are providing the raw materials for the cattle stocks that are now agreed as being absolutely the anchorage of our entire economy.  The market prevailing for live cattle, for frozen meat and tinned meat is a good one and one which is likely to remain <Col N="109" /> useful as long as this Government, or any Government, realises its value to the economy of the country.  Should there be any upheaval in the parent industry, on the dairying side of it, you will have an immediate reflection in the numbers available to replace those cattle we export in whatever capacity they are exported.</P>
    <P>There are many people who do not live on the land and do not appreciate the difficulties of those who are living on the land and who are producing these goods.  These people express certain criticisms of the necessity for a subsidy such as this.  But we must realise that we must export and that for too long, when we had to import agricultural commodities, these were the very people who were critical of the standard of those imports.  We can well remember the Danish butter and how the people in the cities of Dublin, Cork, and Limerick, reacted at that time, how they wished that they would see the day when they would have ample supplies of good Irish creamery butter.  Thanks be to God, that day is with us.  It would be impossible for any Minister for Agriculture or for any cohesive farmers' organisation to arrange things so that we would have the supply of butter, milk or other products derived from cattle in the exact quantities required in this country.  The variability of the weather and other factors would make that impossible.  It is therefore a very happy state of affairs that we have the situation in which we have this exportable surplus.  It is regrettable that in these circumstances such a disruption should be created as the recent announcement in relation to the levy on the producer of practically one-third of the cost of possible future exports of butter.</P>
    <P>It is known to everybody who has any knowledge of the creamery industry that butter manufacture is the poor relation of that industry, that those concerned in the manufacture of chocolate crumb or in the disposal of milk as dried milk and the export of that dried milk to countries far removed from these islands, have a distinct advantage over the creameries not so advantageously placed and <Col N="110" /> which have to produce creamery butter.  We know, of course, that they are not in a position to withstand the impact that is now being imposed on them by governmental direction.  It is a pity that it is that aspect of the creamery industry that is being faced with this additional levy.  If that levy is designed to drive that part of the industry away from the production of butter then it is unfortunate because one of the few good things which was presented in the last Budget by the Minister for Finance, and one which contained something of real advantage to the future of the country, was an Estimate for research in practical marketing.  Indeed, there were many who felt that the Government should have gone further in providing markets prior to seeking the increased production which we now have.</P>
    <P>Of course, you cannot provide a market until you are in a position to guarantee supplies to that market.  We are now in that position and it is a pity that something more concrete was not done in using that money for the furtherance of marketing.  Instead what is being done is the placing of a levy on our surplus production in wheat and in milk.  Deputy Wycherley will recall my remarking to him when the levy was placed on wheat that similar applications would follow in regard to other agricultural produce and that milk would be the next in that regard.</P>
    <P>What the Minister has done has been to divert the minds of the dairy farmers at the moment from the greatest challenge ever presented to any sector of our agricultural industry. That is the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  It is regrettable that the injustice perpetrated by the Minister and the Government should evoke from anybody in the farming community even a suggestion that there would not be the closest co-operation in stamping out what is a cloud hanging over our export horizon, a cloud which, if not cleared away, will have its repercussions on every single section of the economy of this country.  In those circumstances the origin of the present trouble must be attributed to the Government's action because they led so many people to believe that the <Col N="111" /> production of the Milk Costings Commission's report would present to the dairying industry an absolute Magna Charta in relation to the future.</P>
    <P>Some of us never had any faith in that document.  We felt that it originated as a way out to relieve the Government of that time of an embarrassment. Now that it has been produced it is a great disappointment because it has been clearly pointed out that the whole system of the costings is open to very severe criticism.  Consequently there is now no faith in the report of that commission.</P>

      <P>I am saying this in relation to the disposal of the surplus of butter in this country.  I am merely referring to the fact that the industry is being disrupted by these factors.  In conclusion, I want to refer to the fact that the people who were charged with increasing the production of these commodities and who have achieved that aim are now being penalised for having produced the commodities that the country so badly needed.  It is unfortunate that those apologists who are being loyal to the Party doctrine are to-day making so much play on the fact that there is this charge on the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>As far as we are concerned, having been responsible for the policy that led up to these surpluses, we do not regard them as an embarrassment.  We think it is a grand thing that a situation should arise in which a Minister should have come into this House in order to face up to the problem presented by overproduction.  It is a good thing that the producers' organisations are directing their attention to the advisability of improving the market for dairy produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am firmly of the opinion that the time is ripe for a &ldquo;Drink More Milk&rdquo; campaign in this country.  We are often advised of the advantages to this country of being self-sufficient and of consuming our own produce.  There is no item of food produced in this <Col N="112" /> country which does not make a greater contribution to the country's welfare than milk.  Could there not then be an effort made to increase the consumption of milk?  Could there not be a logical case made to the consuming public of the advisability of eating good Irish butter?  Is it not a great pity, now, as has been brought home so forcibly to so many families, that we have placed Irish butter beyond their reach, that by wiping out the subsidies which existed on butter so many of them are to-day denied butter and in consequence have been driven to eating margarine?  The substitution of Irish butter on the table of the home by margarine is reflected to some extent in the necessity for this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that those people who are naturally concerned about charges on the Exchequer and the fact that the Exchequer has to meet such a formidable amount as is contained in this Estimate, would use it as still another instance of the agricultural community receiving something more than their due.  It is unfortunate that anybody in authority would express such views or lend any support to them and it is particularly unfortunate that they should try by governmental action to cut down production in butter, milk, wheat and barley at a time when they had assured people that they were to take positive and clear steps to improve by marketing research the markets available for such commodities.</P>
    <P>These actions are contradictory.  If the markets were in existence and capable of being developed why discourage the producer from producing even the amount he is now producing? Instead we should be carrying on from the position reached in 1957 and pointing out that it was to the national advantage and to the advantage of the individual that he should maintain not alone the 1957 level of production but go on from that, keep more cattle, rear more calves, produce more milk and more butter, chocolate crumb, dried milk and all the other things which flow from that industry, that he should go out and produce coarse grains to <Col N="113" /> be converted into bacon for export and do that secure in the knowledge that the Government in office had discovered better means of marketing his surplus produce.</P>
    <P>The people would then be assured of sufficient supplies of these commodities for their own needs and at the same time they would be saved that kind of impact on their standard of living which would be made necessary should our balance of payments again go against us.  This is the industry that has resolved the balance of payments problem and in consequence the people who do not sympathise with the necessity for bolstering up our premier industry should realise that if it was not there, and if we had not sent out from this country £45,000,000 worth of cattle last year, they would have had to meet in other ways, perhaps, a serious personal impact on their occupations and their homes.  It is because we are conscious of that fact that we feel this House should pass the Estimate and bring it home to the country that it is not being passed in any apologetic way but as a tribute to the achievement of the people who succeeded in increasing production against such great difficulties and over such a short period to the point where the present Government are in the good position that all they have to face is the problem of marketing the surplus production which their predecessors handed to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister set out the grounds for this Supplementary Estimate and it is quite clear that Deputy Corry made no attempt either to listen to the Minister or to read the Minister's speech. If he had done so he would not have made that charge, but it appears no attempt is ever made by some members on the Government Benches to give credit where credit is due.  The <Col N="114" /> increases in the Estimate are due to many causes, including the fact that more grade A bacon was produced than could have been anticipated.  That required a subsidy.  More milk and butter were produced than could have been anticipated and this required a subsidy. In his opening speech the Minister set out the facts fully in regard to the reasons for the Supplementary Estimate and it is an astounding thing that Deputy Corry or any Deputy should come in and make such a charge in the face of the Minister's published statement.</P>

      <P>When this Supplementary Estimate was being discussed last week-end I was taxed with my failure to make certain announcements regarding Government policy on milk and butter production. At question time I was pressed on the same matters.  In fact, the public outside, if they were not as intelligent as they are, would have got the impression that my failure to make such announcements would have some dire consequences of which I, certainly, am not aware.</P>
      <P>In the course of replies to supplementary questions I think I said that pending the making of such an announcement the farmer was free to dispose of his milk in the way he had been disposing of it.  Over the week-end I was glad to be able to make the announcement before we completed the discussion of this Supplementary Estimate, not because I wished to have a full-dress debate on departmental policy generally but because I wanted to see that members of the House who were naturally concerned about a question like this would have an opportunity of giving their views on what had been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like to make a political issue of a matter such as this although once in a while we may have a showdown in this House, but some of the claims made here in relation to important matters like these are really so provocative and so unjustifiable as to drive one to a line of action in debate that one would wish to avoid. For example, Deputy O'Sullivan has just stated, &ldquo;We left you with this surplus of butter as a result of the <Col N="115" /> policy that we pursued when the previous Government was in office on the first occasion, between 1948 and 1951 and between 1954 and 1957&rdquo;.  Is not that an absurd claim having regard to a history that is here before me and into which I have no desire whatever to go for the sake of making Party capital or for the purpose of securing political advantage?  It may transpire that on some other occasion I shall have to delve in thoroughly in order to blow sky high the preposterous claim that has been made here on that matter.</P>

      <P>It is my duty to keep within the limits without having to be reminded by the Chair that I am exceeding my rights.  Therefore, I am afraid I will have to try to choose my own ground.  I can say this much about the claim that has been made across the floor here and I do not do so in any boastful way&mdash;whatever average price the creameries have been receiving it was we who gave it to them.  Whether it was too high or too low, it was this Government who created these standards for them.  I should like to assure Deputy Wycherley and other Deputies who have spoken on this matter that I personally regard the dairying industry as the very body and soul of our agricultural economy, and have always so regarded it, and that apart altogether from the responsibilities that a man has as a Minister my own natural tendency and my own determination as an individual would be to do everything within my power to help it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="116" /> It has been repeatedly stated down through the years in this House and outside it that the dairying industry is a difficult business and that the dairy farmers are situated largely in some of the poorest or in the medium land, that the dairying industry is all-important from the point of view of the live-stock trade.  I say, not in relation to this Government or any other Government, that one of the disappointing things in relation to the dairying industry is that in spite of the fact that the store cattle trade and the cow trade in every form is so profitable, in 1957 the cow population was not as large as it was in 1938-39.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that if we were serious and if we were generally concerned about the people who have cows and who produce milk and send it to the creameries and who rear calves and feed pigs and all the rest of it, we could with advantage give some thought to that fact and try to see the way in which that state of affairs might be altered.  Much as I and every member of the Government dislike having to interfere with milk prices, we have had to face up to this matter of the provision of the necessary subsidy in order to sell whatever excess butter there might be over and above what we consume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the limitation of production, the one thing that can be said about the solution we have found&mdash;and it is entirely to its advantage&mdash;is that we have not placed any limit as to the distance we will go with the dairy farmer and we have not placed any limit because we recognise the truth of <Col N="117" /> what I have already said about the importance of that class of the community. If we have asked the milk producer to contribute one in three, if we have asked the consuming public to maintain a support price at home plus a contribution from general taxation, and if we have placed no limit on the amount that they may produce, I do not think that that was an unfair deal having regard, as Deputy Russell said, to the general circumstances.</P>
    <P>We had the matter of bacon to provide for.  We had surplus wheat to provide for.  We had to provide entirely from taxation for the bovine tuberculosis scheme.  We had to provide for the first time entirely from taxation for the ground limestone scheme and, as has been said by others, while the farmer and the milk producer may, and will, as a result of this decision get less to the extent that is already conveyed to him, then the overall picture and the overall contribution by the taxpayer to agriculture must be vetted if we are to arrive at a fair decision as to whether or not the community is treating that important section of our people in a fair way.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I read reports of discussions which take place at the meetings of public bodies, county councils, county committees of agriculture, and so on, on all these matters.  You often see, in the course of these discussions, on the part of those who take part in them, a tendency to cultivate a misunderstanding between the consuming public and the producer.  Indeed you often see efforts made to put over a certain point of view, say, in the milk-producing area and then an entirely different point of view in the grain-producing area.  I have in mind the case of, I think, the County Committee of Louth.  They spent some considerable time in discussing the Government policy, and my policy in particular, in regard to wheat.  After they had spent, I suppose, most of the day discussing that question, they proceeded to pass a resolution asking that butter would be distributed and sold to the people of County Louth at the price at which it was being sold in Britain.  They wanted protection there for the grain grower.  They wanted <Col N="118" /> the assistance of the consumer and the taxpayer to keep their economy in order, but when it came to asking them to make their contribution to supporting those who were engaged in another line of production then it was a different matter and could be conveniently switched around to be made a political question.</P>
    <P>You find these efforts being made and there is no means, nor as far as I am concerned is there any desire, to discourage them or to stop them.  I say that because I feel our people are intelligent enough in relation to these matters, just as they will be intelligent enough to understand the meaning of what the Government is attempting here in order to meet their difficulties and to deal with the complex problems that confront us in the matter of the export of whatever excess butter we have or whatever surplus bacon may be produced here.</P>
    <P>We are surely not anxious, as has been truthfully said, to offer this bacon or this butter anywhere below cost of production.  The production of milk and butter is vital to us and, as I have said, one of the reasons why no limitation of subsidy is provided for is because of the fact that the dairying industry is so vital to us in the sense that it is, you might say, the very foundation of the whole live-stock trade of the country.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude on the note on which I started.  Making allowance for the little bit of political exaggeration which one is bound to find in an Assembly like this, I can detect in the course of the limited discussion we have had here on this subject, an appreciation on the part of Deputies that the solutions and the suggestions that have been proposed and publicised over the week-end, while they are not everything that those who are interested in these very important matters would like them to be, they appear to have made their mark in the sense that they are regarded as being a fair effort to deal with what is and, I suppose, what will be for some time anyhow, a very awkward problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £2,350 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice, including certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate is required to meet the necessary expenses of staff salaries and travelling and telephone expenses.</P>
      <P>The cause of the expected excess of expenditure over the provision for salaries, sub-head A (1), is that it has not been found possible to carry retrenchment as far as was hoped for when the original Estimate was formulated.</P>
      <P>The supplementary amount sought for travelling expenses in sub-head B is accounted for chiefly by an upward revision of the rates of subsistence allowance.  There has as well been extra travelling on investigation duty connected with An Bord Uchtála.</P>
      <P>The increase in telephone expenses, sub-head D, the estimate for which is necessarily conjectural, arises from a greater use of telephones than had been allowed for in the original Estimate.</P>
      <P>The additional sum in relation to the Garda Síochána is required mainly because more Gardaí have retired on pension than anticipated and because of the necessity for increased Garda activity.  Besides, it is necessary to include in the Supplementary Estimate provision for paying increases in subsistence allowances to the Garda on the same lines as those which have been granted to the Civil Service.  The increases are retrospective to the 1st June, 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from these unexpected expenditures there will be a deficiency in the receipts which are appropriated-in-aid of the Vote.  This deficiency arises, in the main, because the contribution from the Road Fund in <Col N="120" /> respect of the expenses of the Garda Síochána in the execution of the Roads Act and the Road Traffic Act was £7,328 less than estimated.</P>
    <P>The total additional sum required is £74,835, but savings on other subheads have contributed to reducing the total to a net sum of £26,300.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate for the Circuit Court is required to meet the extra expenditure which has been caused by the grant of revised salary scales to certain officers of the Circuit Court; by the upward revision of rates of subsistence allowance with retrospective effect to 1st June, 1956, and also by a greater volume of telephone calls on official business than had been provided for.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate is further required to make good the deficiency caused by failure to realise the full amount of the Appropriation-in-Aid receipts.  This occurred particularly under the heading of sub-head F (5) where provision has been made for the receipt of an additional £7,050 through an increase of sheriffs' fees.  The form and content of the requisite Order occasioned difficulties which were not resolved until so late in the year that the yield is unlikely to exceed £500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that the arrangements which were provisionally made for the employment of consultants, or efficiency experts, have now been put into effect.  I should like the Minister to give us the figure over each of these three Votes, or the total for the three, represented by the increases that had to be given in subsistence allowances as from 1st June last.  I shall be quite frank and say that one of the reasons I want that information is as part of a computation to show the losses sustained by the Minister for Finance in <Col N="121" /> relation to these three Votes as a result of his Budget.</P>
      <P>I am rather at a loss to understand the Minister's explanation in relation to travelling expenses, particularly in relation to the Circuit Court.  On a percentage basis, the increase appears to be extremely heavy though, as a sum, it is not so very large.</P>
      <P>Some people take the view that an increase in connection with telephone expenses is a bad thing.  I do not subscribe to that because it invariably means the cutting out of some of the red tape; unnecessary letters and minutes are not written because a more modern method of communication is utilised.  A great deal of unnecessary writing is done in relation to Civil Service minutes.  If there was a little more verbal discussion, by telephone if necessary, a great deal of expense might be saved.  The cost of a telephone call will always be considerably less than the cost of writing a minute. A telephone does away with the necessity for writing a minute, passing it from the bottom stratum right up to the top for signature and passing it down again to the bottom for issue.  If that can be obviated by a more frequent use of the telephone, even if the Minister has to come back for a supplementary for telephones, it will be a good thing because it will have the effect of cutting total expense.</P>

I would hardly be in order on this supplementary if I were to attempt to discuss next year's Estimate so I shall have to forgo that pleasure for the moment.  The additional costs of incidental expenses, for which Deputy McQuillan asked, somewhat surprises me because I thought that most of the expenses needed in relation to those items had already been met.  If, in fact, their acquisition means greater efficiency by the Garda Síochána, we certainly will offer no objection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to point out to the Government at this stage their promises when they came into office.  One of the reasons the last Government got the order of the boot was that the people believed the cost of Government was too high and that no real attempt was being made to reduce it.  The present Government, through the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement last year, made it quite clear that they were going to use the are ruthlessly to trim the Civil Service and Government expenditure.</P>
      <P>We have here in a small way proof of how far from reality the Minister for Finance was last year.  Here we have the Minister for Justice having the audacity to produce here three Supplementary Estimates in which the House is being asked to vote extra money to the headquarters of the Minister's own Department in order to pay increased expenses for the salaries of the staff. Surely the work of the Department of Justice has not increased to such an extent over the last 12 months that the Minister can renege on the promises given by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, that he would reduce the cost of Government?</P>
      <P>It has to be brought home fully to the public that no matter what promises have been made here about cutting expenditure on the Civil Service or the cost of administration, there is no difference in the world between any Government in power over the last 20 years.  The different Governments have proved themselves to be in the hands of the Civil Service in regard to expenditure and that they only count in so far as their names make legal the further expenditure by signing on the dotted line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to these Supplementary Estimates, Deputy Sweetman has suggested it is a desirable trend that the telephone should be used now rather than the minute passed up from the lower ranks to the top.  I am in full agreement if that procedure will help to speed decisions and cut read tape. But is it not too much to suggest, if we are to cut red tape and gain efficiency through the use of the telephone, that we could have a decrease in the Civil <Col N="123" /> Service in that particular Department? If the use of the telephone means that two hours of a civil servant's time is spared in writing and reporting some little matter to other sections, can we not logically deduct from that, if there are 1,000 calls in a week, we can reduce the man-hours in regard to that work? If there is to be an increase in the amount made available for telephone calls, there should be a corresponding reduction on the other side in regard to the expenditure on the number employed in that Department.</P>
    <P>Having agreed so far with Deputy Sweetman on that, I want to criticise the Minister at this stage for not being able, or for not being efficient enough, to realise, when his original Estimate was before the House, that a more realistic appraisal should have been made of the amount of money likely to be spent on telephone calls over the 12 months.  Here we have a Supplementary Estimate totalling £5,990 for telephone calls, almost £6,000 additional expenditure in the Department of Justice on telephone calls alone. Was there correct estimation on the part of the Minister and his advisers in regard to expenditure?</P>
    <P>On the Supplementary Estimate, Vote 30, I asked the Minister to break down the details under sub-head N.  I understand that portion of the £15,867 being asked for here is due to the cost of having the Department inspected by efficiency experts to see if it was possible to reduce the costs of the Department.  The main Estimate will give a better opportunity of dealing with that, but I want to refer to other items, namely the sum of over £8,000 for wireless equipment.  How did it come to be necessary to purchase extra wireless equipment to the tune of £8,000?  How was it not realised in time for the main Estimate?  Are we to take it that this supplementary sum has been spent on the purchase of walkie-talkie wireless sets used at the present moment along the Border?  I should like the Minister to clarify that position for us.</P>
    <P>These three Supplementary Estimates show quite clearly what is likely to come over the next 12 months. <Col N="124" /> When the people get the full bill of all these supplementaries on top of the main Estimates, whatever they thought of the last crowd in office, if they can lay their hands on the present bunch over the next 12 months, it is just God help them.</P>

      <P>The statement I made in opening gave, fairly reasonably, the reasons for coming into this House and seeking these extra sums.  They could not be avoided and they have been brought about by various causes.  In the case of the Garda Síochána, the additional sum required is mainly because more Gardaí have retired on pension than was anticipated.  Naturally we have to meet that extra cost.  There is no means by which we could avoid it.  As well as that it was necessary to include a provision for paying increases in subsistence allowance.  Not only had we to do that but we had to pay them retrospectively.</P>

If that situation did not exist it might not have been necessary to buy as many sets as have had to be purchased.  With any police force, or any other force used for the maintenance of law and order, we must at least secure the best possible equipment to deal with situations that may arise in the course of the duties of that force. I am happy to be able to say that, since we have got our forces along the Border properly and effectively equipped, that force has achieved considerable success in preserving that area from use by illegal forces.</P>
    <P>As I have said, these Estimates are brought about by reason of the fact that we have had to meet increased costs.  Increased transport costs have, to some extent, been brought about by reason of the activities along the Border to which I have referred&mdash;continuous patrolling and so on.  I do not know that we are doing anything wrong in taking that line of action.  We must provide the Garda Síochána with the most effective possible machine to deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>One Deputy referred to the fact that I should have had more foresight in dealing with these matters when I was bringing in the main Estimate.  He forgets that I was not responsible for that Estimate.  It was the Government which we succeeded that was responsible for preparing that main Estimate. As far as we were concerned we had to accept that the main Estimates were examined as effectively as we believe they were.  If circumstances arise in which increases of the type to which I have referred occur we cannot ignore them.  We must meet the extra charges. There was also the failure of the Appropriations-in-Aid to reach the anticipated amount.  That is something over which we had no control.  It may <Col N="126" /> possibly be enlarged upon in the main Estimate when it comes along.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with some of the points raised by Deputy Sweetman in speaking on the Vote on Account.  I had dealt with his allegation in connection with the ground limestone and I had shown that, in actual fact, there was an increase in the amount contributed by the Exchequer this year towards the subsidisation of that scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman went on to refer to wheat.  It might be considered amusing by some people to hear Deputy Sweetman or any other Fine Gael Deputy advocating the growth of wheat when everybody knows the record of the Fine Gael Party in respect of the growing of wheat.  They had, as their Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, a man who, throughout all the time when Fianna Fáil was trying to make this country produce as much home-grown wheat as it required for its own use, was a bitter opponent of the growing of any wheat whatever in this country.  There is hardly any need for me to remind Deputy Sweetman of Deputy Dillon's oft-expressed hope that he would live to see the day when not alone wheat, but also peat and beet, would go &ldquo;up the spout&rdquo;.  I want to remind him that he was wont to declare that he would not insult his land by growing wheat on it and that he would not be found dead in a field of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a great piece of effrontery now for Deputy Sweetman to adopt the role of defender of wheat-growing, in view of the record of his Party in regard to growing wheat at all.  If the actions of this Government in regard to meeting the loss on the disposal of surplus wheat are as disastrous as Deputy Sweetman would have <Col N="128" /> us believe, surely he should only be pleased about that, judging by the policy of his Party in the matter.  If these actions have the effect of making everybody go out of wheat production would that not be getting back to the state in which we were when Deputy Sweetman's Party under its then name of Cumann na nGaedheal were in control here?  Would not that be getting the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;back to the position in which the Fine Gael Party tried to keep it and from which the advance was so strenuously opposed by them?  Fianna Fáil's policy has been to get sufficient wheat grown to meet our requirements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That has always been our policy; we never aimed at having a surplus of wheat for export.  The fact is that in these Estimates there is an increase in the provision to meet losses on the disposal of surplus wheat; £650,000 more has been provided this year.  If there is increased production there will be a slight reduction in the price for wheat&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the Minister said in Nenagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that is due to the fact that we are now producing more wheat than is required here for our own needs.  The national income will not support the taxation that would be necessary to raise sufficient money to give the full price for an unlimited quantity of wheat.  I do not blame anybody who is a wheat producer for trying to get the highest possible price for it, but with the increased yields now being obtained it is obvious that the present price is reasonably remunerative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman referred to the meeting at Nenagh which I attended and at which there were motions seeking an increase in the amount of money provided to meet wheat losses.  The delegates at the convention who put in these motions were themselves people interested in the question and <Col N="129" /> they made a very creditable case to secure increased remuneration for wheat growing.  I did not blame them for that; I merely had to explain to them that it was not possible to provide sufficient money to give the same price for wheat which would have to be either exported or used for animal feed as for the wheat to be used to make flour for the production of bread.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to bacon. Again Deputy Sweetman attempted to convey the impression that there had been a reduction in the amount provided to support the price for bacon. Actually the position is that, due to circumstances outside our control, the price that can be obtained for exported bacon has dropped and if the Exchequer were to provide sufficient money to maintain the price paid to producers at what it was it would impose a burden on the Exchequer which could not be sustained by our economy. But in spite of the difficult financial circumstances which are still with us after the Coalition's period of office, we have provided an increased amount for this purpose, an increase of £580,000 for subsidising exports of surplus bacon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman also attempted to convey the impression that the Government had effected a reduction in the price of barley.  In fact, feeding barley is only a small proportion of the total grown and in the case of barley grown for malting, the price is fixed between the maltsters and the growers.  The price of feeding barley has to be considered in conjunction with the bacon industry, since barley is one of the essential constituents in that industry.</P>
    <P>Again in connection with milk, there is an increase of £734,000 in the butter subsidy.  We in Fianna Fáil fully realise the importance of the dairying industry, that it is the basis of the cattle trade, and we did not want to do anything which would adversely affect that industry, but it appears that there may be a very large surplus of butter and although there is this increased provision it may mean there will be a reduction in price, but certainly we have gone as far as possible under existing financial circumstances in providing <Col N="130" /> this sum for the butter subsidy. I think it is a generally accepted principle that, if there are increased yields, usually a small reduction in the rate payable can be absorbed and there can still be increased total income. I should like to see the same prices even when yields go up but it was not possible to provide sufficient money to do that on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman attempted to convey the impression that during the election campaign Fianna Fáil had made a specific promise to remove each and every one of the special import levies which he imposed in 1956.  We did not undertake to abolish these levies.  The complaint that we did make about them was that they had been imposed in an indiscriminate way, in such a way as to have an immediate adverse effect on employment.  When we came into office we removed some of these import levies and reduced others.  We did that in respect of those particular items where the levy had the most serious and most direct adverse effect on employment.  By doing that we gave a much needed stimulus to trade and industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman went on to refer to motions which were down for discussion at that meeting in Nenagh in connection with unemployment.  Here again Deputy Sweetman would have been wiser not to have referred to the unemployment position at all.  I shall just quote from the circular issued by the Central Statistics Office on 6th March, the figures for unemployment for the week ended 1st March this year and for the corresponding periods in 1957 and 1956.  The present figure is 82,450.  This time last year it was 91,194 and in the previous year it was 71,092.  That means that in the last year in which Deputy Sweetman was Minister for Finance, there was an increase of 20,000 in the number on the live register.  In other words, in the last year that Deputy Sweetman was Minister for Finance, there was an increase of 28.3 per cent. in the number of unemployed.  That was Deputy Sweetman's record for his last year in office.</P>

      <P>In spite of the situation that the previous Government left, we have gone a considerable distance towards doing that.  In spite of the difficult financial position left to us to deal with, we took certain steps, even in our first year of office, to create the conditions under which it would be possible for our economy to expand and for increased employment to be provided.  I have already referred to one of the steps that were taken, namely, the removal of the most harmful of the import levies imposed by Deputy Sweetman and the reduction <Col N="133" /> of some of the others.  In addition to that, when we came into office the building industry had completely collapsed because of the fact that the small dwellings loans were practically unavailable.  We took steps to make those loans more freely available and while, as I said in Nenagh, unemployment is still heavy and is still heavy in the building industry, there is at least some employment in it; there was practically none when we came into office.</P>

      <P>In spite of the difficult financial situation that we had to deal with, in the Budget that the Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, introduced last year we provided incentives for increased production, particularly for export.  He gave an indication that it was this Government's intention to encourage production and the steps taken in producing a balanced Budget helped towards the restoration of confidence in the Government, which was one of the first essentials towards creating those conditions.  The main step first of all, towards doing away with the conditions of continually increasing unemployment, and then towards creating conditions in which it would be possible for employment to increase, was taken by the people themselves when they put the Coalition Government out of office and put back the Fianna Fáil Government with a sufficiently strong majority to give us a stable Government here, a Government with a policy that was known, particularly in regard to industry.</P>

      <P>The people gave the country that stable Government with a known policy in place of a Coalition Government whose policy was only made up from day to day and that had no definite plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of having a stable Government with a policy of fostering industry is that industrialists are now in a position to plan.  They know that there will be a stable Government here <Col N="134" /> and they can make their plans accordingly. They know also that there is no danger of the idea of the Leader of the Labour section of the Coalition gaining any support in the Government, in other words, the opinion that he expressed, when he was in Opposition, that the majority of our industrialists here should be behind bars.</P>
    <P>They know that now there is a Government in office with a policy of fostering industry, and under those conditions there is every likelihood that industry will progress, that our economy will expand, and employment will increase.  Even in our first year we have gone a considerable way towards creating those conditions. However, the progress we have made must be considered in relation to the situation that we took over.  Deputy Sweetman maintained that in regard to our balance of payments position, as he put it, the corner had been turned when we took office.  In actual fact, in the last year the Coalition were in office the deficit in our balance of payments was £14.4 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to quote also the figures for the previous Coalition when Fianna Fáil took over in 1951.  In the year 1951 the deficit was £61.6 million, and when Fianna Fáil went out of office in 1954 that had been reduced to practically negligible proportions, to £5.5 million.  Here again there are indications that this bar to increased employment has also been removed.  The prospects appear to be that there will be, if anything, a <Col N="135" /> favourable position in regard to that in this year.</P>
      <P>All these things have helped to create the conditions necessary for expansion. The Fianna Fáil Government have in this their first year in office, given proof that we have the right ideas in this regard both by encouraging industry and, in spite of difficulties, providing these increased amounts for agriculture. It is a pity that Deputy Sweetman did not in this debate maintain the attitude that he expressed in the Vote on Account in 1956 when he concluded his speech by saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We must realise that prosperity is not to be had for the asking.  We cannot vote ourselves progressive increases in our standard of living. These must be earned by producing more efficiently a greater volume of goods and services.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The whole difference between Fianna Fáil and the Parties opposite is that we have expressed these sentiments both in and out of office.  Deputy Sweetman expressed them in 1956 but, judging by his speech to-day, he seems to be going back to the position of trying to implant in the minds of the public that it is merely by voting for a particular <Col N="136" /> Party that unemployment can be solved and that a higher standard of living and better conditions can be secured.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister for Defence if he believes sincerely in all the things he has just told us.  If he does he is a very innocent man.  I think some of his more glib colleagues in the Cabinet are pulling the wool over his eyes and that, instead of occupying a ministerial chair he should be in the cradle still. The Minister for Defence, in common with the Minister for Finance when he presented the Vote on Account to the House, does not seem to have any idea what Government policy is.</P>
      <P>Again I ask at this stage will somebody on that side of the House say what the Fianna Fáil Government policy is for the coming year?  The people are entitled to know that.  The Taoiseach says one thing.  The Minister for Finance says another.  The Minister for Defence says something else and Deputy Corry then contradicts the whole lot of them.  In relation to this Vote on Account there seems to be an attitude of helplessness on the part of the Government.  There is one remarkable thing, which I will deal with later, running through the whole system of their financial methods of running the country that is revealed by the Book of Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government says they are short of money and have proceeded to make cuts, and it is very interesting to see exactly where the cuts are being made. Coming from the country myself, I must take into account that first we have a cut in the farm buildings scheme of the Department of Agriculture of £140,000.  Provision in respect of the Local Authorities (Works) Act is completely cut out. After the appointment of a Gaeltacht Minister&mdash;the Taoiseach said on a previous occasion that there should not be a Minister for the Gaeltacht&mdash; Gaeltacht housing, one of the principal benefits conferred by that Department is cut.  This is followed&mdash;again it is the rural areas&mdash;by a cut of £700,000 in <Col N="137" /> housing although the Minister for Defence has told us that when they took office they found housing had been practically at a standstill.  If it was at a standstill a year ago, how will the cut of £700,000 affect it for the coming year?  Is that supposed to give it an injection of new blood?</P>
    <P>Forestry has been cut, the Minister tells, us, by £20,000.  I want to correct the Minister for Finance.  The main part of forestry has been cut by £113,000.  The Minister for Finance should know that the business end of the whole Forestry Department comes under sub-head C.2., the business of establishing plantations, fencing and draining, and that has been cut by £113,000.  The Land Commission has been cut in relation to the most important sub-head, which is sub-head I., the sub-head that gives the Land Commission freedom to execute the works they have to do such as migration, improvement of estates, and so on.  That has been cut by £20,000, something which did not happen from the time we first took office in 1948 until now.</P>
    <P>Public Works have been cut by £204,000 and Urban Employment Schemes by £60,000.  There is one thing running through the whole gamut of economies, or so-called economies put into effect in this Book of Estimates by the present Government, and that is that it is the people of rural Ireland who are being hammered every time.  This time last year the present Government were flushed with victory after winning an election on a shoal of false promises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>False promises they knew they could not fulfil.  We had the Taoiseach in Belmullet telling us food subsidies would not be removed on any account and any suggestion to that effect was so much vile propaganda on the part of the out-going inter-Party Government at the time. We were told there were 100,000 new jobs to be got for the men and women of this country.  But, instead of that, <Col N="138" /> we have the Minister for Defence telling us to-night that unemployment has eased by something like 9 per cent.  He did not tell us what the figure for emigration is.  If the emigration that has taken place within the last 12 months had not occurred, then the unemployment problem would be absolutely staggering.  It is a lucky thing for the present Government that England is there to absorb the boatloads of boys and girls who have to fly from the country, and not alone boys and girls but fathers and mothers, too, and whole families tearing themselves up by the roots and clearing out of the country.</P>
      <P>The Government say they are short of money.  No one can get a housing loan or a housing grant at the present time.  I heard complaints to-day that those who have carried out land reclamation cannot get the grants from the Department of Agriculture.  The Government say they have no money. It might be no harm now to point out three advantages they have that we did not have last year.  The first is Deputy Sweetman's scheme of prize bonds, which amounted to £5,000,000 by the time the present Government took office.  That was £5,000,000 that we did not have at our disposal.  We did not have the £9,000,000 that the present Government collared from the working people and the small farmers by the removal of the subsidies on bread and butter.  That is £14,000,000 the present Government has that we did not have.  Apart from that, the confidence we had created throughout the country caused the loan they floated to be subscribed in full, £10,000,000, giving them a total of £24,000,000 that we did not have.  Yet, they say now they are short of money.</P>
      <P>I notice the Minister made a slight boast to-day to the effect that the figure which appears on the Book of Estimates is down this year.  In actual fact it is not down.  To that figure must be added the £9,000,000 that the Government took by the removal of the subsidies on the working man's bread and butter.  We had to provide that last year.  We were prepared to provide it.  The present Government has not had to provide it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> I want to turn now to the statements made by the Minister for Defence on wheat and butter and milk and bacon. The farmers want to know where they stand in relation to the present Government.  They have been coaxed into producing wheat and, now that they have produced it, they are told they are doing damage by producing enough.  The Minister for Defence told us it was the policy of the Government to produce enough wheat for our own needs.  A short time ago the Taoiseach told us that was not the policy of the Government; the policy of the Government was to produce two-thirds of our requirements and import one-third hard wheat from Manitoba.  Which of the two statements is the truth?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Tell me now without a blackboard.  As far as I can judge the Taoiseach's old habit is still strong within him; he likes to play ducks and drakes with the agricultural industry. At first he was glad that the English market was gone, and gone for good; to-day he is thanking God for the one bright spot in the agricultural industry, namely, our cattle trade with England &mdash;the cattle trade that he tried to kill. He spent 16 years trying to get the people to grow wheat and the people did not grow wheat until Deputy Dillon came to office.  He was the first Minister for Agriculture who succeeded in getting the people to produce a surplus and he was told, of course, that he had no right to do that; it was wrong to produce enough wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Defence was at great pains to go back 16 or 20 years to pick up statements made by Deputy Dillon.  It was Deputy Dillon who put agriculture on its feet through the <Col N="140" /> ground limestone scheme and land reclamation.  Unfortunately the present Minister for Agriculture has adopted the policy of &ldquo;kill whatever your opponents do&rdquo; and that is the only theme I can see running through all the cuts being made here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>The Minister for Defence roamed over all these while the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was in the Chair.  Perhaps he should not have been allowed to do that.  I am merely answering some of the points he made. He made some very nasty statements about Deputy Dillon which, since they were false, should not be allowed to go unanswered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister now if he will let the farmers know where they stand.  They are accused of doing a disservice to the country by producing enough bacon, wheat and milk.  What exactly are they to do? It is time that Fianna Fáil announced some policy other than the policy of meddling with what they do not understand. That is exactly what Fianna Fáil have been doing all along, tampering with the farmers simply because they are not organised and it is easy to play on them.  Fianna Fáil has always regarded the agricultural industry as something to play with, something to fiddle with and something to toy with.  First, the farmers are asked to produce enough and, when they produce enough, they are told they are doing a disservice to the country.  It is no wonder we have a flight from the land.  We have the best agricultural land in Europe and the <Col N="141" /> most salubrious agricultural climate in Europe.  Yet, we have a flight from the land unparalleled since the days of the famine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the cut of £222,000 in the ground limestone subsidy scheme.  That scheme was initiated by the inter-Party Government through Deputy Dillon.  I submit it is something that is absolutely essential.  Any person who has any contact with rural Ireland knows that the whole agricultural output of the country suffered in the years gone by because the land was acid and badly needed lime.  When the limestone business is just getting into full swing, this comes as a death blow to it.  It will have the effect of driving up the cost to the farmer by between 4/- and 5/- per ton.  It will affect agricultural output.  We are largely dependent on the land for our standard of living, whether we live in town, city or village, and any tampering with that will have disastrous results in a few years' time.  I believe the Government could have made a saving in some direction other than that.</P>
      <P>It is time that a reappraisal of the whole structure of Government spending should be made by some competent commission.  Money is being wasted in some directions while other worthwhile projects, which would give useful employment, are being starved and not attended to.  It does not matter what Government is in power, it would be a step in the right direction if some competent economist examined our position to see where we are going. The time has come when that is an urgent necessity.  I could say where savings could be made&mdash;and perhaps I might point out something which would do immense damage.  No doubt every Deputy has his own ideas on the subject, as has the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the wealth of the country <Col N="142" /> is not being channelled in the right direction and I have a good deal of company when I think along those lines.  Everybody knows that, while the drain of emigration goes on, we have an undeveloped country.  Everybody is wondering why it is we can find plenty of money for certain things and cannot find money for employment and for the useful development of our country.  In the years before the last war, people said that England could not find any money to give employment to the unemployed walking the streets there, but the very minute war started, it was said England could find £12,000,000 or £14,000,000 a day to prosecute a war. The people of this country are thinking along the same lines.  We can find plenty of money for many things, for new air runways and so on, but we cannot find anything for the useful development of our country.  It is time there should be a reappraisal of our whole economy in that direction.</P>

      <P>Eight or nine months ago, when speaking on the various Estimates, we in the Labour Benches made it quite clear we were not taking it on ourselves to be critical of the Government or of the individual Ministers. We believed then that it was right and proper that they should at least get a period of 12 months to let us see what form their policy was taking. At this stage we are, unfortunately, in a position to be more critical of the Government and of the various departmental Estimates that will be before the House from now on.</P>
      <P>A while ago the Minister for Defence drew attention to the necessity for a constructive approach when speaking on this important subject.  Unfortunately, I am afraid that while he had the best intentions in the world, the Minister was not very constructive in his own approach.  He drew attention to the fact that in his opinion it was because of the unfulfilled promises of the Coalition Government, as he said, that the people decided last year that that Government should be outsed.  If that is true, it is an extraordinary fact when we realise that it has happened to all Parties since 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister for Defence is correct <Col N="143" /> in his assumption, it must mean that the people realised in 1948 that Fianna Fáil were not telling the truth.  It must have happened again to the Coalition in 1951 when there was a change from inter-Party to Fianna Fáil; in 1954 to Fianna Fáil and in 1957 to the inter-Party again.  I believe it is more important for us to understand ourselves, to arrange for a programme to put before the people and to stand or fall by it, than to speak in a critical or destructive manner of the policies of other Parties. On this important matter it is more important for us to draw attention to what we believe is wrong rather than waste time in quoting from other people's speeches at election time.</P>
    <P>However, we are bound to draw particular attention to the position to-day in comparison with the position last year when an inter-Party Government had been in power for the full 12 months.  We can remember 1956 when the present Minister for Finance and his colleagues were sitting in the Opposition Benches.  We can remember how critical they were.  They were not very anxious to be constructive in their approach to the problems existing them.  Each and every one of us must remember the various issues of the paper <i>An Gléas</i> which month after month drew attention to the prices of every item increased.  Surely the Front Bench members of the present Government must remember that?  Should they expect members in any other part of the House to be less critical of them and their policy?</P>
    <P>We all know that the Fianna Fáil Party held office for the best part of 20 years.  While perhaps there may be excuses for irresponsibility on the part of well-intentioned people who might not have much experience in government, there is no such excuse for members of a Party who held office for so many years and who tell us at this stage that it is not fair to be critical of them while they themselves used every device, in this Chamber and outside it, to draw attention to what they considered were increases in the prices of various commodities affecting the cost of living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> It is natural that throughout the length and breadth of the Twenty-Six Counties comparisons are being made in relation to two very important items: (1) the cost of living, and (2) the question of employment and emigration.  It strikes me very forcibly that when we speak of the cost of living we should not forget the line of approach to that question of the present Government when in opposition a few years ago. Surely the Minister for Fiance and the Taoiseach cannot forget that plastered all over Cork City, they had a monster poster showing the loaf of bread with a slice off it?  They expected, and they did, secure increased votes by that poster.  Will they not now show that poster to the people of Cork City with the slice still missing but with two increases in price added to it?  The Taoiseach, no matter how interested he may be in statistics, must know that whether it be in Cork or in Dublin the increase in the cost of the loaf of bread is a major problem for the housewife.  He surely must know that under the direction of Fianna Fáil Ministers two increases have taken place in the price of the loaf.</P>
    <P>Again, we had under discussion last week the total cost of the subsidy for the export of butter.  I am not blaming the present Government for their approach to that.  It is quite true that they may have company on my left hand in relation to the wisdom or otherwise of such export subsidies. However, we cannot forget that the working people of the various cities, towns and villages have justification for the complaint that while subsidies carry Irish butter abroad to be sold cheaply they have to pay much more for the same butter here at home.  The present Government must bear responsibility in that regard since it was made quite clear by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and the present Taoiseach that they would not reduce such subsidies if returned to office.</P>
    <P>Much has been said, and is being said, throughout the country in relation to wheat prices.  I shall not deal with this matter at any length.  The time for that will be when the various <Col N="145" /> Estimates come up for consideration, but I will say, in a general overall way, that the real origin of the failure of the present Government is the fact that their overall policy in relation to agriculture is lopsided.  Whatever may be said in relation to the price of wheat and barley the problem is that the overall policy regarding agriculture is based on a political basis concerned more with changes of Government rather than facing up to the problem from an economic viewpoint.</P>
    <P>It is not many years ago since millions of pounds were provided for agriculture.  That money and the interest thereon must be repaid.  Year after year a certain amount of money, whether by subsidy or by indirect means, is being poured into agriculture and we also know that, over the years, that money has not produced the desired effect.  Fianna Fáil must bear responsibility in relation to the agricultural policy.  Throughout Dublin, Cork and various parts of the country potatoes are now costing the housewife 5/- per 21 lb.  That is because of the lopsided view which has been taken in relation to the overall cost of wheat and barley and the fact that agriculturists were not advised to operate on a balanced economy of a fair return of the various crops which would give a guaranteed price.</P>
    <P>Whether he was right or wrong time will prove, but Deputy Dillon, when Minister for Agriculture, did offer one important asset to the agricultural community and that was a fixed price over a number of years.  How can we expect, and how can the Minister for Fiance who holds such an important post, expect, an even return of the various agricultural commodities when the prices for these commodities vary, not over a period of years but from season to season?  That is all I wish to say in relation to agriculture except to point out again that two of the important items which have a great effect on the cost of living, bread and butter, have been increased by this Government.  The present Government must give us the answer as to why, in their wisdom, they decided, on the one hand, that butter should be <Col N="146" /> subsidised so that it could be sold in England at a reduced price, and, on the other hand, they decided that the people at home should have to pay more.</P>
    <P>It may be said that because the surplus was there it was necessary to export it.  That may be but coupled with this whole question of the cost of living in our small country must be the problems of unemployment and emigration.  Twelve months ago speaker after speaker of the then Opposition drew attention to the terrible problem of unemployment.  They were right in doing so and we in the Labour Party made it quite clear that a Government which would wish to put the question of emigration and unemployment into the background would be wrong in their approach.</P>
    <P>Where do we stand now?  Here this evening the Minister for Defence made comparisons between the figures relating to unemployment this year as against last year.  It is true to say that this time last year it was a tragedy and a heartache to many of us to know that there were so many people unemployed.  Quite rightly Deputies then in Opposition condemned us for it.  The Minister for Defence, when speaking in this evening's debate, told us that there was an increase in employment of about 9 per cent. this year.  A member of this House had a question down for answer to-day and the answer given to that question must be inaccurate and incorrect.  The question asked for the number of persons in industrial employment and agricultural employment in the years 1956 and 1957.</P>
    <P>The answer given here to-day was most interesting&mdash;the total number in industrial and agricultural employment in 1956 amounted to 729,000 persons. In 1957 the total employed in industrial and agricultural pursuits amounted to 705,000, 24,000 fewer than in 1956.  Yet the Minister tells us that, comparing the figures for the different years, things are doing well under Fianna Fáil.  If a reduction of 24,000 in the number of people earning their livelihood is &ldquo;doing well&rdquo; there must be something wrong with the Fianna Fáil idea of what is beneficial for the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> It is essential that we draw the attention of the Government to some of the works that will be included in the Estimates we must deal with.  The Minister for Defence referred to money spent under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I do not know whether he has been a member of a local authority, but we remember that the late Minister for Local Government, Mr. T.J. Murphy, was lacerated by the Fianna Fáil Opposition in 1948 when introducing that measure.  There was one or two notable exceptions in the Opposition at that time, and I give them credit for it, but generally, that Minister was condemned from the start in introducing that important Bill.  Down the country, when comparing the volume of work made available in different years when money was provided under the Local Authorities (Works) Acts was against the last 12 months, we know what it has meant. Without it, there was financial loss to road workers and other sections of the community in various areas.  That Act did not suit the Opposition at that time and I am convinced this money has been slashed because of that, as made clear last year in the Budget or in the Estimates.  But it seems obvious to us that the Government failed to realise they were not injuring the political Parties who introduced this measures but were directly injuring thousands of men and their families who were dependent on local works for their living.</P>
    <P>Housing has been mentioned.  I do not know what is happening there.  I was critical of the situation which I knew existed a little before the change of Government but it is fantastic for any member of the present Government to say that we are around the corner in regard to housing.  Fewer people are now employed in housing than were employed last year.  What is the remedy for that?  Government speakers told us that money is now being made available more or less freely for house-building loans.  It is available neither to individuals nor to local authorities as far as the experience of some of us goes.  Housing schemes are held up simply because of red tape, not by Department officials <Col N="148" /> but by directives from Ministers and the Government as a whole.  Every housing scheme has the two-fold advantage of giving employment and providing homes for people; yet house-building is held up because of Government policy.</P>
    <P>As members of local authorities we know that hardly a meeting of a county council or corporation passes that there is not some letter, stricture or indirect order from some Department in regard to economy.  That does not help local authorities and unfortunately, whether or not the Government or the individual Ministers realise it, it is essential for local authorities to operate either on housing or roads.  In many instances the men concerned have no alternative to working on roads but to work for local authorities.</P>
    <P>When we make comparisons of the numbers employed in 1956 and 1957 it must be quite obvious to everybody, whether supporting or opposing the Government, that much of the trouble existing has been brought about by the conservative policy of Fianna Fáil. Ten months ago, perhaps, on various occasions when problems developed, members supporting the Government were able to fall back on accusations against the outgoing Administration and were always able to say that the inter-Party Government left everything wrong.  It is late in the day to say that now; practically 12 months have passed and thing are more wrong in many ways now.  Is it not time Government supporters woke up to their responsibility and understood that they are in charge, supporting the Government in control and that they should not blame individuals and Parties in opposition because of what they did years ago?</P>
    <P>It is but right that we should mention one or two of the items of which we are critical.  We are told that the money problem is a big one.  Fianna Fáil Deputies here and at local authority meetings say that one of the problems from which this country has suffered for the past few years is credit restriction.  I say the present Government is not solely to blame for that. Our position was made clear long ago both in conference and in this Chamber. <Col N="149" /> We did not agree with the over-all credit restriction policy adopted by the inter-Party Government for the six or eight months before the last election.  Fianna Fáil made it clear to the community that, not only were they against such credit restriction, but that they would provide the necessary funds to create employment. Coupled with that is the famous £100,000,000 plan.  It is a couple of years since that plan was formulated. What has happened since?  The Minister for Lands in a recent statement explained that that was but the blueprint. A blueprint is often considered the final draft from which the operative works.  If the £100,000,000 scheme was in the blueprint stage two or three years ago, I do not see how a Minister can make the case now that they are only working on it.</P>
    <P>We must all understand that the policy of credit restriction has hampered the industrialist, the agriculturist and the community as a whole. The wiseacres may say that we dare not discuss the financial connections at the present time.  We know that credit restriction has been the direct cause of there being 5,000,000 unemployed in the U.S.A. at the present time.  They are wise enough there to understand that it is essential to ease credit restriction.  Will we have to wait eight or ten years to realise that the policy that has been the cause of trouble in other countries and that is being discarded by them is causing many of our young men and women to take the emigrant ship?  That has been the case during the last 12 months and, before that, during the period of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>Two or three years ago the present Taoiseach made an extraordinary admission at a Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis.  I believe that the realised then the financial problem confronting this country.  He said then that time was when he believed that there would be no trouble in getting money to finance the various projects for industrial improvement. Two or three years ago he realised that that policy was out of date.  We must consider the consequences that flow from our being tied to our present financial connections.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman can take credit <Col N="150" /> for the moneys saved as a result of the levies.  To a certain extent, certain sections of the community may have a more stable bank balance now as a result of credit restrictions.  Other people who unwittingly overstepped the mark in borrowing from the bank are now in a difficult position.  I consider that the Government has responsibility not merely to one section but to the community as a whole.  There is one important point.  At the present time when Ministers and the Taoiseach are bemoaning the hard time and telling us that there is a long hard road to travel before we return to economic stability, many sections of the community are enjoying life a great deal more than they did three, four or ten years ago.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Blowick said, if sacrifices are to be made, the Government must understand that the sacrifices must be shared by all.  They are not being shared by all.  There are members of this House who, because of their connections, must know in their hearts that the profits of some are such that they need never worry about the rainy day, that the bonus shares that were issued during the last 12 years have changed the position for many an industrialist. I do not mind the childlike statement of the member of the House who drew attention to what Deputy Norton said at one time about iron bars.  There are people in this country whom it might be no harm to have behind iron bars.  Perhaps that applies to people in every section of the community.  Because Deputy Norton dared to draw attention to the profits made by some individuals and groups, he was attacked.</P>

      <P>For the enlightenment of the Deputy who, because of his connection with many firms, must understand the position very well, profit in itself is justifiable and legitimate but there is such a thing as excess profit and the bonus shares that were issued in Dublin and Cork must be considered. While we are told that things are in a bad way and while the Minister <Col N="151" /> for Finance may conclude this debate in his own jolly manner, while we are told that money cannot be provided for important agricultural projects, while the housewife must suffer by the Government policy of removing the subsidy on bread and butter, the Government finds it suitable and convenient to establish a new air service to America.  I do not object to an air service but when the Minister for Health and other Ministers issue circulars which are tantamount to telling local authorities not to give an increase to their employees, is it right and proper, for the purpose of national prestige, to start air trips to America? I leave it at that.</P>
      <P>I know many Deputies supporting the present Government and have known them for years.  Perhaps one advantage we have in this House is that, while we differ, we appreciate one another's qualities.  Knowing these Deputies as I do, I appeal to them.  We can do nothing in opposition. The Government have a majority.  I would say good luck to that majority if I could believe that it would be used for the benefit of the community, but when the people throughout the Twenty-Six Counties are clamouring against a policy that is creating hardships daily, surely it is not too much to ask those supporting the Government to use their influence with the Minister for Fiance and the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Government could in its lifetime introduce measures which would be beneficial to the country one man and one man alone would be entitled to the credit and that would be the Taoiseach.  If they are to introduce measures which in themselves are harmful and disastrous for the economic welfare of our people the man to be blamed is the Taoiseach. We all know that when the present Government, many of whom have been members of this House for many years, left their seats here in February or March of last year to face the electorate very few, if any, of them, had the hope of coming back to this House with an over-all majority.  The credit for securing that over-all majority&mdash;it <Col N="152" /> is immaterial in this context whether the method of getting it was justified or not&mdash;goes to the Taoiseach.  Let him realise that if they succeed he will get the credit but that if they fail, in the autumn of his life, he will have to take responsibility for a policy which is being imposed upon the people and which will impose unjustifiable hardship on them.</P>
    <P>If members opposite are fair to their leader and to themselves they will understand that the Vote on Account as presented to us and which indirectly is being presented to every man and woman in the country, is not in any way beneficial and will not be in any way helpful economically to the various sections of the community during this year or during the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Book of Estimates which has been published gives us a clear outline of the financial policy of the present Government.  It indicates quite definitely the objectives of that policy and the methods by which they hope to achieve their objectives.  It seems absolutely clear to me that the main emphasis of that policy&mdash;and that emphasis keeps cropping up again and again under every heading in the Book of Estimates&mdash;is to the effect that Government expenditure as such must be kept to the existing level, at the same time ensuring that adequate finances are available for every desirable productive national project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the other Ministers have achieved a remarkable success in the presentation of these Estimates to the House.  I calculate that as between the Estimates for 1957-58 and 1958-59 there is an over-all reduction in expenditure of £4.8 million.  I must say that I agree with Deputy Sweetman to some extent there is not quite following the Minister's comparative figures, but I am sure that that can be straightened out.  My calculations are that the Book of Estimates as published for 1957-58 contemplated an expenditure of £112,500,000 approximately.  That was reduced downwards in the Budget statement to £106,000,000-odd and if we take into account the Supplementary <Col N="153" /> Estimates which have been introduced for 1957-58, the Estimates for 1957-58, including the supplementaries, come to £114.8 million.  If we compare that with the published total in the 1958-59 Book of Estimates of £110,000,000, it seems clear that the net over-all reduction as between the Estimates for one year and the other is £4.8 million.</P>
    <P>I regard that as a very significant and important achievement on the part of the Minister.  The real significance and importance of that reduction lie in the fact that it has been achieved while at the same time ensuring that moneys have been made available, in a number of cases in increased amounts, for every productive national project that there is.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be taken for one moment as subscribing to the theory that a reduction of Government expenditure is an end in itself or that it is in all circumstances a good thing.  That to me would be a completely defeatist outlook to take and it would be a very restrictive way of looking at the value of monetary policy as a weapon in the hands of the Government to achieve economic expansion and prosperity. In fact it would be completely against the best modern economic thought here, in Britain or America. As a general principle, therefore, I do not think the mere reducing of Government expenditure as such is necessarily a good thing at all times.  However, having said that it must also be said that, at the present time, in our present financial circumstances and in the state of our national economy, there can be no doubt whatever but that national Government expenditure must be trimmed to a level at which it will equate with resources produced by taxation.</P>
    <P>In that respect I think Deputy Sweetman is mistaken when he says that he could not find out what the financial policy of the Government is. That policy is quite clear.  The present Government is on record as stating that in its opinion taxation, in our present circumstances, is at the maximum level to which it can go and that the danger is that if taxation were increased any further yields would decline. <Col N="154" /> We also stated clearly that we did not think that the practice of recent years of financing, year after year, Budget deficits by borrowing could continue.  Having put those two propositions clearly and accepted them, the only logical outcome is that we must prevent Government expenditure from rising and if possible, in so far as it is wasteful or useless, non-productive or not socially necessary, it must be reduced.  As I have said, the reduction of £4.8 million which I calculate the Minister has achieved in presenting the Book of Estimates is a very creditable and significant one.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, like the famous classical economist, is faced with the problem of distributing scarce means between alternative ends. In so far as he has tackled that problem, he has recorded a notable success. He has achieved this very significant reduction while, at the same time, providing additional moneys for a considerable number of desirable productive projects.  More money is made available for the Industrial Development Authority.  Increased capital is placed at the disposal of An Foras Tionscal.  Money is made available for what I regard as productive enterprises, namely, Shannon, Dublin and Cork Airports.  Additional money has been provided for education in primary schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard technical education as of vital importance and <Col N="155" /> particularly valuable from the productive point of view.  One very significant feature is the increased provision of £2,500,000 in the Vote for Agriculture. I know all of us would like to see more resources flowing into farming. It would be a great thing if, like Great Britain, we could pump £300,000,000 into farming by subsidising our agricultural community, but we just cannot afford to do it.  The resources are not at our disposal.  The Exchequer could not possibly stand up to subsidies such as the Opposition are demanding.  It must go on record that, despite everything that has been said about the price of wheat, milk and bacon, an additional £2,500,000 is being found this year for agriculture.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the Book of Estimates is very important remembering that one of the big tasks facing the Government in getting the national economy moving forward again is procuring a return of confidence and a desire for expansion on the part of the business community.  The one thing that influences a business community psychologically to get cracking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to Deputy Desmond's point about profits and bonus shares. Personally, I have never received a bonus share.  But I do not think there is anything wrong in bonus shares.  The only fund available to finance expansion and bring about employment is that which derives from profits whether they be industrialists', shopkeepers' or farmers'.  If I were a workingman I would prefer to work for a company or firm making steady profits rather than for some bankrupt organisation struggling to exist.  Once and for all, let us get rid of this cant that there is something <Col N="156" /> illegal, immoral or wrong in profits.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman spoke at some length on the proposals that were put forward for a full employment policy. I would direct his attention to the fact that the title of that pamphlet was: &ldquo;Proposals for a Full Employment Policy.&rdquo;  In other words a clear distinction was made between proposals and policy.  The proposals were put forward, as was pointed out by the Minister for Defence, as a basis for discussion at the time within our own Fianna Fáil organisation.  The time at which these proposals were put forward for discussion was just prior to the disastrous year of 1956 when Deputy Sweetman was unable to have his national loan fully subscribed for the first time in the history of this country.</P>

As far as my recollection goes, that is the gist of what was said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Full employment is the objective of the Fianna Fáil organisation. It always has been and it always will be.  Fianna Fáil will never regard its work as completed until full employment has been achieved.  The present Government is working unremittingly to bring about a reduction in unemployment, a reduction in emigration, and an expansion of industrial and agricultural production.  But they have also made it abundantly clear that there is not, and never has been, any magic wand that can be waved to bring about that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stated policy of the Government in this matter is that it is only by continued, steady and unremitting progress that the objective of full employment can be reached.  In that regard there is no secret or mystery about the present Government's financial policy.  It is clearly outlined in this Book of Estimates that we want to reduce any element of unproductiveness or waste in Government expenditure, provide all possible finance <Col N="158" /> required for productive enterprises and thereby bring about the only possible state of affairs in which employment, industrial activity and production generally can start to rise again.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about it, and nobody in this House will deny it, that in 1956 the country ran into a serious financial crisis which very seriously threatened the whole basis of our finances as a nation.  Until such time as the Government, by careful, determined hard work can restore soundness and order in the nation's finances, we cannot go ahead and achieve the expansion of employment which we require.  In so far as the Book of Estimates published gives quite clearly the desire and intention of the Government in that regard, we can quite safely support the Minister in this Vote on Account.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Haughey and other Deputies in the entertaining, if rather elusive search for the Government's policy.  I want to take as my starting point in this search some contributions made to the Budget discussion last year by the present Minister for Defence, on the one hand, and Deputy Corry, on the other.  Starting with that solid basis, I want to inquire from the House where we have got in the last 12 months towards the implementation of that policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall do it softly.  The Minister for Defence talking here on the 15th May, 1957, on the Budget discussion had this to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In my opinion and in the opinion of any fair-minded person who even now goes back and looks over the speeches made in the election campaign, it is beyond all doubt that we were put in here as a Government to take the necessary steps to remedy the situation of mass unemployment and emigration brought about by the previous Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later on, on the same occasion, as reported at column 1288, the Minister for Defence said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" />&ldquo;The people who have been affected by that unemployment and resulting emigration have put their faith in Fianna Fáil to remedy this situation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>According to the Minister for Defence, speaking here in May, 1957, there was no doubt at all about it.  The task which Fianna Fáil had to tackle in the 12 months which lay ahead of them was to end emigration and unemployment. I want to ask the House in a minute to consider the position after 12 months, but before I do that it might be as well, for the sake of Deputies representing rural constituencies, to know how Deputy Corry viewed the results of the election and to see what Deputy Corry thought at the time was the future for the wheat growers of this country.  Speaking on the same date, the 15th May, 1957, as reported at column 1372, Deputy Corry had this to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Thousands of farmers, when they found that gang was on the run&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that gang being the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;started ploughing and growing wheat.  The extra acres are in and the wheat is growing.  They did that in the knowledge that, with their help, the country would get rid of Dillonitis.  They got rid of that all right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope before I conclude to invite Deputy Corry and other Deputies representing rural constituencies to consider the significance of the last 12 months or more, particularly the last month or so, in relation to the future for wheat growers in this country as seen by Deputy Corry just 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>It was over the week-end that the Taoiseach made the claim that the year 1957 was a year of steady recovery. He said that the volume of agricultural output increased, the fall in industrial employment was reversed, unemployment figures fell but emigration figures were probably still very high. The general tenor of his speech was that the year 1957 was a year of gradual but steady recovery.  I want <Col N="160" /> to find out how that claim can stand up in the light of the present Book of Estimates and in the light of a reply which I received from the Taoiseach's Parliamentary Secretary to-day regarding industrial and agricultural employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond already mentioned the answer that was given, and I think it very necessary that we should try to get further light on this subject, particularly in view of the claim made here by the Minister for Defence to-day, made, I think, by Deputy Booth last week and persistently made by Fianna Fáil speakers, that unemployment is going down.  Let us be clear on this.  When Fianna Fáil talk about unemployment going down, what they are referring to is the number on the register as unemployed.  That is not the same thing at all.  Any Fianna Fáil Deputy who thinks anyway more than superficially on the problem will agree with me that if you are talking about the number of persons unemployed on the one hand, you must also take into consideration, on the other, the number of people who have left the country in the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>In order to try to find out what was the real position with regard to the Government's efforts over the 12 months they have been in office in relation to this question of unemployment, I asked the Taoiseach to-day:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If he would state the average number of persons in (a) industrial and (b) agricultural employment in the years 1956 and 1957.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Remember 1956, as far as employment is concerned, is the year that Fianna Fáil speakers paint as a disastrous year, a black year, and 1957 is the first year that the Fianna Fáil Government came back into office.  These are the figures I got for the black year, as Fianna Fáil would have it, of 1956.  We here admit that in 1956 the unemployment figures became very high, higher than they ever had been before under an inter-Party Government, although I do not think Deputy Haughey made the claim that an all-time record high was reached.  I think it was higher in some of the Fianna Fáil years, in 1952 or 1953.  However, I will not correct him on that.  It certainly was at its highest <Col N="161" /> under any inter-Party Government in the year 1956.</P>
    <P>Take that year and compare it with the Fianna Fáil year of 1957 and we find that the estimated number of persons in industrial employment in 1956 was 289,000.  The estimate for the number of people in industrial employment in 1957, the first year that Fianna Fáil was back in office was 275,000.  In other words, there were 14,000 fewer in industrial employment in the year 1957, the recovery year of Fianna Fáil's return to office than there were in the black year of 1956.</P>
    <P>So far as agricultural employment went the picture is practically exactly the same.  In 1956 the number employed in agricultural employment was 440,000.  In 1957 it was 430,000.  As between the two, the years 1956 and 1957, the total number of persons fewer in industrial and agricultural employment was 24,000.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Taoiseach is talking about when he says that 1957 was a year of recovery.  I do not know what the Minister for Defence is talking about when he says that there are fewer people unemployed.  It is now perfectly clear from the answers given to my questions in this House to-day that the number of persons in employment in 1957 was fewer than in 1956. What is the explanation then if there are fewer people registered as unemployed? There is only one answer&mdash; that they have taken the emigrant ship and gone abroad.</P>
    <P>In view of that is it any wonder to find that Aer Linte Éireann is able to take a full page advertisement in a daily newspaper and proclaim to the world the fact that they have specially reduced emigrant fares to America? There is no other explanation for the figures given here to-day by the Taoiseach's Department.  As I see it, industrial and agricultural employment is down and it seems to me to be quite clear that emigration has gone up.</P>
    <P>In reply to another question which I asked to-day, we find that the purchasing power of the £ has decreased by 4d. during the year.  So far as the buying of commodities is concerned, the purchaser with £1 in his pocket <Col N="162" /> finds that it is now worth 4d. less than it was after Fianna Fáil came back into office.  In addition to that the cost of living has been increased since Fianna Fáil came back to office.</P>
    <P>Various claims have been made as to what this Book of Estimates amounts to.  Deputy Haughey made the claim that it showed an overall reduction of £4.8 million.  Deputy Haughey will probably agree that in making that calculation he was assuming that there would not be any Supplementary Estimate during the year.  I take it that he is nodding agreement with me, but I do not think that that is a fair basis of calculation.  I think that the amount of the Supplementary Estimates introduced this year came to £7,250,000.  My approach to the Book of Estimates does not accord with the calculation which Deputy Haughey has made.  If we are to talk about the total figure published on the face of the Book of Estimates, we must remember that the last Book of Estimates produced by the inter-Party Government contained full provision for the food subsidies which have since been abolished by the Fianna Fáil Government.  My calculation is that the flour and butter subsidies reduced it by about £8,000,000.</P>
    <P>If the present Government wants to claim any reduction in the Book of Estimates there should be a saving of at least £8,000,000 to the taxpayer.  In fact there is no such saving.  If you were to take the food subsidies out of the inter-Party Book of Estimates, they would have shown a reduction of something like £5,500,000 underneath the figure in the present Book of Estimates. I made a quick calculation when I opened the Book of Estimates and I saw that, out of 66 or 67 items, 39 have increased.  About 25 have been reduced and two have remained static.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Sweetman and some of the other speakers, I should like to say a few words with regard to some of the reductions that have been made. One of the items reduced by £222,000 is the subsidy for ground limestone.  I think it was only last week in the Dáil that the Minister for Agriculture put himself on record as <Col N="163" /> saying that Fianna Fáil had been given a blank cheque.  I want to make the suggestion that, if they did obtain a blank cheque, they gave some pretty substantial promissory notes before they got it.</P>
    <P>If we take the question of the limestone subsidy as an example, I want to repeat a quotation given here to-day by Deputy Sweetman and I am going to quote out of &ldquo;Truth in the News.&rdquo; I am quoting from the <i>Irish Press</i> of Wednesday, 21st November, 1956, a statement made by the present Taoiseach with regard to ground limestone. He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They had been told, he said, that 12,000,000 tons of ground limestone was necessary to restore the productive quality of our soil.  Less than 1,000,000 tons a year was being spread while it required 12,000,000 tons to put it right and 2,000,000 tons a year to keep it in condition.  &lsquo;If we are the Government again one thing I will promise and that is that everything we can do to push this ground limestone on to the land we will do it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is there anything ambiguous about that?  Is that not a clear statement by the Leader of Fianna Fáil to the delegates that assembled at the Ard-Fheis that, if Fianna Fáil ever again had anything to do with the government of the country, everything they could do to push the ground limestone on to the land they would do.  Yet, in the first Book of Estimates which they prepare after coming back into office we find a reduction of £222,000 in the subsidy for that scheme.  That was a very clear statement made in 1956.</P>
    <P>I have taken the trouble to go back over the Book of Estimates for some years.  I find, in relation to the ground limestone subsidy, that in the year when the present Taoiseach was putting himself on record in that manner to the delegates at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, the amount provided in the Book of Estimates was £684,000 for that scheme.  Apparently that would not be sufficient but he would see that <Col N="164" /> the farmers had this ground limestone pushed on to their land.</P>
    <P>There are other reductions in the Book of Estimates that are worthy of comment.  We had reductions in the amounts provided for the Local Authorities (Works) Act, for farm buildings and for housing grants.  It is worth noting what some of the Fianna Fáil supporters were invited to do over the past few years in regard to these reductions.  Remember the reduction in the farm building scheme, in the housing grants and the reduction&mdash;I might say the practical wiping out&mdash;of work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act are all matters that will further affect the unemployment position here.</P>
    <P>I have given the House the benefit of the reply by the Taoiseach's Department to my question to-day regarding industrial and agricultural employment. When Fianna Fáil Deputies were inviting the people of Cork to galvanise the country in a by-election some time back by electing Deputy Galvin to this House, they issued some pretty strong material to Cork citizens. The unfortunate citizens in Deputy Casey's constituency found that, after responding to the Fianna Fáil invitation and electing Deputy Galvin, instead of being galvanised they were &mdash;with apologies to the Minister for Education&mdash;lynched.  This is what Fianna Fáil had to say to the people of Cork on that occasion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In Fianna Fáil we have set a state of full employment as our goal. We believe it can be achieved; we are working out details of a dynamic programme of investment which, in an expanding economy, will bring the nation to that goal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A dynamic programme&rdquo; which entails a reduction of £220,000 in the subsidy for transport of ground limestone, a reduction of £140,000 in the farm building scheme, a reduction of £700,000 in housing grants and a reduction of £350,000 in the Local Authorities (Works) Act, and all this in the year after food subsidies had been abolished and food prices allowed to rocket sky-high&mdash;not only allowed, but deliberately pushed up by positive action of the present Government!</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> When they were inviting Cork citizens to galvanize the country, Fianna Fáil also told the unfortunate people of Cork that Fianna Fáil was planning an end to emigration.  Fianna Fáil plans proposed an increase over five years of 100,000 in the number of new jobs.  We find the people of Cork were told on that occasion that private house-building was almost at a standstill. This is one of the things put out in heavily leaded type in the Fianna Fáil literature and now we find housing grants are to be cut by £700,000 in the coming year.</P>
    <P>I could keep the House for some considerable time in dealing with any one of the Fianna Fáil election productions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I shall deal briefly with <i>Gléas.</i>  Whenever I think of <i>Gléas</i> it reminds me of a song current towards the end of the war.  I understand <i>Gléas</i> is the title of the Fianna Fáil organisation pamphlet and that a rough translation of it is &ldquo;ammunition&rdquo;.  Deputies will remember the ditty going around towards the end of the war: &ldquo;Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.&rdquo; I can imagine Deputy Corry, Deputy Childers and Deputy Haughey joining together in a beautiful chorus chanting: &ldquo;Praise the Chief and pass the ammunition&rdquo; because <i>Gléas</i> was undoubtedly a factor in assisting the Taoiseach and his Party to return to office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a volume of <i>Gléas</i> for March, 1956, which has come to hand, now that Deputy Haughey mentions it. This contains instructions to people like Deputy Haughey and Deputy Corry and, no doubt, to the Parliamentary Secretaries in a box headed: &ldquo;Do you get your copy each month? It is the duty of cumainn secretaries to see that copies of <i>Gléas</i> sent to them each month are circulated among the members of the cumainn.&rdquo;  I hope Deputy Corry did not slip up on that. &ldquo;Additional copies will be supplied to any cumann which makes application therefor and which shows it has made arrangements for their proper distribution. <Col N="166" /> Individual copies of <i>Gléas</i> will be sent to persons whose names are supplied by cumann secretaries subject to payment of 2/6 per annum for each person.&rdquo;  I think that is somewhat lower than the charge for X-rays under the Fianna Fáil health provisions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall not discuss all of it; I am just mentioning it <i>en passant.</i>  This was ammunition supplied to cumainn secretaries and to those whose names were supplied by cumainn secretaries.  In May, 1955, they had a plan for housing, and I think it is interesting in view of the proposed reduction of £700,000 in this Book of Estimates to see what the Fianna Fáil plan for housing was, according to <i>Gléas.</i></P>
      <P>I am quoting from <i>Gléas</i> of May, 1955:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil believes that private individuals should be given every encouragement to build their own homes or to have them built for them and that, to enable them to do this, they should be given all the help and facilities they may reasonably need. Where houses are built by public authorities Fianna Fáil will encourage tenant purchase schemes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are told private housing should be given every encouragement, and now we find in their first Book of Estimates Fianna Fáil are cutting housing grants by no less than £700,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred also to the reduction of £140,000 in the farm building scheme <Col N="167" /> and in this connection it is worth while to have a look at the literature which assisted in bringing Deputy Kieran Egan into this House.  We find under a blocked column headed &ldquo;Help for the Farmer&rdquo; the Fianna Fáil propagandists had this to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil is not satisfied with the present rate of progress.  It is the policy of the Party&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am still in search for the policy and now we are getting it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the policy of the Party when returned to office to provide increased grants for land reclamation and for the farm building scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There we have it.  That is the Fianna Fáil policy when returned to office, to provide increased grants for land reclamation and for the farm building scheme but, in their first Book of Estimates, after being returned to office, we find the farm building scheme is cut by £140,000.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach seemed to me to-day not to enjoy Deputy Sweetman's references to his remarks regarding the cost of living.  I think Deputy Sweetman quoted the exact remark made by the Taoiseach which I think was to the effect that whenever he spoke&mdash;I think it was a week or so ago &mdash;what he said was that there was no evidence that the cost of living was now increasing.  Let me relate that again to the Taoiseach's statement over the week-end that 1957 was a year of gradual and steady recovery.</P>
    <P>I also sought some information from the Taoiseach to-day regarding the cost of living and the various articles which had increased in price since March, 1957.  I was given the increases which had taken place between mid-February and mid-November, 1957, when Fianna Fáil had been in office for a very considerable period.  In fairness to the Deputies on the other side, the Taoiseach in his reply also included in this items which had decreased in price.  We find that beef had increased by 5.23 per cent; mutton by 4.36 per cent; creamery butter by 15.86 per cent.; bread by 48.73 per cent.; household flour by 73.24 per <Col N="168" /> cent.  There are various other increases. The House might well complain that I was delaying matters unnecessarily if I read out these three pages, but they will all appear in the Dáil Debates for to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I started by referring to this question of employment which, on my reading of the remarks of the Minister for Defence on the occasion of the Budget, was the reason the Deputies opposite became Government and I have referred to the figures which were given to-day.  I just want to refer also to some figures <Col N="170" /> that were given in the House last month in reply to a question by Deputy Norton when he asked for the figures for persons employed on road works in 1957 and 1958.  While I do not claim that there is any very great difference in the figures, it is worth noting that the number employed on 31st January, 1958, as against 31st January, 1957, in a great number of counties has decreased.  We find that there are fewer employed on the roads in Cork in 1958 than in 1957; fewer employed in Dublin, Kerry, Kildare.  Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary (North Riding), Waterford and Wicklow.</P>
      <P>Remember the Fianna Fáil posters during the election: &ldquo;Unemployment is the test.&rdquo;&ldquo;Wives, get your husbands back to work.&rdquo;&ldquo;Beat the crisis.&rdquo;&ldquo;Let us get cracking.&rdquo; In his contribution to the Budget last year the Minister for Defence did not put a tooth in it: Fianna Fáil were to be brought back to end emigration, to get the people back to work.  In industrial and agricultural employment you had an average of 24,000 persons fewer in employment after Fianna Fáil had got cracking than were there for 1956.  You have there the list of counties with persons employed on road works at the 31st January, 1957, and the 31st January, 1958, and I have read out the long list of counties where decreases had taken place.  Fianna Fáil have nothing to be proud of in their last 12 months of office.  The Book of Estimates which they have produced is not one which holds out any prospect for the coming 12 months that Fianna Fáil know where they are going, that they know the problem that confronts the country or how to solve it.  They may know the problem but they are not giving any evidence in their Book of Estimates that they are going in any direction which will solve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To conclude, may I come down to local matters?  I have here one of the Fianna Fáil pamphlets published in the Dublin South West constituency and bearing on it the photographs of the Fianna Fáil candidates for the constituency. Under the heading of &ldquo;Let <Col N="171" /> Us Go Ahead Again&rdquo;, Fianna Fáil candidates for Dublin South West invited the people to vote for Deputy Briscoe, Deputy Noel Lemass, Deputy Barney Butler and their fourth colleague in the constituency.  They had this to say among other things:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have to elect a Government which will straighten matters out again.  We want to see men and women going back to work again with a fair chance that their jobs will last and a prospect of new jobs coming along for the younger folks and the unemployed.  We want the factories back on full time and we want to see the building of houses going ahead and trade at the highest level.  That means securing a Government with a sufficient majority in the Dáil to enable it to carry its own policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They finished this appeal: &ldquo;Beat the crisis.  Let us get cracking,&rdquo; and they told the electorate that Fianna Fáil was the only Party which met with these various conditions which they had set out.  They said that Fianna Fáil did a good job for the country before the war&mdash;they were going back a bit&mdash;and that Fianna Fáil had the capacity to beat the present crisis.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil got that majority.  They got it by default, by a number of people staying away from the polls.  In fact, the increase in the Fianna Fáil vote over the whole country, from recollection, was about 14,000, which is roughly the equivalent to which industrial employment has dropped in the year 1957 when Fianna Fáil got their majority.  Although Fianna Fáil got their majority by default, we are entitled now to ask them to live up to their propaganda, to see to it that men and women go back to work &ldquo;with a fair chance that their jobs will last and a fair prospect of new jobs coming along for the younger folks and the unemployed,&rdquo; in the words of Fianna Fáil's appeal in my constituency.  We are entitled to say to Fianna Fáil that we want the building of houses to go ahead rather than have the amount for grants reduced by £700,000.  Fianna Fáil have got their <Col N="172" /> majority and surely after 12 months it is now time for them to find their policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask Deputy O'Higgins a few question in connection with the Vote on Account. First of all, in connection with road grants, is it not a fact that last January 12 months instructions were sent out from the Department of Local Government to anticipate the coming year's grants so as to find some employment during the last three months of last year?  There was no money but the county council could go and borrow the money on the strength of the following year's grants and use that to keep road workers in employment from January to the 31st March. That is one of the reasons why there is now no money left for road works.</P>
      <P>I wonder would Deputy Sweetman tell us about the conference he had over in the Department of Local Government at which he instructed the people there and the county managers: &ldquo;Whatever way you manage, the housing schemes will be held up for there is no money there.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We had the result in Cork South, North and West as regards housing for the rest of that year. Apart from that, we had a very grave position as regards polio in Cork. <Col N="173" /> Three letters were sent to the Minister from the South Cork Board of Assistance, of which Deputy Casey and Deputy Desmond are members, asking permission to put in 20 extra beds in the Orthopædic Hospital for polio cases.  At the time we were in extremity for bed accommodation, but those three letters remained unanswered. The Minister at the time said, in reply to a question by me, that <Col N="174" /> conditions of financial stringency were such for the inter-Party Government in 1956 that they had not the price of 50 per cent. of 20 beds.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 13th March, 1958.</P>
