      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill has been introduced at the request of the trustee savings banks.  There are five of these institutions in the State&mdash;in Dublin.  Cork, Waterford, Monaghan and Limerick and they have a long history behind them.  They were all established between 1816 and 1820, which makes them a good deal older than the Post Office Savings Bank which was not set up until 1861.  They are the oldest institutions in the country catering for the small saver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> In their long history they have rendered invaluable service in encouraging thrift and the steady increase in deposits over the past decade is an encouraging sign that, despite their age, they have in no way diminished in vigour.  Their deposits now exceed £12,000,000&mdash;more than double what they were ten years ago. Though they are private bodies and not part of the machinery of the State, they have always been subject to State supervision and the manner in which they should conduct their business is regulated by statute.  The Acts which govern them were for the most part passed during the early nineteenth century and were consolidated by the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1863.  This, with certain amending Acts, is still the governing statute.</P>
    <P>Under the Acts, these banks were under the general control of the British National Debt Commissioners, with whom they were required to invest their deposits.  As the functions of the commissioners were not specifically allotted to any Irish authority at the setting up of the State, this position continued until the 1940 Finance Act provided that the Irish trustee savings banks should lodge all future deposits with the Minister for Finance; these deposits are invested in the same manner as deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank.</P>
    <P>Apart from the 1940 provision about the lodgment of deposits, there has been no amendment here of the law governing trustee savings banks since 1920 with the result that the code of legislation under which the banks operate is now out of date in certain respects.  In Britain steps have already been taken to bring savings bank legislation into line with modern needs and, between 1920 and 1949, four amending Acts were passed followed, in 1954, by a consolidating measure.</P>
    <P>We too have in hands a comprehensive review of trustee savings bank legislation with a view to amendment and consolidation but, as the matter is very technical and complicated, examination will take some time.  The trustee savings banks have, however, drawn special attention to certain statutory restrictions which are unnecessary in present-day conditions and <Col N="295" /> which, they find, prevent them from cooperating fully in the savings drive.  It is with a view to freeing the banks as soon as possible from these operational difficulties that the present short preliminary Bill has been prepared.  As well as removing these restrictions, the Bill makes certain provisions in relation to the superannuation of the banks' staffs designed to bring the pension terms to be given to these staffs as nearly as possible into line with those available to civil servants under the Superannuation Acts.</P>
    <P>I should like to add, before passing to a brief summary of the provisions of the Bill, that it is the intention to press ahead, in consultation with the banks, with the major job of revision and consolidation.  If it transpires that the number of amendments necessary in the law is considerable, the Oireachtas may find it more convenient to have them in the form of a second preliminary Bill so as to simplify their study of the final measure which would then be a purely consolidating one.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill is the interpretation clause.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that deposits may be received and repaid by cheque or other negotiable instrument; that transactions of deposit and withdrawal may be carried out either during or outside normal banking hours and by post; and that where a group savings scheme is in operation, deposits may be collected by the bank at the place where the scheme is in operation either during or outside normal banking hours and by one officer of the bank only.</P>
    <P>Section 3 enables the trustees of trustee savings banks to make and carry out pension schemes for their permanent wholetime staffs with terms which are, as far as possible, equivalent to those applicable to civil servants under the Superannuation Acts.  At present superannuation benefits are limited to those provided for civil servants under the Superannuation Act of 1859.</P>
    <P>Section 4 relieves a bank from the obligation of printing its rules in every deposit book issued by it.  Instead, a <Col N="296" /> copy of the rules must be made available to any depositor who asks for them.</P>
    <P>Section 5 removes the restrictions which now prevent a depositor from having more than one account in a trustee savings bank or in the Post Office Savings Bank, and from holding accounts in both a trustee savings bank. and the Post Office Savings Bank. Power is also taken to amend the declarations required from intending depositors in both types of bank as these declarations at present contain a statement that the depositor has not an account in any other savings bank. It has been found that the prohibition on double accounts hampers group savings schemes since only persons who have no account already in another savings bank can participate in such schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is the customary section dealing with the short title and citation of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which has been wending its weary way along to this House.  I am glad that, even at the end of this session, it has been found possible to include it in our legislative programme.  The trustees of savings banks have been asking for a long time to have the law, as it affects them, altered, and it was deferred for years in the hope of getting a more comprehensive Bill.  However, the decision to deal with it by stages was the only possible decision, if we were to see the matter put in order in the parliamentary lifetime of most of the members of this House.  Comprehensive, consolidating Bills are very excellent things, but they arrive later rather than sooner.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I must do so in any case having started it on its course.  There are only a couple of minor questions to which I wish to refer on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take remaining stages today.</P>
      <P>Bill considered in Committee.</P>
      <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended that the effect of sub-clause (a) of Section 2 is that the banks can operate a cheque book scheme or is merely intended that it can receive deposits by cheque?  I think that the word &ldquo;repaid&rdquo; there has no reference whatever to payments by the trustee savings banks.  I think that word &ldquo;repaid&rdquo; has reference only to withdrawals by the trustee savings bank rather than the withdrawal of payments by an ordinary depositor.</P>
      <P>The other point I have in mind is in relation to sub-clause (d).  I agree entirely with the idea that a trustee savings bank must be empowered to receive deposits outside the bank premises.  Group savings schemes for factories can be operated only in that way.  The present law is that the trustee savings bank can take deposits only at its bank premises and that prohibits any receipt of deposits of a group savings scheme in factories.  The purpose of sub-clause (d) is to ensure that the trustee savings bank, if it makes an arrangement with a factory, can send one of its officials there at a specified time to receive the savings of the group.  That is an entirely desirable thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am wondering, however, whether &ldquo;trustee, manager or paid officer of the bank&rdquo; is a proper restriction.  I should have thought it better to have a specified designated officer of the bank.  It might be a member of the management committee of the trustee savings bank who would be working in a factory and who would organise the group savings scheme in that factory. He might not be paid by the savings bank.  Surely there should be sufficient latitude to allow a savings bank, if it thought fit, to appoint such a person to take a collection through the group. I agree, without any qualification or hesitation, that there must be a clear restriction that any officer of a savings bank cannot make collections without specific authority, but I would have thought that the appointment of the actual officer was a matter for the bank itself and that the law should merely <Col N="298" /> restrict the section to providing that it must be a trustee, manager or a paid officer or other specifically designated officer.</P>
    <P>I can conceive circumstances in which a paid officer, merely because he was paid, would still not be the right officer to receive the deposits. The Minister can visualise an office boy in a savings bank.  There is one of the best savings banks in the country that I know of with large premises and one of the Deputies opposite should know it, too.  In the case of that savings bank, an office boy would be a paid officer and it would be undesirable that he should be authorised to accept deposits away from the office.  Equally, there might be a highly trusted member of the committee of management, not paid, who would be a proper person to take the deposits of the group and I think this clause would prevent him from taking such deposits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first point raised by the Deputy, it means that the bank can receive cheques or money orders and can pay out in cheques or money orders, but the depositor of the bank will not be issued with a cheque book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely for the internal working of the bank?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  With regard to the observations made by the Deputy as to the person to be nominated to accept deposits in a group scheme, this is the suggestion of the banks themselves. I presume they thought of the points raised by the Deputy, and, if they had thought it necessary for them to be able to give power to a member of the committee to receive such deposits, they would have asked for it.  They did not ask for it.  As to the point raised by the Deputy about an office boy, we must trust that the committee of the bank will not nominate an office boy to receive deposits in such a scheme.  It would be almost impossible to legislate to such an extent as to prevent them from making such a nomination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What I meant was to prove that the section was wide <Col N="299" /> enough to do that, while it was too narrow to do the other thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but I think that the banks would have asked for the power to nominate a member of the committee, if they thought that was necessary, and they have not asked for that power.</P>

    <Title>International Finance Corporation Bill, 1958&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  When I was speaking last year on the Second Stage of the Bretton Woods Agreements Bill, 1957, I indicated that the facilities of the International Finance Corporation were available to members of the International Bank for reconstruction and development and that the question of joining the corporation would be considered. The purpose of the present Bill is to enable Ireland to become a member of the corporation.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill indicates the objects and activities of the corporation.  Its Articles of Agreement, which comprise the Schedule to the Bill, contain the regulations relating to membership of the corporation, its capital, its operations, and its organisation and management.</P>
      <P>The International Finance Corporation is an affiliate of the World Bank and only members of the bank are eligible for membership.  In May, 1958, the World Bank had 66 members apart from Ireland and of this number 55 had joined or were in process of joining the corporation.</P>
      <P>The activities of the corporation supplement those of the World Bank; it is designed to promote the expansion of private enterprise whereas the World Bank concentrates its operations in the public sector of the economies of its member countries. The corporation's aim is to demonstrate in concrete form that soundly conducted investment in the less developed areas can be highly profitable and by that demonstration to stimulate the flow of private management and capital into such investment.  Its success or failure will be reflected not so much in the amount of its own operations as in the extant to which they encourage others to channel their resources into productive private enterprise in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> The first annual report of the corporation stated that the corporation would concentrate mainly on projects located in Africa, Asia, Australia, and Latin America.  It is understood, however, that if Ireland becomes a member of the corporation, projects in Ireland will be considered as eligible for investment provided they will clearly and substantially contribute to Ireland's economy and are industrial in character.</P>
    <P>The corporation has been in existence for only two years, a very short time in the life of an international organisation.  However, it has already shown that it has many benefits to offer to its members and the wide range of its investment activities can be seen from the examples given in the explanatory memorandum.  That the advantages of membership are widely appreciated is clear from the fact that over 80 per cent. of the members of the World Bank have considered it to be in their interests to join.  In our case membership would help to encourage productive investment by private interests, both domestic and foreign.  The possibility of obtaining financial assistance from this source should encourage the initiation of productive projects by Irish interests. Firms in the United States and other countries which would be reluctant to invest in this country on their own, might decide to do so if assured of assistance from an international financial organisation.  Also the corporation acts as a clearing house for investment projects, bringing opportunities in the less developed countries to the attention of potential investors.  It would, therefore, be able to bring opportunities for investment in Ireland to the notice of foreign firms seeking a profitable outlet for their funds.  In all these ways membership of the corporation should prove a valuable aid in furthering our efforts to encourage productive investment in this country.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum indicates the financial commitments involved in becoming a member of the corporation.  If Ireland joins she will be obliged to take up approximately 350 shares of the corporation stock and her subscription, therefore, will be of the order of £350,000.  This compares <Col N="302" /> with subscriptions of £14.4 million by Britain, £753,000 by Denmark, £3,046,000 by the Netherlands and £421,000 by Finland.  The corporation will be obliged to repurchase Ireland's shares if she withdraws from membership.</P>
    <P>Apart from the obligation of subscribing to the capital stock of the corporation membership involves the granting of certain immunities and privileges to it.  They are similar to those granted to the International Monetary Fund and to the World Bank by the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, 1957.</P>
    <P>Before Ireland can become a member of the corporation it will be necessary for the Government to sign the Articles of Agreement of the corporation and to deposit with the World Bank an instrument setting forth that it has accepted the agreement in accordance with its law and has taken all steps necessary to enable it to carry out its obligations.  This Bill is designed to give approval for the acceptance of the agreement by the Government and to provide the powers necessary to enable the Government to implement the agreement.  The Bill follows generally the lines of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, 1957, in so far as that Act relates to the World Bank.  The purpose of the various sections is indicated in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>Deputies who took part in the debate on the Bretton Woods Agreements Bill, 1957, all spoke in favour of joining the International Finance Corporation and I am, therefore, confident that the present Bill is one which will commend itself to both sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, this is the natural conclusion of the Acts passed last year.  The amount of the subscription by Ireland to the corporation is comparatively small and I would be interested to know on what basis these subscriptions are calculated. I found it rather difficult to appreciate that from the agreement and from the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties with which we are faced in the sphere of financing our <Col N="303" /> projects are perhaps difficulties that are connected more with &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; than with finance itself.  I do not think that in relation to new means of production&mdash;and I stress &ldquo;new&rdquo;&mdash;there would be the same difficulty in providing finance for them here ourselves if they were really productive.  It is not that void that requires to be filled so much in the Irish economy.  The void which requires to be filled in the Irish economy is the void in connection with the finance to develop the &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; that we have not got.  We want foreign investment more in risk capital than by way of foreign loan.  We want people who have the technical &ldquo;knowhow&rdquo; and technical means of distribution and sales abroad, that we have not got and cannot hope to have, to interest themselves in starting productive enterprises here and either to back those productive enterprises by their own capital, foreign capital, or have them backed by something like the foreign underwriting business that is involved here.  I appreciate it is not underwriting in the technical sense of the term, but I am using it in this very broad sense.</P>
    <P>In so far as the corporation is of assistance to foreign firms in giving them the stability they require for investment to back their &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; in Ireland, I think it will have a beneficial effect.  Nothing, however, that we do in this respect or in any other respect can get away from the fact that the solution of our problems remains one for ourselves and depends on our channelling our own savings towards productive rather than unproductive enterprises.  We may have an opportunity in a few minutes on the Finance Bill of dealing with that in its wider sphere.  Frankly, I feel that the real need we have in relation to foreign capital is not what one might call loan capital to industry, but rather risk capital to industry backing a &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; which we have not got here, but which the people who have that capital are prepared to support with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to welcome this Bill and to congratulate the <Col N="304" /> Minister on its introduction.  It represents another significant and important step along the line of developing our financial and economic institutions and adjusting them to meet the requirements of our economy.  This Bill is a very natural sequel to our joining the World Bank.  It has, however, this important and significant difference from the Bretton Woods Agreement Act that the International Finance Corporation will be concerned to stimulate investment in private economic activity.</P>
      <P>We are frequently told by various people, councils and institutions that there is too much concentration in this country on public investment activity and that too little attention is being devoted to the private sector.  In so far as this Bill is directed towards remedying that defect, if it exists, it is all the more welcome.</P>
      <P>This International Finance Corporation will direct all its efforts towards stimulating investment in private enterprise.  It has been said often enough, and it is true, that our problem is to raise the general level of economic activity to the point where it would involve all our resources in productive employment, thereby providing jobs for our people at home. That is the aim and the objective.</P>
      <P>I think it is true to say that no matter what expansion we can achieve in agriculture, it will not provide the necessary amount of jobs required. The whole trend is that the modern development of agriculture leads to lesser rather than greater employment. We must, of course, devote ourselves continuously to expanding and increasing agricultural production. Nevertheless, we must recognise that the raising of the number of jobs available to the level we require can come only from industrial activity.  In so far as this Bill is directed along those lines, it is a very important measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of raising economic activity to the level required is, as Deputy Sweetman pointed out, to a great extent, a physical one.  However, while it is primarily the physical task of creating the necessary expansion of production, we must at the same time keep our financial institutions continually <Col N="305" /> under review and keep an eye to see whether they are at all times adjusted to the needs of our own economy.  In so far as that is a problem, I think we must all agree that the Minister is doing very great work in this regard.  Since assuming office, he has a very impressive list of legislation to his credit.  He introduced the Industrial Credit Company legislation. He brought about the tax incentives to industrial production.  He brought in the Trustee (Authorised Investment) Act and the Bretton Woods Agreement Act which gave us the necessary authority to join the World Bank.  In addition, we have the Encouragement of External Investment Bill.</P>
    <P>When we look at that picture, we must agree that in a short time the Minister has made very important and significant changes in our financial establishment in bringing it into line with our needs and requirements.  It is obvious that he is doing what is required in keeping our establishment under continual review and seeing to it that changes required from time to time are brought about.</P>
    <P>I think that, with this Bill, the Minister will have created an excellent financial framework within which industrial development can take place to the maximum possible extent.  In so far as he has done that.  I think he deserves the congratulations of the House.</P>

      <P>I am sure I am entitled to congratulate the Minister on these significant and important measures which have been introduced by him in the short time that I have been in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter which I should like to raise as I have not been <Col N="306" /> able to find out about it.  With regard to the activities of the World Bank, they are disposed to provide only that portion of the amount required which is required in foreign currency.  In other words, if you have a project and it requires your own and foreign currency, they will usually lend to you only to the extent you require foreign currency.  I do not know if that applies to the International Finance Corporation. I could not imagine that it would but I should like the Minister to explain the position.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey rightly says his recent arrival in this House entitles him to take a detached view. I do not suppose it very much matters who initiates desirable legislation, so long as Oireachtas Éireann enacts it.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister himself will be anxious to say to the House that these Bills were in draft&mdash;particularly the project of joining the World Bank and, I think, the Bill we disposed of before we embarked on this one.  It is as a result of that that unanimity in adopting this important legislation is evident.  It is no harm that the public should know that significant measures of this kind pass rapidly through the House when it is true that the principal Opposition are intimately familiar with their provisions because they themselves were responsible for drafting them.  It might suggest a measure of legislative irresponsibility if we passed important measures of this kind in relatively few minutes unless the public knew the background of our legislative procedure, which permits the degree of ready agreement which will be forthcoming for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anything which helps us to get capital for development in this country, whether it be agricultural or industrial, is good.  If you can make capital work to bring unemployed men and unappropriated raw materials together to produce a commodity or a service which can be economically sold, then you are doing good work, but you have to bear in mind that there is a very clear distinction between the employment of capital for the purpose of bringing men and raw materials together for the provision of what can be profitably <Col N="307" /> sold, and the employment of capital to bring them together for the purpose of providing a new amenity of which society is glad to avail, if and when society can afford it.</P>
    <P>I cannot doubt that the purposes of this legislation are primarily designed to make capital readily accessible to us for the promotion of economic enterprise, that is, industrial or agricultural undertakings, in the wide meaning of those terms, which will employ our people in the processing of raw materials for the production of an end product which can be economically sold.  There is, however, a snag.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us, and rightly, I think, that the expansion of industrial activity for the supply of the home market is largely realised, and that there is not very much scope in that field, and that hereafter the output of industry must be directed towards export markets.  I want to direct the attention of the House again to the fact that that problem has been under protracted consideration by successive Governments. It presents an extremely stubborn circle of difficulty, because in order to embark on large-scale industrial production for export, you must have export markets, but in order to get a marketing organisation in a wide export field, you must have the wherewithal to supply the market you create.</P>
    <P>I myself have had experience of persons filled with zeal rushing out to create a foreign market by offering goods for sale on terms and conditions which were attractive and then returning, with an order book full, to find they had not got the machinery wherewith to supply the demand they had created, and then developing the machine to supply that demand and returning to their disappointed customers to tell them that, though they had failed to deliver on the first occasion, they were now in a position to do so, only to be told that their failure to deliver on the first occasion had created an atmosphere which made it impossible for the buyers to entertain their tenders, lest they fail again; and instead of developing a useful service <Col N="308" /> which they had hoped and intended to develop, in fact they had done great damage because they had made it impossible for anybody to enter those markets as a result of the disappointment caused by their failure to perform, in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I want somebody to tell me how that vicious circle of markets and supply is to be broken, and I have not heard anybody advance proposals to do it, other than the proposals I mentioned in this House.  Unless we can get some persons who have in existance effective marketing organisations and supplies to meet the orders these marketing organisations can create to establish branch factories here and throw into their total volume of sales the output of their branch factories here, I cannot see how we are to break into the fiercely competitive foreign markets of the present time; whereas I am satisfied that if you get a number of such factories established here intimately connected with existing marketing organisations, you not only get the employment they themselves directly supply, but I believe there would grow up around them quite a number of relatively small ancillary industries supplying components and parts of the finished product of the branch factory.</P>
    <P>I say that advisedly, because I have seen more than one instance of it.  I saw a factory producing wallboard in this country brought to the verge of ruin, not through any defect in the quality of its product, not through any shortage of raw material or skilled processing, but because when their product was manufactured, they could not get access to the mass market that existed for it; but the moment they came in contact with an international firm which was dealing in that product, their entire output passed into consumption without the slightest difficulty, and that Irish factory is now in the process of having its capacity doubled.  That all came to pass because overnight, as a result of amalgamation, it had made available to it a great international marketing machine.</P>
    <P>I know at the present time that if we could acquire the services of the existing international marketing organisation for dried milk and milk <Col N="309" /> products. our entire milk surplus could be absorbed profitably, and a great deal more.  I know that there are hundreds of thousands of tons of dried milk being sold all through the Orient and the Tropics and that the demand is not half supplied.  If we had the marketing machinery to make contact with those remote places where there are highly specialised conditions, both as to language and practice, there is a market there that would absorb all the milk we could process; but to get those contacts or to enter those markets is extremely difficult, and some of those who have access to them have acquired over a century of mercantile experience in those areas.  I do not want to go into too great detail of the kind of problem which confronts somebody who seeks to sell in these conditions, but they are formidable, highly technical, and in many cases quite exotic, and could be understood only by those who had direct contact with the problem in the course of trade.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey spoke with admiration of the Minister churning out his Bills here.  It is terribly easy to churn out Bills.  It is terribly easy to set up a commission to investigate market problems, but what no Deputy in this House will face is that it is relatively easy to find out what a problem is but the difficult thing is to find out the answer.  I know, and I knew when I was Minister for Agriculture, that there was this vast market for dried milk in the Orient and Africa and I tried to break into it.  We actually shipped dried milk to the Orient but you run up against the most extraordinary problems if you have not the right contact, if you do not know the appropriate way of dealing with the residents of Bangkok.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be too specific.  I said that if you do not know the appropriate way of dealing with the residents of Bangkok, you may deliver better dried milk than a well established mercantile firm in that area is providing, and yet be told that your dried milk did not stand up to <Col N="310" /> the temperature of the climate and had been rejected.  When you have 100 tons of dried milk sitting in Bangkok and you cannot pronounce your agent's name, and you do not know whether it is a man or a woman, and the public health authority in Yenyong has stated that the dried milk does not come up to the standard specification of the public health authority of that subdivision of the southern territory of the northern jurisdiction, you ask your agent &ldquo;what do you propose to do about it?&rdquo;  He says: &ldquo;There is not anything you can do about it except authorise them to sell the milk at one tenth of the price at which it was originally consigned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>You may know that somebody is putting his finger in your eye but it is very difficult to deal with it unless you have the established organisation which permits you to send &ldquo;Lip Chang&rdquo; up from Singapore to deal with &ldquo;Lip Hok.&rdquo;  If you have that organisation &ldquo;Lip Hok&rdquo; is not likely to put his finger in your eye because he knows &ldquo;Lip Chang&rdquo; would not put up with it.  I am trying to explain to Deputies that is quite illusory to imagine that the existence of these markets is not well known, that the difficulties of penetrating them have not been experienced in the hard school of experience, and I am quite prepared to learn from anybody, including Deputy Haughey, that there is some fairy touch which can be employed, once we have passed all these Bills, which will open out all these markets to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, like the man from Oklahoma I want to be shown; I do not want to be told.  My experience, and I have a good deal, is that these problems are heartbreaking and frustrating. Naturally, if you invite a group of co-operatives to put up 100 tons of dried milk and they have once that experience, they are going to be very chary about attempting it a second time.  Therefore, while I agree with Deputy Haughey that it is very necessary and desirable to complete this programme of legislation I have got a pragmatic mind.  I am not more interested in dreams and aspirations; I want to put men to work, and the only <Col N="311" /> way I know of putting men to work is to get factories which will produce goods which will be profitably sold, and in my submission, the most difficult part of that programme is the profitable selling.</P>
    <P>All these institutions are available to us and available to anybody who comes here to collaborate with us in this perfectly simple job, stripped of all the irrelevancies, of putting Irish people to work in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I do not want to show any disrespect for the Minister for Finance.  I am always in favour of treating Ministers of State with deference and respect and they deserve it.  Now that all these resources are available to us, I want to renew a suggestion to the Minister for Finance that I have already made to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is not enough to pass all these Bills.  It is not enough to make capital available.  What is important <Col N="312" /> is that we should proceed to put these facilities to work.  I think we want help in that and I believe the help is available if we go and look for it.</P>
      <P>I want to put it to the Minister for Finance that his Government should approach the Government of the United States and suggest to them that, now that all these facilities have been, by our legislation, made available here in Ireland, it should be worth while persuading any group of public-spirited industrial <i>entrepreneurs</i> in the United States, who have an interest in access to the Free Trade Area, and indeed an interest in access to the European market and to the African market, that they should establish branch factories in this country on exactly the same lines as Bowaters have established a branch factory in Athy.</P>
      <P>We should point out that all the credit capital facilities available in any country in the world are available here.  We should point out that the supply of labour is abundant and that successive Governments have given abundant evidence of their earnest desire to help and that, more important perhaps, it is in the process of being established in this Oireachtas that our principles of fiscal legislation correspond accurately with the fundamental principles acceptable in Great Britain and in the United States of America itself; and that, with these considerations in mind and bearing in mind that in the present condition of the world Russia is the protagonist of exclusive State control and the United States of America is the protagonist of individual liberty and free enterprise, it would be worth America's while, rather than to offer great monetary benefactions to this country, as she has so generously done in other parts of the world, to use her immense resources to give a demonstration before the world of what free enterprise can be for a community which is prepared to help itself.  I do not believe it will cost anybody in the United States of America a penny; on the contrary, it would be a most profitable investment for them if they but tried.  But I can well imagine that the natural inertia that deters prosperous enterprises from setting up foreign branches has to be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> I do not want Deputies to think that I am simply dreaming dreams and that this is all a figment of my imagining, which rational persons could not be expected to consider.  I understand that this scheme is already operating and that a group of public-spirited manufacturers in the United States of America have combined to attempt this very programme in the Middle East. But, there, they are confronted with the chronic instability of the Middle-Eastern situation, and I should not be surprised if the difficulties there proved too great for the project at present in progress.</P>
    <P>But if an analogous project were launched in respect of Ireland, I believe all the conditions are here present for its success and, to me, its immense attraction is that, apart from the fact that there would be a substantial bloc of employment for our people created here, under good conditions and with the industrial and marketing &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; indispensable to success, I am convinced that each one of these would evoke smaller ancillary industries of the kind which our system is peculiarly qualified to produce, operate and maintain to the very great benefit of the economic life of the country as a whole.  I should be glad to know from the Minister if, having cleared the ground for such development with this series of Bills, he and his Government propose to take any positive action to resolve the strictly pragmatic problem of actually putting men to work in factories, manufacturing commodities for profitable sale on foreign markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I welcome the co-ordination of efforts by different nationalities for their mutual benefit.  In this regard, I think we should participate with the other nations set out in this long Schedule on page 17 to promote mutual interests. However, it would be wrong to imagine that this Bill or this proposed finance corporation or any other similar institution will be a panacea for all our ills.  I subscribe to the belief that our difficulties here will be either solved or not solved inside the shores of our own State.  For that reason, the ordinary laws we enact here, the lead we give <Col N="314" /> to the people outside and the conditions we create in this House are, in the first instance, the essential prerequisite for any prosperity or advancement in our country.  After that, we must rely on the individual and collective efforts of our people to provide prosperity and an expanding economy here.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I should like to ask the Minister to elucidate a few points on which I am not quite clear. There is a list of 56 countries on page 17 which, between them, are to subscribe or have subscribed&mdash;I am not quite clear on that point&mdash;100,000,000 United States dollars.  Earlier on in the same document on page 4, Section 2 (a), it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The authorised capital stock of the corporation shall be 100,000,000 dollars in terms of United States dollars.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Has the capital been subscribed already without our contribution, or is there room for Ireland to contribute its share of the capital?  I do not understand that.  This country's name is not included in the list of 56 countries set out in this Schedule A at the end of the Bill.  Furthermore, Section 1 of Article IX says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This agreement shall enter into force when it has been signed on behalf of not less than 30 Governments whose subscriptions comprise not less than 75 per cent. of the total subscriptions set forth in Schedule A.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again, the name of Ireland does not appear in Schedule A.  Possibly, there is a very simple explanation for it.</P>
      <P>There is another point.  In Section 3 are set out what are termed operational principles.  These are an important part of the Bill, because they indicate, as I said, that this proposed corporation cannot be taken in any way as a panacea or solution for our financial difficulties.  Amongst the principles set out in this section are the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(i) the corporation shall not undertake any financing for which in its opinion sufficient private <Col N="315" /> capital could be obtained on reasonable terms.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it from that that we will have to prove that sufficient private capital is not available either inside or outside this country?  I do not think there is any doubt that, given a proper enterprise showing a reasonable return for the private investor, the capital can be got in this country.  One of the reasons it has been difficult to get capital for some enterprises is that the private investor has not sufficient faith in the undertaking.  That is one of the reasons so much of the privately owned capital here by citizens of this State is invested outside the country.  The private investor appears to think that capital invested in Great Britain or elsewhere gives a better and safer return than capital invested in his own country.  That is an unfortunate truth, but I am afraid it is a truth.  If that is so, is it likely that this finance corporation will regard us as being short of capital which can be obtained on reasonable terms?</P>
    <P>It says, in (iv) of the same section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The corporation shall not assume responsibility for managing any enterprise in which it has invested.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was not aware from the Minister's introductory statement or the memorandum that the corporation was to assume responsibility for any enterprise.</P>
    <P>Again, (v) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the corporation shall undertake its financing on terms and conditions which it considers appropriate, taking into account the requirements of the enterprise, the risks being undertaken by the corporation and the terms and conditions normally obtained by private investors for similar financing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not see indicated anywhere in the Bill the terms and conditions of any loans or other assistance which a private investor may require from this corporation.  In other words, the corporation, in theory, might be a very useful instrument for the supply of finance, but the conditions may be so onerous or the terms so difficult that <Col N="316" /> it might not be worth a private investor's while to avail of it.  Perhaps the Minister would elucidate these matters in his reply.  I believe that our prosperity depends on our own efforts, beginning in the Dáil here and ending outside the House; and no amount of argument will convince me that any external boards, commissions or corporations will help us, if we do not try to help ourselves, in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I maintain that there is a complete air of unreality in this discussion.  The first sane comment was made by Deputy Russell.  He pointed out the major snags which could develop as a result of applications under this Bill for financial help towards industrial development.  The objection that lies to Section 3 is one that cannot be overcome by arguments here or outside.  There is sufficient private capital available here to meet many of the proposals which could be brought into operation under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Why should we give the International Finance Corporation power to make loans to private enterprise here, when that capital is available in Ireland?  At the moment, it is being exported by private individuals, who have no confidence in State or national development.  We really cannot blame the private individual for his lack of confidence, as we have the example set by the Central Bank itself, the big exporting agency for capital.  If the Central Bank finds it desirable to invest the greater proportion of its capital outside this country, can we expect the private individual to invest his capital here?</P>
      <P>Under this Bill, we are asking an outside body&mdash;begging them, at a later stage&mdash;to give us financial assistance for industrial development, on the basis that we have not sufficient capital available in Ireland&mdash;while we are pouring out that capital every day of the week. That is why I say there is an air of unreality about the discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon was perturbed and worried that we had the raw material and the unemployed men and suggested that if we wedded the two for the production of a saleable commodity, we might solve the problem.  We have the unemployed men, plenty of them, and <Col N="317" /> we have the capital; but at the present time we are allowing both to be exported.  A much simpler procedure and a more practical step, would be for the Minister to put a small Bill through this House that would control the export of Irish capital, led by the Central Bank itself.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be critical of the Bill itself.  I want to point out the unreality attaching to the discussion.  I hope nobody here is under any illusion as to what this Bill is likely to mean in the future.  The solution of our internal problems must lie within the country.  The manpower is here and the capital is here; what we want is the intelligent direction from the top, and that has been sadly lacking for years past.  At this stage, all we can find as a solution here is people holding out their arms to beseech America to come here and invest money here, to save Ireland.  I think that is nauseating and disgusting, at this stage.</P>
    <P>So far, in regard to all the efforts made by people inside and outside the House to get help from America and elsewhere, we have got very doubtful results.  I hope the people and Deputies will realise that the major ills which face the nation will not be solved by measures that pass through this House, like this one, with a welcome all round.  We are not facing realities when we base our hopes for the future on whatever results may be achieved from measures like this.  Our security and our welfare as a nation will depend on the efforts put by the people into the development of the country and also on the capital available, which is being exported at the moment, being diverted back here for the expansion of Irish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To commence with the points raised by Deputy Sweetman, the subscription is based on the same formula as our subscription to the World Bank.  That was a very complicated formula, indeed, taking into account national income, external trade and holdings of gold and dollars.  I agree that we do not need foreign capital, as such; what we do need is the technical knowledge that may come with foreign <Col N="318" /> capital and I think that is what any of us has in mind in framing a Bill of this kind.  We find it difficult to organise the production of certain goods here, because we have not got the knowledge; and we need foreigners to come in to give us the necessary knowledge. The easiest way&mdash;I myself think, anyway&mdash;to get foreigners to come in is to get them to come in with their money.</P>
      <P>It is true that this corporation will not put in the risk capital which Deputy Sweetman talks about.  They will not give a loan, but they may on the other hand give to a project the stability that we need.  If there are people in America or elsewhere who have knowledge of a certain project and money to invest, and if they see that this organisation has examined the project and is prepared to put money into it, they may be prepared to come and put their money in without further inquiry, as they will know that the necessary inquiries have been made.  In that way, it may have a good effect in getting capital to come here which is accompanied by the knowledge of the particular project that may be necessary.</P>
      <P>Those people, of course, will subscribe by way of loan, but the idea is that if the project then becomes successful, there would be an issue of shares to cover repayment of that loan, and the shares would be made available to the people here at home, on the assumption that the project would carry on and be successful in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I suppose you could call it that.  Deputy Dillon prefaced a speech he made on the Finance Bill by saying that he saw no way of developing further industries here for export, except by getting somebody to come in and establish branches here, somebody with a marketing organisation.  No doubt, that would be the easy way to get it done, but it may not be possible to get such people to come in.  To pursue that policy and say: &ldquo;We cannot do anything except in that way&rdquo; would be just to end up in despair of <Col N="319" /> developing our industries.  Whatever grip people may have on world markets, it must be admitted there are always new people coming in.  There is no such thing as anybody having a monopoly of the world market.  There will always be new people coming along.  We have experience of that in this country over the past few years.  We have industries here which were doing only internal business up to a few years ago and are now building up trade on the foreign market.  It may be small, but the combined effect of a number of these is fairly substantial.  I think we should pin our hopes on such people, that they may be able to do better in the future. Naturally, I should be only too delighted to accept the suggestion of Deputy Dillon that some organisation which has world markets at its disposal would come in to establish a plant or a branch here.</P>
      <P>I was asked by Deputy Haughey about currency and I think I can best answer that question by reading a few extracts from this book issued by the International Finance Corporation.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The IFC&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;as it calls itself&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;will normally pay out to the enterprise being financed the full amount which IFC has agreed to invest, either in a lump sum or by agreed instalments.  But IFC will also be prepared to consider commitments to put up funds at some future date, subject to an appropriate commitment commission.  The funds so provided by IFC will not necessarily be restricted to payment for any specific goods or services but will generally be freely usable by the enterprise for its business purposes. Accordingly, the amount of IFC's participation will not normally be measured by the foreign exchange requirements of the enterprise.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then it goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;IFC in its early years may often think it prudent to make investments expressed in U.S. dollars.  But whenever a sound case is presented IFC will be prepared to make loans in other currencies if it is satisfied that other aspects of the investment, <Col N="320" /> including any rights of conversion into capital stock or shares, can reasonably be expected to outweigh the transfer and exchange risks which IFC might incur by lending in such other currencies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have given those extracts just to show that a very flexible policy is being pursued and that they intend to pursue a flexible policy in regard to currency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Going back to Deputy Dillon&mdash;we seem to have a bit of difference of opinion here sometimes about who is responsible for certain things.  The Fine Gael Party appear to look on it in this way: they say that when they were in they did things they had to do which were hurtful to the people and when we come along and try to remove these things, they say: &ldquo;We were responsible; we made it possible for you to do it.&rdquo;  That is a soothing sort of policy to pursue and we hope it gives them certain satisfaction.</P>
      <P>Nobody would be so foolish&mdash;I do not think, as far as I caught what Deputy Russell said, that he accused us of it&mdash; as to think that this or any other measure was a panacea for all our troubles.  We have difficulties, as I suppose nearly every other country has, but our difficulties must be tackled from many angles and by many proposals. Indeed, I think we may admit some of these proposals may be absolutely useless, but we must keep on trying and this measure may be useful in solving our difficulties to some extent.  If it goes a little part of the way towards that, we shall have achieved something.</P>

    <P>Deputy Russell was somewhat puzzled about the amount of subscriptions in the Schedule to the Bill.  It tots up to $100,000,000, but actually there are countries that have withdrawn. <Col N="321" /> I should not say they have withdrawn: they never went on: they intended to go on but did not.  Yugoslavia was one of them.  The amount of capital now subscribed is $90,000,000 not $100,000,000, and therefore there is room for other countries to come in to make up the $100,000,000 again.  The terms vary to some extent and will necessarily vary with circumstances. We could not expect them to put down set terms which they would follow on all occasions.  The only thing we can say in regard to that is that a number of countries have negotiated loans through this corporation and they must have been satisfied in regard to the terms.  If the necessity arises for us to borrow from the corporation, we may consider its terms suitable or we may not.  We must wait and see.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan came back to the old fallacy&mdash;if you like to call it that &mdash;of Clann na Poblachta about foreign capital.  Foreign capital cannot be brought back here&mdash;I mean our own capital invested outside the country&mdash; except by way of goods.  In any case, it would be no good to us in notes and we can return it only by way of goods, whether consumer or capital.  So far, we have never had any difficulty about getting whatever capital was required here for capital purposes, and the fact that we have brought in a Bill of this kind which gives us the opportunity to borrow from a foreign corporation, first of all, does not necessarily mean that we will ever need to go to them and, secondly, if we do need them, it does not follow that we would be absolutely short of capital, although indeed it might happen.  If there is very big development here&mdash;which I hope there will be&mdash;we might not have enough capital of our own to pay for the foreign equipment and machinery necessary for such development.</P>
    <P>I think there should be no objection to joining this corporation.  It gives us the right to apply, if we think well of it.  We subscribe to the capital there.  We are quite entitled, if they do well, to get interest on what we subscribe.  We have the right at any time to withdraw and say: &ldquo;We want our subscription back.&rdquo;  We can withdraw from the corporation if we think <Col N="322" /> it has not turned out to be as beneficial as at the moment we expect it to be.</P>

      <P>I should explain that, under existing law, before this Bill would become law and before this section would become law, industrial and provident societies are normally exempt from income-tax under Schedule D in respect of trading profits, but they are not entitled to exemption under Schedule B in respect of market gardening profits.  We are transferring income from market gardening from Schedule B to Schedule D. The sub-section was put in to leave provident societies as they were, that they would be subject to income-tax under this section, but now, on consideration of representations made by Deputy Haughey and others on the Committee Stage, I have decided to ask the Dáil to remove this sub-section (6) and put provident societies on the same basis in market gardening as any other trade.  In other words, they are free from income-tax in this as everything else.</P>

      <P>In page 5, lines 56 and 57, to delete &ldquo;refrain from giving notice under this paragraph or may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had a great deal of discussion on this during the Committee Stage, and I am still in some doubt as to the method adopted.  If the appeal is put in the Special Commissioners' list, notice of that appeal must be given to the taxpayer.  I could not possibly accept a suggestion that it should be in the discretion of the inspector as to whether an appeal that was listed was notified to the taxpayer or not.  I think what is intended in this case is something that is slightly different, but I am not a bit happy about its expression, and it has only come to me as a result of the discussions on the last occasion.</P>
      <P>If an appeal is lodged to an assessment in the ordinary way, I think the inspector is bound to give notice.  It is fair enough to provide that if the appeal is not going to be listed at all, an inspector may refrain from giving notice.  That is perfectly fair, but if the appeal is listed, as I understand the way the section has been framed, then the inspector must give notice.  I do not see where the proviso in Clause (2) takes it only to the cases in which an appeal has not been listed.  Clause (b) says that notice must be given and then it goes on to say that notice need not be given in a case that might be settled, but it covers the case that has already been listed.  As far as I can see, if a case is put in the Special Commissioners' list, then the taxpayer must be informed as of right.  There must not be any discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in this instance dealing with a Deputy who knows the procedure much better than I do.  As far as I can learn in regard to this item, first of all, the case is not listed because the giving of notice is <Col N="326" /> the same as listing.  That is the first point that must be kept in mind.  If the Deputy's amendment were accepted&mdash;first of all, let me give an example&mdash;it would cause unnecessary trouble and would really lead to an unworkable method of dealing with cases in which an inspector thought the appeal would be settled by agreement.  He would have to give notice and he would then have to withdraw the notice.  If he did not withdraw the notice, the taxpayer would have to appeal before the Special Commissioners to seek an adjournment.  I believe these are the salient points.</P>
      <P>Let us go back to Section 3 for a moment.  Section 2 (a) says that the Special Commissioners are to appoint times and places for the hearing of appeals, that is, generally speaking, and the clerk to the Special Commissioners is to give notice of such times and places to the inspector of taxes. Under sub-section (2) (b), the inspector of taxes has to give notice in writing to each person who has given notice of appeal.  This, however, is subject to the proviso set out in (2) (b) (i) and (ii).  One relates to the case in which the appeal has been settled by agreement. I do not think there is any difficulty there.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (ii) deals with a case where settlement by agreement is likely.  I think that is the case we are dealing with.  As long as the inspector has refrained from giving notice or has withdrawn notice already given, the appeal is still open.  I do not think there is any doubt about that.  If the inspector comes to a conclusion, a settlement will be arrived at.  He would then have the appeal listed and would send notice to the taxpayer of the time and place appointed for hearing.  Paragraph (ii) would no longer apply.  Instead, the opening words of (2) (b) would take effect.  It should be added also that the inspector could not have proceedings taken to recover tax where there was an open appeal.  Consequently, he would be most anxious to have the appeal heard.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 27, to add at the end of the sub-section:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided that the rank or status of the officer signing the notice is therein stated.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a very simple thing.  I think it is the practice for all notices of this sort to be signed &ldquo;Patrick Murphy, Inspector of Taxes&rdquo;, &ldquo;Patrick Murphy, Assistant Secretary&rdquo;, or whatever it may be.  It is perfectly proper that the notice should be taken as <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  It should not be signed &ldquo;Patrick Murphy&rdquo;.  The rank of the person signing ought to be clear.  Once the qualification is there, it is easy enough for the taxpayer to verify it.  If he has to go chasing around to see whether Patrick Murphy is an inspector, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, a Special Commissioner in certain circumstances or a principal officer in a tax office, it would be most unfair.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 49, to add at the end of the sub-section:&mdash;&ldquo;but does not include sums disbursed by such employed person as an agent for his employer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am genuinely worried the more I look at this section as to what is intended here.  Take a case of my own.  I send a court clerk to court and he is given money before he goes to court.  He brings affidavits with him to court and stamps half a dozen affidavits at 2/6 apiece.  Then he files the affidavits. Those are expenses that he has to meet in accordance with his job.  He pays the moneys as my agent or as the agent for my client but they are expenses that he meets in the ordinary course of his business.  I do not think anybody intends that returns would have to include matters such as that but I cannot see how you can differentiate disbursements of that sort as the Bill is framed.  We agreed on the last occasion that, be they individuals or companies, 95 per cent. of the taxpayers are honourable, honest people, endeavouring to discharge their obligations under the law to the best of their ability.  I am concerned with <Col N="330" /> people who are reading this section and who are endeavouring to the best of their ability to see what they are bound to return.  It seems to me that under Section 6 now they have to include in that special return disbursements of that sort.</P>
    <P>I mention the solicitors' disbursements purely as a technical case.  I can see exactly similar cases.  Take the man in the company whose business it is to keep the company abreast of modern information and who goes down to a book seller in accordance with his job and buys half a dozen technical books for circulation amongst the technical officers of the company. Instead of having the account sent to the company, he pays for them in cash there and then.  These are expenses which now he must return under Section 105 though the books are not bought for him but are bought for the use of other members of the company. There must be some method in the statute of differentiating in order to ensure that the type of expenses about which the Minister wishes the Revenue Commissioners to have information should be taken out from those expenses about which he does not wish them to have information.  Otherwise, it will mean that the 95 per cent. will have to keep innumerable records that are of no avail to anybody and which merely cost time, trouble and annoyance.</P>
    <P>I go back to the solicitors' case because it is the case I know myself. There are three court clerks for an office who go down to court every day. All of them have to expend money on stamp duties and fees for the solicitors. All officers work on an imprest system. When they come back, they report to the cashier the moneys that have been expended for clients A. B. C. D. and E. The moneys are debited to those clients accordingly and the duties and fees that have been expended are recovered from the clients concerned.  It is immaterial to the client whether those moneys were expended by court clerk W., X., or Y. and no record, therefore, would be kept by the solicitors concerned as to which court clerk did so expend the money.</P>
    <P>Under this section, the moneys that <Col N="331" /> have been given to the court clerk to expend in that way are expenses that must be returned by the individual clerks in their returns and then they must go back and get exemption from them.  The employer must equally return that, of the amount spent, £X was spent by Clerk Y., £Z was spent by Clerk W., and so forth.  That is not the type of expenditure that should be included under Section 105 of the Income-Tax Act, as amended by this Section 6. Yet, if this section is left as it is, I shall have a statutory duty in future to determine and to return which of my clerks paid a fee for my client, Patrick Murphy from Naas.  It is of no possible use to anybody that my books should be cluttered up in that way.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to discuss amendment No. 6 without reference to amendment No. 7 also because one would be inclined to use arguments against amendment No. 6 that might be held against you on amendment No. 7.

      <P>Amendment No. 6 is the wider amendment.  Amendment No. 7 is a limitation of it.  It is a method by which I thought one could limit it in some way.  As a matter of fact, I had drafted amendment No. 7 first and then it struck me that amendment No. 7 would be too narrow. Take the case I have given purely because it is a case I know.  Since the court fees were raised to such an extortionate degree by the Minister's predecessor in office, very much greater moneys have to be carried by court clerks and a figure of £2 would not cover it.  As far as I am concerned, these were two ways that occurred to me.  If the Minister has a better way, <Col N="332" /> I am perfectly happy to take it.  What I want to provide is that firms and companies will not be asked to clutter up records that can have no possible use.  As the section is framed I am afraid they will have to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is framed in a very comprehensive way to deal with every possible eventuality that might occur.  I think it would be almost impossible to frame the section with the exception mentioned.  From the experience we have had of making an exception at all, we know that it is likely to be availed of to avoid income-tax in one way or another.  The section has, of necessity, to be wide in its application. I did say, on the Committee Stage, when this matter was raised, as reported in Volume 169, column 321:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The form which it will be proposed to serve on employers in this matter will be a prescribed form and it will be possible to exclude many of the irritating things to which employers might object, such as the inclusion of bus fares.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that we can deal with the case of a boy sent out with urgent letters and given his bus fare. That can be excluded.  However, I am not so sure about the law clerk mentioned by Deputy Sweetman.  In that case the amount might be very big and it would be difficult to include it as an exception.  In the working of this section it should be possible to deal with cases of that kind and make it easier for the employer to make a return.  If it has been the practice that solicitors have to give a certain amount of money to law clerks for one reason or another, it should be possible to make it easier for the employer to give a return in that case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners may prescribe the form and <Col N="333" /> under that power they will be able to make the prescribed form easier.  The first amendment would be too wide because it would be possible under it to give the employee £1,000.  He would return £100 of that as expenses and, if he was found out, he would be able to say that the other £900 had been given to the employee on the employer's behalf to be disposed for entertainment.  That, of course, would vitiate the whole part of the Act which is designed to deal with evasions of that kind.  To conclude, therefore, my attitude is that I shall have to resist No. 6.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 will, to a large extent, be met by the prescribed form. That is as far as I can go.</P>

      <P>I shall be happy so long as I have a decision on amendment No. 10.  I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 18 and 19, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>As soon as may be after the passing of this Act, the commission now considering the income-tax code shall be requested by the Minister to consider Part IV of this Act and to make an interim report thereon to the Minister who shall submit same to Dáil Éireann and this part of the Act shall come into operation three months after such report is so submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> We have discussed this at some length already.  I was not satisfied with the income-tax code as it was.  I set up a commission to investigate the matter. I felt that the code was so complicated that nothing short of a commission could carry through an adequate investigation.  For years, there had been a clamour for such a commission. The commission was appointed in the financial year 1956-57.  The Minister is now unilaterally coming in and amending the code in a very comprehensive way without waiting for the report of that commission.  If he is not prepared to wait for the general report of the commission he should submit the matter forthwith to the commission which is in being and ask them for an interim report.</P>
    <P>None of us in this House is capable, no matter what technical knowledge we may have of business or of the application of the Income-Tax Acts or of the law surrounding the Income-Tax Acts, of judging whether the provisions introduced by this Bill are fair or reasonable.  The proper thing to do, therefore, is to refer the whole matter to the commission that has been appointed for that purpose and let them come in with an interim report, if necessary. If it is a matter that cannot wait for their final report, let them come in with an interim report.  If they say that the facts are along one line or along another, then those of us in the House will know what we are legislating about.  Without that knowledge, I am afraid it is quite inevitable that Part IV of this Bill will, not withstanding the protracted discussion we had about it, be turned into legislation without many of us knowing the exact implications it will have for the 99 per cent. honourable people in the community who wish merely to carry through their lawful obligations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reasonable to ask that this amendment be inserted.  The Income-Tax Commission was set up in response to a widespread demand for a revision of the income-tax code.  It is generally accepted that the code as at present working is complex and in many respects archaic.  To a very considerable extent it is adopted, as in the <Col N="338" /> case of earlier Acts, merely by continuing statutes which were in operation prior to the establishment of the State.</P>
      <P>Whatever may be said in respect of the earlier years, because a number of other matters had to be attended to, there was probably quite a good reason for adopting and continuing British statutes.  Now, after the passage of 36 years, we still continue in many cases to adopt some of the worst features of the British tax code and we do not incorporate in Finance Acts here some of the many improvements that have taken place there.</P>
      <P>One of the extraordinary situations that has developed is that some of the Acts that have been amended or repealed in Britain continue here.  It is possible in some cases that they are not enforced.  Nevertheless, they are still on the Statute Book and have legislative effect if they are applied.  Undoubtedly, because of the complex nature of the problem, a commission was the only method of dealing with it.</P>
      <P>In many ways, income-tax is an unfair tax.  Views have been expressed from time to time that it should be abolished.  I do not think that is a view that, on examination, could be sustained as sound.  The main difficulty is to provide an alternative tax which would yield equivalent revenue and at the same time not be even more unfair or press more harshly than the present income-tax code does.</P>
      <P>It was for these reasons, among others, that the commission was set up. On a number of occasions, requests were made in this House to introduce desirable changes.  In recent times, these requests have always been refused on the ground that the Income-Tax Commission was sitting and that, pending its report, any change could not or should not be made.  One change advocated in many quarters is the introduction of the P.A.Y.E. system. Whether or not that is desirable in the circumstances of this country is a matter on which the commission will express a viewpoint.  Industrial workers, persons whose incomes can readily be ascertained in advance, would probably welcome it.  It is for that reason that it is peculiarly applicable to British conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> In this country, we have a large number of self-employed people and a very large number of people who derive their livelihood from agriculture.  In their case it is not obvious&mdash;certainly at first glance&mdash;how the P.A.Y.E. system could work.  That is one of the matters which the commission is examining. Up to the present, any question of introducing that system here has been refused on the ground that it is being examined by the commission.  Therefore, it is a surprise to a great many people and, indeed, a fact that is in strange contrast with the various claims that have been put forward recently that we are granting tax reliefs, that we are providing incentives of all kinds, to induce industrialists, particularly foreign industrialists or foreign technicians, to come in here and establish industry.</P>
    <P>While that is being done we introduce Part IV of this Bill, which adds considerably to the already very drastic and comprehensive powers the revenue authorities had and gives them still greater powers, in anticipation of the report of this commission and in conflict with, and in sharp contrast to the policy that has been accepted generally as desirable by all sides of the House in the case of legislation promoted in recent years dealing with allowances for industrialists to export, and the recent measure, whether it achieves anything or not, which was designed to encourage external investment in industry here.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, and because of the general tendency to grant whatever facilities are possible to provide incentives, it is regrettable to enact these very drastic powers, which have not been shown to be necessary and which will add considerably to the expenses of the business community and will involve further problems, further additional administrative expenses which will cause unnecessary work.  It is obvious from the various Acts at present in force that the revenue authorities have already adequate powers to deal with the problem; and it is both undesirable and unnecessary <Col N="340" /> that this measure should be enacted with Section 4 as at present framed.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances this amendment requests the commission to consider Part IV of the Bill and to make an interim report to the Minister, who shall submit it to Dáil Éireann, and that three months after that report is submitted this section of the Bill should come into operation.  That appears to anyone a reasonable request. There is no justification for these drastic powers, and there is certainly no justification for them in advance of the report of this Income-Tax Commission. Is it contended that the authorities feel that this commission will suggest that some amendments should be made, and that they are jumping the gun in order to take advantage of the present measure before the commission reports?  The income-tax code is very complicated.  It is quite likely that one of the recommendations of the commission will be that the law should be modified and a more simple code should be adopted.  While it is an accepted legal maxim that <i>ignorantia legis haud exousat</i>, nevertheless it is only fair and reasonable that this House should not enact further legislation which will make the existing complex code even more complicated, and it is for that reason that I believe this amendment is reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have in my hand two large books dealing with the law on income-tax in Ireland.  Deputy Cosgrave has said that there is an accepted legal principle which says that no man can plead his ignorance of the law in defence of his failure to comply with it. That is true of the citizen, but it ought to be 1,000 times more true of the Legislature. We have no right to persecute the citizens of this country and then excuse ourselves on the ground that we did not know what we were doing. I want to go on record now as saying that there is no Deputy, including the Minister for Finance, who knows that the impact of Part IV of this Bill will be on the commercial community of this country.  But we do know that in the last 40 years the number of private companies has increased from 700 to approximately 7,000, and the whole trend of our law has been to encourage <Col N="341" /> people in family businesses to convert them into small private companies.</P>
      <P>We have a situation here which is in no sense analogous to the situation obtaining in Great Britain.  We have taken over from the British Finance Act practically <i>en bloc</i> these provisions in relation to income-tax and expenses of directors and employees of companies. Those provisions were drafted to meet a situation obtaining in Great Britain.  I do not know how those provisions will impinge on the conditions obtaining in this country.  We have a commission at present sitting which has all the powers that we have not got to get the necessary information. Deputies have no reason to rebuke themselves if they are obliged to state that they do not understand the full implications of Part IV of this Bill, because we have not at our disposal in this Chamber of Dáil Éireann the power to get the information we ought to have if we are intelligently to pass on these proposals.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Income-Tax has that power, for it can send for papers and hear evidence and can invite anybody who feels&mdash;and there are a great many people who do feel&mdash;that this part of the Bill will create impossible conditions, to come before the commission and tell it what their anxieties are and why and how these proposals should be amended and adapted to Irish conditions.  We have made this argument at great length on the Committee Stage, and the Minister has turned it down.  We now make the proposal that Part IV of this Bill should be referred to the Income-Tax Commission for examination, discussion and report, and that for a period of three months this part of the Finance Bill should not come into operation, but that at the end of that period we should have another look at it in the light of the interim report of the Income-Tax Commission, supported by the minutes of evidence tendered to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a reckless, improvident procedure to legislate on this matter which none of us fully understands, and then spend the next ten years trying to remedy the very grave injuries we may have done to the mercantile <Col N="342" /> community of this country.  The trouble is that one is speaking for the sections of the community who are not ordinarily very vocal, whose principal occupation in life is trying to earn their living and trying to conform to the law.  As Deputy Sweetman has pointed out, 90 per cent. of them are concerned only to conform to the law. They will find it intolerably difficult to conform to Part IV of this Bill, but those who are concerned to avoid their common obligation to bear their fair share of the taxes are normally very well fitted to thread their way through the complex situation created by this part of the Bill with the assistance of highly paid technical advisers.  The bulk of the 7,000 private companies represents small shopkeepers and small businesses up and down the country who are not normally in a position to grapple with this kind of problem and who will be put to very heavy expense and endless anxiety.</P>
    <P>There could not conceivably be any frantic urgency about the enactment of Part IV.  There ought to be, in the mind of every Deputy, a very high sense of urgency that we should not, by our legislation, create unnecessary inconveniences for the ordinary taxpayer. It has been argued that the existing income-tax code, rooted in the Income-Tax Act of 1918, with all the differentiations that have grown up about it, has already become an unbearable burden for the average taxpayer. That is as may be.  That is a general question which the Income-Tax Commission is considering and about which they will perhaps make recommendations.</P>
    <P>I do not think I exaggerate when I say the introduction of Part IV of this Bill, while the commission is sitting, is an offensive procedure and will create in the minds of the members of the commission the idea that nobody is paying the slightest attention to the herculean effort in which they are engaged. I do not think that is right. All the members of the commission are working on a voluntary basis, and rendering services which, professionally, would command very high fees, but for which they are getting no fees.  The least the Legislature might do is to pay them the respect of waiting to hear <Col N="343" /> what they have to say on the code as a whole, but especially on Part IV of this Bill, a provision similar to which has so recently been enacted in Great Britain and which could, perfectly easily, be brought to their attention for review and consideration, in the light of the special conditions obtaining here.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister will do good service to the Legislature if he accepted, as a second best, the proposals before him in Deputy Sweetman's amendment.  At this stage of the Bill I do not believe the revenue, or the community, would conceivably suffer any loss by the acceptance of this amendment.  I want to make it perfectly clear that in pressing this view on the Minister I am not thinking of the case of the large public company which has all the machinery at its disposal to catch up with whatever the income-tax code turns out to be, after the passing of the Finance Bill.  I am thinking of the 7,000 small private companies which are, in fact, family businesses, incorporated in order to make compliance with the law easier than it is, or would be, if they remained unincorporated, as most of them were up to 30 or 40 years ago.</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is to postpone the operations of this part of the Bill until the Income-Tax Commission has reported upon it. What we are discussing, therefore, is whether the commission should be asked to consider Part IV of the Bill or not.  The Income-Tax Commission has been set up and their first consideration would be whether or not income-tax should be replaced by some other form of taxation, either partially or wholly, and if wholly or partially, to suggest some form of revenue that might fill the void created.  Apart from that they would be quite free, if they found income-tax was inevitable and had to be continued, to make a report on certain aspects of the income-tax code.  But I cannot imagine their ever considering a matter of this kind. They might, for instance, as suggested by one Deputy, consider P.A.Y.E. as a system.  They might conceivably suggest there should be a <Col N="344" /> higher limit, that is, that the lower income group should not be asked to pay income-tax.  I do not think they would be likely to consider the issue of the expenses that should be allowed.</P>
      <P>This part of the Bill deals with people who are either avoiding or evading income-tax&mdash;whether legally or illegally it does not matter.  It is designed to meet that particular problem. The object of Part IV, as I mentioned both on the Second Stage and the Committee Stage, is to try as far as we possibly can to get equitable treatment for all taxpayers.  We all know that the great majority of employers, and those working for them, make suitable, open and full returns of their expenses and that they are therefore meeting their obligations to the full under the income-tax code. We know, on the other hand, that there are certain employers not making full returns and not making returns of moneys they are giving to their employees for expenses and where, in some cases, the amount given is unjustifiable.</P>
      <P>The object of Part IV is that the Income-Tax Commissioners, and their staffs, should be the judges of what is a fair amount of expenses, and not the employers themselves because there is no doubt that in this country the consciences of the employers vary very much.  The great majority have strict consciences on these matters and make proper returns, and those working for them pay a full share of income-tax. A minority amongst the employers have not got that same conscience and do not make full returns and their employees are therefore getting away with expenses they should never be allowed.  Part IV is designed to stop that inequality which is going on.</P>

    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke of the 7,000 small private companies.  What I have said would apply to them as to everyone else.  I suppose if you take any section of the community, I do not care who they are&mdash;businessmen, employees, professional men, or anyone else&mdash;you will have a big proportion of honest people and a small proportion not so honest.  The same applies to the 7,000 companies.  One thing I would say about the small companies with an income of £7,000 or £8,000 is that the <Col N="345" /> obligation we are putting on them to keep these accounts is certainly not going to be very onerous.  There would not be many people employed by that small private company getting money handed over to them in cash, to spend on behalf of the company.  For that reason the extra book-keeping and so on, will not be very much.  They cannot, therefore, object to it on that score.  I am sure none of us will have any sympathy with them if they object on that score and try to get away in the future with things they got away with in the past.  For that reason, I do not think we can be accused of being stricter with the smaller companies than the bigger companies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon and others said that this was a copy of the legislation in Britain.  I do not know.  I have not compared the clauses.  It may be that we have largely followed the clauses in Britain, but I am quite sure we have not followed them completely.  This scheme has been in operation in Britain for some time.  They may have discovered its shortcomings by now, and we would have the benefit of that in drafting our legislation.</P>
    <P>When dealing with companies, it must be remembered that we have given advantages to our companies here not given to companies in Britain.  In Britain, for instance, they <Col N="346" /> have not given relief on excess profits; we have done so here.  Neither have they given relief on investments in British companies; we have given Irish companies relief from income-tax on the yield from investments in Irish companies.  That is an inducement to people to support Irish industry.  We differ from the British in many other smaller matters.  Even if we were more severe than the British in this case, we can claim to be more lenient in other directions.  But we are not being accused of being more severe; we are accused of doing the same as the British.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon says conditions here are not the same as those in Britain. I do not think the conditions vary very much where you have people trying to evade paying tax.  The conditions are much the same.  The Government concerned wants the tax, wants to see equity as between all taxpayers, and the methods adopted do not usually vary very much.  I do not think much can be made of the point that conditions here are different from those in Britain.  This abuse should not be allowed to continue.  We should deal with the matter as quickly as possible. I do not think it is an appropriate matter to be considered by the Income-Tax Commission and, therefore, I oppose this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last evening, I was dealing with one matter mentioned in the Minister's opening statement&mdash;the necessity to eradicate the slums.  Perhaps the necessity for concentration on slum clearance is not sufficiently recognised. Perhaps we are not as fully aware as we should be of the slackening off which has taken place in all building activities over the last few years.  The picture is a rather easy one to explain.</P>
      <P>After the end of the emergency, an immediate all-out drive was entered upon for the purpose of continuing the good work which had been in progress before the emergency.  Local authorities everywhere, and particularly in Dublin, were faced with a task which had grown so much greater because of the very slight building activity possible during the emergency years.  In 1948 and 1949, appeals went out to building craftsmen working in England, Scotland and Wales to come home to Ireland to use  their energy and skill and ability, to aid local authorities here in dealing expeditiously with this very serious problem.  It was held out to building workers, skilled and unskilled, who had been forced to emigrate, that if they answered this call there was a reasonable assurance that a long felt want in the building industry would be fulfilled&mdash;the need of some continuity of employment.  Among practically all forms of industrial activity, building construction work is almost the only one in which craft workers and unskilled workers do not have at least an assurance, when they start a day's work, that they will be working at the end of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This call was answered in 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951.  The tempo rose and the number of dwellings under construction increased rapidly.  The employment given on building construction throughout the country, and particularly in the city areas, reached probably a level never before achieved.  In the years 1951 and 1952 or thereabouts, on building construction in the City of Dublin between local authority employment and the parallel efforts of private speculative builders, building societies and persons engaged in providing homes for themselves, there was <Col N="349" /> employment roughly of a nature of not less than 5,000 to 7,000, between craft workers and unskilled workers.</P>
    <P>In 1952-53 some 3,000 dwellings were under construction and I think the output for the year was 2,500.  At that stage we reached the apex of the ascending curve and we proceeded to drop fairly substantially.  In the life of the present Government and that of its immediate predecessor we have had the picture, as mentioned by the Minister in his opening remarks, of a steady decline in building activities.  The decline reached a point in the City of Dublin where at the end of May of this year a total of only some 430 houses and some 229 flats were under construction by Dublin Corporation.  The total number of building workers engaged in that work was approximately 266.  It is easy to agree with the Minister's statement that there has been a falling-off in building activity; in fact that might be described as a classic example of understatement.</P>
    <P>Parallel with this falling off there has been a very considerable reduction in the demand for houses built under the S.D. Acts.  This is the position on the constructional side but we see in the housing review prepared by the city medical officer and his staff, issued in 1956, there is a statement that 15,000 dwellings are still required in Dublin City.  The local authority is faced with the problem of a decline in building activity while it still has a very substantial need for houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the need to concentrate on slum clearance but one of the many problems connected with that is the long delay that occurs from the time it is originally planned to acquire land, develop it and build on it in a city area.  If it was as easy to build on a vacant site in the city as it is to build houses on the perimeter I have no doubt slum clearance could be speeded up but there appear to be innumerable difficulties.  The Minister rightly indicated one of these and has dealt with it in this Bill.  It arises from the necessity, in connection with the construction of flats, of closing roads and rights of way.  Under existing procedure the local authority <Col N="350" /> could be held up for weeks if not months.  The Minister proposes to come to the aid of the local authority in this respect and his efforts are more than welcome.</P>
    <P>There is one other factor that may still block progress in this field.  When a local authority decides, with the approval of the Department of Local Government, to build a block of flats, 50, 60 or 100 or more in a city area, the problem of acquisition is on some occasions prejudiced to some extent by the fact that while they can get sufficient ground to build the flats there is also the necessity or desirability of getting proper approaches. On a number of occasions they run into difficulties in that way.  In order to get these approaches they may come in conflict with proposals of the local authority under road widening schemes.</P>
    <P>Although the development of a block of flats in or near a certain street might be considerably eased, if it were possible to have the acquisition of the sites for the flats and the road widening at the same time, up to the present it is necessary for the local authority to set two separate trains of activity in motion.  The local authority must apply under the respective Acts for power to acquire property for building and they must apply separately for power to acquire property for road widening. The housing provisions make the problem relatively simple at least in the case of acquisition for slum clearance and it can be dealt with rapidly but, in the actual planning and construction of the flat buildings, the local authority may be delayed by the fact that there is a road widening scheme next door to the project for flat development and, under the provisions governing acquisition for road widening, they may be held up for two years. I would ask the Minister to look into this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>While there is no considerable amount of building taking place on the perimeter now it is no harm to mention one of the difficulties that has cropped up and may crop up again in the future.  That is the problem of vesting property.  Once the corporation acquires a large area for development, from 50 to 200 acres, they are entitled <Col N="351" /> under the Acts to have the property vested in them on, I think, two weeks' notice, but if any of that land is required for school sites the two weeks' notice does not apply and there is interminable delay in having the property and possibly, the representations, examined and the land finally vested.</P>
    <P>One of the problems facing local authorities and the citizens of Dublin for a long time is the inordinate delay in arranging for the provision of adequate schools.  A scheme of 800 houses was completed at Coolock, Raheny, and it is only now, after a period of two years, that a site for a school has been made available there. Perhaps the Minister would use his good offices in regard to that problem.</P>
    <P>There is a second problem which I am sure will engage his attention.  In the course of the development of the City of Dublin in recent years, very large stretches of rural areas have been taken into the city, and quite a considerable number of cottages that were vested in the tenants under the Labourers Acts are now within the city boundary.  It can happen that when a local authority decides to prepare a building scheme, and requires a small portion of the land on which such cottages stand, it finds that the land cannot be sub-divided under the Labourers Acts.</P>
    <P>We realise that security of tenure is an important matter, but in the City of Dublin any residence or industrial property can be acquired or sub-divided, if it is essential for the building of dwellings under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  There are, however, anomalies and in certain areas, even within the older part of the city, the local authority cannot enter upon any portion of ground, unless it takes the whole plot.  In many cases the local authority does not want to take the whole plot, or to disturb the owner, except to the least possible extent, but as I understand the position, there is no provision for subdivision. If the local authority wants an area 15 yards long by two yards wide, it must, in those cases, take a man's house from him because it is not <Col N="352" /> legally possible to divide the plot of ground on which it is built.</P>
    <P>Another problem which must engage the Minister's attention is that of houses vested under the Labourers Acts which can be transferred only to agricultural labourers.  That is quite a proper procedure in rural areas, but I would suggest that the Minister might examine the position in cases where these cottages are situated in what have now become urban areas. He should see whether such cottages might be transferred by agreement to members of the working classes.</P>
    <P>Housing finance is one of the basic problems facing us in Dublin.  It must be freely admitted that successive Governments have been as generous as circumstances allowed in affording local authorities, including the local authority of the City of Dublin, assistance under this heading, but the position to-day is that the local authority is building houses that qualify for slum clearance and certain ancillary grants subsidised to the extent of 66? per cent. of the interest loan charges up to a minimum of £1,500 on a house.  The bulk of houses built in recent years by Dublin Corporation have been four-roomed houses, and a few of them have cost more than £1,500.  The local authority is allowed 66? per cent. on a maximum of £2,000 in the case of flat dwellings, but the cost of a flat, even of a three-roomed flat, is well in excess of £2,000, and perhaps the Minister would examine that matter while this Bill is under discussion.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome the provisions in the Bill which make it easier for persons to seek repair and improvement grants.  That situation has been very difficult in the past, and the provision made in this Bill should be of great value.  The increase in the amount of grants under this heading will be welcomed and a fairly successful attempt has been made to simplify the machinery dealing with them.  One difficulty still exists and I do not know how it can be surmounted.  It is still necessary that, to qualify for the grant, the Minister must be satisfied the works are for the purpose of providing suitable housing accommodation.  The wording: &ldquo;suitable and essential <Col N="353" /> housing accommodation&rdquo; can have very wide and very diverse meanings. There are many hundreds of houses in the City of Dublin that require repair and the provisions in this Bill, as they exist, will be exercised by the local authority.</P>
    <P>A very large number of these houses have been constructed over the years with various architectural features. Some of them have quite adequate bedroom accommodation and excellent reception rooms, but they are very inadequate in relation to those rooms in which the housewife has to work most of the day.  In many cases you will find a house that is quite ample in other respects with a miserable kitchenette&mdash;a little box of a room maybe 8 feet or 9 feet long and about 5 or 6 feet wide.  I have no doubt that if the owners or occupiers of such houses were sure that they would qualify for assistance in making this room, or excuse for a room, more suitable for its purposes and thus make the life of the housewife a little more comfortable, they would make application.</P>
    <P>Is there a danger even under the present Bill that an inspector of the Department of Local Government will come along and have a look at a house; see that it is very nice on the outside and say that the house is a perfectly fine house suitable in every way and that he will not agree it is eligible for a repair grant?  I would ask the Minister to look into that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to keep a close eye on what happens in regard to the problem of tenements in our city. Tenement dwellings under the Act are those dwellings in which there are three families or more, although, strictly speaking, there is a very wide divergence in regard to what might be defined under the Acts as tenement dwellings.  We normally understand tenement dwellings to be dwellings in which people are compelled to live in one or two rooms.  There are quite a large number of dwellings which might legally qualify for the same description but they have been converted into decent flats and provide very decent <Col N="354" /> accommodation.  It is with the first type of dwelling I am concerned.</P>
    <P>There are still a large number of these tenement dwellings in the city and either the Minister's Department or the local authority should be very careful as to the basis upon which public money is expended in putting a facade of repair on some of them. Some might be made appear suitable for accommodation by the expenditure of money, when the dwellings themselves might be structurally unsound. In addition, it has been generally accepted that families should not be expected to reside four or five storeys up from the ground level, unless there is some form of lift.  While it is true that the local authority in Dublin have built a considerable number of four-storey flats in recent times, the concentration has been upon three-storey flat blocks with a maisonette on top, which gives a maximum of four storeys, but there are still a large number of four-storey buildings in the City of Dublin.  I do not think they are suitable for families where there are young children and old people.  Neither do I think it is suitable for them to live in basements.  There is a very great strain on the young mother carrying an infant and on the older people whose arteries are beginning to harden because of having to walk up the stairs. Whatever provisions there are in the Bill, an effort should be made to ensure that these repair and improvement grants will be used to benefit owners, tenants and occupiers and benefit those who, through widowhood or loss of employment, have been forced to utilise their dwellings as a means to supplement their low incomes.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word or two with reference to the proposed variation in levying rates.  Everyone agrees that the present system is one which imposes hardship on a growing family. After a period of seven years, just when the children are reaching school age and when costs are becoming heavy on the family, the local authority, under the present system, says: &ldquo;You must pay full rates instead of two-thirds.&rdquo; The proposal in the Bill may ease the situation but I do not think it will bring very great comfort.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> In the case of the average couple getting married, possibly the first ten or 12 years are the most difficult.  I think, as the Minister has recognised some of the difficulties, that he might consider if it is possible to go a little further.  I do not suggest that we should return to the old system&mdash;the idea of one-twentieth for the first year and so on and the person should not pay full rates until he has been 20 years in the dwelling.  We have got to retain some sense of balance in these matters. We have to recognise, too, that the peak of building, even under the Small Dwellings Acts, has been passed. Had this proposal come in a few years earlier under whatever Government happened to think of it at the time, it would have been very much welcomed indeed by the thousands of people who provided houses in the past ten years. The number&mdash;at least in the urban areas&mdash;who will benefit by the proposal will not be very large.  Nevertheless, I suggest to the Minister that he might look at this proposal again and see whether it would be possible to recommend a slightly more generous approach.  I know that that is all he can do in the matter because the local authorities will have to meet the cost.  Nevertheless, I ask that the Minister should make some recommendation in the matter.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that, in general, as I said in opening, this Housing Bill is an improvement on present legislation.  It would be no harm to say, as a city Deputy, that we welcome the provisions in the Bill to encourage rural housing.  I do not know whether if, in the past 20 or 30 years, more adequate housing had been made available in rural areas, it would have encouraged the people to remain in those areas.  I think it is a good thing that the Minister has decided to help the rural areas in this way.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the provisions of the Bill, while they are generally welcome, will have any substantial effect on unemployment in the building industry, whether in the urban or rural areas.  The Bill, to a great extent, deals with repairs and improvements. Repairs and improvements can be <Col N="356" /> carried out, in many cases, by people working after hours, if they are lucky enough to have jobs.  Certainly these repairs and improvements would not be carried out under conditions that normally apply under substantial local authority or private enterprise building. Therefore, I think, without being in any way critical of the Minister, that the Bill will make no substantial change in the employment position in the building industry, particularly in the cities, or even in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to deal with the points I have mentioned and to bear in mind, in particular, the points I have mentioned in regard to the difficulties facing my own local authority. Might I conclude on one point on which I may not be supported by my own local authority or by the Department? I am convinced from my experience as a member of a local authority that it is most desirable to have flat buildings limited in number in any scheme.  I think, speaking from a personal point of view, that when you build 200, 300 or 400 flats, you may create a situation which tends to cause other expenses than are necessary by way of repairs.  The damage has been done in the years since the emergency and possibly even before that and now it is likely that it cannot be repaired. The mistake was made of having too great a concentration on the one type of building.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, in Dublin, we were inclined to overlook the fact that no community consists of people drawn from the one wage-earning class.  If you are anxious to have a community which will protect the property, and advise the children to protect it, that can best be done on the basis of a community drawn from different sections of society.  We are a little late in dealing with that matter now and I only mention it for the examination of the Minister in respect of future flat building schemes.  That is a personal view only. I think that a scheme of flats of 50 or 60 dwellings has been proved to be a much more attractive scheme than one which contains very many more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>All the Deputies who have so far spoken on this Housing Bill have said that it is a good Bill.  They <Col N="357" /> have been very shy in their real appraisal of the value of the Bill.  I want to say that, having read the Bill and having tried to understand it, I would, without any reservation, describe it as an excellent Bill.  It is quite obvious to me that a Party, which was responsible for the 1932 housing legislation which made the elimination of slumdom a priority of Government and local government activity, would be anxious, after the lapse of years between, to come along with further legislation which would bring the approach to this matter up to date.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell, the former Minister for Local Government, spoke on this Bill yesterday.  It is quite obvious that he was not speaking from the Bill but that he was speaking from the explanatory note.  He tried to bring politics into the discussion and talked about the fall in building activities. He did not give us details of the reasons for the slowing down in building activities and we have just heard Deputy Larkin, who is the chairman of the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation, praise this Bill and enter into no criticism of this Government because of the fall in the output of houses.  He knows the facts as I know them.</P>
      <P>Within the limited territory which is ours, under our administration as the Dublin Corporation, we have more or less decided we have gone as far as we should go in building in what is known as the perimeter of Dublin City. By building houses away from the centre of the city, it has become possible to vacate properties and acquire others for the purpose of getting back to building up the centre of the city. At the moment, Dublin Corporation are concentrating mainly on building activities within the centre of the city. We have a certain limited number of sites.  I think that, in all, we have 61 sites, some of which we are building on, some of which have been cleared, some of which are in the process of being cleared and some of which will be tackled later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that, within the next five years, these 61 sites will produce something in the nature of 6,000 flat <Col N="358" /> dwellings.  I think it is agreed that it is impossible to achieve the completion of these 6,000 dwellings in a lesser period of time.  I should like to emphasise that, as yet, nobody has raised his voice in this discussion against the Government that, due to Government interference or the withholding of finance, we have been unable to proceed as fast as we want to go as a local authority.  The day when the corporation had to intercede, by deputation and by protest, with the Government for the purpose of loosening up finance in order to enable the corporation to conduct its affairs properly in connection with building has gone.  We are glad the question of finance does not enter into the matter to-day.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fall in the production of houses under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, everybody who knows the history of the past few years is aware that, during the financial crisis&mdash;in the years from 1954 to 1957&mdash;the then Government introduced new regulations with regard to those who could be given financial assistance by way of Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts loans.  There was the fixing of the type of applicant who would be entitled to a supplementary grant and if he was not entitled to a supplementary grant he could not get a loan under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.</P>
    <P>We remember the negotiations entered into by the then Government with different loan societies to make money available for those who no longer qualified under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts regulations. The introduction of those restrictions brought the building of houses under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts almost to a standstill.  Since the restoration of loans to people previously debarred because of those stringent regulations, there has been a beginning of the building of houses under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  Again, there is a limit to what can be done in this respect on purely physical grounds.</P>
    <P>I am informed that, as a result of examination, our officials have concluded that there are, at a maximum, <Col N="359" /> 6,000 sites in our city area on which such houses can be built.  When those 6,000 houses have been built I do not know where new pieces of ground will be found.  At least, we can be grateful that the local authority is now enabled to proceed as fast as it wants to both with the building of houses and the building of flat dwellings.  It has practically no restrictions attached to the granting of loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts and the Government are making available to the local authority money for that purpose as fast as it is required.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, the Minister has gone very much farther than one could possibly have anticipated.  I think that, in all fairness, the House should congratulate this Minister on his adoption of most progressive methods in helping the communities, the local authorities and the people at large, to solve problems attaching to housing.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell, speaking of the new application of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, referred to what he called second-hand houses.  I think it is a fair description because it removes the type of dwelling that now qualifies for a loan under those Acts away from what you call a newly-built house.  I am not quite clear how part of the new development will operate.  I do not know to what extent it will be availed of&mdash;whether it will be to a small extent or to a very large extent. I do not know what new things we shall learn from people who try to avail of this new means of financing the purchase of already-built houses.  I do not know what the position will be with regard, say, to a statutory tenant in a house, the owner of which refuses to improve the house but rather tries to get possession in order that the house may now be sold with possession to a new purchaser at a very much more attractive value.  I see there is protection in the Bill for the tenant. If a landlord is sufficiently vicious to take that point of view, the tenant can himself, although he does not own the house, get an improvement grant from the local authority, repayable by him over a period of years.  Once repayment of the loan has been met, he then reverts to his original tenancy rent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> I should like to put a point to the Minister with regard to the building of houses under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  Money is now available.  Builders are there in great numbers anxious to continue the work of building and there is no doubt that workers are available also.  One of the problems facing a person who contemplates making a contract with a private speculative builder for the building of a house for himself with a loan under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts is the rate of interest.  There are people living in houses who borrowed for that transaction when borrowing rates were low. Others, living in similar types of houses, have had to borrow at a time when the rate of interest was at its greatest height.  Consequently, you have a position where, in the one case, the interest rates would be regarded as reasonable and, in the other case, as a great hardship.</P>
    <P>I am wondering whether the Minister cannot now consider lending moneys to local authorities, for Small Dwellings Acts purposes, at a fixed rate of interest so that people borrowing now, or in the future, will all have the same rate of interest to pay.  I want to say that where people build their own houses for themselves they are relieving the Government and the local authority of a great deal of responsibility and cost, and that the type of person who qualifies for a Small Dwellings Acts loan should be given consideration for, call it if you like, a subsidisation of his rate of interest if it goes above a certain level.  It is the same type of person who would qualify in many cases for a corporation tenancy.</P>
    <P>I want also to refer to this new approach to the payment of rates on new buildings.  There is now a distinction between the two-thirds remission for a period of seven years and the payment of rates on a graduated scale, beginning at one-tenth and finally coming up, in the tenth year, to the full amount.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin did touch upon this matter when he requested a 20 years' period but he pointed out that it would be the local authority who would <Col N="361" /> have to foot the bill by the non-collection of the full rates, after a certain period of years.  I remember some years ago receiving, with other members of this House, deputations of occupants of these new houses.  They came in groups from different areas, having formed themselves into what you might call S.D.A. Residents' Associations and so forth.  Their request was for this very scheme that the Minister is now introducing.  They did not expect to be relieved of a portion of their rates for a period longer than ten years, but they did feel that it would be more equitable or more in conformity with their particular situation of family development, to have their rates increased by one-tenth every year, after the period from which the rates first became due.</P>
    <P>I have no suggestion or request to make in that respect except to say that I believe those who will now benefit by this will be grateful for the new approach and I am sorry that this new arrangement was not adopted years ago, when it would have helped so many of the people who are now paying full rates and who did not have the benefit of an adjusted system such as this.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins mentioned something yesterday about which I was not quite clear.  I had the opportunity of speaking to him later and, as he himself said, he misquoted what he wanted to quote.  He referred to the Housing (Amendment) Act of 1954, and in particular to Section 12, sub-section (7).  I understood him yesterday to say that this benefit in the payment of rates did not apply to people who are not recipients of grants and I think the Minister pointed out to him that it did. Now I understand that what he was really referring to was increased valuation. Sub-section (7) of Section 12 of the Act of 1954 reads quite specifically that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a grant is made under this section in respect of works executed on a house, the valuation of the tenement consisting of or including the house shall not, on any valuation or revision of the valuation thereof coming into force within seven years after the completion of the works, be increased on account of any increase <Col N="362" /> in the value of such tenement arising from the works.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to confirm that where an owner of a house, without getting a grant, or without borrowing from the local authority, is now doing certain repairs or improvements to his house, he will also be protected against an increase in the valuation.  I do not see why a person who can afford to do this himself, or who wants to do it, and who saves the Government from giving a grant should be penalised.  If he is not covered by that particular protection he should be.</P>
    <P>Some years ago we did discuss here, on a Valuation Bill, the hardship on people who, when they improved premises, found themselves faced with substantial increases in valuation and thereby with very heavy increases in the payment of rates.  They were penalised every time they tried to improve their property, or keep it from going into complete obsolescence.  I do not know whether the Minister has had an opportunity, or will have an opportunity, of examining that but I would agree that there is a demand for equity as between citizen and citizen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin referred to problems which confront the local authority in the acquisition of property for building under a compulsory acquisition order.  I have also been giving this matter some consideration and I have already handed in an amendment to the Bill in the shape of a new section, which of course, will be taken on the Committee Stage.  I agree with Deputy Larkin that there is delay in the conveyance to the corporation of property authorised to be acquired compulsorily. As a result we are unable to proceed, because of these delays, with the handing over with full title of school sites in the middle of schemes of large development areas.  I do not want to delay the House now arguing out that point; I shall of course do so on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin also referred to another matter in which I am also interested.  There are maximum costs of houses and flats to which the Government gives a subsidy of two-thirds of the interest and loan charges <Col N="363" /> where there are slum clearance and such like projects.  The Dublin Corporation finds that the cost of a flat is far in excess of the maximum figure under which the two-thirds of the interest and loan charges are recouped, the maximum figure being £2,000.  I should like the Minister to consider varying the regulation which fixes these maximum figures.  It does not have to be done by legislation.  It can be done, if he so desires, by consultation between him and the Minister for Finance and by amending the regulations.</P>
    <P>We know that in some cases the cost of a flat dwelling rose as high as £2,600 and we cannot recoup the two-thirds interest and loan charges on the £600 excess over the £2,000.  As a result, we have to fix an economic rent for the tenant which we know is too high and which we know is, in many cases, beyond the capacity of the tenant to pay.  It is almost as dear in some places as the cost of a private builder's flat of similar extent in number of rooms, and so on.</P>
    <P>If we do not do that, if we fix a rent that is economic to the tenant, we have to put the difference on to the rates.  I fear that if this particular maximum figure is not varied to a higher level, we shall be faced in the future with very heavy charges on the rates in trying to be fair to all concerned. I am not pressing the question on the maximum allowance for single houses because the difference there is not so very great and, in any event, the number of those houses which will be built in the immediate future looks, from what we have heard everywhere, to be on the smaller side.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to contemplate seriously meeting this particular point.  It will help us in our planning for the next five years in the building of these flat dwellings.  It will mean a considerable amount to the ratepayers and to the occupants of these proposed new flat dwellings.  From the point of view of its impact on the Exchequer, it certainly will not be of any great consequence, because in view of the fall in the number of houses that are built on the basis of borrowing with Government subsidy of loan charges, <Col N="364" /> there will not be any increase, as it were, in expenditure to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I would have liked those who spoke on the sections in the Bill dealing with grants for improvement and repairs to have considered it in more detail.  I believe these provisions will be taken advantage of to the fullest, that there will be a great increase in activity arising from them.  I do not agree with Deputy Larkin that there will not be a substantial increase in employment. As far as I understand these repairs and reconstructions in old houses are not the same class of work as goes on in the construction of a new building. In many cases, there will be a heavy labour content and consequently a large part of the money will be spent on wages.  The unskilled worker content in repair and reconstruction work is greater than it is in the building of new houses.  They have to carry in materials through doorways, upstairs and downstairs, bring in materials for mixing, take out rubble and so on.  The actual construction work, from the point of view of labour content and labour wages, can be figured to be higher than in any other type of construction work.  I believe this Bill will be availed of regularly.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this improvement in our housing legislation has been brought about, as it will keep from going into quick disrepair, and ultimately out of use, a number of houses to which for, years, no repairs or improvements were made, and no reconstruction was done in the structural sense.  Furthermore I believe we shall be able to save houses from becoming obsolete before their time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I have no fault to find with it.  I should like to see the amendment I have handed in adopted, when it comes to Committee Stage, to enable the corporation to get out of a difficulty that confronts them with properties compulsorily acquired. There is nothing unconstitutional in what I am suggesting.  No one will lose anything, but we shall be able to vest them in ourselves more quickly and also vest them in others without delay.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister considering suggestions made by Deputy <Col N="365" /> Larkin and myself&mdash;and I am sure other Deputies will put the matter to him&mdash;with regard to raising the level of the cost of the building of a flat as stipulated at present so that there will be less of a charge either on the ratepayers or occupants or on both.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see this Bill introduced because I remember, Sir, that during the recent by-election, it was suggested by many speakers that the reference to this proposed legislation, as it then was, was an election we would and that after the election we would hear no more about it.  I am glad that we have this legislation introduced so soon after the by-election and as fast as it could be produced, from the point of view of the draftsman bringing it back to the Minister so that he could bring it quickly to the House.</P>
    <P>I am glad that there has been no talk here, as there was during the by-election, of the Government holding up building and alleging that the Government had no intention of going on with flat building.  I am glad that the House accepts now that there is an effort to end this problem which has been facing us for so many years.  We decided in 1932 to wage war on &ldquo;slumdom&rdquo;; we decided in 1932 that we would try to make it possible for everyone to have a reasonably decent living accommodation.  We are now fast approaching victory in that war.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin talked of estimates made in 1956 by the health officer of the Dublin Corporation to the effect that there might be need in the Dublin area for something like 15,000 dwellings. There is disagreement on that figure.  Some people think it is not as high as that.  Whether it be high or low, there will always be a need for more houses, not perhaps at the rate contemplated in recent years but at least for the replacement of old houses and for different types of building. There will always be employment in that sphere of activity.  Young people are getting married almost every month of every year and they must have accommodation.  There are houses which have outlived their lives and must be replaced.  There will not, however, be the tremendous need for accommodation which faced us at one <Col N="366" /> time.  I remember the figure given to us in 1928&mdash;18,000 families in the City of Dublin living in single rooms in our tenements, with as many as eight to 12 human beings, parents and their families, living in single rooms. We have got entirely away from that and again, in conclusion, I want to say that I congratulate the Minister on his new progressive legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Briscoe, I welcome the introduction of this Housing Bill, but there are several sections in it with which I am not in agreement.  I should like to point out that some years ago, two years ago to be exact, Deputy Briscoe, from this side of the House, attacked the then inter-Party Government and Deputy O'Donnell, who was Minister for Local Government, about the position of housing, particularly in the City of Dublin.  During 1956-1957 there was a drop of 33 per cent. in the production of houses.  During 1957-1958 there was a further drop of 40 per cent. in the production of houses.  In other words, during one year of Fianna Fáil Government there was a drop of 40 per cent., in spite of the fact that the Fianna Fáil Government came into office on the strength of their statements that they would place the house building industry back on the level at which it was during the five or six years after the war.</P>
      <P>Anybody would have been very foolish not to realise that house building, particularly in the Dublin area, had to slow down.  The production of houses was far in excess of what any of us visualised 20 years ago.  It could be said, and it would be very difficult to contradict it, that the four Governments which we had here since 1948 could be criticised for their approach to the building programme.  Many people have said that we tried to do too much too quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1947-48 there were great demands on the Ministers for Local Government that all building restrictions should be removed, and removed at once.  I agree that the Ministers in question did everything possible to remove these restrictions, but they put a demand for housing upon the local authorities and upon the Department <Col N="367" /> of Local Government itself, for which they were not staffed to cope with fully.  The various local authorities all over the country had to keep renewing and extending their staffs to such an extent that now they are completely over-staffed with permanent officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This colossus was built up during the seven or eight years prior to 1956, when every member of local authorities, including myself, went to their city and county managers demanding that the housing programme be expedited.  We told them to get staff, to get engineers and to get architects.  We still have all those engineers and architects but we are building no houses to provide them with work.</P>
      <P>There is a problem relating to the allocation of corporation houses in the City of Dublin.  Greater attention should be paid by that department of the corporation which is responsible for the allocation of these houses, to the proximity of the particular house, which it is intended to allocate, to the intended occupier's work, and secondly, in the case where his wife or children are not in the best of health, to the proximity of, let us say, his or his wife's relations.  Sometimes great hardship is suffered by new tenants of corporation houses in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of mentioning a very sore point which confronts members of Dublin Corporation, particularly those members from the area I represent.  Can the Minister do something to wipe out the delay in transferring houses to the tenants in St. Anne's estate?  These houses have been built and completed for approximately four years, but the tenants have not had them vested yet. The delay in transferring these houses to the tenants is because of the faulty construction of the houses.  Numerous complaints have been lodged with the corporation with the city manager, and with Mr. Codd in charge of the housing section, and I think the Minister's Department should look into this question because it is creating a lot of trouble. <Col N="368" /> I agree with what has been said already regarding the construction of flat dwellings in the city area, so that accommodation can be provided to enable workers to have their dwellings near places where they work.  I would suggest to the Minister that all new flats to be constructed should have lifts installed, because otherwise the local authority will be faced with a problem of interchanging flat dwellings between elderly families and younger families, and between married people with few children and married people with a large number of children. I would also suggest to the Minister that greater variety in the architectural design of these flats should be provided. As far as I can see, the design of all these flats is similar in every respect.</P>

      <P>The chairman of the Agricultural Credit Corporation was not dismissed.  In accordance with the articles of association of the corporation, the former chairman was due to retire as from the 31st July, 1957.  As provided by the <Col N="372" /> articles of association, he continued in office pending a fresh nomination.  Such nomination was made with effect from 1st July, 1958, whereupon the term of office of the former chairman ended.</P>
      <P>The former chairman was a farmer and company director; he was also the first national president of Macra na Feirme and a member of the Committee and Council of the Irish Sugar Beet Growers' Association.  The present chairman has had long experience as a banker.  He was until recently manager of a branch of a commercial bank and in that capacity has had particular experience of banking among the farming community.</P>

      <P>I am familiar with the various forms of tender used by the British Forestry Commission.  So far as timber of sawlog size is concerned their methods of sale and the general conditions under which their purchasers operate are similar in all respects to the terms and conditions applying here.  It is only in their form of agreement for the sale of peeled pit-props that a price variation clause operates, the sale price being adjusted by reference to the price negotiated periodically between the National coal Board and the Federated Home Timber Associations.  Material of pit-prop size sold from our State forests is generally marketed in mixture with material which has a possible use for boxboard manufacture or which may be used for pulpwood and a price related to British pit-prop prices would have no valid application here.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 35 and 36, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If a body corporate furnishes to the inspector of taxes a statement of the cases and the circumstances in which payments of a particular nature are made or things of a particular nature are provided for any of its directors or employees and the inspector of taxes is satisfied that no additional tax would fall to be paid if this Part were to apply in relation to payments made or things provided by the body corporate in accordance with the statement, he shall notify the body corporate accordingly and, where such a notification is given, this Part shall not apply in relation to payments made or things provided by the body corporate in accordance with the statement:</P>
      <P>Provided that the inspector of taxes may, if in his opinion there is reason to do so, by notice in writing served on the body corporate, revoke any such notification, either as from the date of the making of the notification or as from such later date as may be specified in the notice, and thereupon all such tax shall become chargeable, and all such returns shall be made by the body corporate and by the directors or employees in question, as would have been chargeable or would have had to have been made in the first instance if the notification had never been given, or, as the case may be, if it had ceased to have effect on the specified date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week, the Minister for Finance, when dealing with this on the Committee Stage, certainly left the House under the impression that in this Part IV, and in the section there dealing with expenses, he had afforded to <Col N="384" /> the taxpayers all the easements that were afforded in Britain.  I say that because the Minister paraphrased the view of the British Chancellor.  He said the British Chancellor told the House of Commons he was sure that, after two years, there would be no complaint about the manner in which that Part of the Act was being operated in England and that we here, because of that, would be in exactly the same position.</P>
    <P>When dealing with this Part of the Act, the Minister for Finance took from the British Act everything that was favourable to the Revenue but left out this section because it was favourable to the taxpayer.  I confess that Deputy Haughey mentioned this section on the last occasion but it was not until I sat down and read the debate and was able to check back on the reference he made that I understood the section to which Deputy Haughey was then referring.</P>
    <P>Quite honestly, I am not desperately happy that a power of dispensation in this way is the right way of going round the legislation.  I would suggest many other ways.  At least, however, I think the House should be afforded the opportunity of receiving from the Minister an explanation as to why, when he was giving and presenting the Revenue case, he did not present, as I suggest the Minister is bound to present, both sides of the question.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have some very good and excellent reasons.  No doubt we shall hear them now, if there are any.  However, there is no doubt but that the operation of such a section should be used as a means of easing the trouble, the time and the expense that many of the companies anxious to fulfil their obligations will otherwise have to incur under this part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from anything else, by putting down this amendment, at least it is on the record and must obtrude itself on the members of the Income-Tax Commission who, I have no doubt, notwithstanding the fact that the Minister ignored them, will themselves take into account at a later date, but at an <i>ex post facto</i> date, the amendments that have been incorporated by the Minister in the income-tax code.  As is <Col N="385" /> clear from its face, the amendment provides that an inspector of taxes, who is the equivalent here of the surveyor in England, can dispense a company with the collection of certain records where he is satisfied that the company deals with a matter not merely according to the letter but according to the spirit of the Acts.  I have some doubt as to whether or not that is a wise provision, but it is one which most certainly should have been considered and ventilated in this House.</P>
    <P>No matter what the Minister may say the effect of this part of the Bill will mean that 95 per cent. of the employers, be they companies, bodies corporate, partnerships or individuals, who are assessed for tax under Schedule D will have to keep additional records as between different individual employees in a way that is not going to bring in one extra penny tax to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In 95 per cent. of the cases, the firms involved are paying all the tax for which they could possibly, under any interpretation, be assessed as being due by them.  The Minister makes the case that he wants to get after the other 5 per cent.  Here is a way of absolving the 95 per cent. from the onerous responsibility of keeping the additional records, and of saving all the time, trouble and expense that will be involved by so doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This idea was debated on the Committee Stage.  I argued then and I repeat now that in order to deal with this trouble we are up against, of expenses being charged which should really not be allowed, we must give very wide powers of inspection, etc., to the income-tax authorities.  I cannot see what great difference an amendment of this kind would make because if a company makes a return of the kind set out here, and if the inspector is satisfied he will say so; he will say: &ldquo;That is all right; that is all I need.&rdquo; What great advantage is there in giving that the force of law, particularly as we have provided in the section that he can revoke the consent which he gave to the company if he thinks there is anything wrong?  I think this would be better carried out administratively and it is almost certain to be carried out administratively in the way it is set out here.  The advantage <Col N="386" /> is that there can be no charge against the inspector and there can be no charge against the company either, that they undertook to give true returns and afterwards it was found they were not true.</P>
      <P>For all these reasons I would much prefer to see the Bill left as it is in this respect.  The Deputy says we adopted the British Acts and did not put this in.  Deputy Dillon accused us of taking sections holus bolus from the British Acts, without regard to the conditions here.  This is one case where I believe the conditions are different and I hope I am at least pleasing Deputy Dillon in that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Minister caught me off my guard.  He suggested ten years and I was much too soft when I agreed with him.  However, I shall keep my word.  Ten years is much too long.  Regardless of the number of years it is a thing that will be going on and it is a thing that should be fixed as from the passage of this Act.  If the custom had been there for ten years at any period then when the custom has grown up for ten years the Minister can be satisfied that it is not brought in purely for tax avoidance. Therefore I suggest that at the time the claim becomes operative it should be considered ten years back, rather than back to 1948, whenever the claim comes up.  If for example the claim was made in 1962 then it would go back to 1952, and that at least gives it some fluidity which it should have.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Deputy's point, that this same position would arise as time goes on, that may be, but I think it would be a dangerous amendment to accept from every point of view.  Let us say that a private company has changed shops.  They might pick out a very nice residence over one of the shops and put in the son who would qualify in the coming ten years to occupy that house for the rest of his time, even when he became a proprietor or a director.  It might lead to an attempted evasion of the intention at least of this particular Part.  I would not be prepared at this stage to adopt it.  I should like to have some experience of the working of this Part of the Act before we could experiment in this way in the future.</P>

      <P>May I occupy the interval while the Minister is studying this, to read for Dáil Éireann the words which it is proposed to delete, so that everyone's mind can be crystal clear as to what is being done?  They are:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...but this sub-section shall not apply where the employee is a director of the body corporate in question or of any other body corporate over which that body corporate has control or which has control over that body corporate or which is under the control of a person who also has control over that body corporate.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We discussed this question at length on the Committee Stage and I had an amendment down along the same lines as Deputy Sweetman has here now.  Our joint purpose was to see that the exception which is provided in sub-section (3) is extended to directors.  The rigmarole of words which Deputy Dillon has just read out simply means that it will apply to a director whether he is a director of the body corporate itself or it is under his control.</P>

      <P>It was on amendment No. 28 we had the discussion on the Committee Stage.  Deputy Haughey had an amendment down very much on the same lines&mdash;indeed, exactly as the Deputy has the amendment down now.  One of the principles underlying this Part is that directors, or at least proprietary directors and proprietary employees&mdash;they being defined as persons having more than 10 per cent. of the shares of the company&mdash;should not get benefits which are exceptionally given, let us say, under this section to other employees.  No exception can be made as far as they are concerned.  Deputies should keep in mind that in the case of employees, it applies only to persons earning more than £1,500.  In the case of the proprietary director, it does not matter how much he may be getting, as this particular proviso applies to him also.</P>

      <P>We argued this over and over again on the Committee Stage, in regard to this point of directors and proprietary employees and so on being excluded from benefits that might be given to other employees.  Because of their big influence in the company they could get any perquisites that might be going, such as a nice house or a good car.  For that reason, they were excluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> In page 16, between lines 29 and 30, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(6) Sub-section (1) of this section shall not apply to expense incurred by a body corporate on or in connection with the provision of medical or hospital benefits which are, if required, available to all the directors and employees of that body corporate.</P>
    <P>We had a lot of discussion on the Committee Stage and I put this down to inquire whether the Minister had given it any further consideration.  It seems to me that to include medical benefits, when the medical benefits are available for every director and member of the body corporate concerned, is carrying the thing much too far.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, there may be a good case to be put otherwise, if only a director was going to get the free medical services.  The effect of my amendment is to make clear that it must be included in the scheme that every director and every employee of the company is entitled to take advantage of it.  If it is such a scheme for the whole company, then I think it should be treated as a social advancement and not taxed as specific income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be of interest to know that when legislation of this character was introduced in the Federal Parliament in India, I understand this very point was argued and the Indian Federal Government accepted an amendment to their proposals which in fact excluded health schemes of this character from the general prohibition.  It seems to me, on the arguments adduced mainly by Deputy Sweetman on the Committee Stage, that there is a strong argument on grounds of social policy for following the example of the Federal Government of India in this regard.</P>

      <P>We had a long discussion on the Committee Stage.  Again on the same principle, I did not think it was fair that, even where a medical benefit scheme is at the disposal of employees in a company, the directors or proprietary employees should be entitled to these benefits as untaxable.  They are entitled to them, of course, but they will be taxed.  If we are to make the income-tax code as equitable as possible between all income-tax payers, we should charge income-tax on the benefit, whatever that benefit may be worth, in the case of these particular groups.</P>

Bord na Móna pays its doctor a lump sum in Newbridge for looking after all the employees.  The employees call that doctor in&mdash;all sorts of employees, from the top to the bottom.

      <P>In page 18, lines 49 and 50, to delete &ldquo;it carries on a trade or its functions consist wholly or mainly in the holding of investments or other property.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;it is assessable in respect of its activities under Schedule D.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am not quite clear why this has been limited in the way that it has been limited by the Minister.  We had some discussion about it on Committee Stage, and it seems to me that a more accurate measure of the application of this Part would be that the body concerned was assessable under Schedule D.  For the life of me, I cannot see why a promotional body operating for gain should be treated in any different way from a trading company.  The example the Minister gave on the last occasion was that a State-sponsored company was not being covered by this Part of the Act.  It is a bit odd that we are putting through legislation, onerous legislation on individuals, and the one class of person that we except from that onerous legislation are employees and directors of State-sponsored companies.  What is fish for one should be fish for the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> Why should we treat State-sponsored companies in a different category from ordinary private individuals and private public companies?  I am not quite clear whether the change to Schedule D assessment would cover State-sponsored bodies as such, but it does seem, whether it covers them or not, to be a more logical basis on which to start than the &ldquo;trade&rdquo; which the Minister suggests in the section.</P>

If it goes to 33? per cent. two people could control a company.  Therefore, I think the Deputy's figure is altogether too high.

Any company that was acquired between the 6th of April, 1957, and the 19th June, 1958, will come up for consideration. Where the dividend of the acquired company was declared before the 19th June, then they are entitled to a refund of income-tax as if this Act were not passed.  If any dividend is declared after the 19th June, 1958, the sections which we inserted on Committee Stage will apply.  I think that covers the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on having abandoned the retrospective provisions in the Bill &mdash;the retrospective provisions inserted in the Finance Resolution passed here on the 18th June and which were continued in amendment No. 71 on Committee Stage, amendments and provisions which were likely to make for great uneasiness in commercial transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the arguments <Col N="396" /> adduced in the House by my colleagues and myself have persuaded the Minister to drop that retrospective provision.  The position now is that anybody who acted within the law and completed the transaction up to the 19th June, is not taxed retrospectively. That is a very welcome and significant advance.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there might be cases where, between the 6th April, 1957, and the 19th June, 1958, people had bought a company legally, as they were entitled to do, with the intention of doing something else about it.  One cannot, however, cover intentions of that sort.  I think the factual removal of retrospection which has been carried through in this Bill is adequate to preserve the principle.  It is a principle that is quite vital to our fiscal legislation.</P>
    <P>There may, perhaps, be a trifling matter to arise out of it and that is where, between the 6th April, 1957, and the 19th June, 1958, a person has travelled part of the way towards scrambling the egg and now wishes to unscramble the egg.  He cannot be taxed as he would have been taxed before but I think no obstacle should be put in his way to make it harder for him to carry out the unscrambling process. Probably it will not arise at all. I certainly know of no such case.  I would only suggest that, if such a case does come to light, it should be made as easy as possible to unscramble.</P>
    <P>It is not normal for members of the Opposition voluntarily to make suggestions on matters like this to the Minister for Finance.  I want to make it clear that it is the principle of retrospection with which I am concerned and vitally concerned.  If, therefore, in the future the Minister should find that there is something that he considers to be a breach of the spirit of this Part of the Act, rather than ever again adopt retrospective legislation let him bring in a special <i>ad hoc</i> Bill to operate as from that date.</P>
    <P>In so far as there is need for cooperation in giving such an <i>ad hoc</i> emergency Bill urgent consideration, he will get it from us because it was not with dividend stripping that we were concerned but with the factual principle of retrospection.  Every <Col N="397" /> Deputy who spoke on this matter was prepared to accept the Minister's view that the practice of dividend stripping was one that would have to be stopped.  What was essential was that it should be stopped in such a way that it would not act as a precedent for future Ministers or for the present Minister for other retrospective legislation. Should an unhealthy practice arise in the future it can always be met in the manner I suggest by <i>ad hoc</i> emergency legislation rather than that any Minister should ever try to tread the path which it was sought to tread on the Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of evil in this case good has come because I can see that the fruit of our discussion and the decision now taken to eliminate the threat of retrospection in this Finance Bill further consolidates the principle which this House accepts that in respect of fiscal or penal legislation the principle of retrospection will be diligently avoided.  Had we allowed this instance of retrospection to pass, I have no doubt it would have constituted a precedent for the repetition of this objectionable kind of legislation in the future.  The fact that we have secured agreement on all sides of the House in this respect provides a good precedent for the proposition that Oireachtas Éireann will not hereafter legislate in the fiscal or penal sphere retrospectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, I think, is a very important principle to reinforce which no trouble and no time spent was excessive. Deputy Sweetman said all that requires to be said.  I do not believe that any Party in this House was particularly concerned to protect individuals who were engaged in this operation, indelicately described as dividend. stripping&mdash;in fact, invoking the law as it stood to avoid the impact of normal income-tax on the profits of businesses which they were in process of acquiring. I do not think that we ought to get into a state of virtuous indignation. Nor do I think there is anything indecent or anything dishonest about what any of these firms may have or may not have done.  I agree that the operation would put them in a preferential position and I agree with the Minister that it was a practice <Col N="398" /> which he had an obligation to arrest and stay.</P>
    <P>I want to subscribe to what Deputy Sweetman has said, that if the spirit of the purpose enshrined in the Financial Resolution and in this section of the Bill should be violated in the future the Opposition stands ready to assist the Minister in any emergency legislation which may be intended to plug any loopholes which anxiety to avoid retrospection may have left in the Bill.</P>
    <P>When we speak of <i>ad hoc</i> legislation there are two meanings in which such legislation can be applied.  One is that it can be directed against an individual and the other is that it can be directed against the practice.  What we have in mind is that if a practice emerges, which the Minister diagnoses to be a violation of the general principles enshrined in this section, legislation designed to abrogate that practice will be assured expeditious passage in so far as the Opposition can give that facility to the Minister.  I do not think that any of us would accept the principle of legislation <i>ad hoc</i> for an individual.</P>
    <P>On that understanding I think that we have done a good job.  I do not think we should allow the occasion to pass without drawing attention to the fact that those&mdash;and there are far too many of them&mdash;who are inclined to refer to this Parliament as being an unnecessary part of the institutions of this State, should bear in mind that it is by free discussion and argument in this House that fundamental liberties are maintained.  The fundamental liberty here involved that is of great value to the free man is the knowledge that when he complies with the law to the best of his ability and to the best of his knowledge he is safe from prosecution by the Executive.  The moment the principle of retrospective legislation in fiscal or penal matters was accepted, no one would ever be safe again.</P>
    <P>This is an occasion to rejoice that argument and discussion have carried conviction to the mind of the Executive that the dignity of our laws was of more importance than the passing advantage of wreaking vengeance on <Col N="399" /> some individuals who may have got outside those laws.  That benefit would not have been achieved but for the operation of free debate which even some members of this House may have thought was dragged out to an extreme. Those of us who understood what we were talking about and what we were concentrating on wasted no time.  I believe we wasted no time in bringing about the happy conclusion which this amendment enshrines to-day.</P>
    <P>I like to think that this is another case in which the free functioning of this Dáil has further guaranteed the individual liberty of the most humble citizen of this State and of the most powerful.  Our purpose, and the ourpose of these institutions of ours, is to ensure that all men, rich and poor, great and humble, shall be equal before the law.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Minister's attitude to this amendment is but here I seek to vindicate a principle which I believe is acceptable to every member of the House.  I am not in the least solititous that the vindication of this principle should be in the form of my amendment.  I am no longer fortified by the fact which I was entitled to adduce to the House a week ago.  Then there was a man in jail because he had not the wherewithal to pay his income-tax. That man is no longer in jail.  He has been released but I want to ensure that hereafter nobody else will go to jail for debt in Ireland.</P>
      <P>We have abolished, in this country, imprisonment for debt, but I want to recall to Deputies what imprisonment for debt means.  It was for a long time the law in this country and in Great Britain that if a person secured a judgment against you for debt and if he could not recover that debt from your property he could remove you to the debtors prison and detain you there until the debt was paid.  One hundred years ago that was a common enough practice and the novels of Charles Dickens described the horror of men who spent the greater part of their lives in jail because they had not the money to pay their debts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was what gave rise in this country to what were known as Sunday men.  I think there are Deputies who will have heard from their fathers and grandfathers who had personal acquaintance of the Sunday men.  They were men against whom warrants for debt were in the hands of the sheriff but these warrants were not executable on the Sabbath and neither were they executable in the man's house.  They <Col N="401" /> had to be executed outside the house and if the man kept to the house except on the Sabbath day he was not liable to imprisonment.  These men were not able to come into the light of day except on Sunday.</P>
    <P>I cannot believe that there is any desire to see that system revived to-day but the great danger is that some of the Deputies of this House are so far removed from reality that they believe it could not happen again.  It is dreadful to think that a man may be decreed for income-tax and may be incarcerated without having any opportunity of going to an independent court and explaining his circumstances to the judge.  That man may be sitting in his wife's house and be dependent upon her or upon his children for accommodation. He may be sitting in his son's room.  The superintendent of the Guards can walk in and arrest him, remove him from his home and bring him to jail and there incarcerate him for six months for no offence other than that he has not money to pay his debt.  I conceive that situation arising for quite a number of perfectly respectable and decent citizens.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine that any of us desire that the payment of a debt to the State should be enforced by that procedure.  I am bound to press this to its true conclusion.  When we read in the Scripture of the man delivering his debtor to the torturers to secure payment of his debt and then seeking mercy for himself, it seems to me the utmost end of obvious retribution that he should be denied the mercy he refused to his debtor.  I want to say quite deliberately that, in our modern society, to take a respectable citizen in the presence of his neighbours and to lodge him in a hard labour prison is to torture him for debt.  I ask Deputies to consider the position of a man in that circumstance whose children are at school.  Suddenly they wake up one morning to read in the paper that their father, on the previous evening, was taken to jail.  Young children and adolescents do not clearly distinguish between the stigma of being lodged in a hard labour prison for debt and lodged there for an offence against the law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> In our society, the committal of a person involved the stigma of being a jail bird and normally reasonable citizens do not upbraid one another with that term of derision.  However, we have to think of the respectable citizen who sees that his children are thereafter open to that challenge by their playmates or contemporaries as a result of his failure to pay his debt.  I think that is torture beyond yea or nay.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that anyone would wish to leave in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners or the Executive that right to torture a citizen for the payment of a debt.  On the other hand, we have to face the fact that, unless the Revenue Commissioners have power to collect the revenue, the taxpayers being human creatures will not pay.  None of us likes to pay taxes. There must be no sentimental folly of going to the length of saying that the Revenue Commissioners must be stripped of the power to collect the taxes.  If we did that, the State would collapse and the end result must be anarchy which is worse than any form of tyranny.  Therefore, to be practical and sensible, we must envisage what then are the Revenue Commissioners to do if, a taxpayer's liability having been established, he will not pay.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that a perfectly adequate procedure exists, to which many of us demurred when it was first implemented in this country, for the protection of ordinary creditors. I am not sure it did not go too far in the protection of ordinary creditors but it has now been part of our established law for 30 years.  With this system there, I suggest to the Minister it is quite adequate for the purpose of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is this. After they bring the taxpayer to court, which they now must do to establish his liability&mdash;say a sum of £200 is involved&mdash;the taxpayer then has the opportunity to pay the £200 and let the matter be closed.  If he does not pay the Revenue Commissioners, a writ can be handed to the sheriff who can make a seizure of his goods to that value, if such goods exist, and thus the Revenue Commissioners' debt is satisfied.  If that recourse fails, and the writ is returned <Col N="403" /><i>nulla bona</i>, under the existing law, which I seek to amend, the Revenue Commissioners have the right to get the county registrar to endorse the writ whereupon, without further formality, that endorsed writ can be handed to the superintendent of the Guards who can arrest the debtor and deliver his person with that writ to the governor of a hard labour prison and that endorsed writ is, under our law, a good warrant whereunder to hold that man for six months or until such time as the Revenue Commissioners claim is satisfied.</P>
    <P>All I ask under this amendment is that, when the writ is returned <i>nulla bona</i>, the Revenue Commissioners will proceed with the same measures as are available to the ordinary creditor, that is, that they will apply to the District Court for an instalment order against the defaulting taxpayer.  The taxpayer can then come before the appropriate judicial authority and open his affairs to that independent authority and say: &ldquo;I have not the money to pay.&rdquo;  If the Revenue Commissioners have information that he has money but is concealing it they can produce the evidence.  If the district justice is satisfied that he has the money but will not pay he can make an order of the court that he shall pay at the rate of £10 or 10/- or 10d. a week, whatever the district justice thinks fair and equitable in view of the defaulting taxpayer's means and the family responsibilities that devolve upon him.</P>
    <P>That then becomes an order of the court but it is an order of an independent judicial person who has heard the case made by the Revenue Commissioners and the case made by the debtor and has made an order which, in the light of all the information available to him, he knows to be fair and equitable.  Now, if the defaulting taxpayer will not conform to the order of the court, which has been made in the light of his ascertained resources, that man is simply and manifestly defying the law and refusing to conform to a reasonable enforcement of his duty as a citizen.  Let the Revenue Commissioners bring him back before the justice and say: &ldquo;We have established that the man owes the debt and <Col N="404" /> we have established to your satisfaction that he has the means to pay it. We stand ready to receive it on the terms laid down by you.  This man simply refuses to comply and says he will not pay his share of the common burden that everybody else pays through taxes to the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let the district justice then have the man brought before him and let the man make his case, as is done at present in the case of an ordinary creditor. Maybe his circumstances have changed.  Maybe some family catastrophe has come upon him that has eaten up whatever resources he had when he was last before the court.  If he has no case to make other than that he will not pay then let the law operate against him as it would against an ordinary debtor, not on the ground that he is in debt but on the ground almost of contempt of court because, having been directed by the court to do that which was equitable and fair, he simply stuck his heels in the ground and said he would not comply.  Under the existing law, any person who sets a court of competent jurisdiction at defiance is susceptible to imprisonment.</P>
    <P>There is no way of maintaining order and vindicating the law other than by providing that, where a citizen sets the judiciary at open defiance, the judiciary shall have the right to incarcerate him until he has purged his contempt and declared himself ready to conform with the law.  Surely that remedy is adequate to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners will be able to collect the tax.</P>
    <P>The fact is I do not believe the Revenue Commissioners use that power of imprisonment for defaulting taxpayers in very many cases.  They may argue that it is necessary to have this power <i>in terrorem</i> and it is the fact that they have this power that makes it unnecessary for them to use it.  I want to say again that it is the principle of the matter with which I am concerned.  No man, no authority, no Government in this country, should have the power to imprison a citizen of this Republic for debt.  I readily conceive that the Government, or such bodies to which it properly delegates <Col N="405" /> its functions, must have the ultimate sanctioning of imprisoning a citizen who will not comply with the law.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, if he has any difficulties or doubts about my proposal, that he should at least give it a period of trial, and if in that time it transpires that the Revenue Commissioners are unable to collect the revenue for want of this power, then we can consider restoring the power to them.  I do not believe that situation will ever arise.</P>
    <P>Lastly I want to make this point.  It would be inappropriate for anyone here to express expert opinions&mdash;other than the Attorney-General and we have none in the House at the moment &mdash;on matters of constitutional law but every citizen of this State, no matter how humble, is entitled to express a view as to what his constitutional rights are and I am convinced that under the Constitution this power is <i>ultra vires</i> and that if it were tested in the Supreme Court the Supreme Court would declare that it was <i>ultra vires.</i>  It never has been tested in the Supreme Court and one of the reasons why it has not is that whenever anybody proposed to contest it a compromise settlement was effected.</P>
    <P>Ordinarily it might be argued that if it were suitable for an adjudication by the Supreme Court, anyone who felt their rights were being abridged could seek that remedy.  But in this particular context the people who are likely to suffer under this proviso are, by the very nature of their circumstances, effectively debarred from going to the Supreme Court, because they have no goods and they cannot embark on litigation, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Revenue Commission, if they have no solicitor and no counsel to represent them.  In the mundane conditions in which we live it will not be easy to find a solicitor or competent counsel to accept a brief in protracted legislation, which would be virtually certain to go from the High Court to the Supreme Court, on the understanding that the client had no goods and would be unable to pay their fees.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances there is a peculiarly solemn responsibility on the Oireachtas to protect the rights of such <Col N="406" /> people.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to do either of two things.  I ask him to accept my amendment, or in the alternative, that in the light of representations made to him, he will ask the President to have the matter referred to the Supreme Court for adjudication on whether the existing law, which we must remember we have inherited from the British legislation prior to the establishment of this State, is or is not in conformity with our Constitution.  I am sure it is not, but either means of meeting the matter raised by me will be acceptable if the Minister will adopt one of them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position anyway. I see an order here where a person is ordered to pay up and the Revenue Commissioners have power to imprison him if not.  There are two types of cases where this type of power has been used and in one case, anyway, it is difficult to see what could have been done otherwise.  One is a case where a man boasts to his friends that he will not pay income-tax.  He has made arrangements to show that he has no goods; he owes a lot of money but he does not own his house or his furniture and he boasts that he <Col N="407" /> has provided against paying income-tax, although admittedly he has money.  During his boasting he spends a good deal of money on his friends and so on.</P>
      <P>The second case is where a person is working in this country and means to retire to another country&mdash;very often a foreigner&mdash;at a certain time. He provides, in the last four or five years of working here, that he has no property and does not pay income-tax, although he is receiving a fair amount of money by way of salary, and perhaps, getting money from investments abroad.  In that case I do not know how you could provide to get after him, except in the manner provided for at the present time.  The Deputy said that he did not think the power was used by the Revenue Commissioners very much.  It is not.  I asked for figures and they gave me figures as far back as they had records.  The records go back 15½ years, to the 1st January, 1943.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why only to that date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as far back as their records go.  The figures given to me are for 44 cases.  I think when I tell the house what happened in these 44 cases it will be said that the Revenue Commissioners showed great discretion and great judgment in respect of the people whose arrests they authorised. It does not of course detract from Deputy Dillon's argument that they should not have these powers.  I am not dealing with that point now.  I am saying that at least they used their powers discreetly and wisely.  Of the 44 cases, 30 paid before they reached prison; seven paid the day they reached the prison.  You have, straightway, 37 out of 44 cases who had the money to hand out, but did not do it until this took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is not quite fair.  Very frequently they get their friends to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not as a rule get your friends to pay for you on your way to prison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>These men did not leave their houses.  These men were men who had boasted they would not pay.  They had been pressed to pay over and over again, and over a long period, and in fact had not done so.  In fact, there were only seven who actually spent a night in prison, and these seven were imprisoned as follows: one for two days; three for three days; one for 26 days, and two for 29 days.  Therefore, of the whole number of 44, the amount was paid up and the debt, whatever it may have been, was paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the best argument for a thumbscrew I ever heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Going back to the point made by Deputy Dillon, I must say I cannot see any other way of dealing with the particular case I mentioned here.  There have been a number in that category.  In fact, I mentioned a type of case of which the Revenue Commissioners had actual experience. It was that of a man who had a big income and who called to the Revenue Commissioners once a year to get them to sign that he was liable for income-tax for such an amount.  Even when they had signed that, they never got paid, and that went on until they exercised this power and got the income-tax. In that case, the man intended to go to live in another place.  In such a case, if one had to go through the procedure outlined by Deputy Dillon, of going to the court for a committal order against him, that would be a signal to the man to go to-day rather than to-morrow.  Under the particular powers which the Revenue Commissioners have at present, they were able to approach this man in this way. He was about to retire to another country to spend the remainder of his life there and to spend his money.  They were able to tell him that, before going, he would have to spend six months in Mountjoy&mdash;and, rather than do that, he paid the income-tax.  There was no other way of doing it, as far as I can see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be quite prepared to examine this on Deputy Dillon's amendment, if it were possible to deal with it on the lines suggested by him.  However, in that particular instance, I cannot see that it would be wise to take the <Col N="409" /> powers from the Revenue Commissioners. I want Deputies to keep in mind that it does arise out of a court order.  That is the point.  The power they exercise arises out of a court order.  The court order gives them power first to collect, to distrain on the goods and so on and, if that fails, to arrest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Minister that that is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the fact that the court makes the order, that the Revenue Commissioners are to collect the amount?  That is, the court is not asked anything at all in connection with the imprisonment.  The section of the Act is such that it follows from the order to collect, without any discretion being vested in the court at all in relation to the imprisonment, or without the court being in any way brought in.  What happens is that the collector of taxes goes into the court and asks for an order.  He proves that there is £27 10s. 2d. tax due.  Having proved that it is due, the judge then says: &ldquo;Decree.&rdquo;  When the judge gives his decree, because it is a revenue decree the addendum of collection by <i>levare facias</i> is included in the order automatically and must be included.  When the court order goes to the sheriff and the sheriff is not able to collect and returns <i>nulla bona</i>, the position is that that <i>nulla bona</i> return on the court order is sent to the solicitor for the collector.</P>
      <P>When the solicitor for the collector gets it, he has the option either of accepting the position that there are no goods or returning it to the county registrar to endorse; and then it is automatically endorsed for imprisonment, without a court order.  The court order has been made for payment but the other consequence, the imprisonment, follows without any discretion by the judge and without the possible alternative of imprisonment even being mentioned to the judge when the order is being made.  The Minister can take it from me that that is the manner in which it operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this is the Report Stage and I can speak only once, I might add that there was a case of such imprisonment recently in Kildare.  It has been suggested <Col N="410" /> malevolently and maliciously by a particular person that I interested myself and intervened for the purpose of getting people into trouble in relation to that case.  The Minister is aware that I never approached him; the Revenue Commissioners are aware that I never approached them.  I never raised hand, act or finger in relation to that case.  I was not approached by the person concerned and will not deal with matters unless I am approached. Unfortunately, a person in Naas has chosen to make trouble deliberately, so I am glad to have this opportunity to state categorically that there was no such justification for it.  In that case there was no court order except in the manner I have indicated.</P>
    <P>The position is that the decree is given by the district justice if it is under the district court jurisdiction, by the circuit judge if it is under circuit court jurisdiction; and then, because it is a Revenue decree the addendum is stamped on the decree and because it is a Revenue decree the county registrar can endorse over to make the writ into one of <i>levare facias.</i></P>

When I make a case which at least has a <i>prima faciae</i> foundation, it is reasonable that when the Minister does not feel free to meet me, then I can ask him would he consult the Attorney General.  Otherwise I know of no means short of that proposed by Deputy Haughey, one which I think I will be prepared to embark on if Deputy Haughey will join me.

      <P>I fully understand the Minister's approach, but I do not believe we can have too profound a respect for the Constitution.  I think Deputies ought to note the Minister's feelings in this matter of constitutionality, when he says he is beginning to think we are getting too constitutional in this country.  Note the path we are travelling.  I feel bound to say to the <Col N="412" /> Minister that I propose to proceed in my efforts to have the constitutionality of this matter determined, and what I put my hand to I usually carry through.</P>
      <P>I would much prefer the Minister would find some practical <i>modus vivendi</i> which would create embarrassment for nobody but, if he does not, I shall bring this forward as far as I am able to, because I believe it to be profoundly wrong, and I believe the Minister's approach to it concedes that he believes the truth of my case but he is not prepared to face the consequences of that concession.</P>

      <P>I want to make one last despairing effort, on the Final <Col N="414" /> Stage of this Bill, to get from the Minister for Finance some indication of the financial policy of the present Government. This Bill is really the end of the debate on the Budget resolutions.  I asked the Minister several times during the passage of the Budget, and of this Bill, does he consider that the danger at present is one of inflation, or does he consider the danger is one of deflation.  I asked the Minister to consider whether the advice tendered by the Minister for External Affairs, that people should not hoard up their savings but should expend them on consumption, was right advice or whether his advice was still the same, that we had to increase our volume of savings if we were to make real economic progress.</P>
      <P>We shall have a discussion next week on the Taoiseach's Estimate but, before we go into that debate, it would be of assistance to the House, and to the country, if we could get from the Minister now some indication as to whether he considers there is any danger of inflation or deflation, whether we are saving too much, as the Minister for External Affairs says, and as was published in the broadsheet published by the Department of External Affairs, or whether we are in the position that we want to support a higher productive capital programme by accentuating and increasing our savings ratio so that it will accord with the comparisons that there are in Europe to-day in that respect.</P>

Our production appears to be keeping pace with spending and as long as spending does not outstrip production, there is no danger of inflation. So far, we have succeeded in keeping these two things in line.  On the other hand, there is certainly no danger of deflation in my opinion.  We are saving to some extent and it would look, I think, from every point of view that if we could save a little more we would be in a better position.  That is all I can say at the moment about the balance between inflation and deflation. I am satisfied that we are maintaining a proper line between inflation and deflation.</P>

      <P>As I was saying when the debate was adjourned, Deputy Briscoe mentioned that the financial worries of the Dublin Corporation had ended since the present Government came into office.  I suggest to the House now that this scheme of things was commenced during the term of office of the inter-Party Government.  There was a sum of £4,000,000 and all the necessary guarantees provided to the Dublin Corporation during 1956.  The Dublin Corporation have not, since 1956, sought on the public market any loan for housing.  The present Government are continuing the same system put into operation by the Minister for Local Government during the inter-Party régime.  Since approximately 1947 the Dublin Corporation borrowed something in the neighbourhood of £26,000,000.  It was, as I said before, obvious to anyone who had his ear to the ground and who had any interest, direct or otherwise, in the building programme of the country that we were <Col N="416" /> approaching saturation point.  Deputy Briscoe also mentioned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe also mentioned during the course of his speech that the builders in the City of Dublin at the moment have plenty of financial aid to enable them to sell or to get loans for their clients.  I suggest to Deputy Briscoe that there are fewer builders left in Dublin in comparison with the number that were there from 1947 onwards.  The majority of them have emigrated to Britain and particularly to Rhodesia.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe had plenty of opportunities during the course of his speech to raise all these points.  At the present time there are plenty of vacant houses in Dublin, houses which might be called small dwelling houses, principally through the inability of the people who bought those houses to meet their commitments. I would suggest to the Minister that something should be done in the City of Dublin to provide adequate sewerage and water facilities for houses, good houses, which are still without these facilities.  I admit that the majority of these houses are privately owned.  I would suggest that something should be done where you have small schemes within the city boundary such as the Sailors and <Col N="417" /> Soldiers Land Trust houses, which are still working on dry privies and on a public fountain on the roadside.  One in particular comes to mind, at Raheny on the Howth Road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but this will probably come under the heading of sewerage and sanitary services. I would also suggest to the Minister that approval should not be given to many new houses, in whatever part of the country they are built, unless adequate sewerage and water facilities are available.  We hear a lot at various times about emigration and the causes of emigration.  I think that one of the greatest causes of emigration in this country is the primitive services, if you can call them services, which are available to rural farm houses and rural cottages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to mention something on page 3 of the explanatory memorandum in relation to this Bill about the remission of rents.  It is suggested in this Bill to give ten years' remission of rates on a sliding scale. Heretofore purchasers of new houses received two-thirds remission of rates for seven years.  If these two items are broken down it means that the purchaser of a house benefits to the extent of one-third of a year's rates over the period of ten years.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should give serious consideration to granting 20 years' remission of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The remission amounts to one-half over the ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Two-thirds remission of rates for seven years is equivalent to four and two-thirds years' full remission. Ten years' remission of rates, paying one-tenth the first year, two-tenths the second year and so on up to the full remission after ten years, is equivalent to five years' remission of rates.  The benefit that the purchaser <Col N="418" /> would be getting would be the difference between four and two-thirds and five years which would be one-third remission of rates.  I suggest that the Minister should give serious consideration to granting 20 years' remission of rates on a sliding scale as existed a number of years ago.</P>
      <P>I should also like to mention something about small dwelling loans in relation to second-hand houses.  Anybody connected with a local authority can appreciate what is meant by a second-hand house.  It is a house that was previously occupied.  It might have been occupied only for a year or two or it might have been occupied for 25 years and even though I approve of this section I see great difficulty arising when it is put into operation. The difficulties are going to arise when the appointed valuer is required to make a proper valuation to see if the property would be adequate security for a local authority.</P>
      <P>These second-hand houses cannot benefit by way of grant or supplementary grant or by any remission of stamp duty.  If I take, for example, a house which we would call type A., a new house selling at £2,000.  Under this the purchaser will benefit to the extent of £300 local government grant and possibly £150 supplementary grant, plus a remission of stamp duty which can amount to £70 or £80.  In all, that purchaser would be deriving a benefit of something over £500.  The valuer must consider these things when valuing the house.  Where the substantial selling value of such a house would be £2,000 the valuer must consider it in the region of £1,500.  He further has to take into account the reasonable deposit that can be expected from an intending purchaser, say, £150.  The valuer valuing that new house will not value it at anything more than £1,300. A similar house built on an adjacent housing scheme, of the same type and possibly built by the same builder two or three years earlier, would not derive any of these benefits for an intending purchaser and could not be valued by the valuer at anything more than £1,100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely in that case the <Col N="419" /> house would have to be built for four years or more?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that great difficulties are going to arise under this section even though I agree with it in principle.  You can go back to the 1948 Housing (Amendment) Act, when valuations tumbled down within the space of two or three months because local authorities did not appreciate the operation of grants on the saleable valuation of a house.  The valuer must value a house in relation to what he will get for it on the public market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if a grant is paid by the Government towards the cost of building a house, it will go into the cost of building just the same as the purchaser's money?  Is the house not valued on the total money spent on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be the way but unfortunately it does not work out that way.  We all have experience of the flaws exposed when the 1948 Housing (Amendment) Act was put into operation.  One of the reasons that the 1950 Housing (Amendment) Act was brought in was to straighten out these flaws.</P>
      <P>One last point which I should like the Minister to clarify occurs on page two of the Explanatory Memorandum regarding the repairs of houses.  I should like to know if the grant in that connection would include decoration of such a house.  Quite substantial houses are put on the market and sold as they stand and the decoration of a subsidy house could come to a good deal of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he might consider including decoration of houses in that section.  I think the decoration is a most essential factor in the preservation of a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" /> There is one point which I omitted to mention when dealing with the question of the remission of rates, and I think I could take Deputy Briscoe up on this point.  He mentioned that several residents' associations were quite satisfied with a ten years' remission of rates on a sliding scale.  I attended a meeting of A.C.C.R.A., the Association of Combined Residents' Associations, the biggest organisation of the type in the Dublin area, and I never heard the period of ten years mentioned, but they were all in favour of a period of 20 years.  I shall conclude on that note.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill but I do not agree with all sections of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to this very important debate will be confined mainly to the housing activities of the Dublin Corporation in so far as they affect the people of Dublin South-Central. The Minister is to be complimented on bringing in this Bill, as any effort which will speed up the housing activities of local authorities and private builders must surely be welcomed on all sides of the House.  The problem of bad housing, the legacy left to us by a foreign Government, has been tackled by successive native Governments until now we are in reach of our goal which is nothing less than a decent home for every family.  The only sites available in the beginning were outside the city area and the movements of people to these outlying areas created enormous problems.  The depopulation of our city proper has resulted in loss of business to traders and businessmen especially in the South-Central constituency.</P>
      <P>The Churches, too, complain of losing touch with large numbers of their people.  All in all, and I think it is agreed, every effort should be made to keep people in the area in which their social, business and religious lives are, and have been, centred for generations. The solution of course is flats.  It is to be hoped that the building of flats in the City Quay area will soon commence. There are sites available on one side of Townsend Street which could be used for this purpose and, as far as possible, these flats should be given to people already living in the area and badly housed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" /> Many of these are dockers and Gas Company shift workers to whom a flat near the quayside would be welcome. Old-established schools in these areas would also benefit.  They can maintain the traditions and continuity which they were in danger of losing.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the builders and architects on the designs of new flats in Grenville Street and Hogan Place.  They are a great improvement on the old barrack type of flat.  They are colourful and pleasant to look upon and add to the beauty of the city.  My concern is of course with Dublin, but I am sure that all will agree that our capital should be the show piece and an example to the country as a whole.  Well planned, beautiful and airy blocks of flats in the city centre must leave a profound impression on visitors.  They will give the lie to those who say that the Irish are a careless lazy people to whom the niceties of civilisation are unknown.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister not to encourage the building of mammoth garages in densely populated areas, especially in South-Central Dublin. These sites should be used for housing. Furthermore, the movement of cars in and out and around these places are a danger to school children in the areas.</P>
    <P>Improved grants for repairs to existing houses are welcomed and the section dealing with resetting of condemned houses is also a step in the right direction. There is a need on the south side for a great number of one and two-roomed flats for old people similar to those on the north side of the city.</P>
    <P>All in all, I hope the main effect of the Bill will be to galvanise the local authorities into greater activity.  It is to be hoped it will no longer be said of the authorities responsible for the affairs of the city and country areas that they have no money to press on with this most important project, namely, the housing in proper surroundings of all citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this Bill indicates that the Minister has decided there is need for a continuance of the housing drive, I am very pleased to welcome the measure.  It indicates that we have not reached the point of <Col N="422" /> finality in housing for the working classes, under the appropriate Acts, and for the ordinary people under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  I am particularly glad to note the increase in the various grants and the grants for the installation of water and sewerage.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to speak at any great length on this Bill.  I want to ask a few questions on matters in which I am personally interested.  I want to know if a house built six or seven years ago under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts and which, normally, prior to this Bill, would not qualify for a grant for the installation of sewerage and water as a private supply will now qualify for an additional grant for such supplies where no piped supply is available. My interpretation of the Bill is that it does qualify.  When he is replying, the Minister might make that point clear for my benefit.</P>
      <P>There are one or two omissions from this Bill which if these matters were included would have strengthened it.  I regret the Minister has not seen fit to insert a section to minimise the amount of legal costs in respect of small dwellings.  The late Deputy Martin O'Sullivan was pretty well recognised as an authority on housing in Dublin. I remember him speaking here in 1948 or 1949 and suggesting to the then Minister that he should introduce standardised costs in respect of legal fees for small dwellings in a Bill.  The Minister would be well advised to examine this Bill from that point of view.  It may not be completely acceptable to certain people but, in the interests of the promotion of small dwellings, he should consider the matter. The legal costs amount to anything from £50 to £80 on very many houses. That is a serious imposition on the ordinary man who has to provide capital to meet that and to meet it almost immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one section of the Bill the Minister indicates that local authorities may now provide supplementary grants up to the full amount of the new grant. However, they also may not.  So far as I know, many local authorities are now reducing the grants they formerly gave <Col N="423" /> and in some cases they are not giving any supplementary grant at all.  The Minister should consider including a section to provide that it be mandatory on local authorities to provide grants. It is ridiculous that, in one area, you will have a local authority giving the maximum grant, the same as the Government does, while in another area a means test of some sort is prescribed by the local authority or a reduced grant.</P>
    <P>I want some information on housing grants and reconstruction grants and inspection in general.  One would imagine that when a local government inspector visits an area and passes a house, say, for the maximum grant, the house is solid in construction, is likely to have a certain lifetime and complies with our housing requirements. It is a natural assumption that when a local government inspector comes out to certify a house as fit for the grant, it would meet these conditions. In the local authority area in which I am resident it is very strange to find the urban engineer, on visiting a house, to investigate the possibilities of the applicant securing a loan, deciding, and apparently there is no appeal against his decision, that the walls of the house were not thick enough, that the life duration of the house would be only 20 years, while the loan would be for 25 years, and that the sewerage was completely inadequate.  He added to that, that the market value of the house was a figure which the applicant considered was ridiculously low.</P>
    <P>While it is true that in the last City and County (Amendment) Act provision was made for a right of appeal on market value, and it has been exercised in this particular case, there is no appeal against the decision not to grant a loan.  Apparently the county manager, who is the person who grants the loan, gets the certificate of the local engineer before he grants the loan.  If the local engineer decides that the house is of poor construction, or that the life of the house is not as long as he considers desirable, or if for any reason he decides that the length of the sewerage pipe outlet is not sufficient, or is not wide enough, he can <Col N="424" /> hold up a small dwelling loan.  Surely it is wrong that there is not a right of appeal to the Minister in that case.  I am quite sure that that state of affairs is not common but I do not think it desirable that it should happen at all. I am quite sure the Minister will find, if he makes an investigation in his Department, that all the facts I have mentioned can be substantiated.  That case has happened and it probably will happen again unless the Minister takes steps to see that it will not arise.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know what functions the local engineer, or an engineer attached to the local authority, has in connection with reconstruction grants.  Is it correct that he does not certify in any shape or form, that he has no business even to check what has to be done in relation to the supplementary grant?  It has been claimed, in my local authority, that when the Government inspector passes a reconstruction job that the local engineer has nothing to do with it.  It has been said that we have got to follow their lead and give out the same grant, if we adopt the scheme.  I feel there should be some clarification of the duties which both inspectors have.  It is quite clear that the local government inspector is representing the Minister. Surely then, the local engineer should be representing the local authority.  If that is so I should like the Minister to indicate that my view is correct.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say on this Bill except to mention that I welcome it and to congratulate the Minister for introducing it.  I trust the implementation of the Bill, and the encouragement it will give to housing, will meet the point that I believe the Minister has in mind, that is, the furthering of building by private individuals.  I also welcome the fact that in the Bill attention is given to the rural position, and that we can now get the two-third grants for slum clearance in rural areas.  That was formerly confined to city and urban areas.  I hope that the Bill will give some much-needed employment in the rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pleasing that one of the main objectives of the Minister is the clearing away, as soon as possible, of existing city slums, irrespective <Col N="425" /> of where they are.  In the City of Dublin many of those sites have already been cleared and it is proposed to erect blocks of flats on them.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that those flats are not confined to three-or four-storey blocks.  One must consider the prohibitive cost of the initial site acquisition, the cost of subsequent site works, the provision of water, sewerage, roads, paths, etc.  All these are necessary for the blocks of flats of three or four storeys.</P>
      <P>I am sure most of Deputies in the House, whether from outside the city or not, are familiar with a very beautiful scheme in Dublin, namely, Dolphin House.  We have there blocks of flats of four storeys with very wide open spaces between each of them. One wonders why, after all the initial cost, they were not made eight storeys high.  That would have created a saving on the acquisition of other sites.</P>
      <P>I would also urge on the Minister that consideration should be given to the installation of elevators and central heating.  That might be a municipal matter but eventually it would come before him for sanction.  I am not suggesting that such flats should be termed luxury flats.  Undoubtedly, a greater rent would be required, possibly up to 15/- a week of an increase might be expected, on their existing rents.  One bag of coal costs in the region of between 12/- and 15/- for those unfortunate people and, in addition, they would be saved the prohibitive cost of transport.  The wage earner has to travel four or five miles to his work in the centre of the city.  There is also the question of the housework, and unfortunately education of the children, because we have not attempted to build our schools at the same time as the houses were built and consequently children have to be transported each morning in C.I.E. buses from such places as Ballyfermot to Whitefriar Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, to my mind, is a measure which is overdue.  Town planners may say that the aesthetics of the skyline would be affected if these flats stick up in the sky.  It is rather a pity that we have so much land available for purchase, or acquisition, because if it were not available we would have to <Col N="426" /> build upwards.  Deputy Briscoe stated that we have only 6,000 more sites available for building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would pardon me, I said 61 sites available for building flats, which would provide some 5,000 or 6,000 flat dwellings; and we had 6,000 sites available for the building of single houses under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy. That is what I said&mdash;6,000 houses. When those 6,000 houses have been built, the Deputy said himself he did not know where further sites would come from.  However, we are dealing with denuded parts of the City of Dublin and thinking in terms of the statements that there has been no lack of money for the past two years or year and a half.  Nevertheless, the building industry, which is married to the housing problem, has never been so bad.  I hope the Minister will take that into consideration.</P>
      <P>In that connection, I would have the temerity to suggest that he and his Cabinet give consideration to the immediate appointment of a new Minister &mdash;a Minister for Works or a Commissioner of Works&mdash;who would deal with this problem, as that is the only effective way in which it can be dealt with. I am not suggesting that the Minister or his Department are inadequate, but I suggest that owing to the exigencies of the situation through which we are passing, with the complete collapse of the building trade, this city is now in a state never equalled in the last 45 years, since 1913.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in one of the evening papers this week that in the year before last there were some 6,000 applications for housing, in the following year 7,000, and 19,000 up to April of this year.  I may be excused for dealing with this case from the point of view of building, but that is the only industry of which I have personal knowledge.  I have been associated with the building industry.  I have worked in it and have <Col N="427" /> been an employer in it.  During the war, many of my colleagues were obliged to buy or secure petrol under means which might not have had the blessing of the Department.  Now they have plenty of petrol, but they have to keep the batteries turned on in the garages.</P>

      <P>Many may say we have enough Ministries, but we are in a crisis and emergency powers should be granted.  If the Government decide, in their wisdom, that a commissioner should be appointed, I hope he will have emergency powers.  We created a Department of Supplies and people were able to override them.  The suggestion I make might help in the acquisition of sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the facilities under the Bill for the repair of old houses, I believe the 1954 Act was a total failure, at least in the manner in which it was administered.  Let us take an example. A person wishing to avail of that Act secured the necessary forms and then secured an estimate form from a contractor for, let us say, £300.  They were submitted to the surveyors.  The local authorities were working on a schedule which may have been a practical or operative one in 1939.  They in turn make their assessment accordingly. One has to remember that the applicant in many cases is almost without any funds.  He places the contract and it proceeds and eventually is completed.  Six months elapse before an inspector will appear and perhaps another 12 months.  I am not speaking at random; I can give details of cases under this Act which are over two years completed and no money has come forward yet.  In such instances <Col N="428" /> the contractors would need to add 25 per cent. to the normal cost.  Consequently, it is not working out.  I trust that the Minister will see that those defects are remedied, whether they are municipal or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker has said that the local government inspector must come along.  Municipal authorities will tell you that they have to wait for action by the Department of Local Government.  I agree that these benefits will be a great fillip to the building industry and I am sure that, in regard to any extraordinary powers such as a Minister or Commissioner would have, he would have no opposition and possibly it would be the one thing on which we would be unanimous here.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate that my remarks are in no way political or against any particular Department or any particular Government.  It has been said on both sides that the situation which exists is blameworthy from one to the other.  I would ask the Minister to keep in mind the necessity for doing something to alleviate the present housing situation.  Deputy O'Donnell said he thinks the shortage is coming to an end.  I wonder if Mr. O'Toole of the Dublin Housing Allocations Department subscribes to that idea.  Only this morning I was informed that a man with a wife and three children could not be housed because the room they were living in was a very large room and if they were housed there would be a loss of £500.  In spite of that some say we are coming to the end of our housing problem.  We may be.  Thanks be to God, everyone will admit that is so throughout the country, but certainly that is not the situation in Dublin.  It is my belief that up to another 10,000 houses are needed and, while conditions are as described at a meeting of Dublin Corporation last Monday night, we shall still need houses.  I wish the Minister every success in the implementation of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill inasmuch as it represents improvements on legislation that existed already, but we should not become excited about it.  There is nothing in this Bill that will bring any dramatic change to the overall picture <Col N="429" /> of our housing programme.  It is amending legislation and the emphasis is on the amendments which do improve existing housing legislation. There is nothing in it that is a radical departure, or that can lead us to expect that we shall see a dramatic change in the housing position of this country.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to encourage private enterprise in the conversion and improvement of the existing stock of dwellings, and we must look at it in that way.  That is the real purpose of the Bill.  It is not designed to expand the production of houses in a positive way.  Instead, it is designed to improve existing dwellings and, in that connection, I should like to mention one particular point.  Those who are familiar with building technique will agree that the difference in cost between improving an existing house and building a new dwelling is often very small, and sometimes the cost of making a good job of improvements is nearly the same as that of building a new house.  One difference at least is that the existing house is on a site, and a person does not have the trouble of acquiring a site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, with the emphasis on the word &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo;, improves existing housing legislation and, in so far as it does that, it should be welcomed by every member of the House.  We have been given a useful memorandum showing us what some of the improvements are, and it goes to show that this Bill tries only to improve the administration and the application of existing legislation.  I quote from a comment in that memorandum dealing with loans: &ldquo;Statutory authority exists under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts but is not operated at present, empowering housing authorities to make loans for the purchase of previously occupied houses.&rdquo;  We have had examples where a house was occupied only in a technical way, where a person applied for a loan and may have gone in before the loan was approved, and had to get out again. In a technical way occupation had taken place and, as this memorandum states, the power was there and was not operated.  This Bill is designed to ensure that any misunderstanding that <Col N="430" /> would arise in relation to the occupation of a dwelling in such a way, even for a few hours by a family who expected to get a loan, will be cleared up.  I have mentioned that as an example that the real value of this Bill is to ease the difficulties and to remove the misunderstandings which were in existing legislation, at the same time recognising that the existing legislation had the powers mentioned.</P>
    <P>It was stated that Dublin City can provide 12,000 homes.  They have 6,000 sites for single houses and they have space in which they could accommodate 6,000 families in flats.  We know that Dublin Corporation needs homes for at least 5,000 families at the present time. There is a great necessity for them and no one can say that the completion of our housing programme is in sight.  It is certainly no nearer to completion to-day than it was in 1956 when the row began in regard to both private and public house building.</P>
    <P>A sum of £400,000 was provided at that time and a great part of that money is still unexpended.  I would blame the campaign that took place at that time for the collapse of the building industry in Dublin and in the rest of the country.  Many building contractors have ceased business and 75,000 operatives and building labourers have emigrated.  We have emigration at the rate of 1,000 people a week at the present time, and a great many of those people were engaged in the building trade during the past ten years.</P>
    <P>I have always advocated that the City of Dublin should be built upwards instead of being built out, and I vigorously opposed the extension of the city boundary which took over fertile lands adjoining the city, land on which a vast quantity of the vegetables consumed by the citizens was produced. That fertile land was covered by concrete roads, footpaths, dwelling houses and back gardens, and I felt that positive effort should have been made to build up the city rather than have that happen to the land. Approximately 6,000 acres were taken from the county for Dublin City.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to make in connection with this Bill is that it does not, in a very positive way, encourage the owners of house property <Col N="431" /> in Dublin City to improve, repair and make more fit for human habitation the houses which they have.  Most Deputies, in recent times especially, have got to know the housing conditions which exist in the Dublin South Central area.  Possibly that area is worse than any other area in the city. It is obvious that thousands of families are living there under conditions which make their homes unfit for habitation, and it is obvious that the improvement of housing conditions for the people of that area should be begun immediately, but I feel that this Bill will not meet that need.  It will not transform the housing capacity and housing facilities which we found in the Dublin South Central area, apart from the building of very welcome flats on the available sites in that portion of the city.</P>
    <P>I feel, if a new departure in housing legislation were contemplated, that an effort should be made which would encourage landlords to improve dwelling-houses in which so many families at present are living in squalor in Dublin.  I think it is a grave omission from this Bill.  It is possible, of course, that we could have housing legislation in the future to meet that particular need.</P>
    <P>The remission of rates is a very live issue at the present time amongst thousands of families who have moved into new dwelling-houses and, indeed, among those who built houses on their own initiative in many cases in other areas.  The Bill proposes to extend for a period of ten years the seven-year period which previously existed, but it certainly does not meet the wishes of thousands of families who are asking for 20 years' remission in this case.</P>
    <P>They have a case for it and a strong case when we consider the valuation applied to their dwelling-houses during the past ten years in respect of accommodation equal to or even less than many families whose valuation was applied many years back.  They are living in houses which provide better accommodation nearer to their work. They have also many other advantages.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister should have <Col N="432" /> attempted to bridge the gap between the seventh year and the twentieth year instead of dealing with this matter for the first ten years.  Deputy Belton has shown that although this change in the period of rates remission recognises the problem which exists for all these families it does not properly meet them.  In fact, it is a very small concession when one puts down the figures and calculates over the period of ten years what the rates remission would be on this new scale compared with the two-thirds rate remission for the seven years which previously applied.</P>
    <P>I feel that the people who are agitating for a better approach to this question of rates remission will be disappointed by this section of the Bill. They will have to admit that their problem has been recognised by the inclusion of this section in the Bill, but I think they will have to complain that their problem has not been properly met.  No proper attempt has been made in this new legislation to provide some kind of a substantial easement of the rates position for many of these families.  Any member of the corporation or county council recognises only too well the hardship which many families are experiencing now to meet the very high rates on their dwelling-houses. It was something which they did not expect would become so difficult for them.  Their responsibilities have increased.  When going into the houses they had not calculated what a blow these rates would be when the seven years had expired.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister&mdash;possibly he would be able to assure me&mdash;whether, in fact, people who moved into these houses at any time since the war, since 1947, will now get the benefit of a further three years compared with people who have gone off now after nine years living in these houses and after paying rates for two years since the seven years have expired. I should like to know would it be possible for those people to get the advantage of the three years' extension. Of course, it is not three years' extension when we come down to the figures.  I should like to know in what way are those people going to be met. <Col N="433" /> It is a general problem in relation to the post-war housing.</P>
    <P>I believe an investigation has been carried out regarding the cost of building flats.  It seems to be a frightening cost when one considers that one of these large buildings which might accommodate up to 20 families is costing £3,000 per family.  It is hard to believe that a building with only four walls and one roof would cost approximately £3,000.  I should like to know if any serious effort is being made to put the microscope on those costs to see where exactly the real cost is and how does the cost of providing a flat amount to £3,000.</P>
    <P>County council cottages are being provided by Dublin County Council for a figure of £1,500 or even much less. Those cottages or council houses provide far more accommodation and better accommodation than the £3,000 flats into which many families have moved in Dublin City.  The cost of providing these flats is very important when one considers that it is related to the rent to be paid by the families moving into them.  The rates of corporation and county council houses are live issues.  They cause considerable hardship to many families.  For that reason, I feel that an inquiry into building costs, particularly in relation to flats, should be carried out.  I am quite sure that the matter has been considered several times by the technical officers of the various Departments but the ordinary man and, indeed, the family who moves into the flats find it difficult to believe that the flat costs £3,000.</P>
    <P>Inasmuch as this Bill will make easier the administration of existing housing legislation and inasmuch also as it will encourage the improvement of existing dwellings, I welcome it.  I am absolutely satisfied that the Bill is not going to bring a new housing drive. I believe that if a new housing drive were needed and that it did not take place under the legislation existing already, a new departure in housing legislation would have been necessary.</P>
    <P>Up to the introduction of this Bill, the position in relation to housing was no different than it was a couple of years ago, when a very vigorous campaign <Col N="434" /> was carried out by the Fianna Fáil Party which caused, in fact, the collapse of house building in Dublin City.  Somebody seems to be amused by that but I can point out that money which was there in 1956 is not yet spent.  At that time the Fianna Fáil members of the Dublin Corporation, in particular, carried on a very bitter campaign which caused considerable confusion in the city.</P>

We also have an improvement in respect of the grants payable in respect of serviced houses.</P>
      <P>There is one point I should like to mention in connection with a reply made by the Minister to a query when he said that grants would not be paid for the decoration of houses.  Perhaps the Minister's definition of the word &ldquo;decoration&rdquo; would be different from mine.

I had a question down to-day asking him whether he is prepared to introduce amending legislation in relation to Section 16 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, which would enable housing grants to be paid in instalments over a period of over 15 years or ten years since many persons cannot afford to carry out work which would enable them to qualify for payment of the full grant at one time.  That may seem to be a peculiar question but it is one which arises frequently.  Take the example of a person of very limited means who decides to carry out certain property repairs and improvements. He gets an estimate and is given a proportionate grant as the work he proposes to carry out is not as much as would involve the payment of the full grant.  Say he would get a grant of £120 if he did a certain amount of work and, if he did half that amount, he would get a grant of £60.  The difficulty is that if he gets a grant of £60 for doing half the work he cannot get another grant within 15 years.  I feel that such a person, within 15 years, should be entitled to qualify for the full grant in relation to the various regulations which apply to his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister replied: &ldquo;I would direct the Deputy's attention to the terms of the Housing Bill which is before the House, in which provision is made for increased State and local grants for reconstruction work and for loans repayable over 15 years to persons carrying out such works&rdquo;. That does not answer my question. That reply would seem to make out that I was getting a favourable answer but I have searched the Bill and I <Col N="436" /> cannot find in any part of it where a man having got portion of a grant can get the remainder of the grant within a space of fifteen years.  There are quite a number of people who are able to do a little job every five years but if they do a little job and get a grant for it they cannot get another grant for 15 years.</P>
    <P>Take for example a man who wants to put a room on his house and who has already done some improvement work.  He cannot get a grant to put the room on his house if he has already got a grant for improvement.  I hope the Minister will find a way of straightening out this matter.  I welcome the Bill.  It is an improvement and I hope it will do something to restore building activities.  There is at present no building in progress in a general way and I cannot see in this Bill any encouragement which will bring back a building programme such as we knew in the years before 1957.</P>

      <P>Naturally I welcome this Bill.  Deputy Rooney has been attacking it one moment and applauding it the next.  Deputies in Opposition blame Fianna Fáil for all their ills. The former Minister for Local Government is here and both he and Deputy Rooney have blamed Deputy Briscoe for the collapse of building in Dublin. I have never heard such hypocrisy in this House since it was first established.  I took an active interest in that housing crisis and did everything I could to point out at that time why the housing programme was collapsing.  All we wanted from the Minister and the Government at that time was an honest statement telling the people as a whole what the trouble was.  We could not get that statement from them.</P>

      <P>The first thing Deputy Smith did when he became Minister for Local Government was to try to help a number of people who were turned down for loans.  In County Dublin, 350 people were turned down for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  He tried to honour the obligations of the previous Government so far as these people were concerned. Now, at the eleventh hour, we find people blaming Deputy Briscoe, in his capacity as a member of Dublin Corporation, for the collapse of the housing system.</P>
      <P>We have had a number of deputations from A.C.C.R.A.  It is an organisation of residents in County Dublin comprising approximately 5,000 or 6,000 householders.  Some of these people are in a very bad way and cannot meet their commitments when they go on full rates.  A number of houses have been declared vacant.  I had to try to get some of these people housed by the Dublin Corporation and otherwise. I take this opportunity of telling the House about that problem in County Dublin and on the borders of the city so far as houses purchased by the aid of loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people pay only one-third of the full rates for a period of seven years, after which time they go on full rates.  The section introduced by the Minister for Local Government in this Bill is most acceptable.  In future, tenants will not feel the increase of rates so much as in the past when they came on to the full rates after seven years.  This is a social problem, too. A number of people are in a very bad way.  Some of them cannot meet their commitments.  They have young families.  At first, the interest rate on loans was 2¾ per cent. but now it has gone up to 6¼ per cent.  People who wanted to get married, to have a home and to rear a family were faced with growing difficulties.  Such people are <Col N="438" /> assets to the country.  A number of them have emigrated and have been forced out as a result of the high interest charges.  They had to repay the loan, pay ground rent and rates.  The outgoings for the average householder are about £3 10s. a week.  In a great many cases they are drawing only from £9 to £10 per week and if they had any trouble or illness they immediately felt the pinch.  Hardly a week passes without my having to do something about these problems.</P>
    <P>The low interest charges in the Housing Bill, 1947, were very acceptable to everybody.  The present high interest charges really have an international bearing.  In some cases, too, the valuation of houses is very high. We have a social problem on our hands, in my constituency and I do not know how to surmount it.  In Ballymun, a number of houses are idle because people could not carry on and just left them.  Some of them have been housed by the Dublin Corporation.  I am not asking the Minister to wave a magic wand but to do everything in his power to alleviate the position.  I have discussed this matter with him and I appreciate his difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party now want a 20-years' remission.  If they had done that while they were in office we would have appreciated their feelings a great deal more in that respect than we do now.  Being in Opposition, I suppose they feel that they have not the same responsibility.  This problem arose, too, during the term of office of the Coalition Government because when people were coming on full rates the same difficulties were there.  The Fine Gael Party have gone to town to-day on this Bill and in their demand for a 20-years' remission.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not affect the people about whom I am concerned now.  We cannot introduce retrospective legislation because we do not know how far back we would have to go.</P>

      <P>The reconstruction grants introduced in this Bill are a wonderful advance.  A number of persons whose houses are in a state of decay will apply for those grants and some employment will be created.  Unless the present high interest rates are reduced, I believe that, as time goes on, there will be fewer applicants for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  For that reason alone, the Minister has made a good advance even in giving loans for the reconstruction of houses, thus helping people to put and keep their houses in perfect condition and also creating a certain amount of employment.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision to increase the amount of money for water and sewerage facilities.  Some householders in County Dublin, though near a water and sewerage scheme, are not in a position to pay for the installation of these services.  In a number of cases, the landlords will not do this work. There are a number of places in my constituency where the water and sewerage is passing by the doors of the houses but the people cannot afford to do the work of installation and the landlords will not do it for them and, in certain cases, the local authorities will not do it.  I was wondering if it would involve the Department in a big outlay if they considered attending to that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I wish to compliment the Minister on this very advanced legislation and to stress that in the past there were certain cases where householders applied for reconstruction grants and there was a type of means test applied to them.  The means test took the form that Paddy Murphy was not a worker and did not come under Section 12 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, which dealt with reconstruction grants.  I had a number of these borderline cases which I brought to the Minister's attention and to the attention of his predecessor.  The present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, dealt with a few of <Col N="440" /> them when he was Minister for Local Government.  During the consideration of this Bill, I should like the present Minister to look at these borderline cases of people who were deprived of reconstruction grants in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>On a few occasions I confessed that I was rather green when dealing with certain matters discussed here.  On this subject, however, I think I can claim to be something of an authority.  I am vice-chairman of the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation and we meet every week. In three years I have missed only four meetings, during the by-election and during the general election, and therefore I think I have some factual knowledge of the housing position in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The building of houses in Dublin, except under the Small Dwellings Act, has been finished, or will be finished within the next 12 months.  The position at the moment is that there are approximately 6,000 applications with our allocation officer.  It is proposed to build 6,000 flats in the city so that they will absorb all those whose names are down for allocation.  Most of the people to whom flats will be allocated will come from the tenements which we now propose to reconstruct or renovate. Therefore, there may be a surplus of houses.  Those people who are to be put into flats are at present living in tenements.  That is the factual position.</P>
      <P>There are no facilities in Dublin for house building at present.  Deputy Briscoe referred to 6,000 sites but he was referring to sites outside the city, not within it.  There are no housing sites within the city.  It is not proposed to build houses and I do not think very many will avail of the opportunity to build houses, or to get loans for houses under the Small Dwellings Act.  It has been my experience that hundreds are not able to pay their way and are begging the corporation to give them dwellings under the Working Class Acts.  I had two cases of people who were evicted during the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said during the last month or two about the building of <Col N="441" /> flats and all the employment which such building would provide.  The building of flats does not provide more employment than the building of houses.  It is not expected that at any time we can build more than 600 flats a year in the City of Dublin.  Where you have virgin sites building can proceed at once but when it comes to the building of flats there are such matters as compensation to be looked after; there is legal action and there is demolition. All kinds of plans are turned down, both by the Housing Committee and the Minister.  Many promises were made about improving the flats in Vicar Street, but prior to that, approval was held up by the Department. If we can build 600 flats a year we shall be very lucky.  At that rate the maximum number employed will not be more than 400 so that there is no question of large numbers being employed.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on this Bill because I am very interested in the question of preserving old tenements.  Some years ago I put down several motions in the city council regarding this question, but they got very little sympathy because the people there wanted to keep on building houses.  I warned them that the people would not go out to the houses and they are not going out. Three out of every four people refused to accept an allocation in Finglas or Ballyfermot.  They would rather stay put until flats are built or perhaps they will be satisfied with houses which are reconstructed.  The situation is so bad that our allocation officer has decided to give no transfers, no matter how just a claim might be, from the Ballyfermot area.</P>
    <P>The renovation or reconstruction of those old dwellings is rather belated. If it had been done ten years ago we would have saved a couple of million pounds.  We average it out that four families could live in a tenement with two or three rooms apiece.  If £500 were spent on each dwelling, amounting to £2,000 for a tenement, you can judge how much the authorities would save.  With the cost of flats at £2,600 the housing authority would be saving a very large sum of money in preserving the tenements.  A very large <Col N="442" /> number of people living in our housing estates would gladly go back to those tenements if they were renovated. There are 1,200 applications for transfer back to the city and dozens are leaving those estates every week because they cannot pay their way and because of the high cost of transport and foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill because it will enable people, who due to economic circumstances can only afford so much for rent, to live in the city.  They will now be in a position to save money by going to cut price shops and perhaps getting employment.  Hundreds of people in those out-of-town areas are not able to come into town.  I know the position.  Many things are hidden from the general view but they are not hidden from me.  I made application for approximately 1,500 people in the past three years to be transferred. There are actually 400 people in the courts every year because they cannot pay their rents and most of them would gladly avail of this opportunity either to get back to a flat or to a renovated tenement.</P>
    <P>Much has been said to the effect that something should be done about erecting flats.  The reason why they have not been erected is simple enough. Before you build a flat you must acquire ground and ground in the city is very costly.  In the country it is a different matter; you buy the land and you do not have to compensate anybody. You have to compensate every one with a little hill of his own in the city, including the man with a stable or a shop, when the house has to be demolished.  All those come into the cost of a flat.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of doing something about the cost of flats, everything has been done.  The Minister himself has repeatedly turned down plans and then we have had to replan. I am quite certain that half of our dwellings built in the last ten years will not stand up another ten years. Grenville Street is a case in point. Deputies should take a good look at it.  The railings are well painted but they will bend quite easily.  That is all due to the Minister's drive for economy, in an endeavour to bring down the cost of flats.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> The renovation of old dwellings will give poor people an opportunity to live in the city, where the rent may be 10/- or 12/- and where they will not be subject to differential rents.  That is a bogey; it will be a never-ending sore. It is the cause of all the trouble in the courts that one never hears about&mdash; every month, 200 decrees over on the Quay, but nothing in the papers about them.  For that reason, I welcome the opportunity the Minister is giving poor people to get into the town where they can find their own level.</P>
    <P>In connection with the renovation of old tenements, we want speed.  In the past we took a year, but this new Bill gives the green light in many respects. In the past, one had to be a member of the working class in order to get a grant.  Now, so long as a dwelling is capable of being used for the working class, it gets the grant.  That means there is the green light right away.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation say that in the past they had not sufficient qualified personnel to deal with claims for grants, but they say now that they have the staff.  There are other snags, partly their own fault, partly the Department's fault and partly the fault of the people themselves, who send in wrong applications and wrong estimates.  The corporation say now that they can deal with a flood of claims and can expedite any claims they get.</P>
    <P>Two years ago I had a motion down to ask the Dublin City Manager to request the Minister to bring in legislation to compel the landlords to apply for the grants.  In the past, the vast majority of owners refused to apply for grants.  It seems that we have power now to walk in and carry out the repairs ourselves and either collect the rents or sue for the cost.  There is a snag still.  It appears that, in the section dealing with our powers, the landlord is bound only to carry out repairs which are &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; repairs. The corporation officials fear that if they carry out the repairs and then submit a bill of costs, they will be challenged in court, because while the repairs may be in accordance with the opinion of the medical officer of <Col N="444" /> health, the owner may say that what was carried out was beyond what was reasonable.  In view of that, some phrase should be used, to cover reasonable repairs in accordance with the conditions laid down by the medical officer.  That would help the corporation to go ahead without fear.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill and it appeals to me, but we do not want any hitches afterwards, either in the holding up of claims or in the making of payments, nor do we want the actual repairs challenged by the owners.  We want speed all the time, if anything is to come out of it.</P>
    <P>Another matter is that the corporation ask that Section 23 of the Housing Amendment Act of 1948 should be amended to include housing operations in the case of unfit rooms or premises where prohibition orders are obtained in the District Court because of the general unfitness of such rooms or premises under Section 113 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878.  I shall explain the position.  In all cases under Section 23, it seems that the local authorities can get the full subsidy, but in the cases under Section 113 of the 1878 Act they can get only a lower subsidy.  It appears that there are difficulties and long delay in getting possession under the 1878 Act. Therefore, they want Section 23 amended to include the matter to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the rents of corporation dwellings not covering maintenance costs.  That is a complete falsification of the facts.  It has been admitted by corporation authorities on cross examination, that maintenance costs for corporation houses of 40 years' standing are not any greater than the maintenance costs of housing built in the last ten years.  To the Minister's knowledge, a great many of those houses and flats built in the last ten years have been the subject of many complaints by tenants and owners under the Small Dwellings Acts.  In the old days there were good brick houses built without speed, but in the past ten or 15 years the builders have been anxious to build on the cheap, their whole concern being to finish the job and to get their money. <Col N="445" /> We shall pay for that in years hence, when it comes to maintenance work.</P>

      <P>Whether one agrees with Deputy Sherwin or not, one is constrained to concede that he is a man talking about something he knows.  It is a very interesting comment on this Fianna Fáil Housing Bill that we have reached the stage when a Bill is introduced into this House to promote our people from houses into tenements. For three generations, we have worked in this city to eliminate tenements and to put our people into decent houses. Now Deputy Sherwin, knowing the conditions in which people are living in Dublin Corporation and Small Dwellings Acquisition Act houses, rejoices that there is a prospect of many of them getting back into houses for which they can afford to pay, back into the tenements of the slums.

Certainly we have travelled full circle but I am happy to think not for long.  I want to direct the attention of the House to one absurd anachronism in the present situation.  There are, in this city, a very considerable number of large Victorian houses which are quite useless for individual occupancy under modern conditions, because nobody could afford to staff them.  There are a number of enterprising people in the city who have been buying these houses and converting them, at their own expense, into flats, and very good flats too.  These people have been informed by the town planning officer that they will not be allowed to convert them for the extraordinary reason that their conversion into flats may unduly densify the traffic in the particular districts in which they are.

      <P>There is no use in saying you are not going to stop other people. I have seen the prohibition order.  If it should not happen, let it be stopped, or otherwise authorise me to say to these people: &ldquo;Apply to the Lord Mayor and the city manager and they will cancel the order.&rdquo;  I am now alleging that in Dublin City enterprising citizens are prepared to invest money, in the conversion of substantial vacant houses into good, modern flats, and they are being prohibited from doing so by the planning authority, not on the ground that their conversion is unsuitable but that it will create excessive concentration of population into the areas where they are situated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Look, I lived in these houses when, between the family and the domestic staff, there were 14 living in the house.  Their conversion into flats involved the installation of three families which between them would not amount to 11 people.  If it was not excessive density when there were 14 living in the house, why is it excessive density when we have three families living in the house with facilities we never dreamed of in our days when we had no water above the ground floor? Now there is hot water on every floor, lavatory accommodation and everything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told that this Bill is meant to facilitate the operation of bringing <Col N="449" /> four or five families back from Ballyfermot and Crumlin and ramming them into tenement houses in Gloucester Street.  If that is not absolute insanity I do not know what is.  If any order of that kind submitted to the city manager is cancelled by some responsible person then my case falls to the ground.  If I am to be told that this Bill is to facilitate the corporation to accommodate families to come back from Crumlin and Ballyfermot and at the same time that you cannot convert large houses in Ballsbridge into flats, then I say this legislation is haywire. The fact is that neither the town planning authority nor anybody seems to be able to control it.  We are now reaching the stage in the city where the corporation is trying to do one thing and the town planning authority is doing the opposite.  Nobody has thought of trying to make the two march together.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Briscoe that if he could turn his mind to inquire into the question he would do a great deal more useful work than when he was roaring and bawling from this side of the House trying to precipitate the situation which involved the unemployment of hundreds of workers in the building industry in this city and enforced emigration to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I welcome any legislation directed to procure good houses for our people.  I sympathise with Deputy Sherwin's sentiment in aiding people who are in embarrassed circumstances and who yearn for housing accommodation less burdensome in the matter of rent and rates than they have at present.  That is not the real remedy.  You may say what you like.  You may recondition tenements whatever way you like. They are the slums.  They will revert to slums if they have entrusted to them four or five families for which they were never designed and for which they were wholly unsuitable.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled to hear it said that the differential rent system is operating to make it impossible for families to keep their houses.  I understand that the whole purpose of the differential rent system was to ensure that poor persons with heavy family responsibilities would have a low rent and that well-to-do families would pay an economic <Col N="450" /> rent and that between those two figures there would be various gradations to meet the individual circumstances of the family.  How that system can operate to drive people out of their houses for want of the money to pay the rent is a mystery to me.  I thought that the system was that rents would be related to family income.  I am astonished if Deputy Sherwin's version of the facts is true.  I do not profess to know as much about the City of Dublin.  There have been vast changes since I lived in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The differential rents system is one that operates more intensively in Dublin than in rural Ireland but it ought not be allowed to operate to put people out of their homes.  I do not think it was intended to do so.  Deputy Briscoe shakes his head.</P>

      <P>It is between the Deputy and Deputy Sherwin.  It is the duty of the Minister for Local Government to see that equity and justice are done, but I hope, when he finds out and reviews the impact of the differential rents on the residents of this city and when the Estimates are being prepared, he will bear in mind that their incomes have been abated by the increased cost of living which his Government has put upon them.  Regard must be had to that when the differential rents are being measured.  The housewife with seven or eight children has a very heavy additional burden to bear when buying bread and butter under the conditions now obtaining.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with attention to Deputy Sherwin.  I am prepared to listen to anybody.  I want to make a few general observations for the good of Deputy Briscoe's soul.  I am particularly horrified at the prospect of reconditioning tenement houses.  I hope the Minister will have second thoughts on that.  The sooner we pull <Col N="451" /> down the tenement houses, wipe them out and provide for those who have lived in them too long, clean, decent, modest houses, the rent of which shall be measured to their capacity to pay, the better it will be for us.</P>
      <P>I rejoice to have this to record.  I was speaking recently to an international observer who visited countries all over the world.  He said to me: &ldquo;Mr. Dillon, since I have come to Ireland I have been puzzled because in every other country to which I was summoned in an official capacity I found myself confronted with the problem of an acute housing shortage and a greater or lesser absence of passable roads.  Ireland is the first country to which I have come where it appears to me you have too many houses, if anything, and too many roads and most of them too good.&rdquo;  I was happy to say to him that we had known our period of poverty and when we got the means we knew how to use them.  It is our proud boast that, alone in Europe, it is almost true to say, we have satisfied the housing needs of our people and provided that every citizen of this State shall have a decent roof over his head.</P>
      <P>I exhort the Minister not to hold out before our people the objective of reconstructing tenements for the accommodation of the people of this city.  It is an ignoble objective and if Deputy Booth does not feel free to say it in public then I hope he will approach the mighty behind closed doors and tell them that it revolts his soul to have his name associated with any such contemptible programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief on this matter but I should like to compliment the Minister on this Bill.  I think that in its own way it will prove a very welcome asset to our housing policy. I was surprised to find, when going through the Bill, that a certain section of the people in which I am interested will not qualify under it.  The people I refer to are people who live on small farms within a certain valuation.  We, in north Tipperary find that we can build houses for labourers but we are not empowered to build a house for a <Col N="452" /> small farmer within a certain valuation. When I say a small valuation, I mean a valuation of £7, £8, £9, £10 and £11.</P>
      <P>I am elaborating on this point only to see if the Minister can justify that injustice to those people.  If you take a small farmer of £12 or £13 valuation who is living in a small and very old house, and they are quite common all over the country, under this Bill that farmer will not qualify for a grant. Most of these old houses are built on the mud wall system and the inspectors will not pass such houses for reconstruction due to the thickness of the old walls.</P>
      <P>That means that if the farmer cannot get a reconstruction grant he can only build a new house.  When he starts to do that he finds that his total grant will be between £400 and £500.  The house will cost him between £1,700 and £2,000.  Therefore that farmer is completely out.  In North Tipperary we find that farmers who have applied for loans are faced, after meeting all their commitments, with the payment of from £60-£80 a year each on the loan already received from the county council.  You can imagine any small farmer in Kerry, Donegal, Leitrim or anywhere else paying that amount year by year for any house.</P>
      <P>You have the difference between the worker earning a good wage and the farmer with a good income from his big holding but the small type farmer of the kind I mentioned has never been catered for by any Government.  If you take a small farmer who gets a loan of £1,400 or £1,500 from the county council, he has to pay £80 a year on that loan.  For a loan of £1,500 to be repaid in 35 years he will have to pay in interest alone £1,000, plus the original £1,500.  I may be wrong in that figure.  It is a guess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>So we have a type of small farmer in the country who is not able to build the house he would like to build and we have had Governments down through the years who have not been able to give him these concessions. Would the Minister consider allowing county councils to build a <Col N="453" /> house for such a man on the same terms as they can build houses for labourers?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>In North Tipperary houses are built for people with valuations up to £5 or £6 but on valuation over that the county council cannot build for them.  I should like the Minister to take note of this.  The type I am referring to is the person who comes between the labourer and the average farmer of £30 or £40 valuation.  That person is in as bad a position to-day as he was 40 years ago.  He does not get a grant for reconstruction because the old type of house is so poor that the reconstruction inspector will not pass it.  To build a new house is too great a liability for him because he knows he will not be able to pay the money.</P>
      <P>This type of person has been left out all through the years and I would ask the Minister to give a person in that position some concession if it is in his power to do so.  He could give a direction to the county council to build a house for such a person.  If he is not able to do that, would he reduce the rate of interest to those farmers so that, after meeting their commitments to the authorities, they would be able to pay the interest plus some of the capital?  Despite all the Housing Acts passed by this House we still have a type of people who are not qualified for a grant of any kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the debate, it was rather hard to discern whether the speeches made by Deputies were Estimate speeches or ones concerned only with the Bill before us.  To go into detail on the innumerable points raised by various Deputies, some relevant and some not, would take a very great deal of the time of the House.  If, during my reply now, I seem to miss out some of the points that have been made, it is only because very many of these points are more relevant to the Committee Stage than to this debate this evening.  Indeed, some of them will be dealt with, if not on the Committee Stage, on the closing speech on the Estimate to which, as I said, many of them really refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> It would appear from the general tone of speakers from all sides of the House that the Bill as presented, while not going all the way to meet the wishes of all Deputies in the Opposition, is welcome.  No matter what criticism any of them may have made on its shortcomings, at some stage or another all of them welcomed the provisions of the Bill even though they may have made reservations as to the actual operation of the various sections when enacted.</P>
    <P>Starting almost at the tail-end of the speakers, in order to clear the fog that has been created, I think I should refer very briefly to Deputy Dillon's contribution.  He gave us the type of speech that it is not unusual for him to make in this House.  Those of us who have had experience of his aberrations and entertainments here in the past were not surprised.  In my case, so far as this Bill is concerned, so little real criticism was made of its terms until Deputy Dillon got up that I began to wonder, sitting here, whether or not that in itself was something which should give me cause for fear&mdash; fear lest the Bill was not a good one and that the Opposition were feeling that in the future we would learn to regret it.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased indeed to find Deputy Dillon having one of his mental aberrations and going to great extremes to condemn the terms of the Bill, basing his condemnation on a misreading and misunderstanding of the views expressed by Deputy Sherwin who spoke before him.  Deputy Dillon spent his time endeavouring to put it across here and, I take it, outside this House that Fianna Fáil are now trying to bring people back into tenement and slum dwellings after spending 30 years getting them out of them.  Nothing could be further from the truth, nor could Deputy Sherwin's contribution be any more misconstrued, no matter how deliberately one tried to do it.  I have sufficient regard for.  Deputy Dillon's intelligence to realise that it was scarcely a mistake on his part that that misconstruction of another Deputy's remarks should have taken place.  However, these mental aberrations are not unknown to us.  In this case, it was a source of gratification <Col N="455" /> for me to know that the terms of the Bill so upset Deputy Dillon that this type of attack should have taken place. It gives me reason to believe that the good in the Bill and the good it will do was the cause of his upset.</P>
    <P>From there on, I think we shall forget about Deputy Dillon except to say that, while he made the very vicious charge that we were bringing back tenement dwellings and slums into the city by deliberate action of this Bill, he at the same time found fault with the planning authority of this city and the Dublin Corporation because, in some case or another which came to his notice, they would not agree to slum conditions being created where they do not exist.  I think that is Deputy Dillon's sole contribution&mdash;attacking Fianna Fáil and this Bill for bringing back tenement conditions and then finishing up his speech by berating the local authority in Dublin City for not allowing them to be created where they do not exist.  The inconsistency of the Deputy is well known.  I want to put on record just how inconsistent he can be when he may be trying either to get a point across in the House or possibly to entertain some of the distinguished friends whom he brings into the House to listen to him and admire his oratory which, undoubtedly, is first class, if you disregard what he is saying.</P>
    <P>Moving from there and in order to try to short-cut the closing speech on this stage of the Bill, I think it might be well to take, generally, the provisions and additions which the Bill, if enacted, will in my estimation bring about.  New housing grants, as we knew them, will continue at no less a rate than they have been obtaining in the past and up to the present.  In one case, there will be a decided increase for the section of the community living in an unserviced area without sewerage or water schemes serving in their district.  Where those schemes are not likely to be made available in the future, an additional new house grant of £25 from the Department of Local Government will in all cases be made.  Provision is in the Bill to enable the local authority to pay an additional <Col N="456" /> £25 supplementary grant in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>Water and sewerage grants will not only continue in the future as they have been in the past but the grant of £40 will be increased to £50 in the future for water and from £20 to £25 for sewerage.  Where both jobs are done at one and the same time, an over-all compounded grant of a maximum of £75 will be allowable, with the enabling and permissive provision for the local authorities to do likewise in so far as supplementary grants to the same amount are concerned, as and how they themselves decide how to operate it.</P>
    <P>Loans are one of the big advances, I consider, in this new legislation&mdash; loans for reconstructing buildings and for doing improvement jobs to our houses.  These loans will be available, under Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts code, from the local authority. What is more important, the money will be made available to the local authorities from the Local Loans Fund, thus enabling them to finance any borrowings that may take place under reconstruction or improvement schemes in future.</P>
    <P>Another change that has taken place in regard to repair and improvement grants is that in future the suitability of the dwelling for reconstruction and repair will be the deciding factor as to whether, in a particular case, a reconstruction or repair grant will be paid.  In the past these houses had to meet certain requirements as to their being suitable for a particular class of person and also that they were of a certain type.  The main point is that in future if a house requires repairs to provide suitable living accommodation then that will be the test as to whether or not a repair or improvement grant will be paid.  That then may have the effect of bringing into the scope of housing grant aids persons who in the past were left out, such as farmers whose valuations exceeded £50.  Such people whose houses conform to the general conditions that I have already mentioned may in future get these grants.</P>
    <P>In addition to that they may also apply and obtain loans to help them out with their repairs over a period of <Col N="457" /> 15 years.  Letting grants, which were a feature of past legislation, are continued and there is no change in so far as they are concerned.  One feature which I think will be most appreciated &mdash;apart from the question of farmers, who are over a certain valuation and who were not catered for in the past, being brought in&mdash;and which makes this not only a rural Bill, as some Deputies have suggested, but also a city Bill, is the provision which covers houses in the city.  These may possibly be in terraces, or whole streets, and owned by landlords who, due to rent restrictions, lack of capital and other reasons, have not been able to preserve these houses in proper condition in the past and who formerly were not able to get any assistance from the Government through the various Acts. They will now come under the scope of this Bill where assistance is required to provide suitable living accommodation. That I think is going to confer a very big benefit on Dublin and other cities, but particularly Dublin.  All of us who come to Dublin occasionally, realise the vast number of houses in that category which exist here and which, if allowed to deteriorate further, will only add to the burden of work which will have to be done in the future.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies welcomed the Bill but at the same time made reservations. One such reservation which was made by several Deputies on the Opposition benches, was that no matter what good was in the Bill it would not have any effect on improving the employment position, so far as the building trade was concerned.  If we succeed in repairing, reconstructing, or building additional houses as a result of any or all of the provisions in this Bill, and as these people have admitted there will be some increase, surely it is completely inconsistent to allege that having carried out more work and possibly built more houses, there will not in fact be an increase in employment in the building trade.</P>
    <P>Who is to do the work?  Are we to call in some of the legal profession to build the houses for us?  Are we to ask doctors to reconstruct them for us, or persons in some such category who have no connection with the building <Col N="458" /> trade and could not do anything about it?  Quite obviously if there is to be additional money available by way of loan and grant, both in this year and in the years to come, then building operatives must of necessity gain substantially by way of increased employment during the course of those operations. It will not stop there.  The provision of materials must in turn give additional employment in various parts of the country.  I feel satisfied that if those various improvements, whether they be large or small, take place they will result in more employment.  There will be more operatives working in the future than in the past and other workers will be engaged in providing the materials.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell, who was in the Department of Local Government himself, started off, as indeed did some of his colleagues, by saying it was an admission on my part, on the part of Fianna Fáil and the Government, that building was practically finished, that house building had reached the stage where we did not need any more building. Some of his colleagues even went further and made it more definite.  They said that we had reached the point where we did not need a single new house at all.  I am not making any such admission.  I have not admitted that in the past; I do not intend to admit it now.  I shall go even further and say that, apart altogether from the evidence that has been produced from various Deputies, on both sides of the House, for the need for further building in some parts of the country, and even in Dublin, apart from that immediate demand for building new houses and flats, one must realise that once built they do not last for ever. Unfortunately I would say that the houses which have been built more recently will last for a much shorter time than the houses built many years ago, when times were more leisurely, and labour was practically slave labour.</P>
    <P>Taking it all round, if we realise that there are somewhere in the region of 700,000 dwellings, and even allow for the fact that the life of many of these should be around 100 years, the annual replacement of obsolescent dwellings should be in the region of 7,000 houses per year.  Even if they last <Col N="459" /> 200 years it would still mean that the obsolescent houses to be replaced would amount to 3,500.  We are, in fact, building fewer than that number, or somewhere around that number allowing a 200-year span for the life of a house.  It would be a very happy matter for all of us if we could feel that the houses with which we are familiar would last 200 years.  We know that is not so.  We also know, that being so, that we are going to continue building houses in the future, year after year.  As long as any of us is alive and kicking, houses will continue to be built and must be repaired at a rate certainly not less than that approximating to one-third of those repaired after a 200 years' span.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell went on to ask, while he agreed with the provisions if they worked, why should we not compel the local authorities to operate the supplementary grants schemes and the other schemes contained here, which are only inserted as permissive legislation in this Bill.  Other Deputies have come across with the same story. I have a note of them here and possibly at a later stage we may deal with various efforts on their part to put across the idea that I, in putting this Bill through the House, should take power to compel local authorities to spend ratepayers' money on doing a particular job.  I do not intend to compel the local authorities to do this job.  I believe that the local authorities are mature people who know what they want in regard to these things, who have regard to the general well-being and ability of the ratepayers to pay.  I believe that they are as anxious as we are in this House, to provide these financial aids, in addition to what the Government will give for the provision of housing in both new and reconstruction jobs.</P>
    <P>Realising that, I say that I shall not under any circumstances consider compelling the local authorities to do as Deputy O'Donnell and other Deputies on his side of the House ask me to compel them to do.  I shall appeal to the local authorities to row in with us as they have done in the vast majority of cases in the past, to row in with the Department and with the Government <Col N="460" /> in helping to add to the assistance we are providing directly from the Exchequer by way of these supplementary grants and by way of providing the loans and the machinery for the administration of the loans, the money for which we are providing now from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>The one big argument I would put to them in regard to these things is one which, at all times while I was a member of a local authority, was the deciding argument as to whether we should have supplementary grants to the full 100 per cent. permitted in those days.  That big argument was that, by and large, the people who would qualify for the supplementary grants are people in an income group &mdash;or at a valuation level, should they be farmers&mdash;who would in time, if not housed by their own efforts with the aid of grants from the State or local authority, fall to be housed by the local authority entirely at the full cost of the house to the rates or the Exchequer or both.  That cost would be very much greater, possibly ten times greater, than that which it would cost to contribute at this stage to enable those people to provide houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>Under the present system, those people will regard their houses with pride; they will regard them in a better way than if they rented houses; they will preserve them longer and, by and large, they will be a greater asset to the community than if they were trodden down to the point where they had to call out to the local authorities to provide houses for themselves and their families.  To my mind, as a member of a local authority, that was the final justification for my continued support and advocacy of the operation in full of the supplementary grants of the past.</P>
    <P>That is the argument I would couple with my plea to all local authorities to-day, asking them for their co-operation and their assistance by adding to our grants from the Department their supplementary grants in all future cases. I believe they will do that, as they have proved in the past they were prepared to do it; and, if they do, much progress will be made in new building, in the extension of water and sewerage <Col N="461" /> to the isolated dwellings in rural Ireland and in the conservation of many houses throughout the land.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested also by some Deputies that, while this Bill reads all right, they would like to know the Government's real mind.  All I can say is that the terms of the Bill were agreed to by the Government and that the Cabinet considered them in detail. They have agreed to provide the money necessary to carry out any development and deal with any increase in the tempo of building and reconstruction which will follow from the terms of this Bill.  That is the mind of the Government. Their mind is that they want to make it known, as they are doing in very concrete form in this Bill, that they desire the housing drive to continue, that they desire all the people&mdash; not 90 per cent. but 100 per cent.&mdash; housed in decent conditions.  They are prepared to finance the terms of this Bill if it is made an Act, and they will make available to local authorities the requisite money to carry out their side of it, if they co-operate with us in this new drive.</P>
    <P>It is not, as has been suggested, a substitute for the revival of the housing grant.  This is what we regard as the method by which the revival will take place.  It is not a substitute for revival.  It is maintained, by quoting the figures for 1958, 1957 and 1956, that Fianna Fáil has fallen down on the job which they accused their predecessors in office of not doing properly, that of providing accommodation for our people.  The quoting of those figures is not conclusive proof that Fianna Fáil has fallen down on the job.  It is said that we are as far back now as we were in 1956.  Surely the houses which have been built since 1956 must represent some advance on the position obtaining then?  Surely it must be realised also that difficulties will arise if one allows the whole building industry to be ground down to a standstill, as was done in 1956, so much so that not only did building taper off but actual planning was stopped completely and entirely by some local authorities.</P>
    <P>That occurred for one very good <Col N="462" /> reason, that they could see no point whatever in planning for further building when they had not the money to pay for the building which was going on, when they had not the money they were promised before they started to build in order to pay for the work that had been completed.  Surely the responsibility for that must rest with the Government then in office, and surely theirs must be the guilt if, 18 months after their departure, the revival that Fianna Fáil believed was possible has not yet taken place?</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge that you cannot acquire land, plan houses, get contractors on the job and build houses overnight.  That, in fact, is what is implied in the criticism now being levelled at Fianna Fáil, and in the figures quoted of a 40 per cent. decrease this year as against last year. The responsibility for that is being laid at the door of Fianna Fáil, but I lay it back at the door to which it belongs, that is, the door of the Coalition Government which, as I have said, brought the whole building industry to a complete standstill.  I go further, and say that if it were not for the advent of Fianna Fáil in 1957, the percentage drop in the number of houses built in the past year would be not 40 per cent. fewer than the previous year, but it would likely be 80 per cent. fewer.</P>
    <P>We must go back a little bit and recall to our minds, those of us who knew the situation then from the point of view of being members of this House and members of local authorities, the plight in which we were then; the plight in which local authorities were placed in the summer, the autumn, the winter of 1956 and in the spring of 1957. We were being tagged along.  We were being codded up to our eyes by promises issued week by week either from within the House, within the various Departments, or from platforms at public and private meetings held outside this House.  We were being pushed along and coaxed to continue building, and the money that was to come last month was to come next month.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows as <Col N="463" /> well as I do&mdash;and I am sorry for him still that he was a party to the Government, and was the instrument by which the local authorities were brought to their knees to such an extent at that time&mdash;that they had to cease planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No moneys were made available by the Department.  No moneys were forthcoming.  Promises were being made that: &ldquo;If you wait until next week, or next month, you will get what you were promised for last month.&rdquo;  The position naturally grew to such proportions that prudence within the local authorities began to assert itself, and members said: &ldquo;While we are committed up to our necks in what we have already planned and made contracts for, we would be a right lot of idiots to go further in planning future schemes until we get the moneys for the schemes which we are now doing.&rdquo;  That is one of the reasons why, though Fianna Fáil has been in office since March 1957, we have not yet recovered to the degree that we would wish to recover in the building trade, nor to the degree we believe is possible of recovery in the building trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest there be any doubt about what I have said, lest people's memories might be slipping, is it not a fact that when Deputy Smith became Minister for Local Government he sanctioned, within his first six months in the Department, £865,000 worth of contracts, the sanctioning of which had been awaited in that Department and had not been forthcoming under the previous Government and the previous Minister?  Is it not true that in the few months before the departure of that Government, before March, 1957, only a few small schemes amounting to not more than £13,000 in all were sanctioned?  Then to come along here to try and maintain that because more houses were not built last year than were built the previous year, to try to prove by that that Fianna Fáil has failed, is surely futile on their part if people but recall the circumstances <Col N="464" /> under which Fianna Fáil came into office, and if they realise the back-log of unsettled and unsanctioned schemes that lay in the Department of Local Government, and the unpaid bills that were lying at the doors, not only of the Department of Local Government from local authorities, but at the doors of local authorities themselves, from the various individual people who built houses on the promises of grants made by the local authorities who were to get the money from the Government, but who did not get it.</P>
    <P>That was the position that obtained when the Coalition were in office.  That position, however, does not obtain to-day; it has not obtained for the past 12 months.  That, in itself, is surely a turning back of the tide which once threatened to overwhelm the entire building industry in this country.  That in itself had been a very big advance and in a very great part is the fulfilment of the promises of Fianna Fáil, prior to coming into office on the last occasion, that they would rectify the matter and would bring the building trade back to a proper basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy apparently cannot be made to understand that you cannot stop building, and put the entire population into confusion through not paying bills incurred by Government, and then expect within 15 months of this Government assuming office, that not only will the bills be paid but that the wheels of the building industry will be rolling as merrily as ever they rolled before.  We do not claim to be magicians, but I believe that even with those figures which the Deputy and his colleagues quoted, we can claim to have gone a long way to rectify the position that the Coalition Government had brought about by their mismanagement in the years of their office up to 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="465" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will not change figures; only the Taoiseach can do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes to quote figures possibly he will tell the House why he, when Minister in the Coalition Government, did not set up an all-time high record for the greatest number of houses completed in any one year?  Who holds that record?  Who holds the record for the second highest number of houses built in any one year since this native Government was established?  It is not the Coalition.  It is not Fine Gael, Cumann na nGaedheal or any other Party in this House other than the Party in government to-day.</P>
      <P>They were the architects, back in 1932, of the revival of house-building and of the promotion of house-building and the rehousing of our people.  A great job has been done and if, in the interval, by accident two Coalition Governments may have carried it on, there can be no mistake, and there will not be, when the history of the housing drive in this country comes to be written, about where the credit lies.  I say that deliberately.  The entire credit will go to the Fianna Fáil Party who were the initiators and the promoters. They were the people who launched that programme and they are the people, who by the terms of this Bill, will fill in the gaps that have been left by past legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying to get down to the level of those who, in the past have not been able to avail of the various benefits of previous Acts, to try to cater for those people in a greater degree than in the past, and so fill the gaps which remain in the programme for the rehousing of our people.  Deputy O'Donnell remarked that we could hold up building needlessly in a way designed to conserve money.  I think there is nobody better qualified than himself in the unfortunate circumstances he was placed by his Government to know the ways and means of holding up building needlessly in order to save and conserve money.  We do not intend to practice the same type of hold-up.  If we did not have the money and if we could not see our way to <Col N="466" /> provide it in the future, we would not come into this House, as I now do, to make further and better provision for more building in the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill has also been described as theoretical legislation by Deputy O'Donnell.  He talks of theoretical legislation and hypothetical estimates. I do not think the Deputy can be quite serious in suggesting that these estimates are hypothetical.  Possibly I have misnamed the Deputy in this case.  It is Deputy Corish who spoke about hypothetical estimates.  When I mention Deputy Corish, I should like to go further and say that this charge of hypothetical estimation by officers of the Department of Local Government and the local authorities is a lot of eyewash.  If an estimate is found to be much under what the actual cost of the job proves to be&mdash;as is very often the case in regard to houses which from an outward appearance look as if they do not need much repair but which on further investigation. may require a good deal of repair&mdash; these earlier estimates if wrong, are revised and have been revised for the benefit of the applicant in very many cases.  It is not hypothetical nor is the legislation we are now promoting theoretical.  We hope it will be very practical.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that the method of dealing with the various problems in regard to houses has been slowing down; that we have been dillydallying and that we are not getting on with the work as we should.  I want to make it clear that as far as these housing projects are concerned our wish is that where necessary projects are and could be devised and put up to us in the Department we are awaiting them. Rather than attempting to block them we are awaiting their arrival in the Department.</P>
    <P>We have made that quite clear on several occasions.  I wish to reiterate that we are not holding up unnecessarily or unduly for the want of money any worthwhile scheme whether it is a housing scheme, sewerage or water scheme in any part of Ireland at the moment.  That is the present position and that is the position I hope will continue.  If there is one little fault <Col N="467" /> I can find with the situation at the moment it lies not with the Department but with the situation whereby, due to the nature of the planning, sufficient schemes are not coming to hand &mdash;not as many as I should like to see and not as many as I know could be brought to hand if the job were tackled and continued without a break during the latter days of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>There have also been suggestions&mdash; several suggestions as a matter of fact &mdash;that unduly long delays are taking place in regard to the acquisition of building sites in the cities.  Particularly is this claim made in regard to the Dublin City area and to a lesser degree I have heard it mentioned elsewhere, although on investigation in Limerick and Cork I have discovered there is not very much in it.  The complaint is that, due to faulty legislation, bad legislation or lack of legislation, acquisition cannot proceed.  Here in Dublin, however, wherever or by whomever Deputies are advised, there seems to be general agreement amongst various members of this House that we have not got sufficient legal powers to get on with the acquisition of sites in central Dublin; that it will take, as some of them said, from five to seven years to get on with one of these clearances.</P>
    <P>I have investigated this aspect of things put to me by various Deputies not only to-day but on other occasions and so far as my advisers can tell me, there is sufficient law at the disposal of Dublin Corporation to-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not talking about Deputy Briscoe and his pals.  I am talking about the apparent general dissemination of information no doubt by <Col N="468" /> some legal gentleman or genius who has instilled into the minds of the lay members of Dublin Corporation and members of this House interested in the welfare of central Dublin the idea that no matter what law there is it is not sufficient to enable the legal department to go on.</P>

      <P>I hope Deputies will follow that up.  If they can get nowhere I shall hear from them.  There is sufficient law to clear the central city building in every other city in the country. I would ask Deputies who are members of the corporation to follow that up. If what I have said is found to be so, then they will go on, as I know they want to go on, with the acquisition of central city sites.  If they come back to me and say it is not so, I shall lose no time in rectifying the position.  But we are as assured as can be that there is the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>You will not have any difficulty in holding me.  I will be a very willing volunteer.  Perhaps I have kept the House sufficiently long.  I have fallen into the same trap as many other speakers who went before me and who dealt with the Second Reading as if it were a Committee Stage.  I would ask to be excused for that fault.  Having listened to so many points which I might call Committee points, I felt there were some which demanded at least a reply.  That I have not covered all the points mentioned by all Deputies is due to the fact that most of them are appropriate to the Committee Stage.  Then we can discuss them in detail.  Every point raised will be fully gone into and the answers will be given to Deputies on that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying that so far as this Bill is concerned, if it becomes law, I believe it will do much to bring about a revival in the building industry, <Col N="469" /> that it will have the effect of giving a chance of getting houses to those who still need them and that it will provide a long felt want in regard to the conservation of many old houses, particularly those owned by landlords who, for one reason or another, could not do anything with them in the past. I believe that so far as the loan content of the Bill is concerned it will go a long way to make it possible for the not-so-well-off owner to do a good repair job on his house and make it a more fit place for himself and his family to live in.</P>
    <P>I believe that the terms approved in the Bill regarding water and sewerage schemes throughout rural Ireland will provide for a certain number of applications and that the time will come when we shall have a dwindling number of unserviced houses, not only in the city and towns, but also in the rural community as a whole and that the drudgery of the housewife, the farmer's wife and the labourer's wife will be reduced, that the attractions of the countryside for the younger people will be added to, that more contentment will obtain and that fewer of our people will be seized with wanderlust to leave the country as they have been doing and not without justification.  In the past it was lack of amenities such <Col N="470" /> as these that led people to leave the countryside because life there was not very pleasant for them.</P>
    <P>These things are possible under the terms of this Bill.  They will become probable if I get, as I believe I shall, the full co-operation of the local authorities in the operation of the grants and loans.  Having got that, I believe we shall go on to attain the objects for which this Bill was introduced&mdash;the provision of better houses for many of our people, the conservation of the existing housing stock and the saving of money, not only to the Exchequer but also to the ratepayer. As such, I now commend the Bill to the House and trust that it will become the law of the land.</P>
