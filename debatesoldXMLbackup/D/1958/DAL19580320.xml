    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in order to secure economy and more efficiency in administration and to obviate delays, the Government will consider the advisability of decentralising such Departments as Local Government, Industry and Commerce and Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (thar cheann an Taoisigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would direct the Deputy's attention to the reply of the then Taoiseach to a question in almost identical terms which was addressed to him on the 30th March, 1950.</P>
      <P>As was pointed out in the course of that reply, the decentralisation of Government administration gives rise to serious practical difficulties and it is doubtful whether it would, in fact, tend to improve efficiency and obviate delays.</P>
      <P>In my reply to a question on the same subject which was addressed to me on the 6th June last, I gave as my view that the only hope of effective action lies in aiming at the location in the provinces, as opportunities present themselves from time to time, of subordinate sections of Departments&mdash; particularly in the case of a new Department&mdash;or of any new statutory bodies that may be set up.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that guest registration in hotels in 1957 dropped by 106,000 compared with 1956, and that the total hotel receipts in 1957 were over £1,000,000 less than in 1956; whether this trend is likely to continue; and if he will ascertain what steps Bord Fáilte Éireann propose to take in the matter in view of the importance of the tourist industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct that the latest quarterly report published by the Central Statistics Office on their inquiry into hotel and guest house receipts indicates that the number of guest registrations in hotels in 1957 decreased as compared with 1956.  It is not correct that total hotel receipts in 1957 were over £1,000,000 less than in 1956; the report shows that total hotel receipts in 1957 increased by £67,000 as compared with 1956.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte Éireann are charged by statute with the task of promoting the development of the tourist traffic in Ireland and particulars of the steps taken by them in pursuance of their statutory functions are contained in the annual reports of the board, which are presented to the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Separate statistics in regard to factories situated in dwelling-houses are not available, but I am advised that the number of such factories in the County Borough of Dublin comprises only a small percentage of the total number of factories in the area. The aim is to have each factory on the official register visited by an inspector at least once a year, but in practice and because of the need for repeated visits <Col N="548" /> in some cases, the average is less than once a year.</P>

      <P>In addition, three other large-scale sanatoria, which could be regarded as regional in character, were provided since that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state (a) whether representations have been made to his Department regarding the failure of the dispensary medical officer to attend to a patient (Medical Card No. T. 2/4376) at Bishopstown, Cork, (b) the date of such representations, (c) the dates of correspondence on the matter between South Cork Board of Public Assistance and his Department, and (d) whether a decision has been made on the matter and, if so, what decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On 26th February, 1957, a letter was received from the secretary of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance regarding the alleged failure of the district medical officer to visit a patient at Bishopstown, Cork.  The views of the county manager on the complaint were requested on the 8th March, 1957, and these were received in my Department on 16th March, 1957.  Further communications were received from the board on 4th September, 1957, 26th November, 1957, and 12th February, 1958, and letters issued from my Department on 26th October, 1957, and 7th February, 1958.</P>
      <P>During the course of the investigation of the complaint, it became apparent that the large number of patients covered by medical cards in the dispensary district in which the complaint arose had a bearing on the issue and it was thought desirable to examine more fully this aspect of the matter, which had been under discussion with the local authority for some time, before disposing of the original complaint which has been investigated by a medical inspector of my Department.</P>
      <P>I am considering the medical inspector's report and I hope to arrive at a decision shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has the full file in front of him for over 12 months is he still satisfied that under the Health Act a medical officer can refuse assistance to a person covered by a medical card as in this case?  Further may I ask the Minister does he believe it fair to put over an excuse that because <Col N="550" /> of a so called number of people under the care of this medical officer, refusal to attend a patient can be allowed? Thirdly&mdash;which is important&mdash;is the Minister going to decide at any time as to whether the doctor had the right to refuse on the grounds that he had no petrol allowance at the time of the Suez Canal affair to make whatever visits were necessary, at a time when he had such petrol allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a conflict of evidence in this case.  I think I am looking at the case much more objectively than the Deputy is.  I understand he has an old grievance in regard to this matter.  All I have to say about it is that in this case the only breach which the doctor made of the regulations was that he gave the mother of the child a ticket that the baby should be admitted to hospital.  That is the only case I know of and, while he has been guilty of a breach of the regulations in not seeing the child in the first instance, I am not at all satisfied that it was to the detriment of the patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising out of the Minister's reply, is the Minister aware that a certificate for admission of the child to the local hospital was issued by a doctor at the time without having seen the baby at all?  Secondly is he aware that the diagnosis in this particular case was proved to be wrong when the child was admitted to the hospital?  Thirdly is he aware, in relation to his personal insinuation to me, that I have never met the doctor in my life, that I have never spoken to the doctor in my life and that I know nothing whatsoever about him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what chit-chat the Deputy might have had with the doctor or about the doctor but I am satisfied that the breach of the regulations in the actual circumstances of this particular case was not a very serious one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>

      <P>I am aware that, except in individual cases of unforeseen emergency, holders of Irish passports resident in Canada require visas to enter the United States of America on a visit.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, I have already made representations to the Government of the United States on this subject.  Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 1952, the visa requirement for non-immigrants may be waived by the American authorities on the basis of &ldquo;reciprocity with respect to nationals of foreign contiguous territories and residents thereof having a common nationality with such nationals.&rdquo;  On this basis, and as they have common nationality with Canadian citizens, holders of British passports resident in Canada are accorded exemption.  Irish citizens, however, have not a common nationality with Canadian citizens and, therefore, holders of Irish passports resident in Canada may not claim a corresponding exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Irish emigrants from the occupied part of Ireland are entitled to cross into America without having to get this visa and that Irish emigrants from the Republic have not alone to get a visa but to lose a day's pay from work and pay $25 for the visa, would the Minister not agree that the implication is that the Irish passport is inferior or less useful than the British one which is used by residents of the Six Counties?  In view of that, would the Minister make the strongest possible representations to the American Government to have this position clarified as soon as possible, in the interests of the Irish emigrants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree, of course, that it is in any way inferior. Citizens of other countries&mdash;Germany, France and so on&mdash;have similar disabilities with regard to this short term visiting to the United States, when they are resident in Canada.  However, I agree that it would be a great convenience to Irish people holding Irish passports to be able to get into the United States on a short visit from Canada without a visa and I have <Col N="556" /> made representations to that effect to the American authorities.  The American authorities have the right to insist that all people entering their country should have a visa.  They waive the visa for a short visit in the case of Canadians and people having common nationality with Canadians, for the convenience of their own staffs, because people were queued up on certain occasions and it was for their own convenience they did it.  I have urged them to extend that facility to cover our citizens or people with our passports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Ormonde)</NameTxt>
      <P>The clothing requirements of the Government service in general are ordered by the Comptroller of Stores.  In the coming financial year the anticipated requirements are approximately 80,000 woollen garments (overcoats, tunics, vests and trousers), 35,000 items of protective clothing (waterproofs, overalls, etc.) and 130,000 minor items (caps, shirts, underwear, socks, gloves, etc.).</P>

Some of the requirements for the coming financial year have already been ordered and it is expected that contracts for the bulk of the remainder will be arranged within the next two months.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the last portion of the Minister's reply in which he states that he is satisfied it would not be in the public interest to disclose the tender prices to other parties, particularly to other parties submitting tenders, is the Minister aware that down through the years there has been the greatest dissatisfaction amongst clothing manufacturers and people tendering generally for these contracts?  Surely, in all justice, if a person fails to obtain a contract he should know what the successful tender was so that in the future he may become more competitive?  Any local authority when it gets tenders for housing schemes publishes them so that other builders will become more competitive in the future.  Will the Minister state what is the reason for the secrecy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Disclosure of contract prices would be objectionable on a number of grounds.  There sometimes is a wide margin between the lowest price and the second lowest.  This arises from the fact that particular jobs are often better suited to one firm than to others, either because its machinery is more suitable or because it has the requisite skill, or from other reasons such as location.  The disclosure of tender prices in such a case would almost certainly lead to an increase in the prices paid by the Department as the lowest tenderer would become aware of the margin at his disposal and might be expected to raise his price next time to something nearer his competitor.  The present system makes <Col N="569" /> for keener prices as it encourages tenderers to be competitive.</P>

I understood I had a constitutional right of access to documents referred to in public by my successor in office, quite apart from the ordinary rules of courtesy.  I do not know what the Taoiseach's opinion is.  I understand we have a constitutional right of access to official documents confidential to our Departments referred to in public by our successors.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the agricultural side of our economy goes, the Fianna Fáil Government has given the farmers maximum protection. When Fianna Fáil came into office in 1932 there was practically free trade as far as agricultural produce was concerned. Fianna Fáil gave the farmers maximum protection on the home market.  As a result of that protection we have now reached the stage when we are faced with over-production in agriculture.  Various people criticise the Government and the Minister and, in so criticising, demonstrate their negative approach.  We had the experience in County Dublin of the County Committee of Agriculture passing the usual vote of censure on the Minister.  So much political eyewash! These people cannot themselves make any constructive suggestions.  All they want to do is to criticise the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has proved a good friend to the farmers, to the market gardeners and all the others concerned. He has helped them by giving them all the protection necessary.  We are now able to fulfil our own requirements on the home market.  I ask these people who criticise, what would they do?  We have kept our bargain with the farmers, with the people generally <Col N="580" /> and with the workers.  We have given protection in the industrial field as well as in agriculture.  Nobody can say that we have failed in that respect. No one can say that we have failed in our promise.  We have honourably fulfilled that obligation to the workers, the farm workers, the farmers and the industrialists.  Any promises that were made by us in 1932 were honourably carried out by us.  We honoured them as far as was humanly possible. Deputies at the other side of the House may smile&mdash;they find it easy to do so&mdash;but we went through a severe time, and we were up against many problems during that period.  However, Fianna Fáil did a good job with those problems.</P>
    <P>There are parties outside this House who speak on behalf of various organisations and they can do nothing more than cast a negative vote of censure on the Minister for Agriculture.  These people are making a poor contribution to the welfare of this country.  If that is all the contribution they can make, it is a very poor reflection on their intelligence, when they know that we are doing our best to honour our promises.</P>
    <P>These people must realise now that we have to go into the export market and compete in that market.  We are now subsidising certain agricultural commodities, such as butter.  We have to try to export our butter in order to help the farmers to produce more milk and butter.  We have protected our farmers in regard to all the commodities which they could produce for the sheltered market at home.  The country to-day wants the enterprising farmer or industrialist to go into the export market, so that we can make a profit from the produce which cannot be consumed at home.  If we do not succeed in getting export markets and if we cannot encourage our people to do the best for themselves, we are not going to have a prosperous country.</P>
    <P>The great countries of the world which have achieved great things did so by the enterprise of the individual and by the enterprise of groups of industrialists and agriculturists.  These people succeeded in getting into <Col N="581" /> the export market and now they are clamouring more than ever for an export market.  We have reached saturation point in the home market in regard to certain commodities and now we must put these commodities on the foreign market, if we are to progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the export market.  Surely, when there is a national problem to be faced up to, we should not have these nonsensical interruptions from the other side of the House.  We are facing up to these problems and we will win our battle with them, as we won in the past.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance holds a very responsible position and has a very responsible task in trying to guide the ship of State through troubled waters. However, I want to make this suggestion to him: any factories or industries which have received protection over a long number of years from this and previous Governments, and which are confining themselves solely to the home market, should now be told to make an honest effort to get into the export market.  We have given them protection over a long period of years and now, if they have any products to sell in a foreign market, they should try to sell them there and do so to as great an extent as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The condition in which we find our country at the moment is one that should be far outside the range of Party politics.  If we are to bring our country back to prosperity, give employment to our people and keep them from emigrating, it can be done only with the wholehearted co-operation of the people who are in a position to help the country.  The only way they can do that is to get into the export <Col N="582" /> market and sell our surplus products there, whether they be industrial or agricultural.  I should like to see cooperative societies developed in every parish in Ireland, so that the people would be able to help themselves and not be blaming the Government for everything that happens.</P>
    <P>I believe that if that spirit of co-operation and goodwill was developed, and if the people were anxious to help one another in the solving of their own difficulties, they would help the country to get out of its difficulties.  There is no use in people who have control over certain organisations condemning the Government, while failing themselves to make any constructive contribution to the solution of our problems.  If that is what we are to be up against, we will not get any place.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to make, which must have been considered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his predecessors, is the question of friendly nations who purchase our goods.  When friendly nations purchase our goods, we should not purchase goods from any other country, if it can be avoided.  I do not think that we should deal with any country except those countries that are prepared to buy from us.  Certain pressure groups have from time to time tried to secure the import of certain products from countries with which we have no trade. That should not be tolerated at all.</P>
    <P>Any money available to the Government should be devoted towards the development of our export markets. Last night, I mentioned one industry at random, the whiskey industry.  It is one of the many products for which we have an export market.  If lack of money is responsible for our failure to put this product on foreign markets, then it is a matter to which serious attention should be given.  However, exporting companies should endeavour to help each other to sell their products abroad, as well as getting assistance from the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has given industrialists all the encouragement possible and has set up a special body to deal with their problems.  If this country is to survive, <Col N="583" /> these people will have to be helped; but they will have to give up blaming the Government for everything and will have to do something for themselves.</P>
    <P>Everyone here deplores unemployment. I have my own difficulties in County Dublin in regard to employment and emigration.  Every other Deputy here has the same.  Under Fianna Fáil, we have carried on housing schemes, made roads and built schools and hospitals.  We have reached the point where we will have to change there any more.  We have reached the point now where we will have to change our economy, if we are to survive, and we will have to do something that will give continual employment.  I have not much regard for these small factories that will keep people on for a week or two and then let them go when the home market is satisfied.  It is the same with relief schemes.  They are a stopgap to help us for a little while, but to the ordinary family, they mean only a little money for a month or two, and then back on the dole again.</P>
    <P>We all deplore the idea of a father leaving the country, having to leave his wife and family behind him and having to keep two houses.  We are anxious to see that as far as possible we should develop an economy here which will alleviate the distress existing among certain sections of our people.  Some people here have cures for all our ills. that they have cures for all our ills. They write to the papers and they speak outside.  There are certain people who are trying to say politically that they have a cure for the partition of our country.  The best way to get our country united is to build up our economy here.  If we can succeed in achieving a stable economic unit, it will be the best possible contribution towards ending Partition, and perhaps we will be able to influence the people in the North who are trying to keep away from us.</P>
    <P>The people outside, and especially those in the universities, who have an opportunity of studying our problems should concentrate their studies on ways to help the country's economy. More than any time in its past, the country needs to-day intelligent people <Col N="584" /> who will give a lead, soldiers of goodwill who will secure goodwill for us in friendly nations.  The greatest ammunition any country has is a spirit of goodwill, harmony and common understanding.  We should do anything we can to build up our goodwill with other countries, always bearing in mind that we will act honourably towards our own country.  We should endeavour to get the wholehearted co-operation of the people, get them to give up these votes of censure on the Government and give a lead themselves. The Government cannot work miracles.</P>
    <P>Last year in County Dublin we had a surplus of vegetables.  Some of them were ploughed into the ground by the market gardeners.  We found a few intelligent people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That shows what can be done.  Down through the ages, the great individuals responsible for improving their own countries economically and politically have left something for posterity to study.  We in Fianna Fáil are doing our best and I am confident that we will succeed in bringing the country back to where it was when we were defeated by misrepresentation in 1948.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is the tail-end of what will go down in history in this country as the infamous famine Budget of 1957.  We now see the full extent of the insane financial policy embarked on by the Minister for Finance last year.  This last year has been one of the blackest in our history.  The same Budget of last year gave the working people of Ireland no hope and was directly responsible for almost 60,000 of our people emigrating.  An economic policy, if it is to be sane, must be reckoned in terms of human beings.  The overall loss to our nation has been irreparable. The Government is supposed to be <Col N="585" /> representative of the people and if that is so, its policy will be reflected in the economic conditions in which we live and will also work in the interests of the people.  If, on the other hand, a Government, though supposed to be representative of the people, has a policy reacting to the detriment of the people, it is natural to assume that such a Government is not in fact representative of the people but of the vested interest group.</P>
      <P>Look at the structure of our society to-day.  Need we ask of whom is the Government representative, of the people of Ireland or of the vested interest group, when we have 90,000 unemployed every year and almost 40,000 or 50,000 people emigrating? That answers the question.  Away back in 1940, the Minister for Supplies said the existence of large numbers of unemployed for long periods, through no fault of their own, was the acid test of any system of Government, commerce or finance.  If within the present system we cannot cope with unemployment, he said, the system must go. How does that sound to members of the Fianna Fáil Party after almost 20 years?  How can they account for the brutal system which gives us 90,000 idle every year and 40,000 or 50,000 forced to emigrate through sheer economic necessity?</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly asked the Taoiseach in this House what he intends to do to bring about an end to mass unemployment and up to date I have got no satisfaction, nor has the Taoiseach given any indication that he intends to bring about an end of mass unemployment.  I now ask the Taoiseach again, or the Minister, if he will tell us and tell the people what he intends to do to bring about an end to mass unemployment, and more important, when he intends to do it?  Let him say if he has a plan for full employment and when he intends to put the plan into operation, or does the Taoiseach still prefer to remain silent on the question of unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party is to be a continuation of the disastrous policies which have been pursued for the past 30 years, will the Taoiseach not now agree that the <Col N="586" /> Party system and Party jobbery have been the main factors in bringing about the damaging situation whereby economic policies, instead of being far-reaching and intelligent, have been merely tools of vote-catching politicians?</P>
    <P>I feel that the working people of Ireland are now ready and more than willing to play their part sincerely, if given an example by those in high places.  The time has come when we of this generation must rid ourselves once and for all of the seeds of dissension sown by the civil war and nourished by the bickerings of the politicians ever since.  We of this generation have grown tired of living in the past: we want the future for ourselves and for our children.  It is time the Taoiseach, if he has a spark of honour left in him, resigned.  He should get out of this House; he is &ldquo;washed-up&rdquo;.  He should give us in this generation a chance to provide for the future of ourselves, our wives and our children.</P>

      <P>It is customary for the debate on the Vote on Account to bring from the Government an outline of future policy and customary for the Minister for Finance who introduces the Vote, to give the Dáil and the country an idea of what Government policy will be; but, judging from the Minister's speech and from the speeches of those who have spoken from Government Benches, it is now clearer than ever that the Government are completely bankrupt of any policy whatever.  There was no statement of policy on agriculture, on the language, on emigration or on unemployment. There was nothing but the hoisting of the white flag, evidence of despair and complete evidence of surrender in any attempt to formulate, or consider formulating, future policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we hear the member for County Dublin, Deputy Burke, saying that his Party always honoured their promises, it is time to examine briefly their record.  Deputy Burke singled out the year 1932 and said that from that year they had honoured the promises they made.  I should like to remind Deputy Burke and every other Deputy who <Col N="587" /> feels the Fianna Fáil Party has honoured its promises since then, of three promises clearly and distinctly made by the present Taoiseach at that time.  I fail to see where there is any stim of honour left, in so far as the fulfilment of these promises is concerned. One of these was that they would bring back the emigrants from the United States, that there would be so much work here that they were sending out invitations to every Irish emigrant who ever went to the United States or Canada to come home.</P>
    <P>He went on to say&mdash;and I am sure it was in Athlone he made the statement&mdash;that traffic in the provincial towns would come to a standstill between 12 and 1 p.m. every day because there would be so many people working in the factories.  That promise was not fulfilled.  Another statement was that no man was worth more than £1,000 a year and no man would get more.  Long forgotten are the days of 1932 when those baits were successfully thrown out to catch votes.  Again, we had the 1932 promise that the Seanad would be abolished, because it was too great a burden on the taxpayers. The Taoiseach abolished it right enough, but he brought it back three months later.  These were some of the promises made, some of the baits held out, in 1932, to which Deputy Burke has made no reference.</P>
    <P>We do not have to dwell to any great extent on years long past: we can come closer, to the past 12 months. Everybody knows that it is a waste of time for the Minister for Finance, for the Taoiseach or for any Minister to say that the people gave them a blank cheque at the last general election.  The people did no such thing.  Certain promises were made at the last general election.  Not only were promises made, but pledges of honour to carry them out were given from every platform in every constituency. Promises were made in every constituency to suit the best-thinking and most attractive elements of the electorate.  For example, in the large provincial towns and cities, the Fianna Fáil Party devoted all their promises to the provision of full-time employment <Col N="588" /> for every person who was able and willing to work.  They guaranteed the provision of full-time employment. They condemned bitterly any policy whereby there would be any unemployment. There is no use in saying that there were no promises.  There was a promise made that, when a change of Government took place, there would be 100,000 new jobs available and that every unemployed person would be put into productive full-time employment, with good wages and a good standard of living.</P>
    <P>The chief worry of the present Tánaiste at the time was the fact that there were not sufficient wages going into the pockets of the working-class people.  In Castlecomer, County Kilkenny, when he was endeavouring to secure victory in the by-election for Deputy Medlar, he said that the new Government must at once stimulate employment by the institution of a capital investment programme designed to put men to work, to put wages in their pockets, so that those wages would be spent in the shops and so that the whole national economy would get a boost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement made by the Tánaiste at Castlecomer, County Kilkenny, on 24th February, 1957, and published in detail in the <i>Irish Press</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 25th February.  That speech certainly impressed the low wage earner and the large number of unemployed miners in, that area.  His speech was given such publicity in the papers the following day that it must have impressed every unemployed person in the country.  It was a promise given to put wages into the pockets of the workers, which would, in turn, benefit the shopkeeper.  The shopkeeper thought that, if there was a change of Government, his shop doors would not be wide enough, that he would have to take on extra hands and erect new shelves to hold the additional goods that he would require, following that statement in Castlecomer, that there would be such a boost, following a <Col N="589" /> change of Government, that it would provide full-time employment and put big money in the pockets of the wage-earners which would benefit every shop in the country.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the shopkeepers; I sympathise with the workers; I sympathise with the unemployed; I sympathise with those who have fallen for that false promise; but while all sides of the House appear to sympathise with sincere efforts to provide work for those who cannot get it, it must be borne in mind that the people had had previous lessons of Fianna Fáil's promises, prior to the last general election, and that Fianna Fáil deceived the people previously because of their lack of policy and lack of initiative and drive to formulate a policy and, while we sympathise with those who are now disappointed, it is extremely difficult to be sorry for people who have deliberately voted themselves into the position in which they now find themselves.</P>
      <P>We enjoy great freedom in this country.  We enjoy the freedom to elect a Parliament through the secrecy of the ballot box and if we want to elect a Government of responsible, intelligent people, we can do so.  If we want to elect a Government of duds, we are free people and we can do so.  If we want to elect a Government that we know can make false promises and that deliberately deceive the people and make hard beds for them, we are a free people and there is nothing to stop us from voting for such a Government.  If we want a Government that will provide full-time employment, that will improve agriculture and the living standards of all our people, as free people, at the elections, we can do so.  The people get the Government they deserve.  In the long run, that is the summing up of the position.  I have said in this House on many occasions that if the people sow nettles, they cannot expect roses to grow.  That is the position.  The electorate deliberately sowed nettles at the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the provision of full-time employment, as outlined by the Tánaiste at Castlecomer, I ask the House to consider the present position. There is a cut of £174,000 in the provision <Col N="590" /> for the building of schools and a cut of £700,000 in the provision for housing grants.  How do the Government reconcile the speeches made prior to the election with the cutting down of funds for school building and housing? We have heard a great deal of sympathy expressed for the Gaeltacht and the people there.  There is a reduction of £27,000 in the provision for Gaeltacht housing.  The reduction in these grants means that there will be fewer people employed in the building trade and less money in circulation.</P>
    <P>That does not worry the Tánaiste. What he said in Castlecomer is of no concern to him now.  He is gratified and overjoyed at the success of his speech there, which he knew at the time was a means of tricking the people into voting for his candidate.  The speech has served its purpose.  It was a good speech, from that point of view. It was a clever speech, cutely designed and deliberately uttered, with the full design and intention of hoodwinking the electorate and it must be given first prize as an outstanding success.  Unfortunately, the ribbon of success must go to the Tánaiste, but failure, despair and want are the results for those who were listening to him.</P>
    <P>I can remember distinctly that, on the border of my own constituency at Graiguecullen, quite convenient to Carlow, Deputy Lemass, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, made a further speech.  On that occasion when he spoke at Graiguecullen on the 11th November, 1956, he referred to the fact that he had published on behalf of Fianna Fáil proposals for a full employment policy designed to secure that in five years capital investment would be extended until jobs were available for every boy and girl leaving school as well as for those who were unemployed.  Therefore, he went a little further with the joke at Graiguecullen than he did at Castlecomer. At Castlecomer he dealt with the unemployed and wages but in Graiguecullen he appealed to the boys and girls, to the younger element, saying that in five years there would not be a single one of them that would not be in full productive employment and that there would be jobs available <Col N="591" /> for all.  Then he tells us there were no promises made.  The Government tells us there were no promises made and the Minister for Agriculture says they had a blank cheque from the electorate.</P>
    <P>One of those five years expired last Tuesday.  There are four remaining and the steps that were taken to provide employment in the first of the five years must certainly be looked upon as a step backwards, not forward. Forestry work is at a standstill, which means additional unemployment.  Bord na Móna works in the Midlands in the immediate vicinity of Deputy Egan's home are closed down and hundreds have been paid off.  Bog development works have been completed and Local Authorities (Works) Act schemes abolished.  County councils are taking on fewer road works.  There are fewer people employed all round and a record number of unemployed registered in every town and village in Ireland.  In addition to that, the greatest number of emigrants that ever left Rosslare, Dún Laoghaire or the North Wall have left within the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why the present Government, after 12 months of failure in dealing with the problem of unemployment, having obtained office by this mean low trick, of promise and deceit, will not now admit that they cannot provide work, that they will not provide work and that unemployment must grow and grow.</P>
    <P>I do not know if many Deputies have had the experience in recent months of standing on Dún Laoghaire Pier and seeing the large queues particularly from the West of Ireland, from West Cork, parts of Kerry, Roscommon, Sligo and Donegal.  Many of these people leave, never to return. There is little use in speaking of emigration from the Midlands.  Not alone have workers emigrated from the Midlands in the last 12 months but we have experienced what we never experienced before in relation to emigration.  It was always the head of the family who went and sent home the weekly earnings in the form of a <Col N="592" /> money order.  Now not only the head of the family emigrates but entire families, mothers with babes in arms, little children clinging to their playthings and fathers of families steering them before him down the corridor into the mail boat.</P>
    <P>County councils, particularly the council in Offaly, have experience of more houses becoming vacant in the past 12 months than ever before because of entire families emigrating. I very frequently go out to Dún Laoghaire around 8.30 p.m.&mdash;I suppose people have their own strange fads&mdash; because I like looking at the mail boat. However, I do not like the heartrending scenes that take place there very frequently.  Recently when I was seeing a friend off on the mail boat who came home on a holiday, he told me of four emigrants who were on the boat home with him and who were from some place near Rosaviel in County Galway.  They were going home for a fortnight's holidays and they said it was pitiful that so many had to leave Ireland because work was so hard to find.  Nevertheless, he said they were still glad they were home last year to have the honour of putting &ldquo;Good old Dev&rdquo; back.  However, they were not too long in Rosaviel after the elections because to-day the same four men are employed in a big industrial concern on the outskirts of Leeds.</P>
    <P>Is that not an extraordinary mentality for people to have, that they will look upon the conditions in this country with despair, surrender, and depart, but still are glad to have the honour of putting &ldquo;Good old Dev&rdquo; back into office?  I suppose the Irish people have many peculiarities but the most expensive love&mdash;and I suppose all of us in this House have some experience of the use of that phrase from time to time&mdash;that has ever been experienced or ever will be experienced is the love the Irish people have for the present Taoiseach, because it has certainly cost them a lot.  It costs everyone who buys a pound of sugar a halfpenny more because they love him.  It costs every person much more to eat a loaf, because, in February, 1957, an ordinary two lb. loaf cost 9¼d.  To-day the same loaf costs 1/1½d.  The price of the stone <Col N="593" /> of flour in February, 1957, was 4/10. That has been increased to 7/- per stone by the people who were supposed to bring down the cost of living and who still say that the cost of living is not rising.  When they say these things publicly in this House, what do they say behind closed doors where nobody but their local cumann members can hear them?</P>
    <P>During the régime of the inter-Party Government, the price of the lb. of butter was 3/9.  That has been increased to 4/4 to-day because of the love of the Irish people for Éamon de Valera.  A packet of cigarettes cost 2/10 during the time of the inter-Party Government.  To-day it costs 3/-.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

      <P>I never got any of the Deputy's anyhow, I can assure him.  I did not reach the cigar stage yet.  I was not admitted to the cigar company yet and it is doubtful if I will enter it at this hour of my life, either. The price of the pint in February, 1957, was 1/4; it is now 1/5, despite the fact that in Dublin and elsewhere we had the Fianna Fáil people speaking very loudly about the poor man's pint.  During the last election, the impression was created that if Fianna Fáil got back into office, the brewing and distilling industries would get a fillip and the price of the pint, in addition to that of beer and spirits, would be reduced.  Petrol cost 4/7½d. per gallon during the time of the inter-Party Government; it is now 5/- per gallon.  We have all those charges piled on the burden of the housewife. It is the housewife who has to bear the brunt of increases in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing all that in mind, you had the meanest possible type of theft performed during the past 12 months when a Bill was passed in this House, whereby hospital charges on the <Col N="594" /> poorest of the poor were increased to 10/- per day by the deliberate action of the present Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>If they have not got a medical card, they are supposed to pay 10/- per day, whereas they paid only 6/- per day during the term of office of the inter-Party Government. To raid the pockets of the sick, the semi-invalid and those in ill-health was the lowest form of theft.  I think it was wrong, uncalled for and unnecessary. It certainly was not in accordance with any of the many promises made.</P>
      <P>The cost of living was the main topic of debate from every Fianna Fáil platform at the last election.  You cannot divorce the cost of living from both unemployment and emigration.  It would be worth while in relation to the cost of living, unemployment and emigration to compare the pre-election speeches with the performance of the Government during the past 12 months. Deputies who made promises at the last general election are very silent upon them to-day.</P>
      <P>Instead of Opposition Deputies making speeches in this House, I have a feeling that it would be much better if we invited the Fianna Fáil Deputies to speak at every chapel gate in the country from now on.  I think that if we are sincere on this side of the House, all of us, the Labour Party, the farming representatives and the Fine Gael Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to speak on unemployment, emigration and the cost of living.  I want to go further than that and speak on unemployment in that area, where the local tile factory is on the verge of closing.  Other drawbacks have been experienced in that part of the constituency during the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>With regard to business, is it not well known that every shopkeeper, whether he is a grocer, a draper or a hardware merchant, and particularly if he is a publican&mdash;somebody told us that, in Bray, the public houses have to close down at 6 o'clock in the evenings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not exaggerate about Wexford.  A statement has been made by a Deputy, representing Wexford, to the effect that a shop connected with the licensed trade has to close down before closing time.  The owner of a licensed premises was always glad to evade the law to keep open as late as he could, while he had a customer, and no blame to him.  I am not asking that the law should be broken in that respect.  Here we see that those interested in conducting licensed premises have customers on Friday and Saturday, but they must close down for the rest of the week. <Col N="596" /> There is no business in the licensed trade.  The very same applies to shopkeepers. The volume of business transacted in the drapery or hardware or provision line is not what it was 12 months ago.  In so far as the provision of capital is concerned, everybody knows there is not the same stir of money as even 12 months ago.  Therefore, the owners of business premises who were expecting the boost to which Deputy Lemass referred in Castlecomer are sadly disappointed.</P>
      <P>Let us hear from the Government what they intend to do about these matters.  They are a very important aspect of policy.  What will be done to stimulates more business in business houses for the circulation of more money?  What will be done about the promises made to wage-earners before the election so far as a decent wage and a proper standard of living are concerned?  Having regard to the fact that business is at a standstill, surely it must be within the full knowledge of the Government that at the present time the banks will not allow business people to carry overdrafts?</P>
      <P>I am sure I am voicing the opinion of most Deputies who have experience of activities in rural Ireland when I say that if a small farmer or even a small business man asks to-day for money in a bank the position is that a thief with a &ldquo;six-shooter&rdquo; in his hand would be more welcome.  Due to Government policy, there is less money in circulation and certainly there is less money in the pockets of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old Fianna Fáil policy has come out in its true colours in the past 12 months.  They have always been singing the tune that the people were living too well and looking too well, that they were eating too much, living beyond their means and spending too much. I have here a newspaper report of a recent speech by the Minister for Lands, who makes a very busy man of himself.  He speaks more than all the Ministers put together.  However, he could not speak loud enough to have his own Estimate for the coming financial year increased because it is down considerably.  It would seem that the Minister for Lands does not speak <Col N="597" /> where he should speak&mdash;at the Government and Cabinet meetings.  He had this to say at the Dublin University Commerce and Economics Society meeting, as reported in the daily Press of the 1st March, 1958, under the heading: &ldquo;Had Been Living In Make-Believe World&mdash;Mr. Childers&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the past 11 years they had been living to a considerable extent in a convenient, make-believe world. They had got happiness in motor cars, wireless sets and other amenities.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the line taken by the Minister for Lands recently in Dublin.  He seemed to think that those who are fortunate enough to have a wireless set, those who have a motor car and those who, through their own hard work, skill and industry, have any comfort should not enjoy these amenities.  He was very much disturbed and annoyed about the matter.  It was against the grain of the wishes of the present Government that anyone should have anything but rags, sackcloth, hard times, tough times, dry bread, crusts, unemployment and long queues outside labour exchanges and the farmers beggared, paupered and driven into the workhouses.</P>
      <P>I was told in the county registrar's office in Portlaoise this morning that, since the appointment of the present county registrar, there were never so many sheriff's decrees down.  Shopkeepers cannot wait for money.  Business people cannot wait for money. Process servers, sheriffs and bailiffs are the only people in full-time employment to-day.  They are concentrating all their energies on the people on the land in order to drive them off it and make things harder and tougher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On top of all this, there is a reduction in the price of wheat which may be a reduction of 6/- a barrel but it may go to 12/- a barrel when the harvest comes.  During the last election, Fianna Fáil promised the barley-growers in my constituency&mdash;Deputy N. Egan will be glad to hear of this as there is a good malthouse in Banagher: I love to refresh <Col N="598" /> his memory&mdash;not the 40/- a barrel which Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture gave them&mdash;that would not be sufficient in the eyes of Fianna Fáil, they said&mdash;but 45/- a barrel, if they were elected to office.  The change of government came and the barley-growers are still waiting for the promised 45/- a barrel for barley.  The sad position is that they have not now even the 40/- a barrel which Deputy Dillon gave them when he was Minister for Agriculture.  The price per barrel for barley has now been reduced to 37/-.</P>
    <P>I shall be interested to hear the explanation which Deputy N. Egan will give the barley-growers next Sunday week at Banagher.  I shall be interested to hear an explanation as to why the barley-growers were promised 45/- a barrel for barley at a time when they were receiving 40/- a barrel for it under the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, and why now there has been a reduction of 3/- in that price of 40/- a barrel so that, under the present Government, the barley-growers are receiving not the 45/- a barrel which they were promised but 37/- a barrel.</P>
    <P>Not alone have the prices of barley and wheat been drastically reduced but the price of grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; pigs is down by 5/- a cwt.  Where you have good barley ground in barley production, and usually where you have maltings, you have industries in which barley producers are always interested such as pig feeding.  I am sure the pig feeders of Banagher, Shannonbridge, Shannon Harbour, Ferbane, Clonbullogue and Belmont, particularly, will be interested to hear from Deputy N. Egan why the Government has not seen to it that the price of grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; pigs which was guaranteed by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture should not drop by 5/- per cwt.</P>
    <P>A cut in barley and wheat prices, the price for pigs down by 5/- a cwt. and the fact that bailiffs, sheriffs and process-servers are working overtime will soon drive the farmers back to where they were when Deputy Smith was Minister for Agriculture some years ago and to where they were when Fianna Fáil's Minister for Agriculture <Col N="599" /> conducted the economic war that beggared the majority of our farmers, that put them into debt, want and hardship to such an extent that many of their families have not since recovered from the severe damage done to them by that war.  I heard Fianna Fáil condemn the old Cumann na nGaedheal policy.  I was not so active in the public life of this country at the time to recollect fully all the old Cumann na nGaedheal policy.  However, I recollect that its policy was that our greatest export was cattle and every encouragement was given to our people to sponsor and foster our cattle trade.  It was completely cried down by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Is it not quite evident that the difficulties brought about as a result of the balance of payments problem&mdash;to which no Government can close its eyes but must take efficient steps to rectify &mdash;can best be overcome, in our case, by the export of cattle?  Fianna Fáil can claim no credit whatever for any achievements as a result of cattle exports, because it was their policy all down through the years to discredit and discourage the raising of cattle for export.  They always looked upon the man who raised cattle for export as unwanted in farming society.  He was looked upon with a certain amount of suspicion and disgust.  Where were we but for the exports of cattle?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, who is in the House now, can convey this to the Minister for Finance.  I say that the greatest achievement of any Government since this State was founded was in the 1948 Trade Agreement, brought about by Deputy Dillon and the inter-Party Government.  Where would this country be to-day but for the millions and millions put into the pockets of the Irish farmer through the 1948 Trade Agreement?  The country was sunk long ago but for that agreement. I want to warn the present Government that, in whatever negotiations are going on with regard to agriculture and free trade, there is a bounden duty on Ireland's representatives at any free trade conferences to see that whatever happens the terms of the 1948 <Col N="600" /> Trade Agreement will be held steadily and firmly.</P>
    <P>That agreement was an outstanding achievement.  I feel that the majority of our farmers do not realise the tremendous benefits which flowed from it. Not alone did it put millions into the Irish farmers' pockets but the Irish farmer passed it on to his farm worker and it went into the shops, to the business people and on into business circulation. I hope and trust that the terms of the 1948 Trade Agreement will be always protected and cherished, because the Irish farmer could not have better security or firmer security than to be linked up with the prices of live stock in Great Britain&mdash;that is to say, if the price of cattle is raised in the British market and if the English farmer is to benefit, it follows that the Irish farmer will benefit also.</P>
    <P>Whilst the Fianna Fáil policy and programme are to condemn and criticise all actions and works of Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture, I say here and now&mdash;and I challenge contradiction from any member of the House&mdash;that the greatest achievement since this State was founded was the 1948 Trade Agreement.  Not a single member of Fianna Fáil has given credit to Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture for that proud and pleasant state of affairs, which has brought tens of thousands of pounds into the pockets of the Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>When we speak of the price of barley and the price of wheat, I do not want to let the opportunity pass without reminding Deputy Kieran Egan&mdash;who owes his seat in this House to wheat, as one of the five wheat Deputies&mdash;that on Sunday week he will have a contribution to make on wheat.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan on wheat, on the 2nd December, 1954, at column 1565, of Volume 147:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Three hundred thousand tons of dried wheat are, I think, as near as can be to two-thirds of our requirements.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what Deputy Dr. Ryan said. I presume this is an accurate and true account of every syllable uttered by Deputy Dr. Ryan on that occasion.  We do not have to quote Deputy Dr. Ryan on wheat, because there are many other celebrities in Fianna Fáil who can be quoted.  Attention has been directed already here to the fact that the same Deputy Dr. Ryan was speaking over Radio Éireann on February 25th, 1957, in his election broadcast and he described the 1954 cut in wheat as &ldquo;cruel and unjust&rdquo;.  That is what he said about it, that it was &ldquo;cruel and unjust&rdquo;.  The farmers were listening. Whether the present Minister for Lands likes it or not, the farmers have wireless sets, although it annoys him and worries him that they are sufficiently well off to have them.  They were listening to Deputy Dr. Ryan on the 25th February crying bitterly and sadly.  Afterwards, he was laughing at how he had pulled it off, how they fell for it and how it sounded coming over the air.  They were lovely words to hear over the air&mdash;&ldquo;cruel and unjust&rdquo;&mdash;particularly when referring to wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said there would be a remunerative price fixed for crops such as wheat, giving the farmer to understand that when he, Deputy Dr. Ryan, said it was &ldquo;cruel and unjust&rdquo; that was a safeguard against a further cut in wheat. The farmers said: &ldquo;We can put two and two together; he did not actually tell us he was going to give back 82/6 a barrel for wheat, but it is as good as <Col N="602" /> that; he said the cut was cruel and unjust and when he gets back this is, at any rate, a guarantee over the radio, in his own voice; we will take the chance and put him back into office, in the hope of getting 82/6 a barrel&rdquo; I sympathise with them.  They fell for it.  They asked for it, but they did not get it this time.</P>
    <P>I want to get back now to the present Minister for Lands.  When Fianna Fáil were in office he was on most of the Fianna Fáil committees.  In other words, he was the Party coroner who held inquests into every item submitted for examination to see whether there was a failure when the inter-Party Government was in office.  This political coroner spoke as a member of the Fianna Fáil agricultural committee and addressed the Ard Fheis of Fianna Fáil in 1956.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The biggest problem of all was to convince farmers that if they produced more prices would not go down drastically.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what he said when he was a political coroner for Fianna Fáil and an active member of the Fianna Fáil Agricultural Committee.  That is what he said at the Ard Fheis&mdash;that the biggest problem of all was to convince farmers, mind you, that if they produce more prices will not go down. What happened?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Drastically&rdquo;. It is a very important word because that is what did happen.  Prices did go down drastically.  Whether they went down drastically or modestly they went down; they did not go up.  I want to place on record that while farmers are asked to work harder and produce more, there is clear evidence that it is the present Government's policy that the harder they work and the more they produce the less they will get for this produce.  That refers not alone to wheat; it refers also to barley, pigs and to practically everything that comes off the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask what encouragement has the farmer to work hard to-day?  What encouragement has the staunchest, <Col N="603" /> most patriotic Fianna Fáil farmer, who loves to grow wheat because he feels, if he is Fianna Fáil, he is pleasing the Taoiseach and the Government to do so, or what encouragement is there to work harder in any capacity to-day? We are told to work hard and produce more and get less for it.  That is clearly the position, particularly as far as wheat, pigs and barley are concerned. The present Government have come a long way in 12 months in beggaring and making paupers of the farmers.  I venture to say that if there was a general election in a month's time the present Government would be swept, bag and baggage, out of office forever.</P>
    <P>The reason and the evidence as to why that should happen is only too clear.  I was present in a place called Mountcollins in West Limerick and while there I distinctly heard the present Minister for Agriculture speaking from the steps of the graveyard&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;after Mass in Mountcollins.  He said it was the duty of any Government who had the interests of the dairy farmer at heart to see that they were given a substantial increase in the price per gallon for milk.  However, the script which he gave to the Press reporter was a little different.  He did not put it as bluntly in the script as he actually said it but he gave every farmer in Mountcollins to understand that if Fianna Fáil were once back in office, so far as milk prices were concerned, they were sure&mdash;as sure as they saw him in Mountcollins&mdash;to get a substantial increase in the price per gallon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What did they get?  One penny per gallon less.  Therefore we see that as well as milk producers, wheat growers, and barley growers every section of the agricultural community has been attacked and brutally assaulted.  Every effort is being made to deprive them of a decent standard of living.  The grants made available for cow-byres is being halved.  I want to add my voice to the protests that have been made. I have noted, as other Deputies have, <Col N="604" /> that a number of farmers have signified their intention, as a protest against the decrease in the price of milk, not to participate in the scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  I deplore that attitude.  I hope that no sensible farmer will follow that course. I hope that no sensible association no matter how genuine or sincere they may be in their protest, will resort to such action.  I hope that, in their own interests, owners of herds will resort to some other means of making their protests felt and heard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>They can march but I think their protest is ill-advised if they are to be asked not to participate in the scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis because the day is coming very speedily when no beast will be allowed into Britain unless it carries a tuberculosis free certificate. Nobody can say that that is not right and proper.  I hope that in the interests of this country, in the interests of the high standard of all our live stock and in the interests of the farmers themselves they will give every support and co-operation even though they have got no lead from the Government.  The Minister for Agriculture himself stated recently in public that even though this scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis was commenced some years ago by the inter-Party Government he himself had not got his own cattle attested under that scheme.  I think that is a bad headline for any Minister for Agriculture to set because any Deputy who wants to set a headline to his constituents will be the first to avail of any scheme for the benefit of the community in general.</P>

      <P>Very well, Sir. I presume that many weeks will not pass until the Agriculture Estimate <Col N="605" /> will be before us and we will have an opportunity of hearing more on this subject from the Minister for Agriculture, particularly with regard to his own dairy herd.  In my opinion, the farming community are facing hard, tough, bad times.  It is commonly known that when the farmer is well off, and when agriculture is thriving, everybody is well off and everybody seems to have a stir of money. That has been my experience and the experience of every Deputy.  There is no better spender than the farmer and no more decent man than the farmer. Because of the Government's agricultural policy, the farmer is not in that happy position to-day.</P>
      <P>We hear speeches from members of the Fianna Fáil Party with regard to wheat, but some facts must be borne in mind by Deputies of that Party, particularly by Deputy Kieran Egan, one of the five wheat Deputies.  Fianna Fáil brag and boast about being the Party that encouraged wheat and started wheat growing.  Let us examine the position closely.  Let us give Fianna Fáil all the credit they like to have for encouraging wheat growing, but, under Fianna Fáil, the wheat growers secured six, seven or eight barrels to the acre.  Who changed the position for the betterment of wheat growers in this country?  Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, saw to it that ground limestone was made available. I did not hear him, but I presume he pointed out to this House yesterday evening that when he took office, there was not a thimbleful of ground limestone in the country.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister for Education will agree that, if the ruling of the Chair is for me, it is also for him.  We will obey the Chair.  I want to draw the attention of the House to this aspect of agricultural policy.  Did any member of the Fianna Fáil Party during the course of this debate say that the inter-Party Government, when they were in office, did any one thing that was of benefit to the agricultural community?  In addition to the 1948 Trade Agreement being one of our greatest achievements, there was another great achievement of ours in the fact that, due to the land rehabilitation scheme, sponsored and begun by the inter-Party Government, we have 1,000,000 acres of arable land now that we had not got before that scheme was started.</P>
      <P>If we read in the papers that a Government in Holland, or any other country abroad, had initiated a scheme making 1,000,000 acres of additional land available to produce food for man and beast, and to yield bountiful return, would we not say that it was a marvellous Government and that they were great people.  When that has happened at home, when we can see that our national wealth has been substantially increased by the addition of 1,000,000 acres of land, it is a wonderful achievement about which we should never stop congratulating ourselves.  Because of the envy and disgust of the Fianna Fáil Party, they are prevented from paying a tribute to the scheme which brought that great addition to our national wealth, a scheme that was launched by the inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>Among our other great achievements was the parish plan which provided advisory services for the farmers on their own farms.  That is an achievement for which the inter-Party Government can claim credit and which has brought untold benefits in its own way to the farming community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to refer to the fact that if our farmers and people in general are asked to produce more, we must ask ourselves one question: what means of credit will be placed at the disposal of these producers in order to assist them to produce more?  We have only two means by which credit can be made available to increase production.  One is by loan from the banks on security, and the other is to have recourse to the loan machinery available through the medium of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. It is not common sense to ask our people, particularly our farmers, to produce more, unless there is some means by which we can give them capital to produce more.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to produce more from the land, in order that the farmer will carry more stock, in order that additional land will be broken up and put under the plough, additional capital should be made available.  It is the duty of the Government to tell us what is their policy on the provision of capital for farmers and others to increase production.  Over a 30 year period, the Agricultural Credit Corporation issued a total of 47,000 loans, of which less than 45,000 were for £500 or under.  For sums between £500 and £1,000, they issued 1,766 loans while loans bigger than £1,000 totalled 555.  These figures are for the 28 years between 1928 and 1956.  This means that, of a total of around 200,000 farmers who are deriving most of their livelihood from the land, only one-fifth have ever applied or received a loan from any Government or semi-Government concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know quite well that merchants find farmers honest to a very high degree.  Bad debts between them are few and far between.  On this Vote on Account we should hear from the Government what steps they propose to take in the critical period that lies ahead for the farming community to <Col N="608" /> help them to increase production and what steps they propose to take to make money available to them at a low rate of interest for investment in their land.  The farming community in general is looking to the Government to give a lead.  This year, I venture to say, we shall have as much land under tillage as we have ever had.  In many areas, additional land is being put under the plough because of the inability of farmers to buy stock and to keep stock on the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I was merely endeavouring to obtain from the Minister what Government policy is in relation to credit facilities for farmers to enable them to increase production.  If we are to have more cattle for export, the farmers must be provided with the wherewithal to buy stock.  That is a major point of policy. It is one of the utmost importance and there should be a statement of Government policy on that matter.</P>
      <P>I bow to your ruling in that regard, but I must refer to the fact that the Minister for Finance saw fit in Wexford recently to offer belittling and insulting criticism of the National Farmers' Association.  A word of encouragement and a pat on the back would have been better, coming from a Minister for Finance, and would have been more welcome than belittling criticism.  I do not always agree 100 per cent. with the National Farmers' Association, but they are a very important representative body.  They are a negotiating body.  They are the link between the farmers and the Department of Agriculture.  I think that the Minister's statement was made deliberately in an effort to divide and break up the National Farmers' Association.</P>

      <P>The Minister is responsible for making that speech and it was a speech that would have been better left unmade.  I should like from <Col N="609" /> the Government a statement on rural electrification.  We were led to believe at the general election that rural electrification was to go full steam ahead. We were told from public platforms by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his henchmen that not alone would rural electrification go full steam ahead, but it would progress more rapidly, more efficiently and give more employment than under the inter-Party Government.  I distinctly heard that statement being made.  I hope Deputy Egan, who is easing his tie, is not choking when he listens to me because he is one of those who were very vocal on rural electrification.  I expected the Minister for Finance to make some statement in that regard, because here on 21st May the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated that the estimated 60 new areas would be completed in the year 1957-58.  He has given no explanation to the House for the slowing down of rural electrification.</P>

May I place this on record now and may I ask the Minister for Education to remind the Minister for Finance, when he is replying, to make some reference to the deliberate slowing down of rural electrification?  Is it Government policy to stop rural electrification?  Is it Government policy to slow it down?  Or is it Government policy to reach the target of 100 areas a year?  That is a simple question to address to the Minister for Finance with special reference to Government policy.</P>

      <P>I cannot claim to be as familiar with procedure as you, Sir.  I am asking for a statement of Government policy on rural electrification. So far, we have not had any <Col N="610" /> statement of policy.  I trust it will be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>A debate such as this should not be allowed to pass without comment on the statement made by the Minister for Lands with regard to the erection of houses and hospitals and their part in providing employment for our people and keeping our people at home.  The Minister for Lands spoke in Kilbeggan. He said that millions had been wasted in the vain hope that building houses and hospitals would keep our people at home.  Does the Minister for Lands or the Minister for Finance hold that the millions spent by the inter-Party Government on hospitals and houses were millions spent in vain?  I should be glad to be associated at any time with the spending of money on hospitals and houses for our people.</P>
      <P>There has been no repudiation or contradiction by any member of the Government of the statement made by the Minister for Lands.  He did not finish his speech at Kilbeggan in that tone.  He went on to say that far too much money was being spent on nonproductive services which provided little employment.  The Minister for Lands seems to look upon the building of houses and the provision of houses &mdash;in other words, the provision of work for our people&mdash;as a waste of public money and a waste of time on the part of the Government.  We shall be very glad to hear from him what contribution he has to make in so far as the putting into operation of the plans and promises he made before the general election is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say that there is a growing tendency on the part of the Government and, indeed, on the part of all Governments, to hand over a great deal of responsibility to different boards and committees?  We are asked on this Vote on Account to vote a substantial sum of money and I feel that there are many times when members of this Dáil are not given the opportunity of inquiring into every detail of public expenditure which we feel, as members of this House, we are entitled to get.  There have been many occasions in the past when Deputies have addressed questions to various Ministers asking how certain public moneys <Col N="611" /> voted by the House were spent and they have been given the reply that this was a matter for the everyday administration of the body given charge of the matter.</P>

He made particular reference to the export of whiskey.  It is only right that the Government should have an efficient and up to date organisation for the handling of our exports and for the finding of suitable markets for them, particularly in the United States.</P>
      <P>I am told by one very extensive merchant, who lives in Jackson Heights, New York, and who visits this country frequently in an effort to obtain supplies of frozen meat and fish and various other Irish goods which he is anxious to have displayed in his stores in New York, that the limited supplies available are no sooner displayed in his store windows in New York than they are immediately bought up.  I feel that contact with such business men in the United States is highly important because of their practical experience and their efficiency in selling products in the United States, and their advice and assistance should be more appreciated by Córas Tráchtála, or whatever other body is pushing the sale of Irish manufactured goods in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy <Col N="612" /> Burke that a good deal more can be done in pushing the sale of Irish whiskey in the United States, but whiskey comprises only a small part of our export trade.  Our main export is live stock and the Government should concentrate all its efforts on the building up of the cattle trade. That is the one trade which can pay very great and bountiful dividends.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke also asked for cooperation with the Minister for Agriculture and he deplored the fact that various county committees of agriculture had passed resolutions calling on the Minister to resign.  I think the county committees of agriculture know their own business best, and, if they find that they have no confidence in the Minister in charge of agriculture, they have a right to express their opinion. There is no better way of expressing an opinion than that which has been adopted by the different county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The outlook for the farming community, for the workers, for the manufacturers and for all sections of the Irish people is a bad and gloomy one. I think the only remedy is for those of us on this side of the House to arouse public opinion in the country so that the people will tell the Government to face up to their responsibility, that it is their duty and responsibility now to find a remedy. The Government now have an overall majority.  This House does not stand in their way.  If the Government have a progressive policy this House must adopt it because of the numerical strength of the Government Party. There is nothing to stop them now. There is no use talking about the past. The future is theirs and the present is theirs.</P>
    <P>It is their job and their responsibility to provide a remedy for the decline and distress of the past 12 months.  This Government were given a year's trial.  They failed miserably in that year.  If they cannot do better in the four years ahead, I feel that the outlook for the Irish people is bad, gloomy and disastrous.  I am sorry for the people and I am sorry for the Fianna Fáil Deputies who have to defend the actions of the Government. <Col N="613" /> It takes courage and grit and hard neck to do that, but I have no doubt that they have an abundance of the necessary hard neck.  For that reason, I feel it is the duty of this Opposition to bring home to the minds of the people their folly of 12 months ago. It is the duty of the Opposition, not alone to be determined and constructive, but to see that a Government fulfils its obligations to the people, and if they do not keep their promises, that their promises will appear before them with frequent reminders.  There is a day of reckoning coming for all of us.  It may be far away; it may be near.  There is a day on which the Government will have to answer for their deeds.  It may be far away; it may be near.  But there is nothing surer than that it will come, and all the better for the Irish people, the sooner it comes.</P>
    <P>Never in the history of this country was there such a game of fraud and trickery as was played in the last election, and the eyes of the Irish people have never been opened wider in horror and amazement than they have been to-day.  I hope they will stay open.  The people will get only the Government they ask for and they should not be deceived.  We on this side were not deceived.  We told the people what they would get and they have got it.  We are telling them now that blessed are they who expect nothing for they shall not be disappointed. I hope they are not expecting anything in the next four years from the Government because they will not get it.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude on the note that it is always best in Irish politics to be honest with the people.  I was always a believer in being honest with the people.  By being honest with the people, I was always placed at the head of the poll.</P>

      <P>Having regard <Col N="616" /> to the entire lack of a constructive policy for employment, for stemming emigration and increasing production, I suggest the Government are entirely bankrupt of policy.  Steps should be taken by the Government to come down to earth because the policy on which they have embarked during the past 12 months is one that has been concentrated more in the air than on the ground.  The ordinary men and women in the country, who have to work and earn their bread, are not concerned with aircraft, air lines or the extension of air services.  While there may be a lot to be said for those, first things should come first.</P>
      <P>The Government should concentrate their energies on the ordinary man in the street and see that a decent standard of living is provided for all sections of the community.  I want to join with my colleagues in severely censuring the Government.  They have failed in their job, failed the Irish people, mismanaged the affairs of the State and have driven the people into distress and poverty such as has never been known in the country's history.</P>

      <P>It is difficult on a debate like this to avoid making particular references, even though one must, according to the rules of order of the House. It is particularly difficult if one has to sit here for a period to get a chance to speak to avoid following suggestions and arguments made on one side or other of the House.  I propose to deal shortly with just a few general remarks and to refer, if I may, to something in particular before I conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman, when he opened the debate, made a short review of conditions leading up to the present situation and since he did so briefly, I think he was probably in order and therefore I might similarly be in order in making brief reference to these conditions. It must be admitted, as most Deputies who spoke on the opposite side have admitted, that when the present Government assumed office exactly a year ago to-day, I think, they had a clear mandate from the <Col N="617" /> people.  They were given an overall majority and that was because the people realised the situation had been reached when a Government with a sufficient majority should be given control of the country's affairs.</P>
    <P>The economic situation was extremely bad then, and in the minds of the people there was a clear realisation of the necessity to set the country back on a steady economic course and to right, as far as possible, the finances of the nation.  I think that was what Fianna Fáil promised to do initially. Charges have been made about breaches of election pledges, the breaking of all kinds of promises, but it is only natural that during an election campaign Fianna Fáil Deputies should have shown up as far as they could the deficiencies of the then Government, deficiencies which were apparent to the vast majority of the electorate and which were reflected in the way the people cast their votes.</P>
    <P>I should like to support what the Minister for Lands has said, and I have taken particular pains to check the references, that, by and large, the statements made by Fianna Fáil with regard to the task that faced any Government coming into power at that time, were to the effect that it would be a difficult task.  I am sure the people realised it would be an uphill fight and for that reason, even though the Government and the people might be disappointed at the progress to date, I believe the people are still patient and still hopeful that the signs of improvement which have been apparent in the past 12 months will continue and fructify in the future.</P>
    <P>The Irish people had long been influenced in their approaches to elections by political considerations.  Up to the late 1920's, the Civil War was a live issue&mdash;probably even later.  Subsequent to the accession of Fianna Fáil to power for the first time, much of our progress was of a political nature and that, I would submit, had the support of the majority of the people. There were certain and more significant economic advancements.  Then came the war with restrictions and rationing in its wake.  Shortly after the end of the war, the first inter-Party <Col N="618" /> Government gained office.  I suggest that by that time the progressive policy of Fianna Fáil from their accession to office up to the time they first left office had been generally accepted by all Parties in the State from the economic and social points of view.</P>
    <P>Many of the facets of progress in political, economic and social spheres were opposed by the then Opposition, but we are glad to note, and I think the country is pleased also, that the fundamental political aim of the nation is common to all sides of the House, with the result that I think I can rightly suggest that we now have a united country, politically, and if the people differ in supporting different political Parties, it is an economic difference influenced by our study of economic conditions and by the performances of the different Governments we have had.  That discriminating public decided, on economic considerations, to remove the former Government from office.  They assessed the existing conditions on the merits and they realised that the country 12 months ago was in a bad way.  For that reason, they decided to make a change.</P>
    <P>Before the previous Government left office, its members knew the country was in a bad way, and they knew that the people fully appreciated the position. They left office, and I use the word advisedly, even though it was suggested that it was because of the withdrawal of support by a small section of Deputies supporting them.  I suggest, if they wanted to continue in office, that, even with these defections, they still had a majority in the House; yet they complained they were removed from office before they had an opportunity of putting their programme into effect, before the fruits of their policy began to show the productivity that was bound to come.  That situation arose after a period of almost three years; now 12 months after the Fianna Fáil Government acceded to office in a serious situation like that, it is being pilloried and criticised because it has not fully restored the economic situation.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil faced a similar position <Col N="619" /> in 1951; not so serious perhaps, in some respects, because capital was more readily available in 1951 than it was at the end of 1956 and at the beginning of 1957.  Nevertheless, after two years, Fianna Fáil had been able to right the situation and able to mark the end of 1953 as a year of progress and recovery, a year that has been acknowledged as the best year economically the country has enjoyed since the end of the last war&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The advantages that were gained in 1953 were gained largely as a result of what has been described as the &ldquo;harsh, cruel and unnecessary&rdquo; Budget of 1952, a Budget which, according to the Opposition, involved unnecessary taxation to the extent of £10,000,000, an amount that could have been decreased in ten minutes.  Nevertheless, in 1954 to 1957, with the possible exception of the relief in the subsidy on butter, not one penny of that £10,000,000 appeared by way of benefit and not one aspect or item of the cruel hardships imposed by Fianna Fáil was removed by the Coalition Government in any of their Budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advantages that were gained were quickly lost and in 1956 we had a year in which unemployment had risen alarmingly.  By the end of that year the number on the live register had reached something in excess of 95,000.  What was more important was that there was almost a complete breakdown in the availability of capital.  Two National Loans had failed.  I will admit in respect of one of them that outside conditions influenced the success of the loan but the conditions of the previous loan which had not filled were much more favourable. The public did not subscribe to the extent that the then Minister for Finance thought they would or felt was necessary for the advancement of the capital programme of the State. <Col N="620" /> It was apparent, when the Government assumed office, that the people appreciated that they were faced with a difficult task which would not be easy to overcome.</P>
    <P>There have been charges made during the course of this debate against the present Government of holding up housing schemes.  During the latter part of 1955 and particularly the early part of 1956 we all know the difficulty local authorities had in having provided for them through the Local Loans Fund, through Government agency, the finances necessary for house building.  We know also that when the Government had left office many people who had entered into commitments under the Local Loans Fund had not got the necessary money wherewith to complete their houses or to pay their builders.  Rather than hold up housing schemes, it must be acknowledged that the present Minister for Agriculture, when he succeeded as Minister for Local Government, provided a substantial amount of money to make up the leeway that existed in the 1955-56 period.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan suggested, since the Minister for Lands has made some statement to this effect, that Fianna Fáil have decided that house building is not good economy.  The Minister for Lands mentioned that if we had been in a position to devote the capital moneys necessary for the building of houses, hospitals and roads to projects of a more productive nature, it would have made for more lasting employment in the country and would have been generally conducive to the economic advancement of the country inasmuch as continuous employment would have been made available.</P>
    <P>If £10,000,000 is spent on houses or on roads, it would take approximately something short of £1,000,000 to service that debt in one year and that £1,000,000, if devoted to more productive purposes, would probably provide employment for 250 or more people. Nevertheless, our economic difficulties in this respect exist and they are largely influenced&mdash;I shall not say entirely influenced&mdash;by our political history.  Unfortunately there were <Col N="621" /> many decades of neglect in regard to the provision of social amenities of all kinds.  Housing, hospitals, schools and roads were neglected and the new Free State Government and the Governments which followed had to pay particular attention to these matters.  They had, perhaps, to devote an undue proportion of the available capital to the remedying of the deficiencies in this respect.</P>
    <P>The house building programmes embarked upon in the 1930's and ever since, the hospital building programmes, the road making programmes involved the employment of a very big labour force.  The houses had to be completed at some stage and in many counties the targets which the local authorities set themselves have already been reached; their programmes have been finished.  In the bigger areas, the amount of building has been tapering off.</P>
    <P>The problem then arose: what were we to do with the big labour force that was employed on these various projects? Our capital had been sunk, I again say, in a rather disproportionate manner in these very desirable social projects and sufficient capital was not available for the continued employment of that labour force.  I think the previous Minister for Finance experienced that difficulty as much as, if not more than, any other Minister for Finance.  That is and for some time will continue to be our greatest economic difficulty.  It was born out of our political history and I, for one, do not regret the fact that our Governments, when they got the opportunity, did undertake the building of hospitals, houses and roads that were acutely necessary.  Anybody who is a member of a local authority and is faced with requests from people living in bad housing conditions for new houses or who was faced up to three or four years ago by people who had relatives suffering from T.B. for the provision of beds in T.B. hospitals, will not regret that such an amount of our capital resources was devoted over the years to these purposes.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the reference to the decreased provision for house building in the current year does not <Col N="622" /> indicate a fair-minded approach to what the facts are.  In many areas, particularly in my own constituency, in Dublin and elsewhere, the number of houses to be built is still very large. It has often been suggested that the amount of money available is not sufficient.  A peculiar position was reached in my own constituency last year when, of the £750,000 made available to the local authority for capital purposes, £30,000 remained unspent up to about a fortnight ago, with little prospect of that £30,000 being usefully utilised in the balance of the financial year.</P>
    <P>Perhaps steps have been taken since then to use up the balance of the £750,000 but the point I am making is that, apart from the few areas where there is still a big backlog in the number of houses to be provided, most of the local authorities either have reached their housing targets or are certainly nearing them.  Therefore, it is only reasonable to expect that the overall provision for houses will come down in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The main stress in this debate has been placed on the attack, as it has been described, on the farming community. Everybody knows that the taxpayer generally will, in existing circumstances, have to bear a considerable portion of the moneys earned by farmers for their production.  Deputy Costello, when he was speaking, mentioned that the levies which were taken off certain commodities in the past 12 months should have been left there in order to subsidise to a greater extent than at present the export of agricultural surpluses.  However, he qualified that very particularly.  He said they should be left there at least for a very short period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events, it is clear that Deputy Costello did not envisage extra taxation to provide the moneys to subsidise these surpluses. Not only did he not envisage extra taxation, but he advocated that if we were to achieve extra production, we would have to decrease taxation.  It would be interesting, therefore, to find out from Opposition Deputies how they would propose to make the moneys available to subsidise, without limit, our exportable surpluses of agricultural products.</P>
      <P>It is very significant that here in this House, at any rate, the Labour Party have been rather silent on what their remedy would be.  Nevertheless, Deputy Norton at a function at Naas, in Deputy Sweetman's constituency, which he was unfortunately unable to attend, said that this policy of exporting surpluses was a suicidal economic policy.  I can only conclude from that and the fact that we have not heard any direct contribution to the debate from the members of the Labour Party, that the Labour Party would not support the subsidisation of surplus agricultural products for export purposes. That is borne out by the fact that they failed to support the Fine Gael Party motion some couple of weeks ago. Therefore, it is pretty clear to the farmers that if the Coalition Government were still in power, they would have considerable difficulty in convincing them, as they appear to be trying to do now, that agricultural prices should be maintained, irrespective of surpluses.</P>

    <P>The charge has been made that increased production results either in decreased employment or lower prices for agricultural goods, but I should like to draw a distinction between increased production and increased productivity. If increased production will procure only a greater bulk of goods produced at the same unit cost, then increased production will serve very <Col N="624" /> little useful purpose, once the immediate local demand has been satisfied, but increased productivity should&mdash; and I think everybody will agree with this&mdash;result in reducing the unit cost of all commodities and, therefore, enable the producer, the manufacturer of these goods, to supply them on the market, whether it be the home market or the foreign market, at a lower cost and thus give him an opportunity of competing with more favourable prospects of success in that market.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything inconsistent with increased productivity and the maintaining of employment at the present level and ultimately increasing employment in certain industries.  As I said, if a man produces a manufactured article at a certain cost per unit, at a certain capital outlay, and if, by increased productivity, he can produce, with the same capital outlay, at the same cost, one and a half units of that manufactured commodity, he should be able to market it more cheaply and ultimately expand his production.</P>
    <P>Similarly with agricultural goods.  I am not setting myself up to be an expert, but I should like to refer to some figures quoted by Deputy Flanagan a few minutes ago when he boasted that as a result of Deputy Dillon's agricultural policy, the barrel production per acre of wheat increased from some six to 20 barrels in a short period.  I should like to refer him to the figures with which I have been supplied.  They indicate that the mill intake of barrels per acre which was 6.75 barrels in 1954-55 increased to only 8.3 by 1957-58.  However, whether it is an increase of six to 8.3 or six to 20, it would appear to me that if the farmer can increase his productivity, get more production out of his acreage, assuming that his capital and his costs remain the same, he should be able to market his produce more cheaply.</P>
    <P>I will admit that farming costs have increased over a number of years. Nevertheless, I would suggest that, as in the case of manufacturers who are trying by new methods, by more up-to-date techniques, to reduce their cost of production, similarly the farmers' more modern techniques, the application of <Col N="625" /> fertilisers and the consequent increase in output per acre, should enable them to sell more profitably and more cheaply.</P>
    <P>I shall not dwell on the question of wheat, but I should like to remark that, when the price per barrel of wheat was reduced from 82/6 to 70/- in the cereal year 1955-56, there were then 2,604,000 odd barrels produced. The following year there were some 2,781,000 barrels produced but, what is still more significant, is the fact that the number of barrels per acre delivered to the mills increased steadily over the period 1955-56 to 1957-58 from 7.27 to 8.3 barrels per acre, which is a clear indication that the farmers are getting more out of their wheat over that period.  As well as that, and despite the large cut made in 1954-55-56, there were more barrels per acre produced, if there was a slightly less acreage grown in the previous year.</P>
    <P>If wheat is to be produced beyond our consuming capacity to the extent that the surplus will either have to be exported, sold for animal feed or otherwise utilised profitably, the fact remains that the taxpayer will have to bear the cost of that burden.  If a higher grist of native wheat is put into our bread, it will mean an increase in the price of the loaf.  The amount of imported wheat now necessary to produce a loaf which appears palatable to the Irish people, is cheaper than the cost of our native wheat and thus contributes to the holding down of the price of bread whereas if we had to put more of our wheat into that bread it would inevitably increase the cost of the loaf.</P>
    <P>When we speak about the attack on the farmers' incomes by the decision on wheat made by the Government, one must also take into account that only 60,000 out of 380,000 farm holdings produce wheat apart altogether from the people who do not work in agriculture. All these people have to be taken into account as well.  The interest of the community as a whole must be the determining factor in the long run. I have gone into this matter more deeply than I intended.  Nevertheless, I think these facts ought to be remembered when people talk loosely <Col N="626" /> about the price of wheat and the attacks made on farmers' incomes.</P>
    <P>The point I commenced to make was that if, as appears to be the policy of the Labour Party, agricultural products which we produce to a surplus should not be subsidised by the taxpayer and if, as it appears from the former Taoiseach's statement, these should not, as a permanent measure, be subsidised either out of taxation, what then is the Opposition's objective suggestion as to how a surplus of wheat or a surplus of milk could be carried by the taxpayer in the coming financial year?  It would be interesting to know how they propose to finance these exportable surpluses.</P>
    <P>I said before&mdash;and I shall repeat it &mdash;that it is in the national interest to a certain extent that these things should be subsidised, particularly so in the case of exports of butter which is so much an issue now as an international economic matter.  Deputy Flanagan a while ago said that Fianna Fáil deplored the person who raised beef for export.  He seemed conveniently to forget that unless the dairy farmer was properly looked after, as he was down through the years by Fianna Fáil, we would have no beef for export. Everybody knows that the dairy farmer is the keystone of our agricultural economy.  Unless we have calves we shall not have cattle for export.  It would certainly be inconsistent for Fianna Fáil to denounce the raising of cattle for export.  We all know what we owe to it and all praise to Deputy Dillon and the other Minister for Agriculture for fostering the export of cattle.</P>
    <P>I would agree, however, with Deputies who say that we should aim at a higher rate of processing of our agricultural goods.  Exporting cattle on the hoof, while it might be profitable to a very large extent, could, I suggest, be still more profitable if we could process more and more of that beef at home.  It would provide not only the means of possibly higher prices for carcase meat but it would provide also the possibility of developing an extra industry from by-products which are now lost to us by exporting cattle on the hoof.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> Deputy Costello made a suggestion with regard to the possibility of the utilisation of surplus milk.  He suggested the manufacturing of cheese and the possibility of extending our exports of cheese.  That is a matter in which I was always interested, but, again, I am not sufficiently conversant with the dairying industry and certainly not with the difficulties of processing cheese to suit the taste of our own people and people abroad.  Nevertheless, I would suggest to the creameries, particularly those creameries engaged in the making of cheese at the present time, that there must be a method whereby they can increase the utilisation of milk and at the same time benefit the country by providing us with greater markets abroad in milk products. I know there are difficulties involved.  If there were not, I am sure the present processes in regard to cheese would have expanded trade in that direction.  These are only small instances of how we can expand the export of our agricultural products and relieve the taxpayer of the necessity to pay certain subsidies on such exports.</P>
    <P>I mentioned I was going to speak in a general manner and then refer to something in particular.  The particular matter to which I want to refer was something mentioned by Deputies Sweetman and Casey, and, perhaps, one or two other Deputies.  That was the reference to the apparent reduction in the provision for primary school buildings in the current year.  I hope I am in order in making this reference since other Deputies referred to the matter.  I shall only deal with it very superficially.</P>
    <P>It is true that in the Estimate for primary school building in the current year there is an apparent reduction of £174,000.  The fact is, however, that the amount of money provided for last year, £1,589,000, was not entirely spent and will not be entirely spent at the end of the current year.  In fact, only £1,200,000 of that provision will be spent by the 31st of the present month. Therefore, the provision of £1,415,000 odd for the coming year is an increase of £200,000 on the amount of money spent in the present financial year on <Col N="628" /> school building.  That is a realistic increase and it is the sum which we expect will be spent on the building of national schools in the coming 12 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy not only why I do not think it is enough, but how it is limited to what it is for the current year.  At the end of 1956, as the Deputy knows, for the six months June to November, the Office of Public Works was instructed by the Department of Education&mdash;possibly as a result of its being, in turn, instructed by the Department of Finance&mdash;that no more provision was to be made for school-building in that period.  The same applied to vocational school buildings and perhaps other projects of a capital nature as well, but I do not know. Certainly it applied in relation to school buildings.  The Office of Public Works then instructed their technicians that no more money would be spent on schools.  The Minister for Finance had not the money.  We were all aware that a serious capital position obtained in the country at the time.</P>
      <P>The criticism which I make and which I made when I came to the Department was why should this six months be lost.  I was told that the Office of Public Works, as a result of that six months' lay-off, were not geared to keep up the then existing tempo of school-building.  My criticism was that the Department of Education and the Office of Public Works should have insisted on the examination of plans, in so far as they could have gone on.  Perhaps they could not be looked after 100 per cent., but certainly there should be no reason for a back log as did appear at the end of the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pressed as hard as I could but I could get only £1,200,000 out of them. The excuse was that the six months' <Col N="629" /> Standstill Order was the cause of their failure to expend more money on building, that the effects of the Standstill Order still persist, and that they can increase that expenditure by only £200,000 in the coming year.  Nevertheless, it is a significant increase, though it is not quite as large as the expenditure in the year prior to last year, and certainly is not nearly as much as I know is necessary and as I hope will be expended in coming years.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Chair for permitting me to refer in particular to this matter, even though I know that, in so doing, I am possibly straining the rules applicable to a debate such as this.  In so far as those specific charges have been made, I hope I have refuted them satisfactorily and allayed any fears Deputies may have had or expressed that there would be a reduction in school building.  Rather can I say that there will be a significant increase&mdash;an increase of 17 per cent. which, I suggest, is significant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened patiently during the past week, in the hope that we would hear some statement from a representative of the Government in connection with portion of the plan for the relief of unemployment which we were promised.  It is no use for Deputies or Ministers to make the excuse that that plan which was announced by the Tánaiste was for discussion only. I am in a position to prove that the plan was announced to counteract the trade union plan for full employment. The Tánaiste made a statement at a public meeting in Wexford, as reported in the newspapers, on 23rd February, 1957, in the course of which he said that they had published their plan, both in the Dáil and elsewhere, and that it had received support from all quarters, amongst the farmers, trade union leaders and businessmen.  That plan, as we all know, was promised. Millions of pounds were to be spent and thousands of men were to be put into employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have now had 12 months of office.  Surely it is time for them to give us an indication of what portion of that plan will be put into operation?  As reported in the <i>Irish <Col N="630" /> Press</i> of 9th March, the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unemployment is the one thing I am thinking of at the moment. Fianna Fáil's first task would be to secure sufficient employment so that people would not have to emigrate through economic necessity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the subject of emigration, the Taoiseach is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is, of course, a longstanding evil.  It has become more serious in recent years, partly due to economic factors and partly due to other ones.  The proper place to start, I think, as regards the economic side, is to try to secure that there will be sufficient employment available for our people so that they will not, through any economic necessity, have to go abroad.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was the first task and the Taoiseach stated they were thinking of that plan.  He continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With an overall majority, the Fianna Fáil Government will begin at once to put back into productive employment our 90,000 unemployed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe the Taoiseach, in all sincerity, made that statement, which was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 9th March.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence made a great case to the effect that unemployment has been relieved.  We were inquiring in what areas unemployment has been relieved.  Unfortunately, it is not true in my constituency.  Let us consider the position in one of the industrial portions of County Wicklow, where at least four factories were giving employment.  Three of them have now closed down, and, in one of the principal industries, the employees are on a three-day working week.</P>
    <P>In another part of County Wicklow, flour mills which gave employment have been closed down and, since last October, very few men are employed on the roads.  Nevertheless, when the Minister for Finance went down to a cumann meeting in that area, he tried to make excuses for the county council being unable to provide the employment which they had provided in <Col N="631" /> previous years.  In the course of the whole of this debate, we have not had a statement from any Minister in connection with the serious problems facing the country.  I have been associated with this House for over 35 years and I cannot understand the attitude of the Government on this occasion.</P>
    <P>We talk about factories closing down. Even in this particular area, 40 families emigrated to England.  They were individual farm labourers going up to the county council and paying 2/- a week for a house with a half-acre of land, but they took themselves and their families across where there was more work than in this area.  What has become of the plan we were promised to provide employment for our people. There is money in the country.  That has been proved by the two successful loans.  Ministers and Deputies of Fianna Fáil are responsible for all the prophecies of gloom and despair, but in spite of that a large number of people invested in the E.S.B. and other loans. If they had not painted such a gloomy picture, the position would not be as serious as it is to-day.  Even those who are in temporary employment are wondering whether they should remain another week or clear off in the next boat.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands is taking the long-term view.  Notwithstanding that he has reduced the amount provided for forestry, he points out what will happen in 50 years' time.  That is a long time to go.  He will provide full employment for all men requiring work on forestry then.  He is quite safe in talking about 50 years' time.  None of us will be here to contradict him or to refer to his speech.</P>
    <P>I maintain the Government is responsible for the serious position we are faced with to-day.  They deliberately attacked the workers by the removal of the food subsidies.  I warn them of the serious ill effects it will have and I am warning the Minister that, notwithstanding his threats, the trade unions will be there to protect their members and get them back some compensation to meet the reduction in <Col N="632" /> the standard of living caused by the removal of the food subsidies.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce immediately had to consult with the trade unions to get some agreement between wage earners and employers, to meet partly the deliberate action of the Government in removing the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>What do we find to-day?  I am sure Fianna Fáil members must feel the same as other members.  We find that we are asking the unemployed man, the old age pensioner and poor people in the lower income group to pay a tax in order to give the people in full employment in England butter at 2/6 a lb.  I have seen butter brought in by sailors in my own town, Irish creamery butter, three pounds of it, and the sailor told me he paid 7/6 for the three pounds.  It was the best Irish creamery butter, bought across in Liverpool.  At the same time butter is 4/5 a lb. here.</P>
    <P>I could go back to history.  I remember one occasion when the then Minister for Finance attacked the social services and a number of Deputies then approached the Minister.  We were told by the Finance representative at the time that the Minister thought it was necessary to attack the social services because it was saving £500,000 that year.  One man on the deputation had lost his brother in the war and he said: &ldquo;I am very sorry to-day that my brother gave up his life, if it meant saving Ireland for £500,000 and attacking the social services of the people.&rdquo;  The Finance Department were always like that.  Naturally, I have nothing to say about the civil servants; I found them nothing but courteous and I am proud of our Irish Civil Service.  They have given good service to the State, but they always take the safe course and they will take no risks.  Of course, they will advise that the Department cannot do this and cannot do the other.  They have advised in connection with the removal of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>What is the position to-day?  We remove the subsidy on butter and we have estimated that in this particular year £3,210,000 will have to be found to meet the subsidies on butter.  Would it not be better to adopt the Danish <Col N="633" /> plan, announced in the papers yesterday, and give to the Irish people cheap butter, just as the Danes are giving it to their people at 1/9 a lb. instead of sending it to England and depriving their own people of it?  Why not right the blunders we made and give our Irish people the butter?  Then no one will object and the farmers will get the subsidy at the same time.</P>
    <P>I am not alone in this.  I will quote the Taoiseach himself.  When Deputy Sweetman, as Minister for Finance, was bringing in the resolution to lower the home price of butter by 5d. a lb., Deputy de Valera then said, as reported at column 143 of Volume 146, in relation to the relative values of butter from the point of view of health as against certain health benefits, that he was inclined to agree to a large extent with what Deputy Sweetman had said. He continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think that the foundation of health is good food.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was what Deputy de Valera said in all sincerity in June, 1954.</P>
    <P>He continued, referring to the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister has indicated that he has put in comparison the health services and butter and I am inclined to agree that if I had to choose in certain circumstances I might choose butter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, however, despite the view which he took then, his Government are penalising the poor people in the lower income group and the unemployed by making them pay 4/4 a lb. for butter, whilst at the same time he is giving butter at a couple of shillings a lb. to people over in England and the North of Ireland.  This was made an election issue by a politician in the North of Ireland, who said: &ldquo;There is the Twenty-Six Counties economy, giving us butter at a couple of shillings a lb. but charging their own people 4/5; they are giving it to England cheaper than they are giving it to their own poor people&rdquo;.  He made it an election issue and it appeared in the papers all last week.  Here we are asking the poorer section of the community to <Col N="634" /> pay the subsidy and denying them the butter for themselves.</P>
    <P>Of course, we shall be told by the Minister about the balance of payments. If the Minister took into consideration the amount of raw materials imported for the manufacture of margarine, because less butter is consumed by the people now on account of the price, one would balance with the other.  I am not one to say that the balance of payments is to be held in a state of sanctity while we let our own people become unemployed and disheartened.</P>
    <P>During 35 years here I have listened to many debates but it is no pride or honour now to get up and talk about the position of the country.  I want to point out that we could take a different course.  As I pointed out, it has been proved that the loans were successful. We should not continue talking about &ldquo;strong Government&rdquo; but we should get the people who have the money to invest in Irish industry to provide employment for our people at home. Encouragement is being offered by the remission of taxes and by grants for the starting of industries, but if we continue the gloomy speeches made by Fianna Fáil Deputies and Ministers, we are not encouraging people here anxious to invest their money in their own country.</P>
    <P>Why not point out the good things that have happened, the great achievements that have been taking place?  I could go back over 35 years and talk about many things but I take a great pride in praising this country and boasting about it even when there is a Government in office which I may oppose greatly.  I prefer to do that than making statements against the country.  I heard a Fianna Fáil Deputy praising some Labour representative in England.  He forgot to tell us that the Labour Party, in Government, were the first to attack Ireland by Act of Parliament.  He had nothing but praise for them.  I have no praise for all of the men who were in the English Labour Government because it was they who made an attack on Ireland by the Government of Ireland Act.  Therefore, when he <Col N="635" /> gives a quotation I think he should give it from some Englishman other than some of the Labour men they had there.</P>
    <P>I referred to the position that there was unemployment in all parts of the country.  While it is wise and proper that we should discuss the distressing position in agriculture and sympathise with the agricultural people, I, representing both an urban and a rural area, regret to say that businessmen, supporters of the Government, have told me that they were never faced with a position such as obtained at the present moment because the Government gave orders to the banks to withdraw credit.  They have reduced all the various financial provisions that give employment.  They reduced the Board of Works Estimate; they have taken £700,000 out of the Local Government Estimate, although the Minister for Local Government, in a broadcast before the election, said that houses, sanitation and water works were essential and important features of local government administration. Now he is Minister and he has been responsible for reducing the Estimate by £700,000.  Where now will we get the money for the erection of houses, with the high rate of interest? Half of the skilled men who were employed in Dublin have had to emigrate and are lost to the country for ever.</P>
    <P>I belonged to one public body which initiated direct housing schemes.  We had houses erected even during the war, but now, owing to the high rate of interest, an economic rent cannot be obtained.  We cannot borrow money because the tenants we have in mind would not be able to pay the rent. Houses will not be erected unless we are able to reduce the rate of interest to encourage public bodies to proceed with their erection.  Houses are required and if there is a house available there are ten to 20 applicants for it.  I cannot understand why the Government allowed the banks to act in the way they did.  I am not divulging any secrets but I know that the banks at one time refused Dublin Corporation £100,000 for the erection of houses.  They were given an ultimatum <Col N="636" /> and told that if they did not help the corporation other measures would be taken and then Dublin Corporation got their money.  We found out in two days that it was not necessary to withdraw credit on the other side, that it was only a book transaction.</P>
    <P>Why are we allowing the banks to take advantage of the present rates when the public require amenities such as water works, sewerage and the erection of houses?  You and I must pay extra in our taxes and in our rates, but the banks get away with all the spoils because they lose nothing.  Our only hope is to get control of the banking system of this country, through the Central Bank or otherwise.  I say so, after my years of experience.</P>
    <P>I do not want to detain the House, but I did not wish to allow the opportunity pass without expressing my views in case my constituents might think that we were approving of what has been happening here over the last 12 months.  The Fianna Fáil Government have now been 12 months in office and I until recently had some hopes for them, believing that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste would hardly make statements such as they did unless they really meant to put them into operation.  I am disappointed now when I hear a Minister say that the statements were only for public discussion.  I appeal to the Government that if a blunder has been made in the removal of food subsidies, to restore them in the coming Budget.  If we have to give a subsidy on exports of butter, let charity begin at home and save for our own people first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. S. Browne Mr. S. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I feel slightly worried, having listened to Deputy Flanagan speaking for close on two hours this evening.  I have come to the conclusion that we must be desperate fellows over here.  I am sure I am included in the five &ldquo;wheat&rdquo; Deputies who were mentioned. I really feel worried, as I say, rising to speak on this Vote on Account.  I find it hard to understand why if the Coalition Government accomplished so much in the space of the last three years they were in office, they left office this time last <Col N="637" /> year.  I find it still harder to understand why, when they did get out of office, the electorate of the Twenty-Six Counties made sure that they stayed out.</P>
      <P>Over the last four days we have heard many speeches from Fine Gael Deputies in connection with farming. I suppose it is only right that they should deal with farming as the farmers are an important section of the community.  Nevertheless, I would say to them that there are a few other people in the country as well.  I do not think for one moment that the farmers in the Twenty-Six Counties would thank Deputy Oliver Flanagan for the statements he made this evening when he referred to them as being pauperised and beggared.  The farmers are an independent, hardy, hardworking and sturdy people and they, the small farmers in particular, have all down the years supported the national drive and the national efforts of this country.</P>
      <P>We have heard no realistic or objective approach whatsoever to this debate by the Opposition.  I think the only refreshing contribution I heard was that by Deputy Corish yesterday evening.  It was, I believe, the only honest contribution to this debate.  It is rare to find a Deputy on this side congratulating a member of the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and especially an Opposition man in his own county, but I will say this, that Deputy Corish made a constructive and honest speech on this Vote on Account.  He made one appeal that I should like to support. It is an appeal which the whole House could back, an appeal to the Irish people to buy Irish goods.  It should not really be necessary to do that, but, in view of the possibility that the Free Trade Area will come into being&mdash; though I doubt if it ever will&mdash;it is only right that our Irish people should be Irish goods conscious.  We might extend that appeal to our emigrants overseas. If we could get as many of them as possible to be Irish goods conscious, to buy as many Irish goods as may be <Col N="638" /> available to them, to make the effort to secure as many Irish goods as we can put at their disposal, it would be doing very much to help the home market.  If we could get our Irish people in six major cities, London, Liverpool and Birmingham in England, and New York, Boston and Philadelphia in the United States, to support our Irish goods, it would be doing a lot to help the economy of the homeland.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Government's policy as a whole, there has been no realistic or objective approach to the situation by the speakers who have spoken for the Opposition.  We have gone over the same ground time and time again.  I think it has been gone over six times since I came into the House 12 months ago.  We have had all this business again about the election promises.  We have had the usual papers produced, the <i>Irish Press,</i> or <i>Pravda,</i> as Deputy Dillon would prefer to call it, and the Fianna Fáil publication, <i>An Gléas.</i>  We have had a new one produced, the <i>Nenagh Guardian,</i> which has appeared in good company. I would say to my good friends from Tipperary that in future, when they are holding their conventions, they might do like Fine Gael and hold them behind closed doors and, when the conventions are over, issue a statement to the Press saying that everything in the garden was rosy.  I think the one reason why we are here after 32 years, stronger than ever, is that we have always held our conventions in the open.  They have always been man to man affairs and there has been no hiding and going behind the scenes.</P>
      <P>I think the best way to answer a bad argument is to let it go on.  We have followed this mysterious £6,500,000 all over the place.  I wondered at one stage where it might pop up next.  The Opposition speakers seem to forget that when Fianna Fáil took office 12 months ago, there was then a deficit of over £6,000,000 on current account and the Estimates which were prepared by the previous Government sought an increase of over £5,000,000.  Were it not for the saving of this £6,500,000, it would still be an additional burden on our people.</P>

      <Col N="639" /> The Opposition were critical on the question of agriculture, critical in connection with social welfare and critical in connection with housing and health. If we look at the Estimates, we find, under the heading of agriculture, that something like £25,000,000 will be spent during the coming year.  We have a sum of £20,500,000 for social assistance and £4,500,000 for social insurance, a total of almost £25,000,000.  It is not a bad figure at all.  We have also in the Health Estimates a sum of £8,200,000 to pay the 50 per cent. contribution to the amount of moneys raised by local bodies to meet the health charges and look after the health of the community. That has risen during the past eight years and it is a major contribution to the health of the people of this State.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the cuts in the Estimates, but I have not heard any speaker suggesting that we replace those cuts.  The Opposition cannot have it both ways.  If they want those cuts replaced, they must be prepared to support increased taxation.  I feel that so far as the people in my constituency are concerned, the trend in those Estimates showing a reduction in Government expenditure will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Government's wheat policy has also been discussed.  I am well aware that the Minister for Finance is a man of very great patience.  Certainly he required all that patience to sit back during this debate and listen to the Fine Gael Deputies speaking on wheat. If it were necessary or useful to the House, we could rehash all the statements made by Deputy Dillon, and other Fine Gael speakers, down through the years when they were opposed to the growing of wheat.  I was only a schoolboy when I heard Dr. Ryan, as Minister for Agriculture, trying to get the people of the Twenty-Six Counties to grow wheat.  I remember the task he had in my own county of Wexford to get the farmers of Wexford to grow wheat.  Any good supporter then of Fine Gael, or Cumann na nGaedheal, felt it was his duty not to grow wheat, but what has happened to the wheat position now?</P>
    <P>Up until two years ago, everything <Col N="640" /> was going fine, but, at that stage, a number of what I would call wheat ranchers entered into this business of growing wheat.  We had Deputy Rooney and Deputy Sweetman talking about wheat growing here.  It is the wheat ranchers in Deputy Rooney's constituency and Deputy Sweetman's constituency, to a very great extent, and the wheat ranchers in Wexford and other counties, to a lesser extent, who have created the wheat surplus at the present time.  It was never intended that we should grow more wheat than was required for home consumption.  It was never intended that we should export wheat, even if we could get a market for it.  I am quite certain there is no hope of getting a market for our surplus wheat.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan, speaking this evening about wheat, referred to a statement made by the Minister for Finance in 1954.  He could, of course, have referred to statements made by Deputy Dillon and other members of the Opposition, too.  He said that the Minister had stated that 300,000 tons of dried wheat represented two-thirds of our requirements.  That statement is perfectly correct.  To-day we have 370,000 tons of Irish dried wheat, 70,000 tons more than our requirements.</P>
    <P>We have had from Deputy Dillon and Deputy Flanagan the usual boasting about all the increases they have brought about in agricultural production. We had the usual boast about the land reclamation scheme and all the rest of it.  We had the boast that there was not an egg-cupful of lime used prior to their coming into office. Deputy Corish, speaking here yesterday evening, referred to the increase in production from seven barrels to 22 barrels per acre of wheat.  Deputy Dillon boasted about the greatest quantity of wheat, of barley and of milk being produced in this country, since, as he put it, Adam was a small boy.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody worries about Deputy Dillon's boasting or has any objection to it; it is a rather childish type of occupation.  He has taken credit for every good and for every increase in production, but he <Col N="641" /> will not accept responsibility for any of the difficult things or the unpopular things.  Deputy Dillon's boasting has done more harm to the interests of the Irish farmer than anything else.  It is a fact that Wexford farmers are the soundest and ablest farmers in Ireland, and they will agree with me that at the moment there is less sympathy for the Irish farmer amongst the rest of the community than ever before and that has been brought about by this boasting.</P>
    <P>We are told the Irish farmer is now getting 22 barrels of wheat where before he got only seven barrels.  It is very hard to follow Deputy Dillon's logic.  At one moment he is bewailing any attempt or effort to reduce prices. If the Irish farmer is getting 22 barrels per acre now, whereas he got only seven before, what must the rest of the people think?</P>

      <P>We have heard a good deal about milk and butter in this debate.  Deputy Everett told us that we should let the Irish people eat the surplus butter.  That might be a good idea, but, if we let them eat the butter, they will have to pay for it.  I speak subject to correction now, but I calculate it would cost anything from £10,000,000 to £15,000,000 in extra taxation for the Irish people to eat the butter.</P>

We know quite well what the cost of production of a lb. of butter is. It is produced with the cheapest labour in the country because the agricultural labourer is the cheapest labourer here.  Nevertheless, the raw material costs 3/9.</P>

      <P>I agree with those who have suggested we should find some alternative method of using our surplus milk.  It might be a good idea if we could encourage some of the continental manufacturers to come in here to manufacture cheese.  We had hopes recently of having a German firm manufacturing cheese in Wexford, but something has upset their plans unfortunately.  If we could encourage some of these continental manufacturers which have an unlimited market in America to come in here and use up this surplus milk, that would, indeed, help to ease the problem considerably.</P>
      <P>We had references by Deputy Costello earlier and by Deputy Flanagan to-day to the transatlantic air service. This is still keeping true to the Fine Gael mentality that opposed the setting up of Irish Shipping; that ensured that the short-wave radio station would not go on the air; and that opposed the whole industrial revival in this country.</P>

      <P>We have heard a considerable amount about subsidies. Subsidies were introduced into this country by Fianna Fáil and in the first years of their existence they cost about £15,000,000.  They were reduced by Fianna Fáil in 1952 to approximately half of that figure.  It is a well-known fact that those subsidies were opposed by many Opposition Deputies in this House, by both Fine Gael and Labour Deputies.</P>

It was the intention of the Opposition to abolish those subsidies.  We have Deputy Mulcahy's own words for it when he said: &ldquo;A good deal of the money is being given out to those who could well afford to do without it.

      <P>We have heard a good deal here about unemployment. We have been hearing about unemployment since the establishment of the State, but the figures show that there are about 8,000 fewer unemployed now than there were this time last year.  I should like to say that I feel, for one, that agriculture will not support a large population.  I feel that it will not give sufficient employment to support a large population, especially since the advent of machinery into Irish agriculture.  Let it not be taken for one moment that I am opposed to the introduction of machinery into Irish agriculture, but I believe it is a bad thing to subsidise surplus wheat and to allow the wheat rancher to import costly machinery with a short term of life into this country.  However, if we are to keep our place in the markets of the world, we must have machinery.</P>

    <P>Deputy Corish, in his very able statement last night, referred to the fact that there is now less demand for, and less work in, housing and hospitals. That is true.  We are now reaching the stage where the demand for housing and hospitalisation has almost been met.  When Fianna Fáil took over in 1932, after ten years of Cumann na nGaedheal Government, they were working on virgin soil as far as industry, housing, agriculture and everything else in this country was concerned.  We have heard a great <Col N="646" /> deal about free trade.

      <P>On a point of order, <Col N="648" /> Sir, a few minutes ago Deputy Cunningham was very careful to preserve the privileges of the House.

      <P>There has been much discussion about emigration.  Deputy Dillon claimed many records for the years 1946 to 1956, but there was one record established during that period which he did not mention.  That was the record for emigration.  The average net emigration was at a higher figure during that ten-year period than at any other period in the lifetime of the present State.  From 1936 to 1946, the average net annual emigration from the Twenty-Six Counties was 18,711. From 1946 to 1951, which included three years of Coalition Government, that figure rose to 24,384 annually.  From 1951 to 1956, which included three further years of Coalition Government, the figure rose to 40,079.</P>

      <P>That is your record as far as emigration is concerned&mdash;the highest figure on record since the establishment of this State and long before it.</P>
      <P>I agree there is nothing to boast about with regard to emigration and unemployment figures.  Nobody wishes to boast about them.  It is about time we stopped trying to make political points in this House about emigration and unemployment.  They are very serious problems.  It will take the best efforts of every Party and every Deputy to solve those problems.  I am sure every Deputy would prefer the situation to be otherwise.  Every Deputy would prefer to see employment for every able-bodied man and woman in this country, willing and anxious to work.  Every effort will have to be made to try to solve these serious problems.</P>
      <P>It is a question of promoting new jobs.  As Deputy Corish said last night, the many jobs available from the time Fianna Fáil took over from 1932 on, building houses, hospitals and roads, were of a temporary nature and are now rapidly drying up.  It has been stated that there is something like £700,000 less in the coming Estimates for housing.  In introducing this Vote on Account, the Minister said that the demand for housing was not the same as it was in the past.  That is admitted, but I would say there is a demand in urban areas and provincial towns for a certain amount of housing.  Under the existing financial conditions, however, I am afraid we are not able to meet that demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is agreed that the ratepayers and the central authority provide very generous financial assistance for house-building, but that assistance is not sufficient to provide under present conditions houses that can be let sufficiently cheaply for some applicants in our towns.  I am sure it would be more appropriate to say this on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, but I think the time has come for a new approach to that problem. All down the years we have been dealing with houses on old, well-established lines and I think it is time to establish a commission of all Parties interested <Col N="650" /> in housing&mdash;trade unions, builders, architects and so on&mdash;to see if they can provide a house that can be built for, say, £1,000.  I believe it can be done.  England has tried it and has, I believe, succeeded in doing it.</P>
    <P>During this debate we have been accused of being a &ldquo;towny&rdquo; Government. That expression was used already in the past few weeks by a Fine Gael Deputy who I am sure got a considerable number of votes from the towns in his constituency.  It is deplorable that any attempt should be made to create a cleavage between the towns and the rural areas.  One depends to a very great extent on the prosperity of the other; they are really inter-dependent.  Last evening Deputy Corish referred to the small traders in the towns and said their difficulties began just one year ago.  As far as the Opposition is concerned, all our difficulties began on the 20th March of last year.  It is not a very pleasant thing to face, but we know that the small traders in our towns during the past three or four years have probably been the hardest hit section of the community and are just now beginning to pick up a bit.</P>
    <P>The outlook of the Opposition has changed over the past 12 months.  Now they tell us everything was rosy when they left office; there were no difficulties and everything was grand.  That is their approach to the position to-day. During the debate over the past two days that was their approach, but on this night 12 months ago when Deputy Costello spoke on the formation of the new Government there was a different approach.  In a very brief speech then, I think he made seven references to the tremendous difficulties that faced the new Government. It must be admitted that it was those difficulties, and nothing else, that made the previous Government make up their minds to get out.  It was those difficulties, many of them of the Government's own creation, that made the people ensure the Coalition Government would not be returned.</P>
    <P>We have had many quotations from various newspapers and other documents. There has been a good deal of <Col N="651" /> talk about &ldquo;promises&rdquo;; many of these I am sure have been invented during the past 12 months, but I am rather surprised that no member of the Opposition&mdash;and they are well served by their information section under the charge of Deputy O'Sullivan &mdash;at any stage produced an election address issued to the electorate in Wexford even though we are accused of getting in here on false promises.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon yesterday challenged Deputy Allen and myself in this House and, honestly enough, I told him that we addressed only three or four meetings during the whole election campaign; it was not necessary to do it in Wexford.  I addressed four meetings myself, two in the towns.  We put before the people of Wexford the seriousness of the position as it then was, the irresponsibility of the Government at the time and how they had failed the community, and, as a result of telling the people of the difficulties and of what had been done by the previous Government, we got a majority of the seats in Wexford.</P>
    <P>Nobody produced the election document issued by the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Dr. Ryan, to the electorate of Wexford during the election campaign, even though the Minister has been attacked here.  We were told of his &ldquo;promises&rdquo; given on the wireless but Fine Gael speakers made sure they did not mention the promises made by the Leader of the Opposition, in 1954 I think, when he promised guaranteed prices for corn crops for a period of five years.  Yet, within one year of that promise, the Party that he led, and still leads, reduced the price of wheat by 12/6 a barrel.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister has been attacked because of his &ldquo;promises&rdquo; and his failing the farmers, I can say that for the past 40 years the Minister has been elected to Dáil Éireann by the finest group of farmers in Ireland or anywhere on the face of the earth. In his election document there is one paragraph which is typical of the whole document and in conclusion I shall quote it.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You have the opportunity on March 5th to end the period of drift <Col N="652" /> and depression, the bungling and confusion which the country has had to endure since June, 1954, and to return a Government that will command confidence, that will set the nation on the road to recovery, to overcome the difficulties besetting the country, a task of great magnitude, but with the support of all sections of our people Fianna Fáil will face the crisis with confidence and determination.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was no rosy promise there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just one comment to make on the statement of Deputy Browne about the great body of farmers in Wexford.  Not so long ago the Minister was down there and what did he say about them?  He said their spiritual home was in Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>Listening to this debate over last week, yesterday and to-day I am sure one fact struck every Deputy in the House, that as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, it is new Deputies such as the Minister for Defence, sitting in at the moment, Deputy Browne, who has just sat down, and Deputy Carty of Galway who have been speaking&mdash;all the young fellows, while the old, hairy warriors remain silent.  We should ask ourselves the reason why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years I have listened to the hairy old warriors on the other side of the House referring to the price of milk, the price of wheat and so on, but they cannot do so to-day; it is the youth that they have sent in here to talk this evening, people who, like the last speaker, will talk about what happened in 1932 and so on.  I shall not go back that far. I am not entitled to do so. I shall go back to this day 12 months, when a change of Government took place.  When I was crossing the floor of the House on that occasion I felt that, if Fianna Fáil were able to live up to the things that they said they would do, it was no harm to have a change of Government.  For the past 12 months I have been watching their progress without any criticism.  I would ask the Minister not to shake his head. I give credit where it is due.  Without the slightest criticism, I have been watching for the past 12 months from <Col N="653" /> day to day, week to week and month to month to discover what advance would be made in fulfilling the promises made so sincerely to the people and that I expected would operate as from this day 12 months ago.  For the few weeks prior to this night 12 months ago, outside every church gate, on every platform, on every poster one read: &ldquo;Give us an all-over majority; give us a strong Government and let us get cracking.  Put your trust in Dev.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It took a strong Government, and a very strong Government, a Government that cared very little about the people who gave them that majority, to do what the present Government have done in the past 12 months.  Their first act here was to abolish the food subsidies.  The first people that they hit were the poorer sections of the community, the widows and orphans, the old age pensioners, the blind pensioners and people who could not earn their own living.  With one wave of their hand, the Government took away £9,000,000.  The Minister in reply to a question here indicated that that was the saving effected by the abolition of the subsidies.  It saved, he said, £9,000,000 to the taxpayer.  It is a nice thing to talk about the taxpayer but the person who is in need deserves consideration before the taxpayer.  One of the first acts of the strong Government that took office this day 12 months ago was to deprive the needy, the old age pensioner, the widow and orphan and the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Of course, they would tell you that they gave 1/- to the old age pensioner, that they gave this and that they gave that.  The Minister admits that in a full year that will amount to only £2,500,000 but they took away £9,000,000 and therefore gained £6,500,000 at the expense of the poorer sections of the community.  The Minister, Dr. Ryan, is laughing but he will not laugh when I am finished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed it is and a good bit more, but I am not as ancient as the Minister.  Going around to the fairs in the country there was a fellow selling patent medicines&mdash;the &ldquo;black doctor&rdquo; they used to call him.  He had a pill which would cure anything.  For three or four weeks before the last general election Fianna Fáil reminded me of that black doctor.  They had a pill that would cure anything.  The best pill of all was the pill that the present Minister had.  We see the result of that pill&mdash;the taking away of £9,000,000 from the poorer sections of the community through the abolition of the food subsidies.  The price of bread, the price of flour, the price of every commodity that the poorer sections use, were affected.</P>
      <P>Of course, that is the reason that the younger elements appeared in this debate.  The old, hairy element that I have referred to did not appear at all.  I was amused at Deputy Browne of Wexford speaking while Deputy Allen sat as mute as a mouse beside him.  Do you know why?  Wheat, wheat, wheat!  I am glad that my old friend, Deputy Killilea, is in the House because during the last election in North Galway everywhere he went Deputy Killilea referred to wheat and to &ldquo;what Jim Dillon did&rdquo;.  I tried then to point out to the people, and successfully pointed it out, that the reason the inter-Party Government made that change was that certain individuals were turning out acres of wheat, people who probably would not grow an acre of wheat when the country needed it.  It was in order to prevent them from doing so, in order to prevent the taxpayer from subsidising such wheat ranchers, that the inter-Party Government made that change. Would Deputy Killilea listen to that? Not at all.  It is the same policy, word for word, that has been advanced by Deputy Browne of Wexford on the other side of the House to-night.  How can Fianna Fáil blow hot and cold?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a representative of the farmers, I believe that the price of wheat should <Col N="655" /> not be depressed.  It is all right to ask, &ldquo;Why should we subsidise it?&rdquo; but why are we subsidising everything else?  Why should we not subsidise wheat when we subsidise other sections of industry?  None of the hairy warriors appeared to say a word about it.  The young Minister for Defence opened the debate.  Young Deputy Browne intervened in the debate.  I think he was making his maiden speech.  It sounded like it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carty also contributed to the debate.  He said he was glad to see in the Book of Estimates an increase for forestry.  He is a national teacher and surely he can read.  There is a reduction in forestry of £135,000.  It is in Vote No. 7, sub-head C (2).  Another reason why the old hairy warriors did not speak was the reduction in the price of milk.  I am glad to see my friend, Deputy Moloney, in the House and I will tell you why.  I happened to be campaigning successfully in a by-election in North Kerry and &ldquo;successfully&rdquo; is the word.</P>

I would not say anything hard to Deputy Moloney.  We will be good friends, but down in that part of the country, within a week, it was decided there should be an increase in the price of milk.  I was going down to Dingle to a meeting and I met this fellow in a car.  The front of the car was filled with a set of posters beside him and in the back of the car was another set of posters.  I said I would see what this fellow was at.  He took one poster from the front of the car and posted it up.  It said there would be a mass demonstration and a march to Dublin, a demand for an increase in the price of milk.  On the other side <Col N="656" /> of the road he posted up a notice: &ldquo;Vote Moloney No. 1&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was cruel about wheat, but it was not cruel about milk. Both the price of wheat and the price of milk have now gone down.  There is another reason why the hairy warriors did not speak.  I remember sitting over there and Deputy Dillon, the then Minister for Agriculture, being asked questions about the report of the Milk Costings Commission.  It was said from a Fianna Fáil platform in North Kerry at that time that the then Minister for Agriculture had the report, but would not submit it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not in the House at the time; he was only trying to get in.  The hairy warriors did not speak at all.  They put up the innocent Minister for Defence, the innocent Deputy Browne of Wexford and the innocent Deputy Carty, but the hairy warrior from Galway, Deputy Killilea, did not speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see why we should not subsidise the export of butter.  Everything else is subsidised except what the farmer produces.  Why should butter and wheat not be exported and subsidised, if it is necessary to do so?  Is the farming community not as much entitled to consideration as other sections of the community?  They have been asked to increase production and <Col N="657" /> when they have done that, the aim is to depress its price.  It is a wonder that after 12 months these marvellous people of the Fianna Fáil Party, who could do anything, have not suggested something else that could be done with this extra agricultural produce.  Fianna Fáil will go down as the Government that taxed the pig.  The British Government in days gone by taxed the dog in this country.  They never thought of taxing the pig but Fianna Fáil taxed them to the extent of 5/-.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht gave out a challenge here last night that it was the inter-Party Government who decided to cut by half the grants for the cow byres.  I want to know from the Minister the day and date the inter-Party Government came to that decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something that I do not believe happened.  I want to appeal to the farmers, whether they are milk producers, wheat growers or any other section of the farming community, who are disgruntled by the acts of the Government, not to cut off their noses to spite their faces.  I appeal to them above all to work in every way they can in connection with the tuberculosis eradication scheme. It is important to every section of farmers.  I appeal to them to cooperate in that scheme, because, if they do not, it will sound the death knell of the one and only industry of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I ask the Minister to give me the day, the date and the conditions under which the inter-Party Government decided the cow byre grant should be cut by half.  It is done now, no matter who did it.  Owing to the fact that the West of Ireland and the counties Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim have now been declared clearance areas, I appeal to <Col N="658" /> the Minister to restore the grant in full in the poorer areas of this country in order to help the tuberculosis eradication scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht would love to say the hard thing.  Since he became Minister, I do not think we have heard much about what he did for the West of Ireland.  He has a sort of scheme called Scéim na Muc. That is the right title for it, because it is the five bob tax on the pig.  The Government will be known as the Government which put the five bob tax on the pig.</P>

I was in Castlebar not so long ago and they were not going for that.  They are fetching a good price though, thanks to the inter-Party Government.  The inter-Party Government played their part in that.  Fianna Fáil Deputies should be ashamed to mention the word &ldquo;calf&rdquo;, because they were known as calf murderers in their time.</P>

If the people on the Fine Gael side of the House and those on the Fianna Fáil side of the House forgot about shirts and about what happened 20 or 30 years ago and tried to look forward to the future, it would be more in the interests of the community and would probably result in greater prosperity for the people as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which worries me as a farmer representative. At the moment, meetings are taking place of representatives from different countries in connection with the Free Trade Area.  As far as the farmers are <Col N="659" /> concerned, the representative of agriculture in this country is the Minister for Agriculture, whether he is a member of the Labour Party, Clann na Poblachta, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or any other Party.  Might I ask the Minister how it is that at any of these meetings in connection with the Free Trade Area the one man responsible for agriculture has not been sent by the Government?  The chief thing to be discussed at these meetings is agriculture. I am glad the Minister is here because I hope that the great position we enjoyed under the 1948 Trade Agreement, so far as agriculture is concerned, will never be lost.  Speaking as a farmer and as one who was bred, born and reared on the land, I say that was the greatest agreement ever negotiated.  It does not matter whether it was negotiated by Deputy Dillon or by the present Minister for Agriculture, or anybody else.</P>

      <P>Deputies will come and go and those who occupy the Government Benches to-day will fill the Opposition Benches to-morrow. That is democracy, but one thing must be realised, that is, that for the benefit of the country, there must be a continuation of the work which one Government starts at the expense of the taxpayer.  As regards our air services, I think the proposition is a good thing and I would vote for it to-morrow morning.  I think it is good work.  The one thing we should do is to keep the name of our country before the eyes of <Col N="660" /> the world in every way we possibly can, but let me sound one note of warning.  I am proud of Aer Linte, but might I point out to the Minister that the present seems to be a dangerous time to embark upon that undertaking. I shall give my reasons and the Minister will correct me, if I am wrong.</P>
      <P>Many of our Irish people coming to Ireland and many leaving the country will book in on the Irish planes.  That is only natural to expect, but is there not then a danger that the other air lines, for the lack of passengers, might not operate through Shannon, but bypass it, with dire results for the airport at Shannon?</P>

      <P>It might then be too late, Sir.  It is no harm to utter the warning.  Another thing which the inter-Party Government did before they went out of office was to put certain taxes on luxury goods.  I thought that was a good idea.  The money was wanted very badly, as it is to-day.  I did not agree when the incoming Government took off those taxes.  Had they kept them on, would they not help to-day in giving a better subsidy on our butter?  Maybe they would have helped the limestone scheme.  Possibly they would have helped to subsidise wheat and thus help the wheat growers or to give the employment to our people which is so very badly needed. I was sorry the present Government did it, but they had their own reasons. I believe it was because it affected the big businessman and, at the moment, to Fianna Fáil, the big businessman is a god.  They do not care about any other people in the country.  Furthermore, Fianna Fáil took off the subsidies on the food for the poorer people.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Lands was out during the election.  According to him, there was no knowing what they would do.

      <P>It is not you at all, Sir.  Just a few days after that Government was formed over there, under false promises, the Taoiseach called in some master builders, or whatever they were, and work and <Col N="664" /> building were to advance immediately. What is the position now?  The Estimate this year is £700,000 less than last year.  How will it advance?</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot about Fianna Fáil policies for this and that, but I want to ask the Minister what they intend to do to remedy the present position of the country.  During the last election we heard a lot of talk about their proposals to &ldquo;get cracking&rdquo;. Have they stopped &ldquo;cracking&rdquo;, or when will they start?  That is what I want to know.</P>
      <P>Last July, from the section of the Department of Finance I was in at one time, the Office of Public Works, there was a statement over the radio that there was to be more money for roads. When I took up the Fianna Fáil <i>Pravda</i>, which I have here with me, I read: &ldquo;More money for roads&rdquo;.  I read that under the rural improvement schemes grants there was to be a road into everybody's house.  But what was it?  It was more money for roads, but the men who were to get the roads were to pay the money.  Where we, as an inter-Party Government, had a scheme to grant 90 per cent. of the cost of the road to the house, or 95, or even 100 per cent. in some cases, that has been reduced now and the biggest grant they can get is 60 per cent., where we gave 95.  More money for roads, but the farmers must pay it.  It was not that bunch over there that would pay for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I am.  I see that even the limestone grant is cut.  Last but not least, I want to say to the Minister that there are farmers who require credit.  I know some of the farmers and they are creditworthy people, but if they went to the bank manager the Guards would be sent for or a dog set on them.  There will be no progress until something is done, until the stranglehold is taken off and the banks lend money to creditworthy farmers.  The rate of interest at the moment makes it out of the question. We generally take a leaf from the English book.  Now, in the evening papers&mdash;the one I have is the <i>Evening Herald</i>, but I suppose it is in the <Col N="665" /><i>Evening Press</i> also&mdash;I see the bank rate has been reduced by 1 per cent. in England.  I hope the Minister to-morrow will have the strength to reduce the rate here by 2 per cent. and go one better than the British.</P>
      <P>As we stand at the moment, we have about 90,000 unemployed, and in the past 12 months 57,000 of our people have emigrated; and there is no prospect for them whatsoever.  If that is the work of the past 12 months, if that is the work of the &ldquo;strong&rdquo; Government, if that is the work of the Government which put the 5/- tax on the pig, if that is the work of the Government that wanted an overall majority and if that is the way they &ldquo;get cracking&rdquo;, I hope they will soon clear out and let in someone who will do the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to approach the problem somewhat differently from Deputy Donnellan.  I would just refer to the Vote on Account for a few minutes.  In the figures which the Minister for Finance presented to us a few days ago, as I understand them, there is an apparent lower estimate, compared with the figures we got 12 months ago, of £1.7 millions.  That is largely accounted for by savings under the head of Industry and Commerce, due to the withdrawal of the food subsidies, £1.9 millions; Transport and Marine, a reduction in the grant to C.I.E. and G.N.R., £1.9 millions; and then a reduction in Local Government amounting to almost £1,000,000.</P>
      <P>I take it as a gross saving of £4,500,000, against which we must set off the increase in the Department of Agriculture, £2,500,000, plus some other increases under Aviation, etc., leaving a net difference between this Estimate of the Minister's and the figures presented 12 months ago, of £1.7 millions, as I have just stated.  However, that is after the Minister, in introducing his Budget, had raised taxation by an estimated £3,000,000 and had adopted a net saving of £6,000,000 on food subsidies and other savings, which means, in effect, that, 12 months later, we are presented now with almost the same set of Estimates, after the food subsidies have been withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister's answer will <Col N="666" /> probably be that when he came to examine the Estimates on which he was framing the Budget, he found a deficiency of £6,000,000, and, in order to meet that deficiency and also meet an anticipated increase in expenditure of £3,000,000, he had to find £9,000,000. The fact remains, however, that the only way this Government is able to carry on the services is at the cost of the removal of the food subsidies.  That is what it seems to amount to, in a nutshell.</P>
    <P>Almost 12 months ago, when introducing his Budget, the Minister&mdash;and, I think, quite rightly&mdash;attacked the cost of administration.  In the four days during which I have been listening to the debate here, that point was not mentioned on one occasion.  I listened to discussions on wheat, on milk, on beet and on a lot of matters which had nothing to do with this Vote on Account, but no Deputy, while I was listening, made any reference to what I regard as the key problem, that is, the cost of central and local administration.</P>
    <P>Whether we cut the food subsidies or increase the payment to the farmers under the tuberculosis eradication scheme, when the figures are presented to us, we find that the cost of administration remains at the same figure. Twelve months ago, in his introductory speech on the Budget, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The searching out of wasteful or unnecessary expenditure and its elimination will require keen and continuous attention.  But the urgency and difficulty of our budgetary problem this year required that a start should be made at once. I shall mention a number of specific economies which have already been decided upon but which represent merely an instalment of what the Government hope in time to achieve.</P>
    <P>It will be no surprise that I should begin with the administrative machine.  The present annual cost of the Civil Service, Gardá Síochána and the Defence Forces amounts in round figures to £25,000,000&mdash;almost £17,000,000 for the Civil Service, over £3,500,000 for the Garda <Col N="667" /> Síochána and nearly £5,000,000 for the Army.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have no means at my disposal of knowing what the cost of the Civil Service is, or what the Minister estimates it will be in the coming 12 months.  The cost of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces combined is now £11,000,000.  The Garda Síochána is £4.8 millions, as against the £3,500,000 which, ten months ago, the Minister regarded as too high.  The Defence Forces are costing £6.2 millions as against the £5,000,000 which the Minister then regarded as excessive.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to refer to the total, compared with the total nine years ago, as represented by the Book of Estimates, to find out some comparative costs of administration nine years ago.  It certainly gives very interesting information.  The figures show that the cost nine years ago was £73,000,000 for running this unfortunate country and then the combined cost of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces amounted to 9.3 per cent. of the total cost.  Now, nine years later, it costs 50 per cent. more, at £110,000,000, and the total cost of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána amounts to 10 per cent. of the total.  The Minister went on to say&mdash;and I agree with the Minister in what he was saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are almost 32,000 civil servants, of whom about half are employed in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  An annual bill of £17,000,000 for the pay of civil servants is, however, too much for a country of our size and resources.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am satisfied that action even on these lines will produce a saving of at least £250,000 in the current year and I am taking that saving into account in framing my Budget.</P>
    <P>By the adoption of the most modern methods a reduction in Garda strength has been effected. Every opportunity of further advances in this direction will be availed of consistent with the maintenance of a fully effective force.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the Defence Forces is one which requires <Col N="668" /> special consideration in the light of changing circumstances, but an immediate small economy is possible which, with minor savings elsewhere, should yield £100,000 this year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the Minister goes on to say, quite rightly:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is clear that we have come to a critical stage in our economic affairs.  The policies of the past, though successful in some directions, have not so far given us what we want.  We are not satisfied with the rate at which living standards are being raised and productive and self-sustaining employment provided.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say, and this is important:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is to agriculture we must continue to look as the chief source of exports and the mainstay of our economy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think any Deputy would disagree with that statement.  The Minister continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The raising of agricultural production in volume and in value is, therefore, of vital importance.  In broad terms, increased agricultural production depends primarily on the provision on a wider scale of expert technical advice and assistance, on increased use of fertilisers, improved management of grasslands, more intensive production of home-grown feeding stuffs for conversion into export products, the reduction of costs and, not least, better marketing arrangements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think every Deputy will agree with the latter part of that sentence.  Certainly I was going to welcome the fact that the Minister had made provision almost 12 months ago for £250,000 to improve the marketing of agricultural products, but I do not know what has happened to that money.  Possibly some of it has been spent; if it has I do not know anything about it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position of agriculture, again referring to this interesting Book of Estimates, I find that in 1948-49 the Estimate for agriculture &mdash;which we all agree is the basis of our economy, on which the future prosperity of the country, and of the <Col N="669" /> people, individually and collectively, and their standard of living depends&mdash; including supplementary grants, lands, forestry and fisheries, provided for just over £15,000,000, or 20.5 per cent. of the then Estimates of £75,000,000.  In 1958-59 the Estimates provide just over £18,000,000 under the same headings, or a percentage of 16.9 of the total Estimates of £110,000,000.  In other words, agriculture, the one fundamental item of our meagre resources, on which we should concentrate as much as possible, has gone down from 20.5 per cent. of the estimated expenditure to 16.9 per cent. in the Estimates for the coming 12 months.</P>
    <P>I listened to a number of speakers here and very few of them suggested any constructive method by which the position could be improved.  As I said at the outset, I think the Minister must put first things first and the cost of administration must come down.  I see no hope of putting our house in order unless the cost of administration can be cut down.  I believe the Minister generally started off with that in his mind 12 months ago, but, apart from cutting some of the Estimates, I cannot see where any other apparent saving has been made, or where any effort is made to cut out non-productive expenditure and to channel the money so saved into productive effort.</P>
    <P>I understand that the production of wealth means the application of skill, enterprise and capital to material.  In our case the material is primarily the land.  Unless and until we can save the greater proportion of our national income and devote it to the expansion of agriculture, then our position here will always be as it is at the moment&mdash; an under-developed, under-populated country with its people either unemployed or under-employed.</P>
    <P>The provision of capital can only come from two sources.  One is from our own resources, which means a more stringent standard of living, and the other is to get external capital.  The obvious and only way to do that is to induce external capitalists to come into the country.  I know that incentives have been given in that regard, and I welcome them, but I do not think that they are enough.  I think the Minister <Col N="670" /> will have to give serious consideration to a suggestion already made, both inside this House and outside it, which was to extend the period of the tax-free concession from five years to a longer period.  It would be of considerable interest to outside industrialists if that period were at least doubled to ten years.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies who have spoken laid the blame on the failure of private enterprise to provide an adequate standard of living, and it has been suggested that the State should take a more active participation in the economy of the country.  I think I am correct in stating that this State, which at least gives lip service to private enterprise, takes a greater part in the economy than Socialist or semi-Socialist States, such as Great Britain or Sweden, take.</P>
    <P>I do not think you can have it both ways.  I know that in the present complex, modern economy, the State has to play a greater part in the economy of the country than it had 25 or more years ago, but I think it is up to the Government, or the people, to decide themselves what sections of the economy should be looked after by the State.  The obvious sections are the public utilities, like the railways, Bord na Móna, electricity and so on. But by and large it is, to my mind, to the private side of the economy that we must look to provide the necessary expansion to keep our people employed. While various examples were given, like Bord na Móna, the E.S.B. and the Sugar Beet Company, which are certainly excellent examples, nobody thought of looking to the side of private enterprise industries like Messrs.  Guinness, the Sunbeam Wolsey group and other industries which have survived in spite of intense competition both inside and outside the country.</P>
    <P>One thing certain is that you cannot have it both ways; you cannot have a sort of semi-Socialist economy.  I think you have got to decide which side is going to be Socialist and which you will leave to private enterprise.  You have got to leave private enterprise to do its best and, if it fails, then the Government has got the moral duty to step in. <Col N="671" /> To my mind, it is only under private enterprise that the natural gifts of hard work, initiative and enterprise can be encouraged.  You must give a man a fair reward especially if he is prepared to risk his capital in a doubtful outcome.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is any ideal system which will ensure prosperity for the country.  I know that Deputy Dr. Browne has very fixed ideas on the set-up here, and I agree with a good deal of what he says, but I think that, for quite a few years to come, we must have the political set-up which we have to-day, and it is up to us to make the best we can of it.  Deputy Browne referred in rather scathing terms to the whole idea of free trade.  It does appear that it is now inevitable and I think our industrialists will have to do a lot of new thinking on the whole question.</P>
    <P>A protectionist policy was inaugurated here, especially by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1932.  It did give rise to the setting up of a lot of small units spread throughout the country; it did have the advantage of giving local employment in towns and some cities throughout the country.  From that point of view, it was a very welcome development, but we are now in the position that, when the European Free Trade Area comes into being, these small units will not be able to compete with the larger and more efficient units in continental countries. If the Free Trade Area comes into operation, there must be some consolidation between these small units, if they are to survive in the concept of free trade.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have blamed one side or the other of the House, according to which side the member speaking happened to represent.  I am only a new Deputy, but I cannot help thinking that a lot of the difficulties can be laid at the door of politics.  I do not mean the science of government, but I do mean dishonest politics.  I have listened to Deputies for two days this week, and two days last week, blaming one side or another.  If they just <Col N="672" /> changed sides, I have a feeling those Deputies would make the same speeches.  I think it was Deputy Dr. Browne who said we should change these things now and base our politics on economics and social welfare affairs.  I hope the day when that will happen is not too far away.</P>

      <P>If I can have a minute, I will finish.  I should like to say that the root cause of our difficulties is that our national income is too small. We are trying to take too great a slice out of one small cake.  That is the difficulty which besets us and which has done so for years.  That difficulty will be there until the cake is made bigger, so that every class of the community, particularly the under-privileged, may be given a fairer share.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point raised by the previous speaker of which I did not previously take note.  He spoke of the personnel in mentioning the Civil Service, the Army and the Gardaí.  I think the Deputy is making a wrong comparison.  He is taking the total Defence Vote as if it were solely for personnel.  That comparison is not right.  As regards these savings that I promised to make I think I will be able to say in the Budget speech, when it comes along, that I did succeed in keeping the promise I made on that occasion in regard to savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point I want to refer to is that a number of speakers found it hard to understand how this £6,500,000 had disappeared.  We said last year that we were saving between the two years, part of it last year and the remainder of it this year, £9,000,000 on food subsidies.  Against that we had to provide £2,500,000 for social welfare for certain classes.  That would be £6,500,000 when that sum is deducted <Col N="673" /> from the £9,000,000.  The mistake made by Deputies was to compare the Estimates now with the amended Estimates of last year.  They should have compared them with the Estimates issued at the beginning of last year before the Budget came along. That first issue contained the food subsidies; the second one did not.  On that basis the amount provided for non-capital expenditure in 1957-58 was £102,166,000 and for this year, in the Estimates for the coming year, £98,261,000, which is a difference of £3.9 million.  We have then out of the £6,500,000 actually in the Estimates come down by £3.9 million and that means there will be £2.6 million left to be accounted for, if you like, under that particular figure.</P>
    <P>In these Estimates this year butter subsidy is accounting for £1.1 million, wheat subsidy for £.8 million and bacon subsidy for £.58 million.  That means £2.48 million and that accounts for the difference of £2,500,000 I have already referred to, so that the food subsidies that we got rid of last year, less the amount proposed for social welfare, have been divided in this way so that there has been a saving in the Estimates this year of almost £4,000,000 and there is an expenditure of almost £2,500,000 this year on agricultural subsidies.</P>
    <P>Some of the Deputies speaking about this&mdash;I did not take down names, I just took down the points&mdash;talked about the way that money had been frittered away.  I do not think any Deputy, if he understands the position, will say that the money we have proposed to spend in addition this year on agricultural food subsidies is money that is frittered away.  Another point raised by Deputy Corish, and I think by other Deputies, was that it would appear from the figures published so far that we have a very satisfactory revenue position this year.  This sheet, dated the 18th March, does show on the face of it practically £4,500,000 more revenue over last year.  I must bring Deputies back to the original figure for the year 1956-57.  The actual receipt of revenue in that year was £117.6 million and there was a shortage of practically £5,000,000.  That meant in that particular Budget, in the year <Col N="674" /> before we came into office, the revenue failed to reach expenditure by £5,000,000, and we had to make up that £5,000,000 somewhere or other. In these Estimates, published on the 18th March, it does show revenue higher by £4.6 million than last year. That £5,000,000 I already spoke of has to be caught up on.</P>
    <P>There is another point which must be kept in mind and that is that the expenditure side for the month of March has not been completed.  There was a very big Estimate which came before the Dáil last week of about £3,000,000 for agricultural subsidies and food exports. The greater part of that has not gone into expenditure yet but it has to go in before the 31st March.  It will make a tremendous difference.  My point is that we will not know until the 31st March what total the expenditure and revenue is as compared to last year and, for fear Deputies might lose any money foolishly, I would say to them do not bet on a surplus.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick attached us for cutting the expenditure and said it was done at the expense of the rural people.  That, of course, is very easy to say and it is an especially convenient sort of point for Deputy Blowick to make if he is appealing to the rural people down in Mayo, because the people down there are evidently not very keen on finding out the truth.  The fact is that there was a total decrease shown in the volume here of £5,500,000.  But of that total decrease Industry and Commerce and Transport accounted for £3,500,000 and that leaves a decrease, therefore, of £2,000,000.  If one analyses that further, one finds that it is not at the expense of the rural population.</P>
    <P>Talking about the rural population, one would naturally go to the Vote for the Department of Agriculture, and the Vote for the Department of Agriculture shows an increase of £2,500,000 for this year.  Therefore, Deputy Blowick's point is quite wrong, but I suppose Deputy Blowick is quite satisfied that he made a good point and, whether it is right or wrong does not matter to Deputy Blowick.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy listen to me?  I shall correct many of the statements made on the Opposition Benches.  Deputies on the Opposition Benches should be as interested in the truth as we are; they should listen. Deputy Blowick accused me or the Government&mdash;I do not know which&mdash; of thinking the farmers were doing a disservice to the country by producing too much wheat, butter and bacon.  We never made any such statement.  One Deputy on the Opposition Benches asked: Do we want the farmers to produce more butter?  Of course we do. Why should we have any hesitation in answering that question.  We want them to produce more bacon also.  That is an easy question to answer.  But the question of dealing with surpluses, when they arise, is not nearly so easy as one would gather from the speeches made by Fine Gael Deputies in this debate.</P>
      <P>We have said from the beginning that we want more production.  Deputies on the Opposition Benches have tried to make a joke of that.  We want more production because, if we have more production, there will be a higher national income.  If there is a higher national income somebody, and in all probability everybody, will be better off.  There is no doubt about it; a number of people will be better off if there is higher production.  If there is higher production there will be a better yield from taxation and more for those classes which are now being taken under the wing of Fine Gael, since they went over there, such as the social welfare classes and all the others.  There will be more for health, education and so forth.  But that can be achieved only by having a higher national income and a better yield from taxation all round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are accused of cutting the farmer in his export subsidies.  I suppose we <Col N="676" /> must give Fine Gael credit for wanting to do the best they can and helping us as best they can.  But let us look at the matter from a proper point of view.  There is no cutting.  If you like, we are not following 100 per cent. the increased exports that we think will take place during the coming year. Because of the trend in exports in the last few years, we have made an estimate and we think that exports will be higher still in the coming year.  We say to the farmers that we cannot follow 100 per cent. but we will do the best we can to help them out.  We are not cutting them.  We are giving them more than they got last year and very much more than they got the year before.</P>
    <P>If one goes back before 1956-57 one finds they got nothing at all for the export of butter and nothing for the export of bacon.  We are comparing our figures with the two preceding years; we are giving a lot more than last year and considerably more than that given in the year before. Creamery butter last realised £2,000,000 more than the year before.  In the output of bacon and pigs there was a realisation of £2.2 millions more than the year before.  In the case of cattle, &mdash;this is only relevant in a certain degree, but I am giving the figure now &mdash;the increase was £6.8 millions.</P>
    <P>We are told that we are giving subsidies to everybody else and taking something away from the farmers. What are we giving to everybody else? Fine Gael speakers did not tell us what we are giving.  They talked in a general way: &ldquo;You are giving something to everybody and taking something from the farmer.&rdquo;  We are not.  We are going to give them more in the coming year than they ever got before but, as I say, we came to the conclusion that we would not be able to follow 100 per cent. the subsidies on the exports of milk, bacon, meat, and everything else and we came to the conclusion that we would have to make some cut in the subsidies paid on these particular items.</P>
    <P>In relation to the £22,000,000 received by the farmers for butter last year, we tell them that if their output of butter is what we estimate it will <Col N="677" /> be in the coming year, and that is roughly what it was last year, we, on behalf of the taxpayer, will contribute £1.4 millions and ask them to contribute £7 millions themselves.  We have divided the £2.2 millions subsidy increase in that way.  We are basing that on the assumption that the output of butter will be the same in the coming year as it was last year.  If it goes up, we shall pay more.  If it goes down, we shall pay less.</P>
    <P>We have worked in the same way in relation to pigs.  The output of pigs went up by £2.3 millions.  We say to the farmers that, if they do the same again in the coming year, we shall give them £2.1 millions and ask them to contribute about £200,000.  That is the division there.</P>
    <P>I shall deal with wheat separately because there is a different system. Mention was made of the fact that the farmer got a very much better price for his calf this year than he did a few years ago.  The increase in the value of cattle last year was £6.8 millions so it cannot be said, as some Deputies on the opposite side contend, that the farmers are being cruelly hit in this and that they cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the farmers are impoverished and that we have dealt them this blow when they are not able to take it.  It is a question of dividing the burden between the producer, the consumer and the taxpayer.  We shall leave the consumer as he is.  He will pay the same for his butter and his bacon as he paid last year.  He is not concerned in the deal we are trying to make as between the farmer and the taxpayer.  We are trying to make the fairest deal we can between the producer of butter and bacon and the taxpayer. The farmers were almost £10,000,000 or £11,000,000 better off last year and the question is whether we should tax the taxpayer this year to the tune of £3.5 millions or £2.5 millions. We have decided the figure will be £2.5 millions.  If we decided to pay the full subsidy in the coming year the figure would be £3.5 millions.  I appeal to Deputies to look at this matter in a fair way.  A Government has to try to live up to its obligations to the <Col N="678" /> taxpayer, as well as to the consumer. We have decided that, in that particular case, where the increase in income was between £10,000,000 and £11,000,000 last year, to say to the farmer: &ldquo;We ask the taxpayer to give you £2,500,000 this year, instead of £3,500,000.&rdquo;  We think that is right and we think that the taxpayer has a right to some consideration in this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputies seem to think that the farmers are a lot of fools; they seem to think that the farmers can forget what was done in the past.  They think they are going to take the farmers' vote away from us.  I told one Deputy here this evening that the farmers always vote for us and that is the truth&mdash;the farmers vote for us in any case.  Why would they not?  Take the case of milk for a start.  In the past 12 years, the gallon of milk has gone up from 10½d. to 1/6.  That is an increase of 7½d.  Fianna Fáil put it up by 6½d. and Fine Gael, or the Coalition, put it up by 1d.  Is the farmer going to forget that and listen to the tales of Deputy Blowick and the others who try to persuade them that they, and not Fianna Fáil, are their friends? The farmers know that we are their friends.  They are not going to forget that the only increase they got for milk in the past 12 years was given to them by Fianna Fáil and that the Coalition did little or nothing for them.</P>
    <P>Take the price of wheat&mdash;the price of wheat 12 years ago was 55/- a barrel. It is 72/6 a barrel now.</P>

      <P>We will talk about the coming year later.  During those 12 years, Fianna Fáil put the price of wheat up by 27/6 a barrel and the Coalition put it down by 10/- a barrel. Do Deputies opposite imagine that the wheat-growing farmers, in those circumstances, think that Fine Gael are their friends?  I have been speaking to wheat farmers since this matter was talked of.  I did not expect them to like it and they told me they did not like it, but that they would have to put up with it.  They said that the worst of the matter was that they had no alternative to us, that they would <Col N="679" /> have to vote for us because they were not going to vote for the Coalition. You might as well be idle as looking for their votes.  They will never vote for you again.</P>

      <P>You will get the chance all right.  Deputy Everett said that we ought to give the cheaper butter to our own people and I heard a Fine Gael Deputy say &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; to that.  Suppose we gave the 700,000 cwt. of butter to our own people at the same price as that at which we export it, it would be only fair to assume that the producer would get the same price as he is getting now.  That would mean that if we gave the 700,000 cwt. to our own people, as well as the 200,000 cwt. which we export, it would cost us £9,000,000 instead of the £1,500,000 it is costing us this year.  Where are we going to get that money?  That is foolish talk from people who do not understand these things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We never contemplated, although Fine Gael did contemplate lately, the growing of wheat for export. It was only Fine Gael thought of that.  We started out, when we were in opposition here in 1928 or 1929, to show that wheat could be grown in this country and we were told that it could not be grown.  We were told that if we sowed it, it would not come up; if it did come up, it would be choked by thistles and weeds; that if we did reap it, we could not mill it; if we milled it, we could not bake it; and if we baked it, we could not eat it. These are the people who are now talking to us about growing wheat for export in competition with the great wheat-growing nations of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We knew we could never compete against the great wheat-growing nations of the world, but, in 1932, we set the present wheat policy going. Before that, the present Taoiseach, <Col N="680" /> the present Tánaiste and I were on a committee set up by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government to investigate the question of wheat-growing.  We signed a minority report, hoping that we would get the others to come over to us, stating that we should aim at growing one-half our own requirements, but they would not have that. When we came into office, we said we would grow as much wheat as we could grow towards our own requirements, and when the war came we were glad to have it.  After the war, we again stated our policy that we were aiming at 300,000 tons of wheat per year, but we never at any time said that we ought to export wheat.  I think it would be a bad thing to attempt to export wheat from this country, considering the competition we would have to face.</P>
    <P>We are in trouble now and we have to do something about it.  The Deputies over there have got a hold of the <i>Nenagh Guardian</i> and they are passing it about from one to the other quoting what some farmers said at a Fianna Fáil convention.  There are no closed doors in our organisation.  We expect to meet criticism when we go to our supporters.  When I go down the country, I do not want them to put their hands to their hats and say: &ldquo;Your are doing a good job.&rdquo;  They may say that we are not doing as good as we might do, but they generally end up by saying that we are doing a better job than anybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They always end up by saying: &ldquo;You are doing better than the other fellows, anyway.&rdquo;  The Minister for Agriculture met various farmers' organisations and they adopted an agreed scheme on which they called the married price.  At the same time, he discussed the barley price with them, but he did not take their full advice in regard to barley.  They got 1/- less than they asked for.  Farmers, in fixing prices for barley, are only fixing what one group of farmers must pay another group, if they want it.  When a price is fixed, it means that the Minister must pay that price for the barley, if <Col N="681" /> it is offered to him.  A Minister has a perfect right to make up his own mind with regard to price, after hearing the advice given to him by the various organisations. The Minister for Agriculture got agreement on the wheat price and a difference of 1/- on the barley price.  It is hardly fair to expect that he should lose the confidence of the farmers' organisations on that account.</P>

      <P>I was going there anyway and I am saying it again now, in any case.  Listening to Fine Gael speakers here, you would think that an enormous wrong had been done to the wheat growers.  You would think that Deputy Dillon did not belong to that Party. When he was speaking here he told the House of the condition of agriculture at present.  Every other class was getting something, but the farmers were being cut.  When he came along in 1955 and took 12/6 off the barrel of wheat&mdash;when there was no problem about export&mdash;I said it was a cruel and unjust act, and I still believe it was.</P>
      <P>Does the Deputy want to say now that other classes did not benefit? Does he admit that a year before that they were promising better times for everybody?  In 1955 they claimed they would give better times to everybody, but they took 12/6 off the barrel of wheat.  Deputy Dillon comes along and sheds the proverbial crocodile tears about the farmers at present.  It is a good act.  The Deputy's action represented a cut of £1,500,000.  All the things we are doing at present would not amount to that.  With one stroke of the pen, Deputy Dillon took £1,500,000 from the farmers.  We had to have all sorts of meetings with farming organisations and amongst ourselves. Yet all the cuts put together would not amount to the £1,500,000 Deputy Dillon took with one blow.  Yet he sheds crocodile tears.  It is seldom I can pay a compliment to him, but I have often said he is the best actor in the House.</P>

When they came into office the last time, their Minister for Finance announced officially over the <Col N="683" /> radio that they would bring down taxation by £10,000,000.  We know what happened about that.  They were going to bring food prices back to pre-1952 level.  They were going to cut out unemployment, stop emigration and speed-up housing.  The fellow who wrote this got so tired that he just said at the end, &ldquo;Better times for everybody.&rdquo; These are the men who talk to us about promises.</P>

      <P>Let us take the promised reduction in expenditure.  They put it up, instead of bringing it down.  We brought it down.  They said they would abolish unemployment.  Unemployment had reached a phenomenally high figure when they were going out of office.  At least, we brought it down by 10,000.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon always compares 1957 with 1947.  It shows the unfairness of his mind when he takes a year like 1947 when half the countries in Europe were rationed.  He talks about low production here and winds up with 1957, as much as to say: &ldquo;I did all that.&rdquo; Why not take 1954 when we went out the last time and compare that?  It would be a much fairer comparison.</P>
      <P>There was a lot of talk about employment figures.  It arose because two sets of figures were quoted.  One was in respect of industrial employment in the manufacture of transportable goods and the other in respect of employment in industry generally.  Let us take the figure in regard to transportable goods first, because it is more favourable to us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the second quarter of 1954, when we went out of office, the number employed in the manufacture of transportable <Col N="684" /> goods was 154,417.  When we came in again, in the first quarter of 1957, it was 146,581.  It had gone down by 8,000.  Why compare 1947 and 1957? Is it to give Deputy Dillon a chance of comparing a war year with a peacetime year?  Why not take the year we left office and the year they left office? Since that time, the figure has gone up by 5,000.  We were below at the same time last year, until the last quarter when we had 151,000 people employed, which is the best since June, 1956.  I am saying that figure is very good; we shall take other figures also.</P>
    <P>The year 1954 was the first for many years that agricultural employment remained constant.  It was 455,000&mdash; the same as in 1953.  In 1956, it was 440,000, down by 15,000, and in 1957 it went down to 430,000.  There is not very much change in the trend there, I am sorry to say, but I hope it will improve. In industry and in agriculture, bringing in everything, the number employed in 1954 was 296,000; 289,000 in 1956 and 275,000 in 1957.  These are much more comparable years&mdash;1954 with 1957&mdash;than 1947 with 1957.</P>
    <P>When Fine Gael are making excuses about what happened they always talk about making the balance of payments right, but why did they make it wrong to start with?  In 1951 when we came into office it was £61.6 millions; in 1952 it was £8.9 millions, after a good Budget, but that Budget did not make half the upset that the levies on imports imposed by the Coalition caused. In 1953 it was £7,000,000; in 1954, £5.5 million; in 1955 it went up to £35,000,000 with the Coalition and then to £14.4 millions.  Then the import levies came along and now they are blaming the closing of the Suez Canal for all the hardships created.</P>
    <P>Why did they do these things?  No country had the same troubles so far as we know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The British Government said when the Suez Canal affair was over that it made very little difference to their economy.  The Opposition talks about the cost of living.  In February, 1954, when we left office, the cost of living was 124; in February, 1957 when they left office it was 135, up 11 points. One would think there was no increase in the cost of living when they were in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 142 now, up 7 points. It was up 11 when you were there. Some Deputy asked me about school buildings.  Actually the Estimate provided £1.55 million.  We spent £1.2 million principally due to the fact that an order was given to the Board of Works in the last half of 1956 to stop school building.  Consequently, preparations were stopped and the money could not be spent.  We spent £300,000 less than was provided last year, but the Board of Works now say their plans are going on and that they will be able to spend £1.4 million in the coming year.</P>
      <P>Somebody was rather sarcastic because a Minister talked about private enterprise.  We believe in private enterprise; we are not tied to it.  We believe in it as far as possible and I think the same applies to nearly every Party here.  I am not sure if the Labour Party will agree but we may take it that they do to a certain extent.  It is not an obsession with us.  We have got certain things done by State enterprise but I think we would prefer to get them done by private enterprise if possible, but if it is not possible the State will have to intervene.  It is possible that some State companies may come again as time goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State, however, must help private enterprise in many ways.  The first thing the State does is to give protection to our producers, whether <Col N="686" /> agricultural or industrial.  I should like Deputies to realise that whether the production is agricultural or industrial, the protection on the home market applies in the same way all round.  We try, and I think we succeed, in keeping, let us say, foreign butter, potatoes, eggs, cheese and so on from coming in.  The same applies to foreign vegetables and fruits, so far as these are produced here.  We do protect the market for the agricultural or industrial producer here if he is producing goods for sale at home.</P>
    <P>The State goes further than that. It helps private enterprise by grants in various ways.  There are grants provided in the Estimates of £650,000 for industrial enterprises, for new industries starting wherever they may start, whether in the special areas or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And which you will provide this year on the &ldquo;never-never&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We provide something like £5,500,000 for the relief of agricultural rates, on the other hand, and we give very large grants&mdash;over £2,000,000 worth, I think&mdash;for land drainage, fertilisers, lime and farm buildings. The grants are very big so that as far as private enterprise is concerned a fair amount of money is provided in this year's Estimates just as in any other year.</P>
      <P>Last year also we introduced encouragements for exports; we gave remission of income-tax on the profits on exports of manufactured goods. That will be provided again this year. Some Deputy asked whether the term would be reviewed, but that is a matter more for Budget time than for the present debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This policy of grants should lead to increased production on a stable and permanent basis and, as I <Col N="687" /> have mentioned already, if we get increased production &mdash; which some Deputies think we are overstressing but which I think is essential&mdash;it means we shall have an increased national income on which we can base our taxation and get a better yield in taxation. It will also increase employment and give permanent employment; that is what we should keep in mind.  I know no other way in which permanent employment can be provided.  As I said on the Budget last year, our aim is to raise the standard of living all round by increased production.  We should not look unfavourably, I would say, on a high level of imports and exports so long as the two go up <i>pari passu,</i> because the higher they are the better, as it means a higher standard of living.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Give me a chance to finish.  As long as the level of imports and exports goes up, it means a better standard of living, but it means that we must have the exports to pay for the imports.  That is why it is so necessary to encourage exports of agriculture, as well as exports of industry. Fine Gael may make the other point, and let them make it, if they like, but, in my opinion, there is no reason why producers of butter, for example, could not increase their exports if there is a small reduction in the amount going to them on a large increase of production.  In other words, as I said already, their income for butter last year was £22,500,000.  All we are asking them to pay is £700,000. <Col N="688" /> Surely, £700,000 on £22,500,000 should not discourage exports of butter.  The same applies to the other things that we are dealing with.</P>
      <P>As I said in my Budget statement also, we recognise that it is a very slow job to absorb the unemployed by building industries, building up our exports, and so on, and in the meantime something must be done, and we did provide money.  We provided a fair amount of money for housing.  It was not all taken up.  Those who are on public boards know the position better than I do.  The money was there and it was not taken up.  The Estimate is given for the coming year. It is an Estimate of what may be spent, but I can tell the Dáil now that if more money is needed for housing, it will be made available.  That is only the estimate, but more money will be given, if it is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On roads, we did what we could.  My predecessor found himself in hard straits.  I have sympathy with him in that because I feel like that myself sometimes.  He had to take £500,000 out of the Road Fund, but we put £900,000 back into it last year.  The result was a good deal more money available for spending.  Whether it was all spent or not, I do not know, but I presume it was.</P>
      <P>As I have already explained about schools, we have given as much as the technical staff of the Board of Works say they can spend on schools in the coming year and if that amount can be increased, if they can take more, let us say, they will get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Dáil to vote £36,500,000 on account for the coming year.  In nearly every speech here, the criticism was that we were taking something out; in other words, that we were not spending enough.  I do not think any Deputy made a point that we should cut something out of the Estimate.  It was all &ldquo;put in more&rdquo;, &ldquo;Why do you not spend more?&rdquo;  That was the gist of every speech made, that the provision under certain heads was inadequate.  I did not take notes, but <Col N="689" /> I am quite sure that, if I had taken notes of all the speeches made by the Opposition, where they found fault with this being too low and that being too low and so on, and added them up, we would have a bill for expenditure of £4,000,000 or £5,000,000, or perhaps £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 more for the coming year.</P>
    <P>As far as Fine Gael are concerned, their case is that we should spend £4,000,000 or £6,000,000 more.  That was the sum total of the speeches they made.  There was no suggestion, as far as I know, of any reduction in expenditure&mdash;none at all.  It was all &ldquo;spend more.&rdquo;  In spite of this, I hear people down the country and I read the papers, and I know that everybody is saying, that taxes are too high.  I am quite sure that the Fine Gael <Col N="690" /> Deputies, when they go down the country and meet people who say that, agree that taxation is too high.  How can we keep down taxation if they are pressing for another £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 to be spent in the coming year?  That is the pressure from them at the present time.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Fine Gael are going to vote against this or not. Perhaps I have convinced them that they should not.  If they are, there is no doubt about it that what they are voting for is the expenditure of more money.  That is what they are voting for and I want to make that point.  I want that recorded because it may be useful later on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the question which I raised in the House to-day and taking into consideration the reply from the Minister and in particular his replies to the supplementary questions, does a member, by asking such a question, incur the wrath of the present Minister for Health?  The Minister made mean insinuations to-day. He went so far as to state that I had some old spite against the doctor concerned.  Let me now say, as I stated already to-day, that never once in my life have I spoken to this man and never have I seen this man.  Let me go further in defence of my honour and point out that, when an appointment in a certain hospital was being made recently, a young doctor was a candidate and I was asked to support him.  Because he had the necessary qualifications, I supported him and voted for him.  He happens to be the son of the man against whom the Minister states I have spite.</P>
      <P>The question to-day had a direct bearing on the Health Act.  Members of the Labour Party supported the present Minister and his Party when, as a Government, they introduced the Health Act.  The Labour Party supported the Act because they believed that its introduction and implementation would give the people a better health service.  For that reason, and that reason alone, the Labour Party were united in supporting the then Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the present case, I should point out that it concerned the illness of a baby boy.  His mother <Col N="694" /> attended the doctor in question and, being the possessor of a medical card, asked the doctor to attend the home and examine the baby.  The doctor refused. His statement was that because of the shortage of petrol, he was unable to travel a distance of between two and two and a half miles.  This was at the time of the Suez Canal crisis, and the doctor's excuse was shortage of petrol.  Nevertheless, we all know that even though petrol was rationed at that time, doctors were not denied sufficient quantities of petrol to enable them to attend their duties.</P>
    <P>I have a report from the father of this baby.  He also wrote to the secretary of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance.  As it was my duty as a public representative so to do, I raised the matter at the following meeting. After a discussion it was agreed that the parents should attend at the office of the assistant county manager and put their case before him in writing.  This they did.  The assistant county manager also got a report from the doctor and in that report reference was made to the fact that there had been some dispute of which I knew nothing and know nothing now.  There was some dispute between himself as a doctor and an aunt of the baby in question.  Surely, any dispute which may have occurred between a medical practitioner and a particular patient was not in itself sufficient to warrant the refusal of the doctor to attend the home in this particular instance.</P>
    <P>He went further.  As a last resort, while refusing to attend the home of the patient, he gave a note of admission to the local authority hospital. The baby was brought there and taken into the hospital where it received every possible care.  However, a question arises.  In view of the fact that the doctor did not examine the baby or even see it, what of his diagnosis of the case?  My information is that the diagnosis was wrong.</P>
    <P>The case was then submitted to the Department of Health.  As stated by the Minister to-day, it was sent on the 26th February, 1957.  Let me say this for the Minister for Health.  Credit is due to him for the fact that the letter sent on the 26th February was acknowledged <Col N="695" /> and answered on the 8th March &mdash;roughly a week later.  According to that particular letter, further inquiries were made.  Let me clear the case on this issue.  The letter that was sent out roughly a week after receiving the first letter from the Cork board was sent out not at the behest of the present occupant of the Department of Health.  It was sent out by his predecessor, a man who, by his actions, proved his interest in the case&mdash; Deputy T.F. O'Higgins.</P>
    <P>On the 15th March, the assistant county manager replied to the Department and made it clear that, because some of the questions asked of him in the letter of the 8th March had a direct bearing on certain medical etiquette, it would be impossible for him, as a layman, to answer it.  The Minister's office received that letter on the 16th March.  Then what happened? Nothing was heard in spite of the fact that on many occasions inquiries were made at meetings of the South Cork Board.  The matter was going on so long that a letter was again sent in the month of September asking for further information.</P>
    <P>The letter was sent on the 4th September, but the Department, under the management of our present Minister for Health, acknowledged that letter of the 4th September only on the 26th October.  As stated by the Minister to-day, further letters were sent from Cork to his Department on the 26th November and the 12th February of this year.  In reply, one lonely letter arrived in Cork from the office of the present Minister on roughly the 6th or 7th February this year.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to consider part of the reply given by the Minister to-day. He states that much grave concern is felt, that, to use his own words here, &ldquo;it became apparent that the large number of patients covered by medical cards in the dispensary district in which the complaint arose had a bearing on the issue&rdquo;.  Let me tell the Minister, should he not be aware of it although I do not believe it, that recommendations, submissions and applications in relation to alterations in dispensary districts have been in the <Col N="696" /> Department of Health from the South Cork Board of Public Assistance for at least the past eight or ten years. Unfortunately, the southern committee got no support or little support from either the Department of Health or, indeed, from some of the dispensary officers concerned in trying to improve the situation in these areas. Does the Minister now suggest that people are expected to await the decision of some Minister for Health in the far-distant future before they can expect a doctor to attend to his duties where they concern the holders of medical cards in these areas?</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to know the views of the Minister in this particular case.  The Minister again, in his vicious attitude adopted towards this question to-day, made certain suggestions not alone to me for raising this question but to my colleagues, Deputy Casey and Deputy M.P. Murphy.  On many occasions, considering it to be my duty, I raised this issue at southern committee meetings.  On different occasions I rang the Department of Health.  I got nothing but the greatest co-operation from the officials in so far as they were concerned.  I did all that because this case was going on for so long, and because we could get no decision on it. As far back as the January meeting of that board, the chairman&mdash;a decent, respectable member of the present Government Party&mdash;suggested that the only course open to me was to table a question for reply in the Dáil.  I stated then without any hesitation that I would be slow to adopt such an attitude in so far as it affected an individual case under the Health Act. Ultimately, I had no alternative.  I had to adopt the course I adopted today&mdash;little expecting the type of reply I received from the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that something has happened during the past couple of months.  That is quite true.  An official of the Department of Health, at the request, I presume, of the Minister, called on the parents of this baby. Certain questions were asked.  The irony of it was that each question that was asked had already been answered. The answers to each question had already been submitted both verbally <Col N="697" /> and in writing to the manager of the southern committee by the parents on this particular issue.  Therefore, I am entitled to ask the Minister for what purpose or reason was an official of the Department sent from Dublin to Bishopstown, County Cork, to seek information already at the disposal of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be too long on this discussion.  However, what struck me as most forceful and interesting were the Minister's mean insinuations, to which we are so used in this House, in his reply to a supplementary question by my colleague, Deputy M.P. Murphy, in relation to national records. Surely it had no direct or even indirect bearing on the treatment of a patient?  When national records were required, the member he so rudely interrupted to-day was but a baby in arms.  Some of us, because of our age, cannot claim any connection with a national record.  However, we can openly say that on each and every occasion when we had an opportunity we gave full credit to those people who possessed such a record.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister this question. Does this mean, from his statement to-day, that the holder of a national record can, even when he is a doctor employed by a local authority, with any degree of justification, refuse to attend in the case of the illness of a baby?  Does it mean that the holder of a national record can, at his own discretion, give a note for admission to a hospital without knowing anything about the illness of the baby?</P>
    <P>A good member of Fianna Fáil is dead&mdash;God rest his soul&mdash;a Cork man. As the present Minister for Health knows, he had reason to report a specific instance affecting the same medical officer.  He had reason to fight to the utmost in the Department but, unfortunately, hard fighter as he was, he was forced by certain organisations to drop the case; and the Minister, I am fully convinced, is fully aware of all the facts in relation to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but I would point out that the time for the raising of this question runs from 10.15 to 10.45. <Col N="698" /> That is, the half-hour.  The Deputy still has five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That being the case, is it not strange that one member of this House, now Minister, should when in opposition accuse some of us here of not being interested in the proper implementation of the Health Act?  Is it not with a touch of irony that we had to listen to him to-day defending a person who, under such pretext as I have already mentioned, refused even to see a little baby?  Considering the importance of such an issue, are we now to be told that the Health Act, which was to be so greatly improved by the present Minister and the present Government, provides for the people nothing better than consideration by a medical officer as to whether he should see a patient or not?</P>
      <P>That is the question at issue.  There may be many other cases identical to this; there may be many other cases identical to the one which was fought by Con McGrath&mdash;God rest his soul&mdash; but believe me, let the Minister understand this&mdash;he cannot have it both ways.  In this instance, although I had supported a member of that family for a certain post, I believe that friendship should not come between me and my responsibilities to the public.  I believed that, because I am responsible to the people whom I have the honour of representing, it was my duty to discard friendship in the interests of those people.  Perhaps I differ&mdash;it seems definitely that I do differ&mdash;with the present Minister.  He wants friendship with people, far and above his responsibilities, not as a Deputy in the House but as a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let him understand, therefore, that he may twist his reply; he may accuse members but there is one thing about which he cannot fool the people.  By his very statement here to-day, he made it clear to the House and clear to the people in the country that if a friend of his has a national record, that in itself would be sufficient for that person to say that because of shortage of petrol he could not see a baby, because of shortage of petrol he <Col N="699" /> would give an admission note to a hospital stating in that note that a baby was suffering from a particular complaint, at a time when it had been proved that otherwise was completely the case and the facts were entirely different.</P>

      <P>As I became rather inadvertently involved in the whole matter, I should like to say that it is regrettable and not in the best interests of the House or the best interests of the country that a very serious question, such as that which was tabled by Deputy Desmond to-day, should be responded to in such a manner by the Minister as to make it necessary to bring up this matter on the Adjournment at all.  I think the Minister, as Minister for Health, should be the champion of the person who is in possession of a medical card.  That person is entitled to the free services of a dispensary doctor in accordance with an Act of this House and the Minister for Health should be the champion of that person. He should not view even with suspicion, much less with abuse, a person who endeavours to come along in defence of that person.  I am sorry the Minister handled this in the manner in which he did.  If he had dealt with it in a more serious and more responsible manner, we would not be here at this hour of the night discussing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this question in a responsible way.  Deputy Desmond, who lectured us for 20 minutes, dealt with it in a completely irresponsible way, in a partisan way.  The doctor concerned in this case did not refuse assistance.  The supplementary question to which I gave the reply to which Deputy Desmond has objected was this:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the fact that the Minister has the full file in front of him, is he still satisfied that a <Col N="700" /> medical officer can refuse assistance to a person covered by the card?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This medical officer did not refuse assistance.  He saw the mother of the child.  The mother of the child described the symptoms to him and, in view of what she said, he warned her that the condition of the baby was serious and that the best thing to do was to remove it at once to hospital, and he gave her a ticket to St. Finbarr's Hospital.  I have asked some medical advice on the matter and I am told that very many doctors would hold that, in the circumstances as I have described them, that was the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>I have to deal justly with everybody &mdash;with patients, with those who complain about doctors, and with doctors. I have to hold the scales evenly.  There is an extraordinary conflict of evidence in this case, even as between the father of the child and the mother of the child.  Deputy Desmond has told the House that certain statements were taken from the three persons concerned in this matter&mdash;from the mother of the child, from the doctor concerned, and there was a written statement from the father of the child.  The father of the child said this in his written statement&mdash;of which Deputy Desmond apparently has had a copy.  I think perhaps he may have written it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Mrs. Finnegan, the mother of the child, said to the doctor and to my inspector&mdash;she stated to the assistant county manager and to my inspector&mdash;to two people&mdash;that the child had been ill with green diarrhæa for seven days.  Now, I said there was a conflict of evidence in this case.  There is a conflict between the parents of the child, between the parents themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing that arises is that he said that the wife took the medical <Col N="702" /> card to the house of the doctor concerned and the wife claimed that she described the symptoms.  The wife herself says in her statement that she described the symptoms to the doctor concerned&mdash;and she described them to the doctor in the same terms as she described them to my medical inspector. As a result of that description, the doctor came to the conclusion that the best thing for him to do, the best thing for the child, particularly having regard to the circumstances under which these people live, was to have the child removed immediately to hospital; and he gave her the card.</P>
    <P>In her statement the mother of the child then proceeded to inform both the assistant county manager, and my inspector subsequently, that she met a person who told her that the case was serious in view of the symptoms which the child was manifesting, so she then got a car and brought the child to another doctor.</P>
    <P>Now, why did she not bring the child to the doctor to whom she had recourse in the first case?  That, I think, is something that wants some explanaion. Why did she not do that?  It was as easy for her to take the child to the dispensary doctor concerned as to another doctor.</P>
    <P>A third discrepancy arises.  In her statement, she said that this other doctor gave her a prescription which cost her 19/-.  Four days later, the cost of that prescription had increased to 33/-.  She also said that the doctor to whom she brought the child had charged her a fee.  At first, she was not prepared to state what the fee was, but four days later she stated that she had been charged £1.</P>
    <P>The doctor against whom these accusations are made stated, first of all, that he did not say anything about petrol. The only person who could have heard that observation, if it was made, was the child's mother.  I think the facts which I have recited to the House indicate that, after all, if her statement was uncorroborated, as it was, the denial of the doctor should at least carry equal weight with me.  As I have said, I have got to do equal justice between all parties in the case and I am not going to prejudice the decision <Col N="703" /> which I shall make in due course.  I have also, however, to take another matter into consideration&mdash;the circumstances in which the board, of which Deputy Desmond is a member, compelled this doctor to work.  I think he is responsible for the medical care of between 6,000 and 7,000&mdash;if not over 7,000&mdash;persons who are covered by medical cards.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state the present position with regard to future housing schemes in Limerick City, whether any proposals are before his Department for approval for the Limerick Corporation, the details thereof, and the present position with regard to Compulsory Purchase Orders being sought by that body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the position regarding future housing schemes in respect of which proposals have been submitted to the Department by the Limerick Corporation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Upper Carey's Road&mdash;75 houses: Revised plans were submitted to the Department on 7th March, 1958, and were approved on 14th idem.  Well Field&mdash;54 houses: Preliminary plans were submitted on 7th March, 1958, and are, at present, being examined by the Department's technical advisers. It is hoped that a decision on the plans will issue at an early date.  School site at Garryowen&mdash;51 houses: Correspondence has been proceeding between the Department and the Limerick Corporation regarding the latter's proposal to build 51 houses on a site reserved in the planning of the Garryowen scheme for use as a school site.  The Department's view was that the site should not be built on until it was clear that it would not be required for a school.  The city manager indicated on 4th March, 1958, that the school authorities do not propose to use the site for a school.  In these circumstances it has been decided to agree, in principle, to the erection of houses, and the Department's technical advisers have been requested to examine the housing layout submitted by the corporation as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Two Compulsory Purchase Orders are at present before the Department:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> The Garryowen Area No. 1 Compulsory Purchase Order, 1957, was received on the 16th November, 1957, and the final documents relating to the Order on the 11th December, 1957.  Only one objection to the Order was received and this was subsequently withdrawn. The Order includes a clearance area and arrangements have been made for one of the Department's inspectors to visit and report on the area.  On receipt of his report a decision will be reached without avoidable delay.</P>
    <P>The Garryowen Area No. 2 Compulsory Purchase Order, 1957, was received on the 16th November, 1957, and the final documents relating to the Order on the 11th December, 1957.  A number of objections to the Order have been received and an inquiry has been arranged for Wednesday, 16th April, 1958.  On receipt of the inspector's report on the inquiry the Order will be determined as quickly as possible.</P>
