      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will arrange for the inclusion of the West Limerick coalfields in the proposed three year geological survey of coalfields in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention that the survey should be carried out in the Leinster and Connaught coalfields which are the areas calculated to give the best results for the moneys which will be expended.  I am aware that there are some indications of the existence of coal deposits in West Limerick and elsewhere, but in view of the limited funds which are available it would not be practicable to extend the scheme to include areas where the prospects of discovering economic deposits of coal are less than in the Leinster and Connaught coalfields.</P>
      <P>I am, however, prepared to facilitate private interests in exploring the coal deposits in the West Limerick coalfield and, in fact, I have been given one concern two prospecting licences for coal exploration in the Newcastle West area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Excluding the licences held by the railway companies, there are at present 957 merchandise licences current. Details of these licences vary so widely that there is no basis on which it would be practicable to prepare a statistical analysis.  The Deputy may, however, wish to refer to the report of the Committee of Inquiry into <Col N="421" /> Internal Transport, 1957, which was presented to Dáil Éireann on the 11th May, 1957.  Paragraphs 269-276 of that report give considerable general information about merchandise licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Bourke received an increase of 5/- per week in his British Army pension? As a result of that increase of 5/- per week, the Department of Social Welfare reduced his old age pension by 5/- per week and also reduced by 5/- per week the blind pension payable to his wife.  Is the Minister satisfied that that type of reduction should occur where the British Government, or any other foreign Government, increases a pensions by 5/-?  Is the Minister satisfied that this State should save 10/- at the expense of poor people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state for what purpose the excavations are being made on the north side of St. Stephen's Green; and whether he is satisfied that the amenities of the park will not be permanently injured by the work which is proceeding or the results thereof.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The excavations to which the Deputy refers are being made by the E.S.B. for the construction of a transformer sub-station.  The board has represented to the Commissioners of Public Works that the increasing load in the Stephen's Green area had made the erection of a sub-station adjacent to the top of Grafton Street essential for the maintenance of electricity supply in the area.  The board had failed to <Col N="424" /> obtain an alternative site; and the commissioners agreed to make an alternative site available in the shrubbery on the north side of the Green between Dawson Street and Grafton Street subject to the conditions, <i>inter alia,</i> that the sub-station would be underground and, on completion, that the ground would be restored and any damage made good.  I am satisfied that the amenities of the park will not be permanently injured by the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in inferring from what the Parliamentary Secretary says (1) that there will be no superstructure visible and (2) that there will be no continual ingress and egress from this sub-station?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Number (2) of the conditions states that the sub-station is to be underground and in accordance with plans approved by the commissioners. There will be a special gate, locked, of which the E.S.B. and they alone will hold the key.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that a large lump of Stephen's Green is being appropriated to the E.S.B.?  This is the whole evil of which I am apprehensive. Do I understand from the Parliamentary Secretary now that we are to have a large square of Stephen's Green railed off with a lock and key, ingress to which is prohibited to the public and reserved for the E.S.B.? If it is, it is a scandal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not given the Deputy to understand any such thing. This is an underground station and I have been assured by the commissioners that the condition of the ground as it now is will be restored.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>And that ingress and egress to and from this place will have to be provided specially for the use of the E.S.B. and that is being done by means of a special gate.

      <P>I put down this question in order to reassure the public, believing I would get from the Parliamentary Secretary the kind of answer that I hoped to get, that this would not prevent anybody having access to the Green as they now have.  Now I am told by the Parliamentary Secretary that there is to be a gate and a lock. I want to know what is the gate on and against whom is the lock devised? If the Parliamentary Secretary says to me that when this job is finished nobody will see any difference in the Green, I am quite content, but if he says that the creation of this subterranean station requires the erection of some kind of paling with a gate and lock in it, then I think it is a blooming scandal.</P>

      <P>Apart from the fact that it is not exactly clear from the terms of the question how the words &ldquo;percentage of children,&rdquo; should be interpreted, I wish to explain that to obtain full statistics which would enable me to furnish the information requested by the Deputy in relation to children of a particular age-group or groups, it <Col N="429" /> would be necessary (i) to examine the birth record of each pupil in secondary and vocational schools; (ii) to ascertain from each school the home addresses of its pupils, since the school being attended by a particular child and its, home may not be in the same county and (iii) to ascertain the number of children of each age-group in each county.  I do not feel that the time and expenditure involved in such a process would be justified.</P>
      <P>With a view, however, to assisting the Deputy, I propose to include in the Dáil Reports a table showing the number of pupils (a) from each county who were in attendance at secondary schools and (b) in each of the areas mentioned by the Deputy who were in attendance at full-time courses in vocational schools, in the school-year 1956-57.</P>

      <P>When the House rose last night I was speaking about the poultry industry, and I think we have discussed Deputy Dillon's white turkey.  That is as far as we can go because those of us who represent dairying interests in certain parts of the country are aware that when we get into the poultry section we are encroaching on the housewives' department. That is something in which we should not interfere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the risk of repeating myself, my excuse being the magnitude of the problem and its importance to the nation, I want to refer again to the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme. Quite sincerely, I wish to tell the <Col N="436" /> Minister that members of the agricultural community in the dairying parts of the country feel they are being asked to bear the brunt of the expense in replacing their herds and in the provision of farm buildings.  These are the two major problems involved for the dairy farmer.  It is surely realised that one cannot even attempt to tackle eradication without completely reviewing one's buildings, stalls and cowhouses and I am afraid that 80 per cent. of them must either be renovated or replaced. That, I regret to say, is the case even in respect of cowhouses erected by dairy farmers at very considerable expenses up to three or four years ago and according to plans which satisfied the Department then.  Those unfortunate people are now faced with either building new cowhouses or having the existing ones completely changed about and reconstructed.</P>
    <P>Through the Minister, I want to suggest to the Department that it should consider producing plans for the minimum type of house that will be satisfactory from the point of view of the scheme for the benefit of those farmers who are in the position I have mentioned.  So far as I know, nobody yet knows what type of building must be erected for dairy cows so that they will be safe. It is a very important matter in the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  The difficulty in doing anything about these cowhouses is that people do not know what they should do and some draft plan or plans should be circulated by the Department to the creamery areas.  These creameries have been asked to co-operate in the scheme and have been given certain literature to send out to their suppliers. I think if that literature were distributed and accompanied by some suggestions with regard to housing the animals, as well as suggestions about having the herds examined immediately, it would at least give some encouragement to people who feel they are bearing the brunt of the expense and that the Department is not taking a real interest in their problems.</P>
    <P>I think they feel rightly that the greater need for the scheme exists in the fact stock cattle trade or store cattle trade rather than among the dairy <Col N="437" /> herds.  After all, it is the problem of the exporters as much as, if not more than, it is the problem of the dairy farmers.  I appreciate, of course, that if the price of store cattle falls it will boomerang on the dairy farmer but it also leaves him in the position that he is the man who gets all the trouble, and the man who has an easy task is in the happy position that he can get out of the problem easily.</P>

They still have that confidence in him and believe that he will deal with the difficulties properly and honestly and in such a way that they will know exactly what is happening.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moher told us that the only <Col N="438" /> hope for economic survival is increased agricultural production.  He stressed the point that everybody, whether living in the city or the town, depended for his standard of living on the farmers' ability to increase production and export profitably.  I also agree with him in the statement that almost the only things we can export profitably are live stock and live-stock products. Everybody will agree then that it is the duty of the Minister for Agriculture in any Government in this country not alone to increase the numbers of live stock on the land but also to put the land into such condition that it will be capable of feeding extra live stock.  If Deputy Moher examines his Party's record in that respect, I think he will not be a member of Fianna Fáil very much longer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJBurke" hpid="Mr. J.J. Burke Mr. J.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should ask him to examine the position in 1948.  Fianna Fáil had 16 years&mdash;unbroken, I might say&mdash;in office and what was the position? There were fewer cattle, fewer sheep and fewer pigs on the land than in any year since the famine and the land was never in such a state of dereliction.  At that stage nothing had been done for agriculture.  There was no land reclamation scheme, no ground limestone, no soil testing; no proper cattle agreement.  In short, nothing had been done to help to increase agricultural production.  The inter-Party Government took over in 1948. I shall not weary the House by reminding Members of the very many good things done for agriculture. I shall just mention that when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture he introduced the land reclamation scheme which gave us an extra 1,000,000 acres.  He introduced the ground limestone scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every farmers will agree that soil testing facilities are absolutely necessary. We hear about neglect of land and how it should be manured.  You have no business putting manure on land unless you can first test it and see what manure it requires.  Deputy Dillon provided first class soil testing facilities.  When he expected the land was ready to feed more cattle and <Col N="439" /> sheep, he did not sit back and do nothing.  There is no use in having more cattle and sheep unless you can sell them at a profit.  His greatest achievement, which is paying dividends to the present day, was the 1948 Agreement negotiated with the British Government.  People do not realise the importance of that agreement at all.  They do not realise that the gradual increase in the price of cattle since the war is due entirely to that agreement.  During the war, due to circumstances outside the control of any Minister, cattle prices went up and down.  That agreement, by tying our price to the British price, put all the farming organisations in Britain working for us.  The moment the British farmer got a rise, we automatically got the same rise.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the only hope for our economic survival is increased production.  What are the Government doing about that at present?  The food subsidies were removed last year and the Government set about compensating various sections of the community for the increase in the cost of living which resulted. Almost everybody got an increase. They forgot that the farmer, too, eats bread and butter and that his cost of living had gone up more than that of anybody.  The removal of the subsidies put up the cost of running institutions. In Roscommon we got a supplementary estimate for Ballinasloe mental hospital which cost us about 4d. in the £ on the rates.  The farmer has to pay extra because of the removal of subsidies, yet the Government are giving him less for almost everything he has to sell.  He is getting less for wheat, barley, pigs and milk.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government to remember that the production of cattle and live stock is the only industry bringing any real wealth to this country.  They should be more careful about how they handle it and not carry on as they did in 1956.  There was no fear of a crash in 1956 but there was a slump in prices due to the dumping of Argentine meat in Britain.  Everybody with common sense know that would <Col N="440" /> pass, if we held on and fought.  Fianna Fáil papers tried to crash the whole cattle industry with their slogans of &ldquo;Cattle Boom Over&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bottom Falls Out of Cattle Prices.&rdquo;  They did a grave disservice to the farmers of Ireland and I hope they have learned their lesson.</P>
    <P>There is very little use increasing production unless we have proper marketing facilities.  We were all delighted last year when £250,000 was allocated for finding new foreign markets and improving existing ones. But everybody was amazed to find out that only £100 of that had been spent. It was typical of the Fianna Fáil attitude to agriculture down the years. They just did not bother about it.  We may not have done everything right but Deputy Dillon did his best to improve the marketing and price of cattle. We found a market in France for some of our lambs.  We tried to negotiate a trade agreement with Germany.</P>
    <P>I would like if the Minister would tell us what happened to that agreement or what effort is being made to maintain the French trade.  It is very foolish to import a big quantity of goods from Germany&mdash;I understand about £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 worth&mdash; and sell them in return nothing worth talking about.  The Minister and the Government should insist on their taking a certain amount of our produce and, if not, they should consider putting some ban on their goods coming in.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister for cutting the price of wheat, if he found it necessary to do so for the welfare of everybody concerned.  But I do blame him for misleading the farmers.  I shall not weary the House by talking about promises or anything like that.  The attitude of Fianna Fáil to the cut in the wheat price during the inter-Party régime did a lot of harm and is responsible for much of the surplus we have to-day.  We had to cut the price.  We told the people quite clearly why and what the cut would be.  Fianna Fáil gave the people to understand that not alone would there not be any further cut but that the price would be restored. People went in for wheat on a <Col N="441" /> wholesale scale under the impression they would get a great price.</P>
    <P>The system the Minister is adopting to deal with wheat is entirely wrong. That system will suit the big farmers with combines.  Whether they be conacre men or not, they can do with a much lesser profit than the man growing two or three acres.  If they make £4 or £5 per acre profit they can carry on and force the small man out.  Next year everything will be grand for them when they have forced the small man out.</P>
    <P>I understand surplus wheat is being exported at £18 10s. per ton while our farmers have to pay £23 per ton and take six ton lots.  It is wrong to expect our farmers to pay more than the price at which the foreigners can buy it.  The Irish farmer could feed his pigs much more cheaply if he got it at £18 10s. per ton.  The small farmer cannot take six ton lots.  He may not have storage; he may not have the money or he may not want that amount at all The Minister should see that it would be made available to him in much smaller lots.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the question of credit for small farmers.  When Deputy Dillon was Minister he introduced a very good scheme whereby farmers up to a certain valuation could get credit to the extent of ten times their valuation.  Deputy Dillon was big enough to admit that there was a very serious weakness in that scheme.  We found that farmers who had not paid their rents on two successive gale days were debarred from the scheme.  Most people will agree that the fact a farmer does not pay his rent punctually does not mean he is not an industrious farmer.  To my mind that is a sign that he is a progressive and industrious farmer.  He is trying to put the few pounds he has got together back into the land.  I am sure that many members of this House have got these unpleasant 14 day notices; I know that I have got them myself in my time.  That does not mean that the farmer who receives one is a person who is not creditworthy. I once heard a person looking for one of these loans say: &ldquo;You will get a loan from these fellows if <Col N="442" /> you can prove to their entire satisfaction that you do not need it.&rdquo;  That man was quite right.  It is no use giving credit to people who do not need it&mdash;give it to the farmers who do need it.</P>
    <P>I wonder is there any hope that the Minister will fix a minimum price for potatoes and oats?  Potatoes and oats are the small farmer's crops and if anything could be done about fixing a minimum price it would be helpful both to the people in the towns and to the producers.  We all know what happened about the price of potatoes over the last two years.  Last year, in West Roscommon, potatoes were rotting in the ditches because the people would not buy them.  This year they were 25/- per cwt. because the farmers had gone out of productions due to the bad price the previous year.  That was a blow to the farmer and to the people in the towns.  If some kind of a fair price could be guaranteed&mdash;the price itself would be a matter for the Minister, but I would suggest about £12 a ton&mdash;it would be a help to the farmer and to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister should review the cut in barley prices.  His action in cutting the price was very foolish.  It would be desirable to have an increased price for barely, because it would encourage the people to grow more barley instead of wheat.  That would prevent our having to import maize for feeding and would leave us with a smaller surplus of wheat.  I think the Minister should reconsider his attitude towards barely prices.</P>
    <P>We all say that the farmer needs technical advice and that is quite true. That advice has been made available in several ways.  It was made available in a small way through the county committees of agriculture but I was not satisfied with what happened in that respect.  We had a few very good officers but not nearly enough.  I saw officers of the county committees of agriculture going around giving lectures.  That was all they had time to do and the people just went to the lectures, listened to them, came out and said: &ldquo;That was a very fine lecture,&rdquo; and did nothing about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> A parish agent is in a different position.  He has time to go out and he will find among the young farmers, men with 25 and 30 acres of land, some who are willing to allow their farms to be used as pilot farms.  I have seen young farmers with 25 acres doing everything that the parish agent told them to do and as a result their incomes were almost doubled.  When the neighbours saw that, they soon got the parish agent to come to themselves. It is only by demonstration that you will get results.  You will not get them by giving lectures.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I am entitled to refer to the Local Authorities (Works) Act in connection with this Estimate but I shall mention it only in passing. I should like the Minister to consult with his colleague and try to get those grants restored.  The abolition of those grants has held up a number of land reclamation projects.  The Minister should see if something can be done to get them restored.</P>
    <P>I do not know much about the Agricultural Institute but we are hoping for great things from it. However, the method by which the five members will be selected does not give us hope for an awful lot.  Progressive farmers' organisations such as Macra na Feirme will only have the same representations as the Federation of Bee-keepers and the Federation of Rural Workers.  These are good organisations in themselves but they are not nearly as representative as Macra na Feirme.  That matter should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>We all agree that the improvement of grass land is one of the most important factors affecting production in this country.  The best way of improving grass land is by manuring it. While I agree that there is a scheme to provide facilities for farmers who have not the necessary capital to buy manure there is a clause in that scheme which prevents many farmers from availing of those facilities.  Under the scheme the farmer must have his entire farm tested and must have the entire farm manured.  Many of them are not willing to have that done.  There should be some method by which a <Col N="444" /> farmer will be allowed to manure a portion of his farm under the scheme. When he sees the results there will not be much difficulty in getting him to do the rest of his farm eventually.</P>
    <P>I do not understand very much about the milk situation as I do not come from a milk-producing part of the country but I do know that the milk question is bound up with our whole cattle trade.  The big danger is that if you reduce the price of milk, you will reduce the number of cows and that will lead to a reduction in the number of store cattle in the country. If that happened it could have a very serious effect on our whole economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moher mentioned that there was too much money spent on machinery.  I agree with that as far as the small and medium farm is concerned. There are farmers who own tractors and expensive machinery costing up to £1,400 and £1,500 and they have not work for them for one-third of the year.  This is jeopardising not only their own financial position, but the financial position of the nation because every penny spent on buying those tractors and the fuel to run them is going out of the country.  If the small and medium-sized farmers were encouraged to retain their horses it would be for their own benefit and the benefit of the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word about the scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  Some people say it is very necessary and some say it is all cod.  However, it does not matter which is right because the customer is always right.  Britain is our customer for live stock.  There, they say that they will have the country cleared by 1961 and they will not allow in any more non-attested cattle.  It is up to us, whether or not we agree with them, to have our cattle attested as speedily as possible.  I can assure the Minister it is the wish of the farmers in Roscommon that clearance should start immediately.  I think the order is for 1st July; the people in Roscommon will be glad to have it enforced on that date.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain <Col N="445" /> how store reactors will be disposed of. We know what becomes of reactor cows.  Reactor stores may present a difficulty in the clearance area.  What will be done with them?  Will they be permitted to be sold at the local fairs? What will be the method of disposal? It is very wrong to allow non-attested young cattle into a clearance area. Under the present system, any beast up to a year is allowed in.  That means in reality any beast up to two years because no veterinary surgeon or anybody else can say what a yearling is. These young cattle are coming in mainly from the South, which, I understand, is reeking with bovine tuberculosis. There is no point in our spending money clearing out farms if these non-attested young cattle are then allowed in.  The Minister should take steps to ensure that they will not be allowed in.</P>
    <P>In passing, I want to mention one matter.  I do not think very much can be done about it now, but it is generally accepted that if one wants to eradicated bovine tuberculosis proper housing is one of the first requisites. The Minister was very foolish in abolishing the double byre grant.  He should have left that grant and so encourage farmers to put their byres into proper condition before implementing the scheme for eradication.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to mention&mdash;here is where Deputy Moher and I disagree; it is about the only place&mdash; is the scarcity of good Shorthorn breeding heifers.  That shortage is due mainly to the high price paid for beef stores. It is virtually impossible at the moment to get a good Shorthorn heifer.  People interested in milk production claim that we should have Friesians.  The argument is put up that the Friesian will make as good a store beast as any other.  Again, the customer is right. I can assure the Minister that the Scottish farmer will not buy a Friesian if he can get an Aberdeen Angus or a Hereford-Shorthorn cross.  He certainly will not take a Friesian.  Our main industry is the export of store cattle. Milk and dairying are only secondary. We must, therefore, have a cow which will produce a reasonably good store beast, even though she may not produce as much milk as a Friesian or <Col N="446" /> some other milk breed.  I do not know how the Minister can ensure that these heifers will always be available, but I suggest that, in conjunction with the Minister for Lands, he should take over some of the farms the Land Commission have and breed Shorthorn heifers. The State would be at no loss, because, as the Minister knows, the price of calves is very high and the revenue from the stock would pay for any State expenditure.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like the Minister to ensure that the date fixed, namely 1st July, for the clearance area will be enforced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me&mdash;I am not a farmer&mdash;that we are after all these years evolving a consistent agricultural policy.  That is the impression I have gained, having listened to the remarks on both sides since the Minister introduced his Estimate.  The House as a whole, irrespective of political alignment, has come to accept the fact that a great deal of the prosperity of this country depends on our all-important cattle trade.  Views expressed on this subject 20 or 25 years ago have been reconsidered in the light of circumstances as they exist to-day and as they have existed for a number of years past.</P>
      <P>It is also accepted that we should in fact grow the greater proportion of our wheat requirements and it is certainly encouraging to a neutral like myself to listen to Deputies on both sides speaking in glowing terms of the idea of having a loaf baked from 100 per cent. Irish wheat.  I do not think the same unanimity would have existed on this subject a few years ago.</P>
      <P>Our experience over the past 30 years has taught us there are certain things we must have in our agricultural policy.  There are certain things we cannot put into effect, however desirable they may be.  However well they may sound from public platforms, putting them into practice is a different matter altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be an extremely dangerous thing to interfere with our all-important cattle trade.  I would naturally, and so would everybody in the House, like to see a greater proportion of our cattle going out as fact cattle or, better <Col N="447" /> still, as carcase meat, but, in this regard, we are willy-nilly at the mercy, if I may use the expression, of our almost lone customer, Great Britain. Our policy should be to hold on to what we have and to endeavour to expand outside markets, particularly with this concept of a Free Trade Area now coming near fruition.</P>
    <P>I notice from the very interesting notes prepared by the Minister's Department, we have, in fact, been increasing our export of carcase meat to countries other than Great Britain. It seems to me it is along these lines we are likely to increase our processed agricultural commodities.  Our nearest neighbour will take from us only what will suit her and it is no use kidding ourselves that what we want Great Britain to take she will take.  She will take only what she wants and she will pay for it on that basis; she will arrange her price differentials to suit the particular type of live stock she wants from us.  We have no option but to accept the situation as it is, unless we are prepared to take very drastic steps and disrupt our whole economy.  We are not in a position to do that at this stage of our history.</P>
    <P>Eventually, I hope a greater proportion of our people will be employed in manufacturing industry and that our exports of manufactured goods will rise, making us less completely dependent, as we are at present, on the export of live stock.  That may be many years hence, but as long as we are dependent on the export of live stock on the hoof in relation to our trading returns and our balance of payments, we must accept the position as it is and make the most of it.  We must produce as many cattle as we can, young forward cattle, and get the best possible price we can for them.</P>
    <P>The returns of exports this year follow in general the pattern they have followed over the years.  Exports of agricultural produce are the biggest proportion of our exports.  They help us to pay for our industries, old and new.  In that figure for agricultural exports, commodities attributable directly to the dairying section of our agricultural sector predominate, as <Col N="448" /> they have always done and, as far as I can see, as they always will.  That brings to the forefront a subject mentioned by many Deputies here and one which particularly affects my own constituency, Limerick, that is, the importance of the dairying industry. This year the Minister increased the levy on butter in order to subsidise to some extent the loss on the export of creamery butter.  On all sides of the House it was accepted that, if we are to maintain agricultural exports, particularly of cattle, we must maintain the dairying industry; we must maintain the place of the cow in the agricultural industry.  That is why I feel &mdash;I expressed the view at the time&mdash; that there is a minimum price below which it would be extremely dangerous to go for the price of milk.  I do not know whether that figure has been reached now or not.  If it has not, it must be very close to it.</P>
    <P>This is not merely a matter of economics, of just knocking off four-fifths of a penny or a penny at a time. It is a question of the actual people engaged in the dairying industry.  I know many of them.  They live all around my constituency.  Many of them are families who have carried on the dairying industry generation after generation because their forefathers were in it, not for the small return that they got out of it.  It is possibly the hardest type of agricultural work. It involves working seven days a week 52 weeks of the year, year in and year out.  If these people decide to go out of dairying as a result of the price of milk being reduced to too low a figure, nobody will step in and take up their position.  Once the traditional dairying link is broken, no new people will step in and take up such a task, not nowadays when the whole idea seems to be to demand shorter hours, bigger pay, easier times and more amusements. Succeeding generations will not take up where the dairy farmer left off, if he has to leave off.</P>
    <P>I would have hoped that in the Minister's speech, and also in the notes issued by the Department, reference could have been made to what I regard as a crying necessity, the question of providing land for young men who <Col N="449" /> would make first-class farmers. Although not a farmer, I come into touch with these people.  The question of providing them with land on some basis or other, either by renting it to them or selling it to them on a long term repayment system, should be considered.</P>
    <P>Recently a clerical worker on the railway came to me to ask me how his son could purchase land.  His son had no connection with land but had gone to the Salesian College in County Limerick for a year because he had a natural love for the land.  He could not acquire land.  There is no system by which a young man like that, a born farmer, could buy land.  He decided to go to the United States to work for five or six years to earn enough money to enable him to come home and buy a farm.  There must be hundreds, if not thousands, of intelligent, hard-working men all over the country who would make excellent farmers&mdash;indeed, if I may say so, far better farmers than some of the men who fell in for land for one reason or another over the past 25 years and whose farmers are a complete disgrace now.  All over the country there are small farms that are not being utilised, which are deteriorating into the condition in which they were before they were divided. That is the case in almost every county.  At the same time there are young men who would be only too glad to take off their coats and work these small farms and make them productive.</P>
    <P>I was hoping, also, that the Minister might touch on the thorny problem of conacre.  I know that the previous Minister, Deputy Dillon, had very strong views on that subject and I quite agree with him.  The principle of conacre is completely wrong.  Anyone who can afford to let land on the 11 months system should be deprived of that land by a system of taxation or should be made to dispose of the land to people who would work it intensively and settle down and bring up families on it.</P>
    <P>The question of credit for small farmers has been mentioned in the debate.  There are credit schemes for small farmers but it is very difficult for the small farmer to get money even <Col N="450" /> under these credit schemes.  We all know how difficult it is even for a businessman to get money.  He must provide sureties and prove that he is credit-worthy.  By the time he has proved his credit-worthiness and the fact that he is an honourable person and will repay the money, the necessity for the loan is almost past in many cases.  These credit schemes are all excellent in theory; it is in putting them into practice that the difficulty arises.  I suppose they are difficulties which arise when one must go to a State or semi-State institution to get money for any purpose.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties under which the small farmers, in particular, operates is the under-capitalisation of his farm.  That is ties up with credit.  I have already mentioned that, in theory, it is possible to get credit but, in practice, it is a difficult and slow business.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned agricultural marketing.  I completely agree with the views expressed here but I often with that farmers, instead of looking to the State to provide a means of selling their produce abroad, would themselves go out and sell it. The same rule applies to the farmer as applies to the businessman.  If a man wants to sell an article which he has produced, the best means of doing it is to go out himself or to send somebody representative of him as one of a group.  That brings him closer to the customer and establishes contacts that no intermediary of a semi-State nature can establish.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Agricultural Institute.  I have taken a very deep interest in the Agricultural Institute since the idea was first mooted seven or eight years ago.  I notice that five nominating panels are to be set up.  It is possible, as other Deputies have said, that none of the national organisations representing farmers' interests would get representtation on this new body.  It is possible, in theory at least, that the National Farmers' Association, Macra na Feirme, the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture would not be represented at all on this new body. The Minister might do a bit of rethinking <Col N="451" /> on this subject.  It would be far better if certain organisations with countrywide representation, based on countrywide membership, got direct representation and that other and smaller organisations, irrespective of how valuable they might be, could elect, say, two members.  That would be better and fairer representation.</P>
    <P>When it comes to locating the centre of the institute, I hope it will not be located in the city or near the City of Dublin.  It will be a farmers' institute, to help the farmer technically and through education and propaganda.  The obvious place to locate it is in the country so that, not alone will it help the farmer, but will inspire him and make him feel that it is part of his life and a natural part of his environment.</P>
    <P>Quite a few references were made during the debate to the question of surpluses.  We seem to go through a series of surpluses.  There have been an egg surplus, a butter surplus, and a wheat surplus.  The only thing that we never seem to have any surplus of is cattle.  That brings me back to my first line of reasoning that over the years the one consistent export that has helped to support our economy has been the export of cattle.  We shall eventually iron out these surpluses and decided that certain of them are not serious, that they are of a temporary nature, and that the economy will have to face up to subsidising them for the overall good of the economy.  Under that heading might come the subsidy paid on the export of butter.</P>
    <P>There is one important matter in connection with the whole question of exports and particularly the export of agricultural produce&mdash;the question of shipping, which I do not think has been dealt with at all in this debate. We own virtually no shipping in this country apart from Irish Shipping Ltd.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Limerick Steamship Co.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no shipping operating in the Mediterranean, the Middle East or anywhere else where <Col N="452" /> we could develop new markets.  The cost of shipping and transport generally is so tied up with the question of exports that I hope the Minister, together with his colleagues, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will take cognisance of this problem.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of air transport.  The cost is too high at the moment to be taken into consideration in the export of meat particularly to the Continent.  This is one place in which national airlines might be induced to accept a very low figure to encourage, to the benefit of our economy as a whole, the export of meat and similar products through air transport.</P>
      <P>I would direct the Minister's attention to the amount of agricultural produce imported here that we could very well do without or substitute from our own resources, items like various cereals that are made up from imported maize, and so on.  They are luxury imports and it would be far better if we used some of our surplus wheat for these purposes.  In our present circumstances our best policy is to import only what we require and to export everything we possibly can from the produce of our own land, with the labour of our own people, and utilise whatever capital we have to bring the two together.</P>
      <P>I agree with the views expressed by Deputy Moher and the last speaker that we have expended too much money on imported machinery since the last war.  I know a great deal of that machinery has been utilised to increase production and has made things very much easier for the farmer, for instance, in getting in the harvest quickly, but much of that machinery is idle for the greater part of the year. It is depreciating at cost to the individual and the State and we have to import large quantities of oil, paraffin and other such commodities to keep these machines going.  I suggest that the greater utilisation of machinery amongst groups of farmers would probably be the answer to that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each year the Minister for Agriculture introduces his Estimate it becomes more and more obvious that if we are <Col N="453" /> to survive and expand our economy, greater and greater reliance must be placed on what we produce from our 12,000,000 acres of arable land.  No matter what expansive and expensive ideas we may have on other forms of employment, ours will remain for many generations to come primarily an agricultural economy.  It is encouraging to note that Deputies on all sides of the House appreciate the fact that there are certain types of agriculture in which this country excels.  Those are the types on which we should concentrate, at the same time looking further a field for new ventures that will expand agricultural exports and raise the standard of living of our people as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Each year on this Estimate reference is made to conacre letting.  Conacre letting is not the best way to use land, but I would be opposed to setting up any State body for the purpose of investigating the letting of conacre as, in any case, the Department of Agriculture would not be the appropriate body to deal with that situation.  Much of the land which is let, say, by one farmer to another, is producing just as much if not more than would be produced by the person who had to let the land because of financial embarrassment, failing health or for any other similar reason.  In any event, if conacre letting became so widespread as to affect the economy of the country, the Land Commission could deal adequately with the situation. Where a case is reported to them they investigate it and, where necessary, they take up such land for the relief of congestion.  They will always give a fair and sympathetic hearing to the owner of the land in case any hardship would be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question mentioned was that of mechanisation.  Many people, particularly since the end of the last war, have found that they cannot afford to keep a horse on a small holding or a team of horses on a medium-sized holding.  While it must be admitted that we do not manufacture our tractors here and that they have to be imported along with the fuel, and so on, we should not forget that the tractors have made available much extra land for production.  Many <Col N="454" /> of us for sentimental reasons do not like to see the horse vanishing but such is the march of time that tractors have replaced horses in many areas.  I know an area where a tractor has replaced no fewer than 16 horses.  If we take the average grazing of a horse as equal to that of two cattle or four sheep, Deputies will see how much the tractors has contributed to the output of agricultural produce.  Cattle, sheep, pigs and so on, have replaced the horse and it is purely a matter of economy. It would cost £120 or £140 a year to keep a team of horses.  Another factor which has contributed to mechanisation is that our youth have largely gone from the land.  Help is no longer as readily available as it was years ago.</P>
    <P>A point that struck me about this Estimate was the opening by the Minister himself.  He devoted about 20 minutes to telling us how something over £9,000,000 will be spent.  I could not help reflecting on the big change that has taken place from the time when he was on this side of the House and when he kept the House no shorter period than four long hours holding forth, first, on what he would do if he were Minister for Agriculture, and secondly, on all the mistakes Deputy Dillon, was making while he was Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister has somersaulted in attitude and policy&mdash;particularly in attitude&mdash;since the time when he told us here one night, in a mood of bravado, that he would fill fields with inspectors to make the farmers do their job.  He was then turned out of office largely because of these remarks and the threats of compulsion which the farmers were not prepared to take. The Minister was largely responsible for putting his Party out of office in 1948 and again in 1954. If he has made political mistakes&mdash; and we all make them&mdash;surely he has found them out now through the muzzling of his public statements which is obviously being effected by the Taoiseach and his other colleagues. I think he should not adopt the attitude of sitting sulking in his tent and not making a statement of policy, not letting us know where we are going in agriculture.</P>
    <P>After all, he is Minister for Agriculture <Col N="455" /> and he is responsible to the farmers much more than the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He should tell us exactly what the present Govvernment's policy is.  Nobody has stated it yet.  If the Government has any agricultural policy, I do not know what it is.  One of the first indications of a good agricultural policy is they easing or the cessation of the flight from the land.  Instead it has accelerated and our young people, particularly our young men, are flying from the land to such an extent that when one attends, as I think most Deputies do, after-Mass meetings, the people one finds coming out of the church are the very old and the very young.  There are no young men nor middle aged men; they have vanished.  We know they are in England and that a great number are in America and Canada also.  They have been forced to fly, all due to the fact that there is no agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>Farmers now regard their livelihood as one of the greatest gambles.  What they have not got to sell is on sale at an outrageous price.  It is unprocurable at the prices at which it is going. What they have to sell fetches no price worth talking of.  An outstanding instance of that is the case of the few items of agricultural produce which have a fixed or guaranteed price&mdash; beet, wheat, milk and barley.  The farmers producing these know where they stand.  But it is significant that 83 per cent. of our farmers are small farmers of under £15 valuation and they are the backbone of the nation and the hardest workers, but they benefit very little by these guaranteed prices.  The vast bulk of those along the west coast, from Donegal to Kerry, have neither the soil nor the climate to grow a profitable crop of wheat like the more fortunate people in the South and East, and it is along that western belt that we have the greatest number of small farms.  There, too, we have the greatest flight of young men from the land.  It is not alone young men who are going; whole families are now closing up their houses to emigrate.</P>
    <P>I wish to state very clearly to the <Col N="456" /> Minister that if he wants to put agriculture in a stable position it is absolutely necessary to fix prices for most agricultural products.  The items I have mentioned which have a fixed price are now in abundant supply with farmers who have the land and the necessary technique to produce them. The small farmers, however, depend largely on pigs and poultry and the bottom has fallen out of the market for both.  The small farmers do not know where they stand and the young men cannot be induced to stay and inherit the homestead from their fathers when they have the opportunity of earning £7, £8 or £9 in England and of securing many other benefits and greater security.</P>
    <P>An unfortunate feature of our agricultural life is that everybody not engaged in agriculture sets himself up as an authority telling the farmers what they should do.  No other section of the community is so ridden with humbugs and self-styled experts as the-farmers. I do not hear of businessmen, the Gardaí, schoolteachers, railway men or any other class being told how they should manage their work.</P>

The loudest of those &ldquo;experts&rdquo;&mdash;and I am sure the Minister hears enough of them; I know I had plenty of them and I am sure Deputy Dillon when he was Minister, had them also&mdash;will not touch land with a 40 ft. pole but they have the unbounded cheek to tell the farmers how to manage their business and their farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out to the Minister that the small farmer is vanishing in Ireland largely due to the fact that farmers and their sons do not know where they stand in regard to prices. I saw a cartoon in <i>Dublin Opinion</i> some time ago.  While it was meant as a cartoon it told the truth in regard to the present situation.  It showed two farmers leaning on a wall looking down at another man working.  One was saying to the other: &ldquo;He is overproducing himself out of business.&rdquo; That is happening.  No farmer knows <Col N="457" /> what he should turn to next to get any reasonable profit.  Everything he touches appears to be a gamble.  Let him go into sheep and the price drops; if he goes into poultry, the bottom falls out of the market for eggs.  If he tries turkeys, the same thing happens. If he goes in for pigs, the price goes down and he finds himself, as <i>Dublin Opinion</i> says, in a state of overproduction with nothing behind it.</P>
    <P>Being a farmer myself, I claim to know something about farming and I have come to the conclusion that if there is not a fixed price the small farmer will disappear.  Take the price of wheat.  I shall not go into the politics of the matter but the Minister and his colleagues won by-election after by-election when the inter-Party Government was in power on the strength of the blatant promises they made that they would restore the price of wheat.  In fact, they cut it, but that is not the point.  The Minister fixed the price of wheat and no farmer knows at present what he will get for wheat whose braird is over the ground at the present time.  The Minister does not know.  Here is what will happen.  The big wheat ranchers will probably rake in the full price because they are wealthy enough to buy or employ a combine.  The small farmer, who turns out the best wheat by cutting it in the old fashioned style, stooking it and threshing it will not have completed his work until November or December and by that time the amount of wheat grown will be known.  If there is a surplus, the small farmer, turning out the best quality wheat, will get a cut price.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us if it is proposed to hold back the price of all combine wheat and of all stooked and threshed wheat produced by the small farmers until it is known what the exact position is?  The Minister cannot be guided by statistics.  I am a farmer, and I did my best to grow wheat.  I wasted a lot of money on it, and I found I had neither the land to grow it nor the climate to ripen it and that is the case with most people along the west coast.  It is not the case in other parts of the country where farmers can produce excellent <Col N="458" /> wheat.  More power to them for doing it.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister tell us when replying are those who turn in combine wheat in the middle of August to get paid there and then?  If it turns out there is a surplus of wheat, how is the overpayment to be collected from them or will it be collected from them?  Are the farmers who cut, bind, stook and thresh their wheat to get the same price as the man who turns in the combine wheat?</P>
    <P>Many wheat growers to whom I have spoken do not know where they stand. The Minister may rely on the agricultural statistics gathered by the Guards each year.  I can see some farmers cloaking the acreage they are growing. If they have 40 acres, some of them will say they only have 20.  According to the terms of the statement issued by the Government Information Bureau when the price was fixed, I understand that the price will be based on the acreage returned and an approximate tonnage will be judged from that by the experts.  That is a very uncertain way of calculating the outcome of this season's crop.  I should like the Minister to tell us what exactly will happen.</P>
    <P>I am speaking very sincerely on behalf of the farmer who cuts, stooks and threshes his wheat.  He turns in the very best wheat of all into the mill.  The combine is an excellent machine for Canada and the warm wheat growing States in the United States and Mexico.  It is ideal for France and the southern countries of Europe.  I do not think it is ideal for this country at all.  It is too advanced for our climate.  It is all right in itself but it just does not fit in with our climate.  If the Minister had the choice of buying combine seed or seed stooked and threshed in the ordinary way I know which kind he would go for.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister has yielded to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, in cutting the double grant for cow byres.  The Minister said some time ago that that decision was taken by the inter-Party Government. I have definite information that no <Col N="459" /> such decision was taken by the inter-Party Government.  There may have been some advice tendered to the previous Minister by some official in the Department.  There is nothing wrong about that.  But I want to throw back in the Minister's face his suggestion that this was a decision by the inter-Party Government.  It never came before a Cabinet meeting while we were in power.  The Minister definitely misled the House and the country when he uttered that statement. I do not know whether it came up in the Minister's time or not but it was certainly a backward step.</P>
    <P>We are trying to wipe out bovine tuberculosis.  I am 100 per cent. behind that.  I warn the farmers that our principal export, live cattle, will be shut off completely if we do not get our country free of T.B. as quickly as possible.  A very serious situation could arise by 1961 or 1962.  We might bring our cattle to the fairs but because they were not T.B. attested we could not even give them away. We would have the same situation as we had in the early years of the economic war.  It is a puzzle to me how the Minister proposes to help in the eradication of T.B. and at the same time cut down the grants for byres. It was a wrong thing to do.  I shall go so far as saying that if the inter-Party Government had done it it would have been a wrong thing to do.</P>
    <P>We know quite well that, due to causes in days gone by when the farmers did not own their land, our farm buildings are not up to the standard we would like.  Since their land has been bought out, it has been a steady grind for the farmers to improve their land, their fences, drainage, their dwelling houses and outoffices. They have done magnificent work in improving the whole countryside in that way.  If the Minister is serious about the removal of T.B., I think the double byre grant is a necessity.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme, may I ask what is to become of the store cattle?  I have tried to find out and <Col N="460" /> cannot.  What method will farmers have for replacement?  Where will they get those replacements?  My own county, and practically the whole of the province of Connaught, is being made a clearance area.  Where will those replacements be supplied from? That is the question troubling the minds of the farmers.  If the Minister wants their full co-operation he should let them know.  I hope he will not confine himself to the 20-minute short statistical speech he gave us when introducing this Vote here.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister a question regarding farm buildings.  He will probably tell me that this is more properly a matter for the Minister for Finance.  But I want to put this point to the Minister as the person who has the destiny of the farmers in his hands.  An old hangover from the British days here is that whenever a farmer puts up a new building or effects any improvement in his outoffices, he immediately has his rates increased.  The Minister may tell me that is a matter for the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Finance.  Technically I suppose it is, but it is a deterrent to the average farmer to improve his buildings.</P>

      <P>Very good.  I shall take the Minister's word for it.  But even after seven years why should he pay rates?  There is the case of two farmers living side by side One is a &ldquo;sleepy-head&rdquo; who lets his outbuildings and fences fall down and lets his own dwelling house deteriorate.  He claims relief on rates and gets it.  His more up-and-doing brother across the road, who improves his place, is penalised for every building he puts up or if he only hangs a gate, sinks a pump or puts up a hayshed.  It is a wrong system.  I am after that point for years.  I could never convince a sufficient number of the members either of the inter-Party Government or Fianna Fáil of the necessity for reviewing it.  It is a shocking law that a man is penalised in such a way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have another opportunity when we are dealing with the Vote for the Department of Local Government.  I want to ask the Minister how our agricultural statistics are compiled.  For some years we hear people say that from the returns coming in our agricultural production is static.  I know it is not.  Any farmer I know of is producing twice as much, if not more, than he did 25 or 30 years ago.  Yet agricultural production does not seem to have gone up.  I think it is just a veiled attempt to hold up the farmers as a lot of lazy backsliders who do not want to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister tell us how these agricultural statistics are arrived at? There have been very many improvements over the last 35 years.  There have been improvements in fertilisers and from improved knowledge, there have been improvements from the improved veterinary service provided by the Department, there have been improvements from seed testing and the various other wonderful services that <Col N="462" /> the Minister's Department has given to the farmers.  From these improvements I hold that agricultural production has doubled, if not trebled, over the last 35 years.</P>
    <P>Yet we find, from whatever slipshod way these returns are prepared, that the slur is cast, year after year, that agricultural production is not improving. It happens particularly when the Department of Industry and Commerce is under discussion because every little article that comes out of one of these small factories is noted and tabulated.  I believe myself that a good deal of our agricultural production has vanished from the statistics by virtue of the increased standard of living of our people.  We are using more of our own produce and that is not accounted for in the statistics.  I would ask the Minister to tell us in what manner these statistics are prepared.</P>
    <P>The farm building scheme has been cut by £140,000; the ground limestone scheme by £242,000, and the land reclamation scheme by £9,240.  I want to ask the Minister, who is supposed to be the champion of the farmers, what kind of a stand he puts up against his colleague the Minister for Finance when these Estimates are being prepared? The Department of Agriculture, the Department of Lands, and the Department of Finance, in so far as the Board of Works is concerned, were the three Departments most looted for money this year.  These are the three Departments which deal most with the small farmers.  They have been raided, and the Minister for Agriculture, who should be the champion of the farmer, has calmly allowed the Minister for Finance to dip his hands into his pockets.</P>
    <P>A few years ago £13,500,000 was voted for agriculture.  Now the amount is down to £9,000,000.  I know that there was a question of subsidies but none of the items in the Estimates that go to help the farmers has increased.  The Minister cannot put the blame for this on his officials because it is up to him to determine, at the meetings in the conference room, what money is to be spent on agriculture.  Instead of letting the farmers down, the Minister should be their champion, even though <Col N="463" /> he may not care a whole lot about them and might like to fill some of their fields with inspectors.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the question of credit for farmers.  I want to tell the Minister an experience I had when I was in charge of the Department of Lands.  During that time the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, brought in a scheme to give credit to farmers.  One of the tests in that scheme was that the farmer should have the last two years annuity paid to the Land Commission.  That is no criterion of a farmer's honesty, his ability to get ahead, or his ability to work his land.  It is a completely useless yardstick by which to measure a farmer's worthiness for a loan.  I know myself that the Land Commission receivable orders go astray in large numbers.  Most small farmers do not keep a filing system.  They have never been trained to it and they do not do it.  Their filing system is probably a dresser in the kitchen or a cupboard in the bedroom.</P>
    <P>Very often these receivable orders go astray and I think that if the Minister could abolish that test he would not be losing anything.  If the farmer has not paid the last two years annuity he is excluded but I know of a case of a farmer who is excluded because he did not get his six day notice until the 4th February and he should had have his annuity paid on the 31st January. That man did not get the grant although it was one of his proudest boasts that he did not owe a penny to anybody.  That yardstick of the two years annuity is no measure at all and the farmer is not the person who will deceive the Agricultural Credit Corporation. It is quite possible that 30, 40, or 50 receivable orders may go astray.  They may even be lost in the post and none of the farmers is up to date in the payment of annuities. However, despite that fact, it is noticeable that the collections are always surprisingly up to date year after year.</P>
    <P>I wanted to ask the Minister what improved methods of soil testing have been brought about.  To my knowledge a good deal of fertilisers are still being used by farmers who have not had the <Col N="464" /> benefit of having their soil tested. Some of them do not like the idea of having all their land tested.  If the Minister would establish one or two more soil-testing stations, one in the West and one in the Midlands, it would take the burden off Johnstown Castle and would give much better results.  If it is a fact that a farmer must have all his land tested I would ask the Minister to ease that regulation a little bit.  There is nothing more pathetic than having a hard-working farmer putting out fertiliser without knowing whether it is the proper one to use or not.</P>
    <P>I want to bring home to the Minister that the small farmers, who form 80 per cent. of the farmers of this country, are the backbone of the nation.  They are the hardest working people in the country.  There is no question of their taking a week-end off or a half-day on a Saturday because there are cows to be milked and sheep, cattle and crops to be attended to.  The vast majority of our farmers have not the time or the money to take a holiday.  They are the hardest working people in the whole community and they are the people most hounded by others who would like to dictate to them as to how they should do their work.  That class of farmer is vanishing rapidly from this country and the reason for that is that there is no security of income as far as he is concerned.  Life is a fairly desperate gamble as far as the farmer is concerned.</P>
    <P>Some agricultural commodities are in short supply to-day and prices are sky high, but the small farmer has not these commodities to sell and the bottom has fallen out of the market in relation to the commodities that he has available for sale.  The Minister should take this up with his colleagues and with the able and competent officials in his Department, who guide and direct him, in order to evolve some method of price fixing so that at the very least, even if there is only a little profit, the average farmer will know where he stands.  Not knowing where he stands is the big flaw in agriculture to-day and the youngsters <Col N="465" /> growing up are not prepared to take the chances their parents must take as they are too old and set in their ways to seek a different livelihood. But, if they were young again, they would not chance living on the average holding in this country because of the uncertainty of income.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to tackle the flight from the land he will have to fix prices for farm produce and those prices will have to cover the cost of production and give a small margin of profit.  I do not care how small the margin is.  The Minister knows what happens at the moment.  The very moment there is a scarcity everybody rushes into production.  Immediately there is a glut, and the bottom falls out of the market.  Fixing prices is the only solution.  That is plainly evidenced in the case of wheat, milk, barley and beef.  Unfortunately, the small farmers, who constitute 80 per cent. of the farming community, do not benefit as far as these commodities are concerned.  It is to them now the Minister must turn his attention.  It is the people on the West coast, from Donegal to Cork, who deserve attention. They deserve whatever help is going because it is from that area that the flight from the land of the youth of the country reaches its greatest level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is unique inasmuch as it is confined to one side of the House.  I wonder why the reluctance on the Government Benches to make any contribution to such an important discussion?  I do not know whether it is that some of their previous statements are catching up with them and they are now so embarrassed that they cannot make any contribution to this debate.  The previous speaker, Deputy Blowick, prefaced his remarks with a comment on the Minister's opening statement.  He mentioned that the Minister confined his statement to 20 minutes.  Deputy Blowick was over-liberal in his estimate. The Minister's opening statement occupied only ten or 12 minutes.  It is a sad commentary that such an important item as agriculture should be glossed over by the Minister in ten or 12 minutes.  Surely there is an obligation on the Minister, and <Col N="466" /> on every Deputy too, to give this Estimate close, careful and diligent consideration.  Many important facets of our agricultural policy were not even mentioned by the Minister.</P>
      <P>During my membership of the House I have time and again stressed the fact that it is difficult to devise general agricultural policy.  I firmly believe that, in order to have an agricultural policy suitable to every area in the country, we must first of all divide up the country into zones.  A zonal division is essential because agricultural conditions vary from county to county and what is applicable in one county is not applicable in another.  Little mention was made in the course of this debate of that important consideration.</P>
      <P>Taking the country as a whole, so far as agriculture is concerned we have very prosperous conditions obtaining in many parts of it.  In the Midlands and in the eastern counties generally and, indeed, in many parts of my own county there are prosperous farmers enjoying decent livelihoods, liberally helped from State resources.  On the other side of the picture, along the western and southern seaboards, we have farmers holding large tracts of poor land incapable of giving even average yields of any particular crop. They find it very difficult to make any kind of livelihood.  Some of them have fled the country, with their wives and children, to find elsewhere the livelihood that is denied them at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is very difficult to help people living in uneconomic areas, but it must be borne in mind that the farmers living in these areas are the most hardworking in the country.  That is inevitable because, due to the type of land they have and the conditions under which they farm, they have to work not only an eight-hour day but the round of the clock and from one end of the week to the other, Sunday included.  When the Undeveloped Areas Act was introduced, I asked for help for the farmers in the congested areas.  The congested areas are clearly defined.  It was intended by that Act to develop industry in these areas.  I pointed out then, in 1951, that agriculture was the chief industry and I <Col N="467" /> could not see anything wrong in getting benefits under that Act to help agriculturists.  I mentioned the need for subsidising items of agricultural produce in these areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think my remarks were irrelevant, but I shall abide by your ruling.  We had a very costly commission set up some six or seven years ago by the late Deputy Walsh, Minister for Agriculture. Many people have commented adversely on that commission.  One thing the report of that Milk Costings Commission makes clear is that farming conditions vary very much in this country.  It is stated in that report by experts that it costs from something less than 5d. per gallon to 2/9 per gallon to produce milk.  Is that not sufficient evidence, if evidence were needed, that agricultural conditions vary very much indeed?</P>
      <P>Representing, as I do, an area with a big percentage of uneconomic holdings, I am under obligation here to refer as strongly as possible to agricultural conditions obtaining within my constituency.  I ask the Minister to reconsider in the light of the reports available to him and his Department the position of agriculture in the congested areas.  I cannot see why special funds could not be made available to help agriculturists in those districts.</P>
      <P>For a precedent for the subsidisation of farming in particular parts of the country we need only refer to the Minister's opening statement.  The minister moved that a sum not exceeding £6,343,310 be voted to defray the Charge of his Department during the current year.  We find that £1,250,000 of that is to go to make up the loss arising from the surplus wheat of the 1957 crop.  In other words, the farmers in the more favoured centres are subsidised to the extent of 22 per cent. of the total Estimate.  Everyone will agree that little or none of that wheat subsidy will go to farmers in the congested districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> I do not want to reiterate statements I made when wheat prices for the 1957 wheat crop were discussed in the House.  I maintained then and I still maintain, that the increase in the wheat acreage in 1957 was in no small way attributable to statements made by members of this House, particularly during the election of 1957.  In the early part of 1957, with the likelihood of a change of Government and then with the change of Government before the wheat sowing season concluded, many farmers felt that the price would be restored to 82/6 per barrel and consequently sowed the increased acreage which is costing the State in the current year £1,250,000.</P>
    <P>Are Deputies from the congested areas entitled to ask for some share of this £6,000,000 to help the people in their districts?  We are justifiably entitled to do so.  The majority of dairy farmers in West Cork are smallholders. What is the attitude of the Minister for Agriculture towards these people this year?  What help is a dairy farmer who produces 240 lb. of butter fat monthly getting as a result of the change of Government?  He is getting a reduction of 15/- in his weekly income.  The small farmer who will average 240 lb. of butter fat for the remainder of this year will suffer, as a result of the Minister's policy, a reduction of 15/- in his weekly income. There are farmers in the more favoured districts who could bear that reduction in their income but there is no line drawn, no boundary; the Minister's Order is applicable to every farmer.  A small farmer in the Berehaven Peninsula, in my own parish of Schull or in the area represented by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, West Donegal, or the farmer in West Clare will suffer this reduction of 15/- a week.  It is, indeed, a noteworthy change on the part of a Party who, before the election, condemned publicly and privately the previous Government's attitude towards the price of milk supplied to creameries.</P>
    <P>Before the election, Fianna Fáil felt that the farmers had a very strong grievance in that they were supplying milk to creameries at an uneconomic price.  Many farmers removed their <Col N="469" /> support from other Parties and gave that support to Fianna Fáil in the 1957 election, in the expectation that they would get an increase in the price of milk.  Once Fianna Fáil got their firm majority in this House, instead of increasing the price of milk, they reduced the price of butter fat by 3d. a lb. as from 1st April of this year.</P>
    <P>I am very sorry to state that I have very little confidence in the present Minister.  During his term as Minister he has generally ignored representations made to him&mdash;that does not apply to all Ministers.  He has more or less adopted the attitude that he is infallible and that whatever he thinks is correct and must be approved&mdash; provided, he has a majority behind him.  It is, then, with some reluctance that I mention other matters.  I fear the Minister is unmindful of the people who should get his considered and special attention.  The Minister has made no move since he became Minister for Agriculture to help the many farmers in the West and in the South who deserve special consideration. Questions addressed to him in the Dáil by Deputies representing these areas have brought negative answers.  I hope later this evening to have an opportunity of dealing specifically with one particular item.  I shall not mention it during the course of this discussion.</P>
    <P>We all know that the two principal sidelines for many small farmers were poultry and pigs.  It is amazing that there is no mention whatsoever of poultry in the Minister's opening statement.</P>

      <P>Very encouraging propaganda was made about poultry in the early part of 1957.  The people were reminded again and again of the supposedly small prices then prevailing for eggs and for turkeys. Fianna Fáil availed of the opportunity 100 per cent to make as much propaganda as possible in order to curry favour with poultry producers.</P>
      <P>Looking through the memorandum submitted by the Department of Agriculture we find that the outlook for the poultry industry is very gloomy. As we know this industry was some years ago a very important one in the economic life of our country.  It provided self-employment for many farmers' sons and daughters, for cottiers and particularly for the womenfolk of the farm houses.  It provided self-employment for them at reasonably remunerative conditions and prevented a number of them from being forced to emigrate.  It is, as I mentioned before, peculiar that the Minister has made no statement in relation to this industry. Unless it is in invisible ink, it is not in the Minister's introductory speech to the Estimate.</P>
      <P>So far as pigs are concerned, which is another sideline of the small farmer, the Minister's attitude is not very encouraging.  Shortly after taking office his first announcement was to endeavour to do away with the stability provided for certain grades of pigs by the previous holder of office, Deputy Dillon.  Farmers were reasonably pleased when Deputy Dillon laid down a fixed minimum price of 235/- for Grade A bacon pigs, extended subsequently to 130/- for Grade B bacon pigs.  Even though the price was deemed to below, they felt some security in having this minimum price available and they regarded it as a minimum price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Minister's attitude on this and what will his help be to the pig producers?  He gave notification last January that the price will be reduced at the first available opportunity and that is, I believe, some time in the month of July as, owing to regulations, he could not reduce the price earlier.  That does not afford much encouragement for pig producers. <Col N="471" /> The only way for pig producers to make it an economic proposition is to reduce the number of pigs they hold. If every pig producer were to cut by half the number of pigs he held on his farm there would be much more profit accruing to him.  The price of pigs is fluctuating very much of late.  I know it depends on supply and demand but many pig producers and many farmers believe that if the number were reduced, as is likely seeing that the Minister for Agriculture is focusing his attention on the rather low price prevailing, not only will it react unfavourably against the general economy of the country but it will react unfavourably against the consumer.  Because of the reduction in the price of pigs the likelihood is that the consumers at home will have to pay more for their bacon.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Agriculture to indicate clearly his reasons for not subsidising milk in some parts of the country.  If the same set of conditions applied in this part of the country as in other parts these people would be subsidised to the extent of at least 2½d. a gallon, which I think is what the subsidy would be at the present time.  Whether the money comes under the Undeveloped Areas Act or whatever other source it comes from, there is a solid case for subsidisation of milk in congested districts.  That has been borne out by me time and again here.  Take my own constituency of West Cork.  We get nothing in relation to industries under the Undeveloped Areas Act. Unfortunately we had not the 50 per cent. capital required under the Act. As we cannot get any other type of industry, the main industry there should be subsidised within the limits of that Act.</P>

      <P>We could do with a little more co-ordination and co-operation between the different Departments.  The question of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis has been discussed in detail and I do not want to comment at length on it. However, I think I should make a statement here somewhat similar to that which I made at some recent meeting of the committee of agriculture in Cork as a result of which a resolution was submitted to the Minister for Agriculture.  For the last three or four years we have heard various statements from Ministers and from Department officials regarding the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, and we were led to believe that much progress was made in this regard.  I was amazed to find this position obtaining down in Cork and possibly in the country in general.  A farmer who had a cow affected with T.B. consulted the local veterinary officer attached to the county council who visited his holding and told him that, even though the cow was affected and was likely to transmit the disease, he could do nothing about it as the cow did not come within the four classifications specified to county councils for the payment of compensation or come within the scope of this Order issued in 1926.</P>
      <P>I contacted the county veterinary officer and he told me that that was correct, that he had got no new regulations regarding the eradication of bovine T.B. and that, so far as he and his junior officers were concerned, they had to operate under the 1926 Act having regard to the fact that no other written instructions were issued to them.  We have the peculiar position obtaining in 1958 that this farmer was not eligible for compensation for the cow which he had to isolate.  The only comfort he got was that in all probability in the near future it would have sufficiently deteriorated to come within one of the classifications and then he would get £10.</P>

      <P>The county committee of agriculture having got a detailed statement from the county veterinary officer, made such a recommendation.</P>
      <P>I must digress for a moment.  I have received a note stating that the Ceann Comhairle has ruled out my question on the Adjournment relative to the subsidisation of butter produced in island holdings and consequently I shall avail of this opportunity to deal with the matter.  I had hoped to get a specific reply and I proposed to raise the matter on the Adjournment because it is difficult to get such a reply from the present Minister when a matter is raised in a general debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that island holdings around the coast should get special treatment and I think there is nothing unfair or unjust in that.  Everybody knows the disadvantages under which these islanders labour.  Whatever they buy, they pay more for it due to the high cost of transport and whatever they sell is sold below the value also because of transport costs.  I may mention that island life is becoming <Col N="474" /> so difficult that I believe it will disappear altogether unless these people get some State help.  It is undoubtedly necessary if they are to survive. We have agitated over the past nine or ten years&mdash;and representatives here before me have done so&mdash;so that the island people might get creamery facilities.  The creamery management boards.  I must say, gave that question close consideration and examined all the relevant facts before they concluded it would be impracticable to provide creamery facilities for islands. The cost of equipment, capital outlay, cost of supervision, providing separating stations, cost of managers and so on, would make it completely uneconomic having regard to the quantities of milk available.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Statesponsored body, the Diary Disposals Board, which mainly dealt with the matter submitted a report to the present Minister and also to the previous Minister indicating that they found it economically impossible to provide such facilities but recommended that the best way of dealing with the island milk supply would be to give the islanders a subsidy and let them produce butter.</P>
    <P>I addressed a question to the Minister to-day asking if he would provide a subsidy for the island landholders and I specifically mentioned island holders because I realised the difficulties that would arise if such a subsidy were to be extended to the mainland.  The Minister informed me that if he were to allow a subsidy he would be asked to consider the other people also producing home-made butter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke said he had little interest in the milk question because it did not affect his area.  Possibly because of the small amount of milk produced in Roscommon and similar counties the need for creamery facilities does not arise although they may have a little home-produced butter. But surely conditions in Roscommon are far different from those around the coast.  I think what I am saying would apply to any island, whether off Donegal or off Cork, where the conditions are similar.  There are creamery facilities in two of these islands but <Col N="475" /> the remainder have none.  In the past ten years examinations have been made from time to time by Department inspectors and by the Dairy Disposal Board and in the final report they say they cannot deal with the question and recommend subsidisation.</P>
    <P>Would these islanders be getting something to which they are not entitled if they got a subsidy of, say, 6d. per lb. on home-produced butter?  I think they would not because if these people were able to send the milk ashore to the nearest creamery it would cost the State more than 1/-per lb. to dispose of that butter.  We know the Minister has a surplus of butter which is costing a good deal of money to market, but that is no reason why these people should be overlooked when it is physically and economically impossible for them to get creamery facilities.  Surely they should not be treated differently from people living on the mainland who must get a subsidy due to the surplus butter and high production of milk?</P>
    <P>These islands off the West Cork coast&mdash;possibly the same applies to others&mdash;have valuations in proportion to, or even higher than, similar farms on the mainland.  That is due mainly to the fact that when these valuations were assessed some 100 years ago conditions on the island were as good as, if not better than, on the mainland, but many improvements and facilities have been given to the mainland people since such as water supplies, roads and electrification.  The island people cannot enjoy such amenities and I have been asked by groups representing the islanders to urge the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to their case.</P>
    <P>Take Hare Island, which is reasonably convenient to the mainland, were it not for the difficulty of transporting goods across the intervening stretch of water.  The biggest farmer in Hare Island has not more than 12 acres.  In Cape Clear the position is somewhat similar.  In Sherkin the farms may be a little bigger but in any case the cost of subsidising the home-produced butter from these <Col N="476" /> islands off the Cork coast would be&mdash; I have been reliably informed&mdash;about £1,000 or £1,100.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the State is compelled to subsidise this year the wheat crop of 1957 to the extent of £1,250,000.  Surely then, it is not out of place to ask for £1,100 or £1,200 to subsidise the small island holdings on Cape Clear, Sherkin, Dursey, Long Island or Hare Island which would be the five islands involved off the Cork coast?  These people have no public amenities; they get no bounties; they do not benefit by the wheat subsidy, and life is terribly difficult for them. I think they have a reasonable case and I would ask the Minister to examine it from the point of view of those living on the island, the hardship they endure and the difficulty they have in making ends meet.</P>
    <P>These people are precluded from leaving their island holdings.  During the past five or six years many of them made application to the Land Commission for transfer from their holdings.  The Land Commission have told them they are not prepared to do anything with those applications.</P>

      <P>It is relevant to indicate the position of these people who are forced to stay on the island whether they like it or not.  The only alternative, which some of them have taken, is to close the door, leave the piece of land and skip off.  I am interested in this question of the subsidisation of island butter.  The Minister should give ear to the recommendations made by the Dairy Disposal Board.  They would not have made such recommendations unless the facts down there warranted them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall conclude by again stressing the necessity of having some zonal division of the country as far as agriculture is concerned.  It is very hard to make general regulations in Merrion Street.  While they might apply to Wexford and Kildare, they might not apply to Kerry and Cork.  In their own <Col N="477" /> way, the small farmers in the poorer areas are producing far more proportionately than those in the centre of Ireland.  I believe the Minister could use his good offices to provide more of these big estates in the centre of Ireland for the uneconomic holders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most serious debate we have had over a number of years.  There was a touch of realism about it.  In his opening statement the Minister did not put much fiery thrust into it.  Agriculture is the most important subject the House can discuss and I am glad to see that both sides are more or less formulating a national policy on it.  Over <Col N="478" /> a number of years the country has lacked an agricultural plan.  One year we have too little; another year we have too much.  We want to see a happy medium in which we can have our produce marketed at a reasonable price over a number of years.</P>
      <P>This year there is a grave responsibility on the Minister and the Government to do big things for agriculture. This is a year of great uncertainty. Foreign markets are glutted and competition is becoming more keen.  Overproduction in cereals, milk and butter is causing great concern amongst the people.  Prices are sliding back and overhead costs are rising. These things will have to be rectified before many months.  Many of our trade agreements with foreign countries will have to be revised.  We are importing far too much from certain countries who are importing very little from us. I am leaving Britain out of that because there has been a fair barter of goods between the two countries over a long number of years and it can be improved.</P>
      <P>While cattle production provides the main industry of this country I believe we can overdo that, too.  If you specialise completely in cattle, you will have a very prosperous farming community comprised of the bigger farms but you will have fewer people in the country.  I would rather see a proper balance where by the ordinary labourer living in his cottage and the small farmer would live side by side with the big man.  Most of the prosperity from cattle goes into the hands of the rich and those with broad acres.  I do not know what they do with all the money they earn but very little of it goes to the smaller man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want to get a proper balance we must foster the dead meat trade. I do not believe in exporting on the hoof the finished products of the beef trade.  It may be good at present but it is not sound nationally.  We should have more thinning and packaging here.  I do not see why we should not have our own tanneries, our own glue factories and our own bone manure factories.  England is preserving those for herself.  They may give a reasonable price for live stock on the hoof <Col N="479" /> but they make sure that we never shall be able to have factories in our own country to compete with theirs.</P>
    <P>Something must be done to halt the trend of dwindling populations in our towns and villages.  What these towns need are little industries.  If we cannot give them those, we shall have nothing left but big farmers.  We should concentrate on seeing that the small man gets his rightful place in this country for which he fought and suffered so much.</P>
    <P>The excessive prices for cattle in recent years have operated against the small farmer.  After selling his live stock he cannot buy back.  He does not sell to put money in the bank but to pay his little debts.  His little cheque is very depleted before he can go out and buy back stock.  The small farmer who keeps one or two cows on 15 acres is almost being put out of the cattle trade.  He cannot pay £24 for a calf.  He cannot do it.  All he can do is to get a calf or two from his own cows.  If we go on as we are going, most of that type of small farmer will have to go out of business or turn to earning a living as a labourer for the bigger man living beside him.  These men are entitled to live and work on their own farms and, if necessary, to get State aid to do so.  If we do not allow that we will have nothing, in a few more years, but a number of comfortable farmers.  We do not want that because it was from the small farmers of this country that Ireland always got the people we needed to fight for our rights.</P>
    <P>The problem at present confronting the Minister is the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  From what Deputy Sweetman said it was evident that, although great things were expected from the meeting in Naas, nothing came of it.  I would ask the Minister to give us a clear-cut statement of the Government's policy on this matter. We have few enough years left in which to get the work done.  The counties of Kildare, Meath and Westmeath have banded together to do what they can to help the Government in this matter.  They expect some word of encouragement from the Minister, some sign to go ahead.  I would ask <Col N="480" /> the Minister to give us an outline of Government policy on the matter so that we can get on with the work.  If we do not do that we shall find, when 1960 or 1961 comes, that we are back at the same position in which we were when the calves were being slaughtered. We do not want that to happen. We want to export our cattle as we have always been doing.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that wheat has its proper place in the economy of this country.  This country is well able to grow wheat but rigid checks must be kept on the growing of it so that normal crops will be grown on the proper land and by the proper type of people.  The speculators who have come into my county have destroyed the natural growth of wheat.  We want these speculators out of the way so that the middle-class farmer and the small farmer can grow wheat of the right type in proper quantity and get the right price for it.</P>
    <P>If the farmer does not overproduce wheat the Government will have to give him a proper price for it.  There is plenty of room in this country for all our small farmers to grow good crops of wheat.  They always did it and they can still do it.  We hear a good deal nowadays about the Irish loaf but you will have no Irish loaf if you allow the speculators to go on doing what they have been doing.  I believe that the Irish loaf is on its way but the man who can till 400, 500 or 600 acres of wheat does not care about the Irish loaf.  Neither does he care about the price of wheat.  He knows that with the amount he is growing he will make a profit in any case.</P>
    <P>What we want in this country is a balanced economy but owing to the activities of these speculators the best land in the Midlands is now a dust bowl fit for nothing but weeds, dirt and dust.  It is the duty of the Minister to see that the activities of these people are stopped.  These things have been going on in some of the big estates and it is the duty of the Minister to divide the land and give it to the people who will work it properly.</P>
    <P>The advisory services provided by the Department are of the greatest importance.  I am glad to say that in <Col N="481" /> my county we have been able to provide an advisory service for every 1,000 farmers.  We are doing a reasonably good job with the number of instructors we have there.  I am Chairman of the Meath County Committee of Agriculture and I have completely cut out all political debates at the meeting.  I want the committees of agriculture to be genuine national organisations working for the good of all.  If they do that there is hope for this country.  If politics need to be discussed they can be discussed in this House, or at the crossroads.  For too long snowball resolutions have been going from one of these committees to another with everyone trying to get a dig at the other fellow.  We do not want any more of that.  Now that we have a general council of committees of agriculture I hope the same thing will operate there and that we will have no more political discussions at these bodies.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal to be said for horticulture, which has been neglected here for a number of years.  I must give credit to Deputy Dillon for what he did, as Minister for Agriculture, to get horticulture going in this country. Two Dutchmen came to my county and bought about 100 acres of land each.  They cared nothing about cattle but got into intensive horticulture. Now they are not only supplying horticultural products to the City of Dublin but also to the City of London. They are employing almost 40 men each and are paying good wages.  They have machinery for cutting, packing and cleaning and, as a matter of fact, their farms are really factories.  They came here as refugees from other lands. They had the know-how and a little of the wherewithal and now they are expanding every year.  We should spend far more money on the development of horticulture and market gardening in this country.</P>
    <P>I am proud of the cattle trade, coming as I do from a county which can fatten the best beasts in Ireland, but I think the cattle trade is only trotting after horticulture.  Most of the bigger farmers in my county do not grow a head of cabbage or produce a pound of butter.  They go into the town for any of these things that they want. <Col N="482" /> I do not think they should do that. They should give as much employment as possible on their holdings and, if not, something should be done about it.  When those two men to whom I have referred came in here and did so well, we should be able to learn from them.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has been revolutionised by land reclamation, drainage and liming.  Production has almost doubled in the last 25 years.  I do not say that that is due solely to Deputy Dillon.  I think it is a great thing for the country that we have men with brains and ability to do these things.  All these schemes are good schemes.  They are sound schemes.  They take money, but it is money well spent and spent in the right place.</P>
    <P>The National Stud is an important item in our economy but it does not fulfil a national rôle as far as the ordinary, small farmer is concerned. It is the monopoly of a privileged class at the moment.  I hold that the ordinary small farmer should have access to service for his mares there at a reasonable fee.</P>
    <P>A somewhat similar position obtains in relation to the Royal Dublin Society. We are all proud of it, but we should be prouder still if it were Irish-run and Irish-controlled.  I want to see the present position changed there, too.  The country will never progress unless we develop the Irish side of things.  There is too much money-changing amongst the élite minority and not enough money-changing where the small farmer is concerned.  We should have the courage of our convictions and the steadfastness of purpose displayed by those who gave their lives to preserve the Irish way of life. We should cherish the things for which our comrades fought and died 35 years ago, and for which our forefathers fought for 700 years before.  We want a balanced economy and a happy united Irish Ireland.  Let us forget the bitterness of the past.</P>
    <P>We shall not solve emigration overnight, but if we aim at a balanced economy and put first things first, then, as year succeeds year, we shall <Col N="483" /> find ourselves with a grand little country and a grand people.  We should not allow others to dictate to us.  We should put the real people at the front and keep them there.  We should scrap our present policy and build fresh.  If we do that, then the people outside will be proud of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considerable sympathy with Deputy Murphy who spoke earlier this afternoon in his attempt to discuss on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture problems associated with the Department of Lands.  In my opinion we can never have a realistic debate on agriculture unless we are permitted to discuss, side by side with it, the dual problems associated with the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture. However, rules of procedure adopted in the past operate in such a way as to prevent Deputies elaborating on many matters of importance in the agricultural sphere because the root of these problems lies in the Department of Lands.</P>
      <P>It is a sad commentary on our agricultural policy problem that, in spite of the lip service paid to it as the most important aspect of our economy, in spite of the fact that it is agreed by all politicians that it is the most important industry we have, yet when we come to deal with that most important industry, we find that priority is given here and outside to secondary industries.  At the same time, we find that these secondary industries, to a great extent, go outside this country for their raw materials and the raw materials purchased outside have to be paid for by the produce of the land.</P>
      <P>In all our papers over the last six months, day after day and week after week, all the emphasis has been on exports of secondary products and the aim of our representatives who go abroad, whether they be members of Córas Tráchtála or self-appointed, is to push secondary industries.  They do not specify the importance of agricultural products.  They concentrate on trying to sell petty little products produced under a sheltered system over the last 25 or 30 years.</P>

      <Col N="484" /> Considering the lip service paid to agriculture, one must conclude that it is the most important industry we have, and it should be treated as such. Deputy Giles put his finger clearly on the problem when he said that there is no policy and no plan as far as agriculture is concerned.  The cause of many of our economic ills to-day with regard to marketing and with regard to production stems from the fact that there has been no agricultural plan in operation here over the years.  Indeed, the keystone of our economic fabric has been subjected to the competition of Party politicians and the small farmer, described as the backbone of the nation, has been flogged to death with the propaganda of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael competing for his support on the basis of: &ldquo;We will give you a better deal than the other fellow.&rdquo; Despite years of loyalty, the small farmer at long last is beginning to wake up to the fact that he has been used for political purposes.  That is quite obvious to-day when one realises that the last person thought of, when it comes to devising Government policy in relation to agriculture, is the small farmer.</P>
    <P>To-day it is the small farmer who helps to subsidise the wheat rancher. Although it is most desirable that we should produce our entire requirements of wheat, nothing but a haphazard policy has been pursued in that matter. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to-day agree as to the desirability of having as much of our requirements of wheat grown in Ireland as is physically possible. It is an established fact that less than 4 per cent. of the arable land would be needed to achieve that object.  Would any normal man not think that it is not such a great problem to devise a reasonable plan to grow wheat to meet all our requirements?</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies pointed out that speculators, company directors, non-nationals and various types of people, with no association with land, have reaped the greatest profits from wheat growing.  The tragedy is that the small farmer who has loyally grown wheat over the years is now likely to suffer for his loyalty as a <Col N="485" /> result of the activities of these speculators who simply moved into this line of production for the immediate profits they could make.</P>
    <P>This is not a matter that arose under Fianna Fáil or under Fine Gael in particular.  This is a problem for which both of them must carry responsibility. I remember not very long ago, when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, he castigated and dealt severely with wheat ranchers.  He gave figures which were the result of investigations made by his officers and by the officers of other Departments which showed that, in one period alone, 140,000 acres in the Midlands had been taken by speculators and mined in growing wheat.  The statement made by Deputy Dillon at that time opened what was a closed book in this House for years, namely, the question as to how the Midlands should be utilised. According to the figures that Deputy Dillon then gave, 140,000 acres had been taken, much of it in conacre, and used for wheat growing, to a great extent by people who had no association with land, who could be described in no other terms than as telephone farmers, who took up the receiver and telephoned to their agents to purchase 300 acres as they intended to get into wheat.  That is how it was done.  These people have spoiled the position for the small and medium sized farmer.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that, before the Midlands were used for wheat, they were protected for the purpose of finishing store cattle from the West of Ireland.  It would have been regarded as almost a crime for a Deputy to suggest to the farmers in the Midlands that they should till their land.  The Minister for Agriculture knows well that many of these people got expert advice to suggest that it would be a crime to plough the Midlands, that the land was ideal solely for finishing stock and was not suitable for other agricultural purposes.</P>
    <P>What happened?  When the price of cattle went down and when wheat became a very attractive proposition, these lands were immediately taken over by speculators for wheat growing. That brings us back to the point that has been made for years that the time <Col N="486" /> is long overdue when the huge acreage that is set in conacre, that in many instances has been sold to nonnationals, should be utilised to create economic holdings out of which there will be secured the agricultural production which is so badly needed.  I do not know whether this Government are prepared to make any move in that direction or not.  Judging by their activities over the last number of years, I am afraid there is little hope of getting a dynamic policy into operation in that regard in the near future.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said by Deputies on both sides of the House that agricultural output has increased.  I want to give a blunt denial to that suggestion. Were it not for the export of store cattle on the hoof, we would be in dire economic circumstances.  That is about the only item in respect of which increased production took place for export and that increased production took place without any help from either the inter-Party Government or the Fianna Fáil Government.  That increase took place because the British housewife wanted Irish beef.  We all know that the release from austerity in Britain after the war created a demand amongst the working people for the normal luxuries of life and that the activities of a Labour Government in Britain raised the standard of living of the whole community to such an extent that more people were in a position to purchase agricultural produce. We reaped the benefit of the improvement in living conditions that took place in Britain by the extra sale of store cattle.  That is about the only way in which we have benefited so far. Lack of planning has been noticeable all through the years.  We can thank no Government for the fact that store cattle helped to secure equilibrium in our balance of payments this year.</P>
    <P>I would be repeating what has been said by experts a thousand times on the question of the sale of store cattle if I were to say that it is sending out 3d. worth of goods wrapped in a shilling's worth of paper.  We export the raw materials of industry when we export cattle on the hoof and we retain here none of the material thatwould if processed give first class employment <Col N="487" /> in industries based on agriculture. There is no other country in the world which has pursued such a lunatic system for so long.</P>
    <P>Over the years I pointed out that there has been no plan or continuity and no security for the small farmer in respect of agricultural production. Admitedly the guarantee has been there for wheat, and regrettably the people who took advantage of that guarantee were the wrong element.  In general, with regard to the small farmer there has been no guarantee for his output over the years.  The result has been that in many areas the small farmer is beginning to pack up and get out of the country.  Once upon a time, not so many years ago, it was the sons and daughters who left and they provided very useful money through remittances that helped to keep the household going here.  What is happening now is that the parents are going with the children and that will have a double effect.  Apart from the reduction in the population, we shall no longer have those remittances coming back from the emigrants because there will be none of the relations left here to whom to send the money; consequently we shall suffer again in regard to our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>It is time that the present Government, with such a large majority, got down to brass tacks on this matter. Let us take the pig industry, one of the stand-bys of the small farmer. What security has the small farmer with regard to pig rearing?  We have this question of an alleged guarantee for Grade A and Grade B bacon, but the next moment we find that the bacon curers are able to exploit the producer any time they choose.  The bacon curers of this country have not shown any national outlook whatever. Deputy Dillon, who spoke earlier in his debate, castigated the bacon curers in his speech.  He castigated them a number of times when he was Minister and I think members of the present Fianna Fáil Party, when allowed to, also uttered criticism of the bacon curers.  But no action has been taken to deal with them.  No Government <Col N="488" /> action of any description has been taken, apart from pleas and exhortations. The result has been that one year pig production goes up; the following year there is a low price and the bottom falls out of the market. In between, you can rest assured of one thing&mdash;that the bacon curers will have a profit, whatever about the producers.</P>
    <P>The small farmer must get help in this connection.  It is essential that he be given security, continuity and guarantees with regard to his output as far as price, and so forth, is concerned. If the present system has been proved inefficient and incapable of giving him that security for his output, then we must change the system.  If necessary the pig industry must be put on the same basis as, say, the Sugar Company and made a semiState concern.  There is no end to the wealth that can come into this country if that industry alone is in hands in which its expansion is properly planned and where the farmer is guaranteed a reasonable price for his output.</P>
    <P>Take one by-product of pig production, namely, ham.  I do not like to quote in this House the achievements of other countries, but I should like to refer briefly to what the Danes did in this connection.  In 1949 the Danes went into the ham business and they exported in that year something like £100,000 worth of ham to America. For the next two years the success of the project was in doubt due to the question of taste, but the Danes stubbornly persisted until they got the correct flavour in the ham to suit the American taste.  The position to-day is that the export of ham has risen from £100,000 worth in 1949 to around £18,000,000 worth last year, that is, on one by-product of the pig industry alone.  What are our exports of ham to America?  I do not think we even know what they are or whether the Americans even know that we produce ham.  Yet we have people drawing large sums for travelling expenses and salaries flying back and forth between here and America asking the people there to buy our products.  I do not wish to go into this in detail because <Col N="489" /> I might say too much on that aspect.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here to the poultry trade.  I shall not elaborate on that but again may I say there has been no plan.  In a surge of enthusiasm, due to the words of a certain Minister here, quite a large number of people in rural Ireland, especially the small holders, went into the poultry and egg business.  They got their fingers burned inside 12 months.  The result was that they went out of the production of eggs.  It seems to be an established fact that when we achieve a certain degree of production prices fall.  Of course they will fall when there is no planned way of looking after the business, when the whole question of sales is left in the hands of private individuals.</P>
    <P>If the Government says to the public: &ldquo;Go into the poultry business&rdquo;, it is the duty of the Government, having so asked the public, to make sure that the market is there afterwards, and not wash their hands out of it and say: &ldquo;We are not responsible.&rdquo; That is precisely what is happening, and that attitude has created disillusionment amongst the small farming class.  There is no end to the export possibilities available in the City of London alone for our poultry, whether it is quick frozen or any other kind.  If we went into it in a big way in the next two years, I do not think we would be in a position even to satisfy the requirements of one major city in Britain, but again we have no plan.</P>
    <P>We have a guaranteed price for wheat.  Last year we had too much wheat and we had an increase in the acreage of barley, including feeding barley, but the acreage of oats went down.  It seems that if the acreage of one commodity goes up another goes down.  It is a mere switch in the crops and there is no plan there.  Deputy Murphy was quite right when he pointed out that the whole question of zoning must be taken into consideration with regard to agriculture.  I shall not deal with that in detail for the simple reason that I do not believe there is any man in this country who is capable of putting forward a proper policy for agriculture.  It needs the <Col N="490" /> brains of a group.  The best brains in the agricultural sphere must be brought together because the various aspects are so wide that it would need the services of many experts in order to formulate a proper plan.</P>
    <P>The whole question of agriculture has been left by one Minister to another in a higgledy-piggledy fashion. There has been no systematic exploration of foreign markets.  In fact, we have not the slightest idea how to go about selling agricultural produce or, if I may say so, any produce.  When it came to the question of selling store cattle was there anything set up by way of a good marketing system?  Is it not a fact that the British buyers come over and attend our fairs?  Is it not a fact that the British companies and agents control shipping for Irish cattle, and that if that shipping were taken off to-morrow morning we could not send out a half-dozen eggs?  We did not make any marketing arrangements; they were made for us and we accepted them.  Yet some of us have the audacity to clap ourselves on the back and suggests that we have done marvellous work in increasing our agricultural exports of store cattle.  All we did was to have the cattle present at the markets, have them purchased by the agents and taken out of the country by foreign transport.  We have no say in it, and yet it is one of the fundamental things.  It was a fundamental thing 30 years ago to have provided a proper shipping concern in this country to take our agricultural produce outside. We are minus that shipping service to-day.</P>
    <P>On the question of the lip-service given to agriculture, one would think, hearing Deputies say: &ldquo;Oh yes, agriculture is the most important aspect of our economy&rdquo; that every effort would be made and no money spared to secure foreign markets. What is the position?  On the 7th November, 1956, I asked the then Minister for External Affairs if he would state, in respect of the Embassies in London and Paris, the number of officials engaged solely on work connected with the expansion of our agricultural export trade.  The reply to that question by the Minister was <Col N="491" /> to the effect that technical officers of the Department of Agriculture concerned with the export of agricultural produce to Britain &ldquo;may from time to time be assigned to the staff of the Embassy in London as a matter of administrative experience.  At present there is one such officer serving in Britain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This matter is the keystone of our economy and yet in the entire Embassy we had only one agricultural expert employed, seconded from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of External Affairs to deal with, and be responsible for, the export of our agricultural produce.  There are at least 29 other people employed in the London Embassy.  I have no doubt that, so far as they are personally concerned, they are excellent men but their line is not agricultural produce. Again, we are failing to deal with fundamentals. We prefer to have people deal with alleged culture and cultural activities in London.</P>
    <P>What is the position in Paris, in France?  At the time the question was asked we had no official with agricultural training engaged in the search for markets for France.  Since then, of course, a number of enterprising farmers, particularly some of those in the National Farmers' Association, secured some markets in Paris for our mutton but there again a snag arose and it still exists&mdash;the matter of transport.</P>
    <P>So far as shipping is concerned, we are completely dependent on outside interests.  I do not propose to elaborate on the fact that we can spend £500,000 on the purchase of two luxurious places like the Paris and London Embassies and cannot afford to have properly trained marketing experts in these cities, people who will seek out markets for our produce.  We have no imagination; all we can see is store cattle, beef, beef, beef.  We cannot see, as Deputy Captain Giles said, the tremendous advantages that would accrue from an intensive campaign for horticulture. That is completely neglected; it is left to a few people who came in from abroad and men of their calibre are to be welcomed more than the type of people who come to purchase 300 or <Col N="492" /> 500 acres of land as a sort of rest-centre for themselves instead of living abroad where they should.</P>
    <P>The store cattle trade is of very limited importance to the small farmer, the man with the valuation of from £3 to £14 in the West of Ireland. He has only three or four beasts for sale in the year.  Even if the price of store cattle goes sky high to-morrow, the sale of that number of animals would not provide a livelihood for the small farmer.  Consequently we must get down to the question of producing a policy that will not leave the small farmer depending, as he is, on cattle. Outside this House I suppose my words will be misrepresented by a lot of ignoramuses who will put the question of Party politics far ahead of the gain that can be given to small farmers if intelligent co-operation is made a feature of agricultural policy. We shall survive the misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála has been set up to sell the products of our secondary industries.  There is no scarcity of money when it comes to inducing the hot-house industrialists to get out into the open and to prevent them catching cold in international trade.  They get every protection, every encouragement. What happens to agriculture? The sum of £250,000 has been lying in this Department for the past 12 months.  It was to be spent on a proper marketing system for the export of agricultural produce but again preference is given to the minor industries and the major one, agriculture, is pushed into the background. We get a pious statement from the Minister that he hopes the group considering the question of agricultural marketing will produce a plan for him in the near future.  If that plan appears to hurt any little section of the industrial community, even though it may be of major importance and benefit all round, we shall find that plan will be shelved as many another important plan was shelved in the past.</P>
    <P>The question of the security of the future of small farmers has been stressed by people on both sides of the House.  I am glad to say there is an appreciation amongst Deputies that the trend in recent years has been <Col N="493" /> away from the medium and small farm.  The trend has been to get into the ranching business, to break down the dykes, knock down the fences and increase the size of holdings already too large.  The excuse is put forward by certain elements outside this House that you cannot have an economic return from production unless you have it on a vast scale. That is the alleged economic argument as to why the small farmer element should be eliminated by degrees.  That is the plan of these people who seem to rule the roost as far as agriculture is concerned.</P>
    <P>In regard to wheat, the argument is that it is uneconomic unless wheat is grown on holdings of 150 acres up, that it is ridiculous to suggest that a group of farmers should grow five or ten acres of wheat in a townland, that that would be wrong and uneconomic. That is the argument put forward by these pseudo-experts outside the House.  They do not take into consideration the most vital aspect, namely, the people.  The more families we displace from economic units here by allowing these units to be purchased and built into larger estates, the sooner we shall reach the bottom as far as our security here is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am sure many Deputies visited the show at Ballsbridge recently.  It horrified me to see the volume of imported machinery there, huge, mammoth machines used mainly by the wheat ranchers.  All those machines cost a great deal of money.  They are all imported.  They help to bring disequilibrium into our balance of payments and help to displace Irish workers.  If this policy is allowed to be pursued it will mean that the land of this country will be in the hands of a limited group of people and the majority of the Irish people will be once more serfs at the disposal of these big business combines and interests getting the land.  Many people are perturbed about the situation and it behoves the Government to take the necessary action in a proper and reasonable fashion.  Vested interests will, of course, make their presence felt and the strength of these vested interests is apparent in the political <Col N="494" /> Parties at the moment.  Surely the feelings, welfare and security of the majority of our people should come before the interests of these groups?</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick said there was no security for the small farmer, that when he produced more pigs or poultry there was no market.  I listened to him because what he said was true.  I also expected to hear from him what his policy was.  When he is on that side of the House in Opposition he can criticise the Government and ask why they do not do this.  The very same thing applies to the members of Fianna Fáil when they are in Opposition. Why, in the name of goodness, do they not get down to producing in this House a long term plan for the saving of the agricultural industry? Let them produce it here for discussion if necessary.  We never get it.</P>
    <P>I do not think any individual Minister, no matter how capable or knowledgeable he may be, is in a position himself to prepare such a plan.  What is needed is a land utilisation board somewhat on the lines of that suggested by the Commission on Emigration, a board that will examine carefully all the aspects of agricultural production as well as the type of agriculture that can be associated with the various sizes of holdings.  Such a board should be allowed to carry out a long term agricultural plan, and such a policy as they produce should not be subjected to street corner political arguments.  The work of other State companies that have operated successfully for years is not criticised by the various Parties.  For instance the activities of Bord na Móna and the E.S.B. in general are not the subject of Party criticisms.</P>
    <P>The overall plan we must have for agriculture must be prepared by experts and must be given the opportunity of being put into operation, supported by all the Parties here.  I do not know whether that is likely to appear in the next few years.  The tragedy is that while people talk here about various aspects of agricultural production, the number of people on the land and the number of small holdings are dwindling all the time. Certain aspects of congestion are thus being solved but in the long run we <Col N="495" /> lose because we are losing consumers. We are losing the people who in the past have absorbed the major proportion of the limited agricultural production we had.  Unless we take the active steps necessary to set up a proper marketing system, we shall be in a bad way in the next few years in the effort to get rid of any surpluses we have, even in the limited lines of production we have had over the past 35 years.</P>
    <P>The problem of balance of payments has been there for years.  I forecast it will be there again this coming year. It will be there with a number of European countries.  As far as Germany, Denmark and others are concerned, have we made any real effort to sell any of the by-products of agriculture in these countries?  Is it not a fact that no matter what the Germans do as far as agreements are concerned, we still are allowing their goods to come in here in spite of the fact they will not accept any of ours? Have we ever told these people straight out that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander?  Could we not afford to do without a certain amount of imports if these countries are not prepared to take our goods on a reciprocal basis?  Surely the Irish Government could explain to the people the reasons for cutting down on imports from certain countries?</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact that the Irish people would give support to any Government when they knew the facts of the situation?  If we are in the position that we import £6,000,000 or £8,000,000 worth of goods from a European country and succeed in selling that country only a small amount does it not leave us in a very serious position? If we had the goods to sell to them there is no reason why trade should not be on a £ for £ basis.  I am afraid that, at times, our representatives are too soft-hearted in their dealings with the representatives of other countries. There is no reason for our people to get tough because we are a small country and many of them would not miss our trade.  However, we have provided a lucrative market here for many of the products made by European countries and many of them <Col N="496" /> would not like to lose that market. I think we have good bargaining ground there.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us when he expects to have the report of the body examining the question of markets.  It is most important that the report of that committee, set up 12 months ago, should be made available as soon as possible.  The question of our output from agriculture will be one of vital importance in the next few years.  If this adverse trend takes place in the balance of payments over the next couple of years I have not the slightest doubt that this Government will take the same foolish, blind steps that they took before, namely, to put the burden on the people's backs, instead of taking the necessary steps to ensure that the balance of payments problem does not arise.  When a problem of that nature arises it is not the people who are responsible but the Government, by its inability to face the fundamentals.</P>
    <P>The trouble with agriculture is that we have failed to deal with the fundamentals and have, instead, devoted our energies and the people's money to the fostering of other insignificant industrial concerns.  The tragedy of that type of approach over the years since the foundation of the State is very apparent and the time is overdue when a complete change in our approach to that problem must be found.  I hope this Government, with the strength they have, are prepared immediately to take the necessary steps, particularly with regard to agriculture, to bring that revolutionary change about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Murphy who mentioned that it was rather significant that no Deputy from the Government side of the House had spoken to-day in this debate.  Only two or three have spoken to date and the two to whom I have listened certainly made very useful contributions. I wonder was it that they were told to keep quiet or that they recognised the failure of the Minister for Agriculture and the Government to carry out all the promises made during the last election especially as regards agricultural policies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate has been going on for <Col N="497" /> the greater part of two weeks and in that time I have listened for about six hours.  I wonder, if we had a body of farmers in the public gallery, listening to all that has been said, would they go away any wiser or would they be any better off as a result of the discussion? I am afraid that they would go away very disillusioned and very disappointed with all the talk that took place here in connection with agriculture and other matters.  It is my view that a good, intelligent, industrious farmer could carry on his work and produce the goods for which he expects a good price if there was no Department of Agriculture, or no Minister for Agriculture or no Deputy in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick referred to the so-called experts, the theorists in agriculture and to all the advice they can give.  I am sure there are a good many theorists in this House also.  It might be thought that I am one, not being an agriculturist, but I was born and reared on a big mountain farm where we had to work hard in difficult times.  I understand all the trials and difficulties of such types of farms.</P>
    <P>We hear nothing but statements about wheat and beet, but, as far as the farmers of my constituency are concerned, they are not interested in either of these crops.  They are interested in the production of store cattle, of sheep and wool, of pigs, eggs and poultry and, to some extent, butter.  The difficulties of the Minister would appear to arise from the fact, firstly, that he has a surplus of wheat and butter and, secondly, from the problem which arises in connection with the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  Deputy Corry who, I understand, is a big farmer, gave a solution for the problem of surplus butter.  As reported in Volume 168, page 217, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Last year, we exported 315,000 cwt. of butter.  Evidently in future all surpluses are to react on the producer.  The more they produce, the bigger the wallop they will get. I now say to the agricultural community that they never had a better opportunity of putting things in order, particularly in so far <Col N="498" /> as butter is concerned.  There is a tuberculosis scheme going through which will definitely wipe out about 30 per cent. of the milch cows in this country.  My suggestion to the farmers is not to replace them.  If they sell a cow for £20, let them not chase around the country to buy a £100 one to replace it.  If they do that, there will not be any butter surplus of 315,000 cwt. to further depreciate a price which is too low already, namely, the price of diary produce.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that not a peculiar statement for a responsible Deputy to make?  Surely the deduction from that is that eventually we would have no cattle.  We would not have sufficient butter for ourselves and we would have to start again importing butter from New Zealand and Denmark.  It has been admitted by both sides, and established down through the years, that the basic economy of this country rests principally on our agricultural trade. Our export of live stock forms 50 per cent.  From that it can be seen what would happen were Deputy Corry to have his way and were his advice to be taken by the farmers.</P>
    <P>Foolish advice has been given already in connection with the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  Farmers have been advised not to take any part in the scheme because certain people had a grievance over the reduction in the price of milk.  Surely no responsible farmer would adopt that attitude knowing that, if he did, our cattle trade would be ruined.  Where would our economy be then?  The intelligent Irish farmer will carry out diligently all the advice he gets when he knows that it will result in improving his position.  The Irish farmer, especially in my part of the country, knows that his whole livelihood depends on the production of cattle.  No matter what grievances they may have about the price of butter, milk, or anything else, they are certainly wise enough to take particular care that nothing will be done to interfere with our principal agricultural export, live stock.</P>
    <P>With regard to the subsidising of butter for export, it is not easy to <Col N="499" /> understand the necessity for such subsidisation. Why subsidise butter to enable the British to buy cheap butter? We have to pay 4/4 per lb. for our butter.  It is sold in Britain at 1/10 or 2/- per lb.  It is unfortunate, I suppose, that there should be a surplus, but then it must be remembered that the farmers were told by everybody: &ldquo;Produce, produce, produce!&rdquo; They did produce.  They produced surplus butter and surplus wheat. Difficulties immediately arose for them and for the Government.  If I were a farmer, instead of adopting Deputy Corry's advice, I would keep the same number of cows.  If I had 16 cows I would milk ten to supply milk to the creamery and I would let the calves suckle the other six.  I would do nothing which might reduce the number of live stock on my farm. That would be one way of coping with the situation.</P>
    <P>In order to get rid of our surplus butter, poultry, bacon, meat and eggs I would contact the organisations in Britain representative of the various counties at home and I would ask them to get their members to insist on Irish butter, bacon, eggs, poultry and meat. In that way we could find a market for our surplus.  Those who live in their own homes would be free to buy and those who live in lodgings could ask their landladies to buy Irish commodities.</P>

      <Col N="500" /> I blame Fianna Fáil for the difficulties in relation to surplus wheat.  Since they first took office they have turned to wheat.  They have never bothered about live stock.  Wheat had been growing before ever they came into office.  In 1930 or 1931 there were 30,000 acres under wheat.  It was ridiculous to raise the price of wheat to 82/6 per barrel when the world price was only 62/6.  The inducement to grow wheat was too high.  The wheat ranchers appeared.  They took as much wheat as they could off the land and then left the land derelict.  That is not the way to husband the land of Ireland.  Deputy Dillon was correct when he reduced the price&mdash;possibly he should have reduced it gradually&mdash;and I shall have no objection if the present Minister reduces it still further, because we do not grow wheat in my area.  The extraordinary thing is that, though the price of wheat is reduced, the price of the loaf has gone up.  There is something wrong somewhere.</P>
    <P>With regard to the all-Irish loaf, some experiments have been carried out to see if we can produce a palatable loaf.  Whatever the wheat growers may think, they must remember that there are more consumers than wheat growers in the country and it is for the consumers that provision must be made.  If the all-Irish loaf is not satisfactory it would be a mistake for the Minister to prohibit the import of wheat.  The consumers must be catered for in the first instance, and that goes for every single commodity. It is for them we must cater, and they are in the vast majority.  I hope the Minister will come to some arrangement to ensure that there will be no surplus wheat next year.  He was so late in settling the price, if, in fact, he did settle the price&mdash;nobody knows the price&mdash;that there will be a surplus. As the Minister has said and as everybody knows, it was never intended that we should grow wheat for export.</P>
    <P>Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann have a scheme under which only the quantity of beet required for the manufacture of sugar sufficient to supply the home market is grown.  Perhaps a similar scheme could be devised in the case of wheat so that we would produce the 300,000 odd tons required and no <Col N="501" /> more.  It is a peculiar situation that wheat is exported to Northern Ireland or Britain at £18 10s. or £19 a ton and the Irish farmer has had to pay £26, which has been reduced to £23, but which is still too high.  I understand that the position is difficult to overcome. Farmers were asked to produce more but there is no use in producing a surplus if there is not a market for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a mistake in increasing the contribution made by ground limestone producers towards the cost of transport.  He made the biggest mistake of all in abolishing the the double byre grant where bovine tuberculosis eradication was being carried out.  The Minister said that it was the previous Minister who issued the Order.  I think he was right in doing it.  It was then definitely known in areas where eradication was being carried out that unless the farmers co-operated and carried out the orders to have their cattle tested they would not get the grant.  I can see nothing wrong with such an Order. If people did not co-operate in such an important matter it was right to issue a threat that the grant would be reduced.  People have to be threatened for many things besides that. There was no mistake.</P>
    <P>I often wonder is it because the Minister thought that the order was already given that the double byre grant was abolished.  The Minister would not suffer loss of prestige if, even at this stage, he were to restore it.  If the farmers are to carry out that difficult and expensive scheme, some inducement must be given to them.  The double byre grant was certainly an inducement.  It caused great dissatisfaction amongst farmers who had built cowhouses on the understanding that they would get the double byre grant that they failed to get it.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this country is very suitable for the production of fruit and vegetables.  That would apply principally to small farms along the western seaboard.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht is present.  A good scheme for his Department would be the production of fruit, vegetables, <Col N="502" /> pigs, poultry and eggs, on the small farms.  I do not suppose that farmers who grow wheat, beet, barley and so on, would bother very much about those things, although they do produce them.  Such production would be a sideline for small farmers along the western seaboard and in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>Recently, a fruit juice factory was established in Kerry and is making very good progress.  Farmers in Kerry and Cork have been encouraged to grow fruit to supply the factory.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that, side by side with the reduction in the price of wheat, there should be a reduction in the price of barley.  There is a reduction of 6/- a barrel in malting barley&mdash; Deputy Corry must be responsible for that because he is chairman of the Barley Growers' Association&mdash;and feeding barley has been reduced to 37/- a barrel.</P>
    <P>Another way of avoiding a surplus of wheat would be to entice farmers to grow more barley.  There could never be a surplus of barley or oats.  Barley can be sold as a cash crop or fed to live stock and anything that is fed to live stock will not be wasted because live stock is the one item on which a farmer can prosper.</P>
    <P>It would be well if the Minister would try to discover the reason for the reduction in the price of sheep and wool and see what could be done to rectify the matter.  Last year, lambs and heavy cattle for which there was no market in England were sent to France, which was a great help in maintaining the price of store cattle.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose what is said here matters very much because the Minister will still carry out his own policy. If that policy is good and useful and beneficial to the farmers, irrespective of what Party the Minister belongs to, I can assure him that he will get the support of all Parties in this House, even the new Party, I presume, and in that way our main industry should prosper.</P>
    <P>There will be always ups and downs in prices according to conditions in foreign markets and on the home market.  It would be a very good thing <Col N="503" /> if agriculture, like education, were taken out of politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening attentively in this House and outside it to debates on agriculture and I must say that if all the advice given could improve agriculture, this country would be the greatest agricultural country in the world.  Quite enough has been said about it and the less said in this House about it now the better.</P>
      <P>Even though I am not a farmer, I was born and reared on a farm and in my youth I worked very hard with my parents and other members of the family.  I know what it is to work on a farm particularly on the size and type of farm on which I was reared. I feel proud of the work I did in those old days.  My father, the other members of the family, and a workman, or two occasionally, drained all that land and reclaimed a considerable portion of it, erected out-offices, haybarns and everything else that was necessary for an up-to-date farm.  All this was done without any State grants or loans.  At that period there were no guaranteed prices for our produce and no modern machinery was available; yet I would say that agricultural production in those days by the old method was far greater than it is to-day with the modern machinery at the disposal of the farmer.</P>
      <P>It angers me very much when people speak here and outside the House about what should be done for the farmers.  The trouble to-day is that farmers and every other section of the community are expecting too much State aid.  There are too many people talking about what they can draw out of the national pool instead of planning what they can put back into that pool.  This country will never get anywhere until we realise that we must work if we are to have the standard of living which other countries enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thoroughly agree, nevertheless, that everything possible should be done to improve the lot of the farmer to enable him to produce not alone what we require for the home market <Col N="504" /> but also for the export market.  It must be accepted by everybody that each successive Government has done everything humanly possible within the limits of the capital at their disposal. Deputy Flanagan last night advocated the spending of more money. He emphasised that we should employ more agricultural instructors, one for each parish, and more veterinary inspectors.  It is not alone my opinion, but the opinion of many, that we have far too many officials, all officers and no privates, and to employ any more would be foolish.</P>
    <P>We have spent a considerable amount of money in the past couple of years on land reclamation and no doubt it has proved a success, but&mdash;this is my own opinion, not a Party opinion&mdash;the land reclamation scheme should be available only to the smaller type farmer.  Large landowners, who could well afford to do a good deal of this work themselves, have availed of the facilities of the land reclamation scheme.  They were entitled to it, but if I were Minister for Agriculture, I would make it available only to those of a certain valuation.  We cannot continue this indefinitely; some day it must come to a conclusion, and priority should be given to the smaller farmers who make application.  Like every other scheme, it is open to abuse.  I know a few cases where foreigners came in here, bought farms of land and availed of this reclamation scheme.  Undoubtedly they did a good job, improved the land and the value of their farms, but then sold them and cleared out.  That is not fair for the people who have to foot the bill.  It is the taxpayer who has to shoulder the cost of all these schemes.</P>
    <P>The present Government and the past Government have devoted considerable sums of money towards increased production, and rightly so, but comparatively little has been done in regard to the marketing of our produce abroad.  There is no need to stress the importance of proper marketing facilities to the present Minister because a sum of £250,000 has been allotted for this purpose, but the system must be intensified if we are to venture further into foreign markets. <Col N="505" /> We must have experts on marketing methods just as we have experts on production methods.  We are now operating in very competitive markets throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer, as other Deputies have done, to the growing of vegetables and fruit.  This has been neglected over the years although it is most important as far as the small farmer and the cottier are concerned. Britain, I am informed, imports something like £50,000,000 worth of vegetables annually.  Our contribution to that market is negligible.</P>
    <P>The small farmer should be encouraged and assisted to grow fruit and vegetables which would give greater employment than any other branch of agriculture.  In my part of the country we have one farmer producing vegetables for the home market and for export and he has 150 acres of land every inch of which is tilled for vegetables solely.  The employment he gives ranges from ten to 15 men constantly. That is a very valuable aspect of it; if we are in earnest in our efforts to curb emigration and create employment.  In every branch of industry which is established or pursued the latest and most costly machinery is employed but from what I know of it the growing of vegetables, fruit and even flowers needs little mechanisation and can give greater employment than any other branch of agriculture.  I would ask the Minister to see what can be done in that direction.</P>
    <P>Fruit growing has been very profitable in parts of County Meath, particularly on the east coast where the people started in a very small way because they had been neglected for years.  Even at home, there is a huge market for hard and soft fruit.  I think we could make a very good bargainwith the British in regard to the marketing of vegetables.  At the moment our imports from Britain exceed our exports but in return for a share of that very lucrative market for vegetables and fruit we could purchase the equivalent in machinery. For many years now we have been purchasing various types of motor cars on the Continent and they cost a considerable <Col N="506" /> sum of money while what these countries buy from us is small by comparison.  British car production is quite sufficient and good enough for this country and I believe if an effort is made to penetrate the British market for fruit, flowers and vegetables it will succeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the elimination of the horse from agriculture. Has it struck anybody in the House what the consequences of another war would be or even of another Suez crisis?  What would our position be?  Our horse population has almost disappeared and the plough and other machinery, with which we produced our total food requirements during the war, are now on the scrap-heap replaced by the most modern machinery.  With that goes enormous capital investment.  Somebody reckoned that £3,000,000 leaves this country annually to puchase farm machinery.  There is also the purchase of spare parts, fuel and oil, all coming from abroad.  We cannot put back the clock but the Government should recognise the fact that despite all this talk of emigration and unemployment, so long as we allow masses of machinery to be imported there can be no hope of relieving unemployment to any extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past few years we have had huge combines brought in and most of them are now idle because they have only about a fortnight or three weeks' work in the year.  They are solely responsible for the bad wheat supplied to the mills and the factories during the harvest.  I have seen them in my own area; wheat cut by those machines would not be fit for animal food.  The Minister should see that no more of those machines are brought into the country.  If we are to have a good loaf made from Irish wheat, the wheat should be saved and threshed by the <Col N="507" /> old methods which proved most successful.</P>
    <P>I hope by next year there will be less talk about the price of wheat, a matter which has led to rather protracted discussion.  I am not satisfied with the price fixed last year for wheat but I hold it was the very best that could be offered in the circumstances. I feel, as other farmers do, that it should be grown on licence, on the same basis as beet so that wheat ranchers could be eliminated.  They should not be allowed to come into the country, tear up the land and grow wheat in such abundance that it leads to the elimination of small farmers who always tilled their lands and grew wheat but who have now been pushed into the background by the mass production methods of these ranchers.  Something should be done now so that by next year we will have a more balanced output.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have before us in this Vote a figure of £9,000,000 which is an increase on last year's figure. I am not opposed to an increase in the Estimated for Agriculture provided I am pleased with the way it is being spent in my area.  I would rather have it spent on agriculture than on flying the Atlantic.  I notice there are a number of reductions in the grants in my constituency, grants for such things as shelter belts, fruit trees, bee-keepers' associations, the glasshouse scheme and the Connemara pony association. I could go on and on.  Added to that the small farmers are being refused credit facilities for the stocking of their land.  These are the things I feel sore about on this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any area has been hit as much as our area.  We are not a wheat growing area and we are not a great milk producing area.  Top price is paid for bread and butter.  The present Government seems to have no policy for the Gaeltacht.  Gael Linn has taken over in the West and it has shown both the Department of the Gaeltacht and the Department of the Agriculture how things should be done.  They have given a lead already in the erection of a freezing plants for <Col N="508" /> vegetables and they have supplied boats in the Carna area.  It looks as if it is the Minister's policy to leave it to Gael Linn.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to soil testing in urban areas.  County committees of agriculture are not empowered to undertake soil tests in such areas. They say it is not their function in urban areas.  I should like the Minister to step in.  You can have quite a lot of production from urban gardens.  But some of them are burned out from being constantly in use over the years.  I should like to have the Minister's views on this.</P>
    <P>Present prospects for this year's apple crop are very rosy indeed.  It is a terrible thought that at least one-fifth of that crop will rot in the ground for want of proper marketing facilities. What are the Department doing in that regard?  Another share of the crop will go for pig feeding and yet there are children in the towns who never taste an apple from one end of the year to the other.  The Minister should do something to provide a proper market for this crop.</P>
    <P>It is good that the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme has the blessing of all Parties.  There is more concerned in this than the British market.  Had this been undertaken years ago we might have had to spend less on our Health Vote in regard to tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>I notice there is a cut in the grant for bee-keepers.  Connemara is a fine area for the production of honey because we have there the raw material, the heather.  If the Minister for Agriculture does not do something, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, who is sitting in his place now, might take note of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing the Estimate for Agriculture, not that for the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, Sir, but there is a cut under the heading of bee-keeping. The development of honey production has great prospects in Connemara.  I should also like the Minister to take a greater interest in the production of seed potatoes in the West.  We have had a fairly good trade <Col N="509" /> with Spain over the years.  I have seen ship loads of seed go through the port of Galway.  The Minister should do something to further this trade. Various Deputies said our embassies could be used to a greater extent in seeking trade.</P>
      <P>The Department are taking a very dangerous line in the over-mechanisation of farming in this country. Recently the Minister signed the death warrant of 25,000 horses a year by granting a licence for the slaughtering of horses in this country.  It is a dangerous thing to put all our eggs into one basket.  A few pipelines cut here and there might change the whole outlook of agriculture here.  We shall not have horses, harness-makers, car-makers or farriers.  I suppose we shall have to depend on oxen teams. I would like to know who will drive them.</P>
      <P>I have a cutting from the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 20th April in regard to a meeting of the Laois County Committee of Agriculture.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the <i>Irish Press</i> prints a certain amount of truth.  It is headed, &ldquo;Committee opts for the horse&rdquo; and is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Laois County Committee of Agriculture agreed to grant subsidies to a number of farmers for the purchase of horse-drawn sprayers, but when the Department of Agriculture were asked to sanction the subsidies, they pointed out to the farmers concerned that they must purchase tractor-drawn sprayers. Now, because a number of the farmers had already placed orders for horse-drawn sprayers and because the agricultural instructors think horse-drawn sprayers are best suited to the Laois farms, the committee have advised the Department that they will not agree to the subsidisation of tractor-drawn sprayers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is more of the policy of the Department.  That is how we are sending our money out of the country every other day.  There is a feeling abroad that somebody is getting a cut somewhere along the line with this over-mechanisation.  It can go so far, but it can go too far.  It is known that <Col N="510" /> this Government caters for the combine wheat grower&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants it, Sir, all right.  We have been speaking about the wheat rancher.  The wheat rancher is being protected by this Government.  That protection is responsible for the over-production of wheat.  The wheat rancher can get his six-ton lots but the small farmer can hardly get a one-ton lot and would not be considered for a six-ton lot.</P>
      <P>We all tasted the all-Irish loaf.  I think it was quite palatable but I should like the Minister to state whether it is an economic proposition and whether it will benefit the country as a whole and not merely the wheat growers.  The small man in the town has also to be considered and I should like to have the Minister's views on that matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The two important matters under discussion in this Estimate are the question of agricultural production and the disposal of agricultural produce.  My fellow Corkman, Deputy Corry, made certain suggestions, as quoted by Deputy Palmer, for solving the question of the surplus butter, but I do not think that those suggestions can be regarded as helpful either to the country as a whole or to the farmers themselves. Not alone was Deputy Corry completely off the mark in his suggestion that farmers should not replace the tuberculosis infected cow, but his reference to the price of potatoes was also not very suitable.  He said that in 1948 potatoes were £5 a ton and that now they were costing £30 a ton to those who could buy them.  That was Deputy Corry's approach to the matter.  Later on I may have to refer to the question of potato production in this country under both Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry did not help when he suggested that the farmer should go on strike in so far as production is concerned and that he should keep production to a minimum, thereby demanding more than his share of the national loaf.  I consider that co-operation and co-ordination between all concerned, the Department of Agriculture on the one side and the organisations representing the farmers on the other, are essential if this country is ever to prosper.  I fully agree with the view expressed by Deputy Dillon on this point when he referred to the activities of the Department in relation to research and to the advice on all questions which is available to the farmers through the Department. We often hear from people outside this Assembly severe criticism of the advice offered by the Department. It is a strange and tragic thing when we find farmers, as individuals, scoffing at the scientific advice which <Col N="512" /> is placed at the disposal of the farming community.</P>
    <P>If we are to increase production it is very important that the agricultural organisations, acting on a non-political basis, acting as people really interested in the welfare of the agricultural community, should realise that, while they have their problems and are entitled to their share of the national wealth, they also have their responsibilities to the community as a whole. Some Deputies on the Opposition side found it necessary, as Fianna Fáil did when they were in Opposition, to draw attention to the fact that not enough money is being devoted to agriculture. We all know that greater facilities in regard to credit will help agriculture and that if it were possible for different Governments to boost agriculture by providing more money they would do so.  However, it must be understood that when any aid in the way of financial assistance is provided for the agricultural community the whole community has to pay for it.  The agricultural community must understand that when its members are getting such advantages each and every taxpayer has to pay for them.</P>
    <P>It is important that agriculture should be approached by the political Parties as a very important industry but the people engaged in agriculture must understand that, in return for continued prosperity in their industry, they have responsibilities to the community as a whole.  That is why I believe that for the future of agriculture, and for the overall economic and financial betterment of this country, the agricultural community should appreciate a little more the advice that is given freely by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>In relation to co-operative efforts, I believe that up to the present the farming community has lagged far behind.  There are co-operative societies in existence in different parts of the country.  But we must admit that the problem facing us year after year in relation to agriculture is not just one of home markets and domestic prices but foreign markets and the prices obtaining on those markets. <Col N="513" /> Farmers are dependent on the prices which prevail in Britain, in particular, because they act in an isolated manner and the result is that a sense of futility creeps into rural Ireland and the gospel of pessimism is preached.  What we need is a proper spirit of co-operation and a fuller determination to strive towards the ultimate goal.</P>
    <P>It is essential that every effort be made by the Minister and his Department to encourage our farmers to strive towards a truer sense of co-operative farming, not alone in relation to the buying of the essentials for their farms but even more so in relation to the sale of their produce.  Experience has show that it is not the farmer who gets the biggest gain out of the sale of his produce.  It is the middleman. So long as the middleman is permitted to trade at the expense of the farmer and the consumer, so long will agriculture suffer from the point of view of the producer.</P>
    <P>One problem which confronts any Minister for Agriculture is the problem of a guaranteed price over a certain extended period.  A guaranteed price is of very little use unless the farmer can be assured that the price will extend over a considerable period.  If he has that guarantee he will have some guarantee of stability in relation to the crops he produces or in relation to his live stock.  Some may hold that such a guaranteed price is fantastic. Of course, it all depends on the approach of the individual.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why it should not be possible, through the various marketing organisations and through the Department of Agriculture, to foster marketing on different lines, be the commodity wheat, meat, barley or anything else.  That is the only way in which to secure a satisfactory agreement with the agricultural organisations in relation to price fixing.  It is the only hope, particularly in the case of live stock.  It is the only way in which to secure stabilisation for the benefit of the farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have considerable difficulty in this regard.  Farmers, as individuals, will be bound to dictate, because the farmer is an individualist. <Col N="514" /> When prices are high, he wants to sell himself.  When prices are low, on the other hand, he is prepared to sell through some organisation, because he feels he may do better.  That attitude does present difficulty.</P>
    <P>I have heard Opposition Deputies demanding more grants; I have seen them pointing the finger at some weakness in the Minister's policy.  That happens in the case of every Minister for Agriculture.  It is important to remember that, in relation to this Estimate, we should have a united front in an endeavour to find the ideal, with a true determination to build up our one national industry which provides not alone the prosperity we enjoy at the moment but will be the industry upon which our future economic prosperity must depend.</P>
    <P>The Minister supplied us with some excellent notes.  Those notes show evidence of the progress made in agriculture in the last few years.  As the Minister pointed out, like Ronnie Delany, we have broken records so far as the export of cattle is concerned.  We have broken records in the production of milk and other agricultural commodities.  It was not overnight that these records were made.  We were in training for a considerable period.  It is because of the activities of Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture that these records have been made.  But we must not rest there.  We must continue to progress. I give credit for what has been done, but I urge on the Minister to continue the good work.  In doing so, he will do justice to the farmers, to the country, and to political democracy.</P>
    <P>With regard to market research, apparently Deputy Corry does not approve of that.  He seems to think there is another way.  I agree with the Minister that market research is vitally important.  If we do not have market research we will find ourselves not in the shop window but under the counter.  I think such research must be intensified.</P>
    <P>Adverse criticism has been made of our Embassies abroad.  Our Embassies can fulfil a useful purpose if they set themselves to further the sale <Col N="515" /> of Irish commodities abroad, particularly agricultural commodities.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that records have been broken.  It is good to know that and I hope the pessimists outside will hear all about it, those pessimists who lecture every Government and every Party.  There is statistical proof now. Not only is there statistical proof, but throughout the length and breadth of the country there is visual evidence that our agricultural community is prospering.  The farmers are not the &ldquo;down-and-outs&rdquo; so many people wish to say they are.  We wish well to them but the sooner we admit that they are doing well, the sooner we shall admit that the various Ministers for Agriculture have done and are doing a worthwhile job.</P>
    <P>On one side, records have been broken, which is very satisfactory news. On the other side, there is a tragedy disclosed in the White Paper. Incidentally, may I say that the White Paper is more valuable than any contribution that could be made in this House?  It is grand to see the returns in relation to wheat, barley, cattle, and so on but the drastic drop in the acreage under potatoes year after year is, in my opinion, a calamity.  Consider the position in Dublin and Cork City. In County Cork, 21 lb. of potatoes are called a weight.  The price is 6/- and 7/- per weight.  I know that Deputy Corry says it is £30 a ton for those who can buy.  My remarks apply, not to the administration of the present Minister, but as far back as 1948.</P>
    <P>The year 1948 was the year that many of us came in here as new members with ideas of our own, hoping that we would be able to offer some co-operation, no matter what Government was in power.  In the period from 1948 to 1957, there has been a drop of 121,930 acres under potatoes.  It is no wonder that potatoes are at the present drastically high prices.  The Minister and the Minister before him may say that this year was a bad year for potatoes.  They may also say that, while there has been a decline in acreage, with improved methods a <Col N="516" /> heavier yield per acre is being obtained.  In my opinion and in the opinion of my colleagues in the Labour Party, people in towns, cities and villages are being deprived of potatoes, the staple diet of the large family, unless they are able to pay such high prices.  That completely out-weights some of the benefits derived from the broken records for yields in other lines of production.</P>
    <P>The acreage under oats also showed a grave decline in the same period. Deputy Palmer was right in saying that oats would never go to waste.  In 1948 there was a political outcry.  Some members of the Opposition said that oats could not be sold.  If we have one bad year and a few good ones, that does not justify a reduction of 424,783 acres under oats.  The present Minister for Agriculture should do his utmost to encourage oat production in districts which are not suitable for wheat growing and where even barley is not giving a good return.  The mother of a young family uses oatmeal.  The smaller the acreage under oats, the higher the price for this very important item of food for children.  I would ask the Minister to take steps to stop the decline in the production of oats and potatoes.</P>
    <P>Comparing the years 1948 and 1957, there has been a reduction in total crops, according to the White Paper, of 593,467 acres while there has been an increase in pasture of 794,693 acres. It is a matter of opinion as to whether that is the wisest and best policy or not.  Of course we are told on all sides of the importance of the cattle trade. We all appreciate that.  We are told of the importance of pasture.  We all know that.  A balanced agricultural economy is more important than trying to grasp at an export trade in cattle to Britain when prices may soar or at an export trade in butter to get rid of butter when we find ourselves in the doldrums.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman made it clear that we would not or should not suffer in relation to this problem of butter exports.  Perhaps we may not but I believe it is false economy to export butter to Britain at such a loss to the community here.  It is essential to balance <Col N="517" /> our accounts and, if we are to import essential commodities, we must be prepared to export.  At what cost are we exporting butter and wheat? The price of subsidisation has been heavy on us.  The price at which we import commodities is not their real cost.  To that must be added the price of subsidisation of wheat and butter. Subsidies may be essential but in the past 12 months the subsidisation of butter and wheat for export has proved false economy.  It would be more important to subsidise the price of butter on the home market.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the consumption of butter per head of the population is the highest in Europe and the second highest in the world. Statistics can prove to be wrong.  I am convinced that the figures showing us to be large consumers of butter take no account of the amount of butter consumed by tourists and brought out by them.  I am not for a moment saying that the Minister wished to give a false interpretation.  Neither do I wish to do so.  If we were able to segregate the amount of butter consumed by our own people from the amount consumed by tourists coming into the country and from the amount which they took out with them, I believe we would find we are not in as happy a position as we think in relation to the consumption of butter.  Therefore, because I would wish to see the home market for butter built up I would say, without condemnation of anyone, that it would be far better if the Minister concentrated on the subsidisation to some extent of the butter of the home market instead of pouring it into the British market at such a terrible cost.</P>
    <P>In relation to the national farm survey, that undoubtedly can be of immense value to the country and to all engaged in agriculture, but a further improvement could be made if the following suggestion were adopted. On a Sunday night there is a programme broadcast which is known as the &ldquo;Top Twenty&rdquo;.  Would the Minister consider giving publicity by way of the Press or otherwise to the top 20 farmers in each areas, to those who by better management are giving a better return to the owners of these <Col N="518" /> farms?  No matter what we may offer by way of grants or facilities to the agricultural community, we must recognise the inherent pride and independence in their make-up.  I suggest that the Minister should be prepared to make use of that by giving a little publicity and credit to the successful agriculturists in each parish or district. It would be an incentive to him as a farmer to increase production and would urge his neighbours to catch up on him and obviate the necessity to keep pouring out grants.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Deputy Dillon's remarks in relation to credit facilities. The former Minister was big enough to admit that while he offered incentives in relation to credit facilities he made what he considered to be a mistake by not going further.  While I would wish for better credit facilities, I would not agree with the line taken by Deputy Dillon in relation to the securing of credit.  Deputy Dillon thinks that no man should be in a position to pawn his home.  I do not believe for a moment that the majority of farmers would ever take the risk of borrowing either from a State body or a local moneylender unless they were in a position to return the loan.  What we want is a spirit of co-operation and the encouragement of the activities of a person about whom Deputy Dillon was always so anxious, as I was myself, namely, the parish agent.  I think it essential for the Minister to offer greater facilities in relation to credit.  I do not know whether it applies around the West but I do know that around the South there is grave difficulty in securing credit.</P>
    <P>I should like, however, to sound a note of warning that should this credit be required for the purchase of machinery the farmer would need the most careful advice from the local parish agent or the county committee of agriculture because there is the danger cropping up in rural Ireland week after week that small and medium sized farmers are buying tractors and other implements because their neighbours have secured them.  They do not seem to realise that, considering the cost of such machines and their upkeep, there is not sufficient work on a small or medium sized farm for such <Col N="519" /> a machine, let alone scope for getting a return on the capital and profit from its use.  It is therefore essential that any farmer applying for credit for the purchase of machinery should be well advised in relation to that problem and in relation not alone to the amount of the capital but the rate of interest which can be most damaging to the financial position of the person who has to repay a loan.</P>
    <P>Another item to which I should like to refer is the lime subsidy on which the Minister made a statement.  I shall not condemn the Minister on the question of whether there is a reduction or not, but I wish to draw attention, as I did about 12 months ago, to one important aspect of this question.  Very large concerns have been doing their utmost to wipe out the small lime producer. There are people in Cork who are able to take gambles, people for whom lime is only part of their industrial activity, and it would be a tragedy if they were allowed to wipe out the small man.  Whatever we may feel on the question of subsidy, we do know from the reports we hear time and again that it is not so much on the production of the lime that the money is made by these people but in relation to the subsidy.  I should like the Minister to keep an eye on that situation to prevent one or two firms in this business creating a monopoly and charging the farmers much more than they might otherwise have to pay.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to the Government for the introduction of the Agricultural Wages Board in 1936-37. Through the activities of that board much good has been done.  During the years from 1937 to 1953&mdash;that is the last year for which I have returns&mdash;no less than £79,696 has been collected in cases where men had been underpaid. That board is a credit to the Minister concerned and to those associated with it.  However, even at this late stage there is need for revision.  While the farm workers have benefited to that extent during those years there is room for improvement.  Lately I have had occasion to make certain inquiries. I am not satisfied with the position and <Col N="520" /> I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the following points.</P>
    <P>First of all, it would appear from the reply given to a question this year that the Taoiseach does not agree that the workers' representatives have the right to requisition a meeting of the board. I consider it should be sufficient for four members to ask that a meeting be called, comparing the position under the 1936 Act setting up the Agricultural Wages Board, and the old Act.  Some of us were not even born then and those who were, had little thought of being in this Chamber when that Act was passed in 1917.  At that time even an alien Government was prepared to give a concession to agricultural workers here which they are being denied now.</P>
    <P>Under the old Act there were six workers members of the agricultural committee, any five of whom would be sufficient to call a meeting.  We now have only four and the four are not allowed the right to call a meeting.  I would ask the Minister to investigate that because he has the right to do so under Section 11 of the 1936 Act. It is essential that it should be examined when we realise that in spite of considerations into which I shall go later on there were only two meetings of that board in 1957.</P>
    <P>The latest increase the farm workers got was in May, 1956.  At that time&mdash; the figures I am about to give are for County Cork but I think they cover practically all the other counties too&mdash; the agricultural wage for Group B, that is the area adjacent to Cork City, was £5.  For the rest of the county the rate was £4 15s.  Nothing has been given since.</P>
    <P>We heard much during this debate about the woes and the ills of the farming community but so far nothing has been said about the rate of pay which the agriculturists give their men. If we take the percentage of wages paid against profits in agriculture, we find that in 1938 farm wages amounted to 19 per cent. of the profits in agriculture but in 1955, farm wages amounted to only 13.3 per cent. of agricultural profits.  Who can say, on either side of the House, that agriculture <Col N="521" /> has not prospered since?  Who will dare to say that it is anything but a shame that the agricultural community while prospering did not improve the position of the farm workers and that instead there is a reduction in the amount of wages paid as against profits?  That concerns Ministers where in the inter-Party Government or the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Another reason for calling attention to the importance of considering the right of the workers' representatives to request a meeting of the Agricultural Wages Board is the matter of board and lodgings.  Since 1956 the board-and-lodging figure is fixed at £2 4s. 11d. in Group B and a little less in the outside area&mdash;£2 3s. 9d.  May I ask where did these figures come from?  We must admit that while the Army personnel may not be over-fed they are getting a fair crack of the whip and yet the value of board and lodgings as assessed in August was 10/- less.  The farmer was able to charge approximately 10/- a week more for giving a man board and lodgings than the Army authorities could charge.  Mark you, in the case of the Army, the figure was estimated at current retail prices and that does not apply on the farm.</P>
    <P>Some members may say that the farmer pays as much as he can or they may go further and say it is impossible for farmers to pay more. Hearing or reading the speeches made here each year I have no doubt that the vast majority on both sides of the House have spoken as farmers or farmers' sons.  I admire them for that, but I have never claimed the so-called privilege of being connected with farmers or dispossessed persons.  I do claim that my connection is with the farm workers and my obligation is equally to the worker and to the farmer. The present Minister has got a very bad example since 1956 in regard to the autocratic power of the Agricultural Wages Board and its chairman and officers.  I hope we shall have less unhappy manoeuvres as far as the agricultural workers are concerned in the future.  For too long we have been hearing about those who saved the country, about what the farmers did for Ireland.  We have heard a good <Col N="522" /> deal about them and about the days of the Land League but very little is heard of the farm worker.</P>
    <P>Statistics can lie, perhaps, by accident. In a recent statistical issue it was stated that there were roughly 102,000 paid agricultural workers but, in the course of a little research I made, I found that in the year 1955-56, looking at the issue of social welfare stamps, little more than 62,000 workers were being paid in agriculture.  Even if we take the figures issued by the Department of Local Government in relation to employment we find the number was only 46,000.  Where have the remainder gone?  That question arises to be answered by the Minister and by those who preceded him.</P>
    <P>Above all other industries, agriculture has let down its workers.  Since 1948 they were able to secure a slight advantage by way of a week's holidays and a half-day in the week.  I would ask the Minister to recognise that, on its own, agriculture cannot hope to prosper.  He should also realise that those who criticise whatever Government is in power&mdash;those outside this Chamber who speak of agriculture and its importance&mdash;unless they are prepared to couple with the farmer and his family the importance of the paid agricultural worker, are neither sincere nor honest in their criticism.</P>
    <P>I remember we had difficulty some years ago, in 1947 when the Minister was in office before, in regard to agricultural wage rates.  I hope now that the increase which is overdue for the past two years will be forthcoming. According to the Taoiseach's own statement if we take the present figures and compare them with the figures for farm workers' wages in 1956, taking into account the increase of ten points in the cost of living in the meantime, we must admit that if there is any section entitled to an immediate increase it is the farm worker who gives all his labour to the farmer for a very small wage.</P>
    <P>We must keep these people in rural Ireland.  They are as important as any other section, if not more so.  The Minister has not been very long in office but I would ask him, even at this early stage, to investigate what <Col N="523" /> the Agricultural Wages Board is doing and to find out what it intends to do about calling a meeting and accepting a recommendation to give an immediate increase to these unfortunate workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In his brief introduction to the Estimate this year, the Minister had a happy story to tell in many respects.  He could advert to the fact of increased production in so many fields that he was endorsing what is now recognised by so many sections of the community as the tremendous contribution which Irish agriculture can make and has made in recent times to the economy of the whole country.  Never in our 35 years of self-government has that been brought home so forcibly as in relation to the correction of our balance of payments problems which worsened in 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recession then can now be attributed to the fact of the flooding of the British market by cheap Argentinian meat, as well as the coincidental happenings in Suez increasing our import charges.  The major contribution to the correction of that problem came from the fact that agricultural production had increased to the point that we had the goods to sell and the market in which to sell them.  The availability of the market in which the goods were sold originates to a vast degree in the enactment of the 1948 Trade Agreement.  It is only since then that the agricultural producers have found encouragement and stability in price together with the hope which is now realised by so many young farmers of to-day who in their various organisations are improving their knowledge of agricultural and are preparing to contribute in the years ahead to a degree that was certainly never envisaged ten or 12 years ago. That return to confidence in the major industry is in consequence of what was achieved by the 1948 Trade Agreement. Since that time improvement of the land, soil analysis, advisory services and so on, have contributed to providing the additional produce which we have happily been able to sell in the <Col N="524" /> markets available in Britain and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I note in the report of the activities of the Department a paragraph in regard to soil testing which, I think, is to a slight extent amusing.  This is the paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The service, which commenced in 1947, has proved of great value and a substantial part of the manuring now carried on in this country is on a basis of soil analysis results.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is true in relation to the results that are flowing from the improvement of soil analysis but, surely to goodness, the boy with the medicine bottle and the bicycle wheel, so often graphically described by Deputy Dillon, cannot be claimed to be the service in 1947 which has now resulted in the improvement per acre and in volume which we can so happily report upon.</P>
    <P>Much of the increased production would not have been secured were it not for the fact it was decided ten years ago to give stability in price, an assurance to the farmer that if he produced for his own benefit and the benefit of the community at large, he would be guaranteed a price below which his produce would not go over a particular period.  There existed then, and there exists among some people to-day, a hankering after what they would describe as &ldquo;the good old days&rdquo; when there was a limitation on production, when we did not have enough goods to satisfy even home requirements, when we had butter rationed and when we had the unfortunate situation of not having enough flour.</P>
    <P>In those days there were people who made profits on limited production but surely the man to-day who thinks that therein lies prosperity for the Irish farmer must have his head examined. That would be a very bad suggestion if it were made by a person outside the House with little responsibility, but how much more serious it is when it comes from Deputy Corry, a colleague of the Minister, a vociferous representative on the Fianna Fáil Benches, that in his opinion the farmers actually should reduce production and that if they did, by creating a scarcity in that <Col N="525" /> way, they could revert to the days when they could demand a blackmarket price for what they had to sell?</P>
    <P>The Minister visited my constituency some months ago.  I saw a report in <i>The Kerryman</i>&mdash;a paper, incidentally, which one of his colleagues now describes as a despised rag but nevertheless which is recognised as on of the principal provincial papers in the country.  It reported the Minister as having answered some point made at his Party convention in Mallow, in which this very suggestion was advanced by a simple delegate to his convention.  The Minister went as far as saying that he would, to the extent of jeopardising his life, oppose any such limitation.  It remains for him, in replying to the debate, to elaborate on that very strong principle and to deal with his colleague, Deputy Corry, as forcibly as he dealt with the humble delegate in North Cork.</P>
    <P>When the Deputy advances these views he is playing down to a limited number of agriculturists who still hold these views.  It was a difficult and extremely arduous task to bring home to very many of our farmers that the future of their industry, of their families and of the country, depended on increased production in every field of agriculture and that with that increased production came greater profit for themselves.  That was only secured by first overcoming many of the antiquated ideas then held.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry was presented in Kilkenny as the shadow Minister for Agriculture.  He told the electors of Carlow-Kilkenny that the moment Fianna Fáil returned to office they would again have 80/- per barrel for wheat.  That was useful at the time. He was accepted by the people in that area as the likely Minister for Agriculture in the Fianna Fáil Government. Consequently, when he makes the statement to which Deputy Dan Desmond and other Deputies referred, it is time that his like would be dealt with forcibly by those to whom he is responsible to a certain extent.  In these days for any Deputy to stand up and advocate such a policy, no matter how disgruntled he may feel and no matter how disappointed he must be <Col N="526" /> at the results that have flowed from the policy, or lack of policy, pursued by his own Minister over the past 15 months, despite his intense feeling of disappointment, was extremely discreditable.</P>
    <P>The situation has been reached here, when these difficulties have been overcome in the securing of increased production, that the farmers are in the frame of mind that they say: &ldquo;We answered the call of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour and every Party for increased production, and now, when we have increased production, we have a surplus which is being thrown back to us as being an embarrassment to the people in office.&rdquo;  Surely, having solved so many serious difficulties in relation to increasing of production, the finding of a market for the produce should not be an insurmountable matter?</P>
    <P>In the Budget statement last year there were many blows to various sections of the community which were of an extremely heavy nature but one or two items in that statement brought from the public much approval.  One of these was the fact that the Minister set aside £250,000 for marketing and the other was the indication of his intention to make certain economies.  We do not find that there is much evidence of either of these objectives having been achieved.  The expenditure of a miserable £800 out of the £250,000 voted for market research stands out as indicative of the fact that there was not much virility or endeavour behind what the Minister thought was important enough to write into his Budget statement.</P>
    <P>We can see where certain organisations and individuals have had a certain amount of success in marketing some of our agricultural produce.  We know we have a very efficient staff attached to the Department of External Affairs, seconded there from the Department of Agriculture.  These men are doing all they can but are they getting enough assistance in tackling what is a very pressing and major problem?  This matter was referred to in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs.  May I sympathise with the Minister for <Col N="527" /> Agriculture on the fact that he has as a colleague a Minister for External Affairs who ignored all reference to this matter in his reply to the debate on this Estimate, a reply which stands out as one of the most disreputable ever made in this House?</P>
    <P>Milk is one of the items which we now produce in abundance in this country.  That is a direct consequence of the improvement in grasslands, in farm buildings, of the provision of running water and of rural electrification. Now that we have this great production of milk, I do not know why an effort has not been made such as has been made in Britain and other countries, to popularise it as a beverage. In those countries the dairying industry represents a minor part in the general economy but in Ireland the dairying industry is important in many respects but particularly in providing the foundation for our live-stock exports.</P>
    <P>In relation to milk production surely there is now an opportunity for the Minister for Agriculture, in conjunction with his colleague the Minister for Health, to make an all-out effort to popularise its consumption?  Surely that would help in relieving the problem that has been presented by the heavy butter production and at the same time would make for a reduction in the incidence of many diseases? The effect of the Government's policy on the dairying industry has been detrimental in the extreme.  Was this then the time to reduce further the consumption of milk in the country? That has been done by the direct action of the Government in abolishing the subsidy on butter.  By taking away that subsidy they have reduced the consumption of this valuable food.</P>
    <P>Amongst the many impacts on the farmers and the ratepayers of the recent increase in the cost of living, due to the removal of the subsidies, has been that of the increasing cost of our public institutions.  In that respect it would have been a simple administrative development for the Minister to have made butter available to all our institutions and so relieve the total <Col N="528" /> cost of upkeep.  Such action would not only have relieved the Exchequer of the increasing cost of upkeep but it would also have relieved the ratepayers who will have to meet the increased cost of running these institutions.  If it is possible for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to accommodate two biscuit manufacturers with subsidised flour surely it would not be beyond the capacity of the Government to provide these institutions with subsidised butter?</P>
    <P>The Minister stressed the importance of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. All public opinion was with the Minister in condemning statements made by some organised bodies of farmers, in natural protest against the reduction in the price of milk, whereby they threatened that unless the price was increased they would withdraw co-operation in the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  The attempt made to withdraw from that position was indicative of the fact that many milk producers were condemnatory of the people who made that statement.</P>
    <P>I suppose there was no body created in this country in the past 35 years to deal with any particular problem received greater criticism than the Milk Costings Commission.  It failed to provide a report in a reasonable time and the cost involved, together with the fact that the Minister repudiated any recommendations made, point to the fact that it was a sham and a fraud from the word &ldquo;go.&rdquo; It was set up to stave off the day when the Minister would have to face up to a concerted demand for an increase in the price of milk.</P>
    <P>Now the unfortunate situation has developed that, just at the time when the milk producers have to meet the cost of replacing herds in consequence of the tuberculosis eradication scheme and when they have to meet the cost of improved buildings, the Government and the Minister, instead of trying to improve the lot of the dairy farmer, has faced them with a reduction of 1½d. per gallon in the price of milk. That, occuring at a time when they, like all other sections, have to bear the burden of the increase in the cost of living is certainly an extraordinary <Col N="529" /> occurrence.  It is one for which this Government will have to answer.  It was a bad thing to do at any time, but it was a criminal thing to do at a time when the co-operation of the milk producers and the dairy farmers in general was absolutely essential and when it was vitally essential to have the co-operation of all those interested in live stock to ensure prompt progress in the elimination of bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>There is considerable concern at the moment among sheep owners in relation to price and the possibility of a still further reduction in price.  I wonder whether the Minister and his Department have examined every opportunity that presented itself to dispose of sheep, mutton, lamb and so forth.  There is available this year a colossal market.  There is a magnificent propaganda opportunity for bringing before the eyes of the world the excellent quality and the availability of Irish mutton and lamb.  One exceptional opportunity presents itself at the Brussels Exhibition.  I should like to know from the Minister whether any effort has been made to avail of that exceptional opportunity in advancing the cause of our Irish sheep farmers.</P>
    <P>An item that was exceedingly popular with some Deputies when they were on this side of the House was the last Minister's attitude towards the establishment of a horse canning industry. When Fianna Fáil returned to power we learned, with a great fanfare of trumpets, that the Fianna Fáil Government had decided that a licence would be given on condition that certain guarantees of protection for our cattle industry were forthcoming, but there appears to be an absolute full stop to any developments in that direction. We are wondering what has occurred.</P>
    <P>Among the minor economies that the Government felt they had to effect since their accession to power was their action in relation to the double byre grants.  The withdrawal came again at an unfortunate time and the Minister's effort to get out of it by saying that some decision had been taken by his predecessor was proved to be incorrect.  The papers were demanded and were made available and <Col N="530" /> it was successfully proved that, in effect, what had been submitted to the last Minister for Finance was something in the nature of an incentive to induce farmers to avail more quickly of these grants.  That was coincidental with the drive for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>That was twisted and presented as being similar to the action of the present Minister.  It was not similar. It was diametrically opposite.  Under the original proposal, it was made clear that sufficient time would be afforded to everybody who desired to erect the byre to have it done and to qualify for the grant.  The action of this Government was to announce that the grants were being withdrawn, a withdrawal which affected everybody without giving anybody an opportunity of expediting his arrangements to have such byres erected.</P>
    <P>Much discussion has been occasioned, and rightly so, by the impending formation of the Free Trade Area and the effect it will have on our economy whether agricultural or industrial.  In the agricultural field, N.F.A., Macra na Feirme and such organisations have been discussing the possible impact of our entry into the Free Trade Area.  It is clear to everybody that the effect will be very considerable in relation to agriculture.  The decision of the Fianna Fáil Government to confine its representation to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and not to include the Minister for Agriculture in any discussions in relation to the future of that immense development, is indicative of the fact that the Minister for Agriculture in a Fianna Fáil Cabinet is relegated to very near the end of the queue.</P>
    <P>The important aspect of production is of course the availability of labour on the land.  We view with concern the reduction of some 10,000 over 12 months in the numbers engaged on the land.  Surely it is the duty of the Government to do everything it can to encourage the retention of labour so that farmers can go ahead with increased production, secure in the knowledge that they will have available to them the manpower to harvest and process what they sow.  We have a <Col N="531" /> seasonal market for labour in certain parts of the country.  Why cannot we have migratory labour from one part of the country to another?  Migratory labourers leave these shores for Scotland and England.  I cannot understand why we cannot exploit that kind of labour.  That has been done successfully in relation to beet harvesting. Labourers from Connaught harvested the beet in Munster.</P>
    <P>I agree with everything that Deputy Desmond has said in relation to the contribution which farm labourers have made and are making to the industry. Again, the Royal Dublin Society is the only body which gives any little recognition to men who give their lives in the service of Irish agriculture. It would be a good thing if some way could be found in which to extend that recognition so as to encourage men to live and work on the land.</P>
    <P>One of the factors that have an important impact on costs is transport. I know that the Minister is not responsible.  I know that the whole question of transport is under review at the moment but surely it is his duty, as Minister speaking for agriculturists, to bring home to his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the remainder of the Cabinet, the impact of increased transport charges on the agricultural industry and the limitations, by regulation, which have been imposed from time to time in order to protect our national transport system.  Down through the years it has been responsible for inflating costs of production and, to-day, with the modern trend towards transport of live stock by mechanisation, we are now faced with another problem.  Is it possible for any easement to be effected in the regulations permitting farmers to carry their neighbour's cattle for reward?  That would be of tremendous assistance.</P>
    <P>There was no action of the Minister's in the past year which occasioned such dismay as his method of appointing agricultural representatives to the Agricultural Institute.  It certainly is extraordinary how any Minister or any <Col N="532" /> Government could stand over the means adopted in the itemising of the various agricultural bodies which should be represented so that bodies which are representative of minute agricultural interests should have equal representation on that body with bodies such as the National Farmers' Association which represents so many thousands engaged in so many aspects of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of the last six months has contributed in no small way to the disruption of the pig industry. Absolute panic was created by the Minister's announcement of a reduction in Grade A bacon when the period expired over which his predecessor had ensured that neither he nor his successor could have any detrimental effect on the price level.  By the announcement that it was the intention of this Government to reduce the price of Grade A bacon by 5/- a cwt. the green light was given to bacon factors to row in on this opportunity to reap greater profits and they availed of it to a very great extent and very quickly.  The result has been, naturally, when the Minister had taken this action, that the pig producer in very many instances sold off brood sows, with the result that there is now reduced activity in the industry and the Government will not have in the year to come the measure of bacon exports which they had to report for the previous 12 months.</P>
    <P>Another economy that has been effected by this Government seriously affects by this agricultural community. The curtailment of the rural electrification programme means that many hundreds of farmers who would wish to install milking machines, small mills, etc., and who are entitled to electric light to assist them in their work, will be denied what is happily available to many thousands of people throughout the country.  I do not know whether the Minister concurred in the decision to curtail that scheme but it was incumbent on him to ensure that the scheme which was so far advanced, would be completed in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>In respect of that, there is a certain <Col N="533" /> injustice to which I should like to refer but I realise that the Minister for Agriculture is not responsible for this matter and I shall withhold it until the Minister who is responsible will be presenting his Estimate.</P>
    <P>There remains, of course, as the all important feature in relation to agriculture over the last 12 months, the effect which the 1957 Budget had on the agricultural community.  Many sections of the community have secured compensations to meet the increased cost of living.  It is extraordinary that those engaged in agriculture, who have to provide all these increases, should have to suffer reductions in their incomes.  In that respect, I made the point before and I repeat it now that the reduction and subsequent complete abolition of food subsidies had a more detrimental effect on people who work in the open and work hard on the farm than it had on those people who enjoy meat three times a day.  They were also more seriously affected by the increase in the price of bread, flour and butter.  The higher rates and taxes that are the result of the abolition of the subsidies will have to be met by the primary producer, the farmer.</P>
    <P>All other sections have been catered for, that is, all other organised sections.  Very many other sections of the community are suffering and will suffer in consequence of the Government's economic policy, but the fact remains that the major section singled out to get no improvement whatever in their income was the agricultural community. The Minister and his Government will have to answer to the farmers in that, being responsible for increasing their cost of living and their cost of production, they have thought it proper at the same time to remove the guarantee of price level which they had when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, when the wheat farmer knew the price he would get.  To-day there is no wheat producer who has any idea within 2/6 of what he will get when he harvests his wheat.</P>
    <P>The barley producer has had to suffer a reduction of 3/- per barrel.  The milk producer has had to suffer the extraordinary reduction of 1½d. per <Col N="534" /> gallon.  The worst feature of the whole thing is the wiping away of the guarantee of a firm price which existed until the people voted this Government into office.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the months to come will have to face very much of the kind of thing expressed so forcibly by his colleague Deputy Corry, that the farmers in consequence of producing more, are being fined for so doing and would fare better if they did not contribute to the increased production which everybody has required of them. That is the position which the Minister will have to overcome.  He will recognise and the House will recognise that it is a situation to which he has contributed in the main in that he failed to ensure that the guarantee of prices which existed before his accession to the Ministry, would be continued.  The position has been very much impaired by the action of the Government in reducing the prices and removing the guarantee of a fixed price in relation to many of the goods which farmers were producing in such abundance in recent years.</P>

      <P>During the course of this discussion some Deputies were critical because of the time I took in reading my introductory speech.  If I were to reply to all the points that have been raised in the debate, I would not cover the ground in 15 or 20 minutes.</P>
      <P>One of the disappointing things about a discussion on agriculture&mdash;I suppose it is only natural that it should be so&mdash;is that there is a rehash of the same subject, no matter how often that subject is discussed.  Only a short time ago the Party opposite asked for Government time to discuss the whole wheat situation, the scheme announced for 1958, and so on.  We had that day's discussion and I think we explored the ground fairly thoroughly but to-day, yesterday and during the whole course of this discussion, we have entered again on the same fields.  That of course obliges me to deal again with some of the points that have been made on this matter of wheat, wheat surpluses, wheat acreage, and all the rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said in the course of the discussion <Col N="535" /> here on that motion something which although it might not be willingly admitted in this House would I believe be accepted outside, that it never was the aim in my time in this House to produce wheat in excess of our own requirements.  It was not, in other words, national policy to produce wheat for export.  There was enough discussion both inside and outside this House in 1927 and 1928 to have brought that home to every man.</P>
    <P>Starting from that point, as I must, here is the situation with which I had to deal and with which this Government had to deal.  We sold 12,000 tons of wheat in April, 1957 for animal feeding.  There was a carry over of 75,000 tons of wheat from 1956 to 1957. There was a surplus in 1957 of 75,000 tons which left us with 150,000 tons of dried wheat.  That had to be disposed of and was bought by merchants under Government guarantee. It was dried, stored and held by them.  It fell to my lot to make a decision in that respect.  A decision could have been made in 1956 or 1957, perhaps not to deal with the situation entirely but to relieve it for the people who bought that wheat, put their money into it, whether it was money advanced to them by the banks, or however it came.  There was also the necessity to make a decision as to what the wheat price should be for 1958. These were urgent matters and in fact the then Minister for Agriculture was being pressed, and I would say understandably so, by members of the Opposition to announce the price for 1958.</P>
    <P>It was in that setting that, when I came into Agriculture, I met all the people who are interested in this matter, the representatives of the growers, and other interests.  However, the one thing I want to make clear in this House and which I have made clear on every occasion on which I discussed this matter, under whatever kind of fire, is that it has never been my desire, once I came to accept and ask my colleagues in the Government to accept a scheme, to take the stand that it was because some other interest recommended that to me, such as the National Farmers' Association, or some <Col N="536" /> other such body.  I do not intend to shelter behind that, because I know that it is my scheme, that it is the Government's scheme and I should like that fact to be borne in mind in relation to anything I may say.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussions which I had with these people who were affected, who were interested in knowing what the conditions were to be in 1958, interested of course in getting the highest price possible, I found on the part of every one of them full acceptance of the difficulties of the situation that I have described and a realisation that some decision along the lines of the one taken would have to be made.  I did not show any great enthusiasm, during the course of the discussions, for the scheme that had been announced.  I was, in fact, very critical of it.  There were not many alternatives but whatever alternatives there were were also discussed.</P>
    <P>If a Minister, and especially a Minister for Agriculture, were to ignore the interests that were concerned in such matters as the growing of wheat, the price of wheat, and so on, and refuse to consult and argue with these interests, what would be said of me when we discuss a matter of this kind in the House?  However, even though on this occasion he not only met them and discussed the problems at considerable length but actually agreed in the main to the proposal which they themselves recommended as the best of all those mentioned, he is still open to criticism and censure.  I do not mind that at all. That is what one has to expect in a deliberative assembly.</P>
    <P>However, I do know&mdash;and this is the real safeguard to a Minister&mdash;that outside this House, outside all those bodies, which are in the nature of public bodies at which these matters are discussed, and discussed with an eye upon the propagandist effect of what may be said one way or another, the rank and file of the people outside recognised, as do the rank and file of the growers, that something would have to be done.  As I said at the outset, it never was the policy of Fianna Fáil to grow wheat for export and, if it was not the policy of Fianna Fáil, surely it would not be the policy <Col N="537" /> of those who could not be induced to grow wheat when wheat was really wanted?</P>
    <P>The scheme for the disposal of this surplus wheat has been under fire. Immediately on coming into office we disposed of 12,000 tons as animal feeding.  When the scheme was announced there were still about 150,000 tons of dried wheat.  The mills were asked to carry 50,000 tons into next year, leaving us with 100,000 tons to dispose of in some way.  I had discussions again with all interested parties in this matter and I was anxious to ensure that the greatest possible amount&mdash;all, if possible&mdash;of that wheat would be sold at home as animal feeding.  I had consultations with the Government, with the Department and the Minister for Finance, with the compound millers and with representatives of all interests.</P>
    <P>At that time the price of barley was £28 per ton.  I tried to get a price that would have a relation to that barley price in so far as wheat was to be used for animal feeding.  The price of £26 per ton was decided on.  I want to say &mdash;I shall deal with this more extensively later&mdash;that the only reason, the main reason, for fixing that price for the sale to compounders of whatever surplus wheat they could use was the fact that we had committed ourselves to guaranteeing the price of barley.</P>
    <P>I asked the compounders how much of this surplus wheat they were likely to use and I asked our own people if they could give me an estimate.  They did and the compounders also gave me an estimate.  From the Department of Industry and Commerce and the flour millers we had got a fair idea of the amount of wheat they might use for conversion into flour.  Complaints were being made to the flour millers apparently about the quality of the flour. The millers said the consumption of flour was going down and they attributed the fall in consumption&mdash;I do not say it was correct; I did not accept the contention myself&mdash;to the high extraction rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How would that reduce the consumption of flour?</P>

    <Col N="538" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the quality.  They asked us if we would give them some of this wheat at the feeding price so as to reduce the extraction rate and we did.</P>
      <P>After making all these arrangements the compound millers came to me at a later stage, at my request, because I could see that we were not likely, at the rate at which it was being taken up, to absorb all the surplus wheat that was there for feeding purposes and I was prepared to reduce the price at which that wheat would be sold if they could give me an assurance that there was a likelihood of their using all of it.  When I came to discuss the matter with them, they made their case.  It is one which I understand although I do not claim to have any great knowledge of the milling business, but all of us have some idea of the general ingredients that make up a suitable compound.  When I spoke to them and almost told them that I was prepared to review these feeding prices for wheat, entirely on condition, of course, that they would give an indication of the amount they would be likely to use, these men said: &ldquo;We are using as much of the native wheat as we can.  We want to keep our compound, to preserve its appearance and quality and the ingredients we have been accustomed to using in the main.&rdquo;  They said they would prefer to get 10,000 tons of pollard at the same price as we would be prepared to sell them 10,000 tons of this wheat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know who is daft or what is daft but I am stating truthfully the history of the wheat position about which we have heard so much talk and so much misrepresentation. I am not going to talk of the difference, from the feeding point of view, between a ton of dried wheat and a ton of pollard but at the same time I can understand that if you change substantially a compound mixture, and especially if you use a large quantity of wheat, it may happen, as they claim, that the mixture will become quite clammy and sticky, if and when water is applied to it as compared to the sort of compound they <Col N="539" /> had been in the habit of producing. These men of course are businessmen and they know the farmer's reaction to any change in the compound.  Even if it were a change for the better, if the farmer detects it and if it is too obvious he will immediately become suspicious that what he is getting is not really what he should get and not as good as what he was accustomed to get.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the House that there was no single question to which we gave more attention in the last couple of months than this involved matter of the wheat situation.  Some people had been making all sorts of suggestions as to what we should have done in regard to the 1958 crop&mdash;that we should have had a contract system, that we should have dealt with those people cashing in on wheat and all the rest of it.  While I freely admit that this is not the type of scheme which appeals to me, I find it hard to think of an alternative.  As I have already said, this is an experiment for the year.  It does not mean we shall give up trying or that we cannot think of anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like as much as any Deputy here to devise some means by which those engaged in legitimate wheat growing would be fully protected and able to get whatever guaranteed price was offered.  Is it not strange that, in spite of all the criticism levelled against the method of calculating the price for 1958, we are still told that the acreage will be increased over that of last year?  Some Deputies may say that certain commitments were entered into in advance of the announcement.  I do not believe that at all.  It may be true to a limited extent but it would not have any substantial bearing on the acreage.  When I was driving home one night I had to pass through Deputy Giles's county.  I saw a man standing on the road and I pulled up and gave him a seat.  He did not know me.  From his accent I suspected he was not a Meathman.  I asked him what he was doing there and he said: &ldquo;We were breaking up some land for wheat, although I believe the price is to be <Col N="540" /> reduced by 10/- per barrel.&rdquo;  No announcement had been made at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal now with the question of barley.  It was also raised by several Deputies on the motion dealing with wheat.  In the course of the discussion on that motion I made my attitude clear in regard to barley.  Before any price was announced for 1958 the fullest possible discussion took place between my Department, myself and representatives of the National Farmers' Association and other interests involved. What I am about to say is not due to any lack of appreciation of the importance of barley but because I believe it to be a correct attitude.  It is that the fixation of a barley price is a bad policy.  I challenged the representatives of the National Farmers' Association, having regard to the fact that barley is the raw material for bacon and live stock, to give me one reason <Col N="541" /> why the price of barley should be fixed and result in the creation of a situation such as I found when I came to fix a price at which the surplus wheat would be disposed of for animal feed.</P>
      <P>Barley is grown over a limited area. New varieties are being grown in a limited way.  Last year half the barley grown never saw a market.  It was retained by the people who grew it and fed by them to animals.  We had to, by our guarantee, put a floor price into barley at the harvest time of £2 per barrel and then proceed, through the activities of Grain Importers, to give that guarantee reality by purchasing some of whatever barley was grown as a cash crop and offered for sale in the green state.  Grain Importers, having put that floor on the barley price, then conveyed to private grain merchants the assurance that, if they bought what came on the market later, no other grain would be released at any time until that barley was disposed of and until of those who put their money in it, dried it, paid for the drying of it, stored it, paid interest on the money that went to purchase it, got their return and whatever profits were regarded as legitimate.  There was all that messing and all that meddling for the sake of half the barley crop that was grown last year.</P>
      <P>While all that was going on the whole picture had become so warped, as Deputy Desmond and some other Deputies described it, and the acreage under oats had fallen to such an extent&mdash;and in addition to the fall in the acreage it was a bad year for oats &mdash;that the oatmeal millers could not obtain enough oats for conversion into oatmeal; and they came to me looking for a permit to import oats.  At a later stage a number of other interests approached me on this matter&mdash;firms in Dublin and elsewhere which still retain horses for haulage purposes&mdash;and I found it very, very, very hard to refuse and I thought it very, very hard to grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seemed to me an extraordinary thing that such a position could have been reached.  We asked the representatives of the National Farmers' Association to make contacts in Donegal and elsewhere with a view to <Col N="542" /> finding out if oats could be obtained because, as every Deputy knows, the consumption of oatmeal has gone down lamentably in town and country and one would not like to see those who still retain the taste for oatmeal deprived, or being forced to follow the line that so many others have taken in regard to oatmeal as a food.</P>
    <P>I have said already that I do not believe in guaranteeing a price for barley.  Some Deputy mentioned the fact that we should do something about this oats matter, that we should grow oats under contract, that we should give a guaranteed price.  These recommendations came from different parts of the House.  But the price of oats was guaranteed here, not by one Government but by two, and it was a complete and absolute failure.  Some time around 1942 or 1943&mdash;I was not then a member of the Government, but I was a member of the Government Party&mdash;the Government of the day decided they would give a guaranteed price for oats.  I had no hesitation at the time in saying that I did not believe it would be effective, that I did not believe it was wise, that I did not believe it was justifiable.</P>
    <P>I do not say this now merely to demonstrate that all the wisdom was with me, or anything like that, but it was demonstrated on that occasion that a guaranteed price was not justifiable and did not work.  It was decided on for one year.  It was continued for a second year although it was clearly demonstrated from the beginning that it would not work.  After that no more was heard of it until 1948.  There was a heavy crop of oats.  There was a bad market.  Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture.  There was great dissatisfaction because you could not dispose of oats except at a rediculously low price.  I am sure that Deputy Dillon at the time was being pressed and urged to fix a price for oats and I feel that he realised the complications of taking a decision of that nature. Anyhow Deputy Dillon went away to the United States, I think, and by the time he arrived back again the acting Minister had fixed a price for oats.  It did not work then either.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, it was one of the <Col N="543" /> great laughing stocks of the time. After the announcement of this price, I remember Deputy Dillon making a statement either in this House or outside in which he said, in effect: &ldquo;If the farmer or oats-grower is in trouble just drop me a postcard.&rdquo;  They could have dropped him many a postcard at the time but the dropping of the postcard would not have solved their problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They dropped me Deputy Neal Blaney, which was even worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only going over this ground to show my own slant on these questions.  I can avail of any occasion on which the opportunity is presented to me to let the House and the country know the lines along which my mind is running.</P>
      <P>I would not be so foolish as to say that any one Minister has the right to determine matters of important policy. Subject to that condition, that was the state of my mind only a couple of months ago in my discussions with representatives of the National Farmers' Association and with every interest I thought could assist me in offering justification for the fixation of a barley price.</P>
      <P>I do not like calling upon semi-State organisations such as Grain Importers to come into this sort of question.  I am not saying they deliberately do any harm.  I am not saying their judgment is faulty.  However, I know that when you call upon Grain Importers or any such organisation to give effect to a price that is fixed for barley it means that they go out to the market, buy the barley, hire the stores in which it will be held and pay for these stores at the highest rate that can be charged because, as a semi-State organisation, they will not get storage on any basis except the most attractive.  Everything they do, as we all know, will cost them more and, ultimately, the community, than if it were done by the private individual who would have his finance and his own methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the introduction of a body such as Grain Importers to deal with what is, after all, a very small percentage of the grain needed here means that you interfere with the <Col N="544" /> business of the compounders and the millers and create the necessity for interviews with officials of my Department and interviews with the Minister. No matter who he may be or how well-advised he may be by his officials, no matter how knowledgeable he may be, it is fair to say he cannot be expected to know as much about these matters as businessmen who are engaged in such matters all their lives.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why the price of barley should be fixed any more than the price of oats or potatoes should be fixed, as was recommended by some Deputies.  The only reason why, after very prolonged thought and discussion, I recommended to the Government on this occasion that we should fix a price for barley was because I wanted to save the wheat-grower to the best of my ability.  I felt that if I did not name some price for barley there might be a greater tendency to switch over to further wheat-growing and that that would injure further the interests of those who, in fact, I was anxious to save.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the potato crop, the fall in the acreage and the price obtainable this year as against that obtainable last year.  I want to ask Deputies who have been plotting this course of the fixation of barley prices every time they make a speech, what better right, what stronger case, what more justification is there for the fixation of the price of barley than there is in respect of the potatoes crop? In 1957, potatoes could be bought for as low as £6 or £7 a ton.  This year the price is as high as £30.  Other years it might be £8, £9 or £10 a ton. Those who have been growing potatoes have been taking the risk, carrying the risk, putting one year against another &mdash;if this year is good maybe the next year will not be so good, and so on. I am, therefore, inviting all those members on every side of the House&mdash; even Deputies of my own Party&mdash;to ask themselves these questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>I have covered these four questions&mdash;wheat, barley, oats and potatoes.  I have done this largely as a warning.  As far as next year is concerned and as far as my attitude is concerned, I shall certainly recommend whatever the Government may decide.  I shall certainly recommend that there be considerable freedom in the manner in which animal feed stuff is to be provided, whether through the activities of our own farmers on their own land or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies were very critical of the manner in which we propose to set about electing five members from the rural organisations to the board of the institute.  In this regard I called into my office the representatives of what I thought were the six major organisations&mdash;the National Farmers' Association, Irish Countrywomen's Association, Muintir na Tíre, the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association and the Irish Agricultural Society.  I regarded them as the six major organisations of the very many organisations that would be entitled to claim to represent rural interests.  I was anxious to see if they could assist me and whether we could <Col N="546" /> arrive at an agreed method by which these five people would be elected.  We had a very long discussion and I am interpreting the result of that discussion fairly when I say that the attitude of the representatives of these organisations when leaving my office was: &ldquo;This is a tremendously difficult thing. We have not been able to help you. We have not been able to make any suggestion that would be of assistance to you and all we can say is &lsquo;do your best&rsquo;, whatever way you think is right and we will have to be satisfied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was anxious to bring into this matter as many of these organisations as I could, but I realised at the same time that there was a tremendous difference between the N.F.A., the I.C.M.S.A. and the Bee Keepers' Association, or some such a body confined to a very limited number of people.  I believe it was Deputy Sweetman who suggested that I was giving a slap in the face to some of these major organisations by the decision I made, and in the grouping that I effected in order to secure these five representatives.  I was doing no such thing.  I had no such intention.  I realised quite well there were five or six of the organisations that could be regarded as major ones.  I explained to these representatives that I was anxious to secure the widest representation possible in this knowledge that it is not necessarily the organisation with the largest membership that might have in its ranks the person who would suit, the person who would fit the bill best.  I quite freely admit it is not the sort of scheme that one could think of as being perfect but I certainly repudiate Deputy Sweetman's suggestion.  In fact the evidence is there to establish completely my justification for stating that I gave the fullest thought to this and that I consulted all those whom I thought could help me.  If anybody is anxious to test my statement and establish the truth of it, I think the representatives of these organisations will admit that was my approach.</P>
    <P>I am quite convinced that, much as we might find fault with the method and with the grouping, there had to be <Col N="547" /> some grouping.  It was even considered having representatives of 25 organisations together and telling them to select five members from their numbers. If one has to arrange grouping you will find no matter what you do the grouping will be open to criticism by somebody.  All I want to establish is that the method was certainly not designed for the purpose of giving anybody a slap in the fact.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon questioned my decision regarding the introduction of the Landrace pig.  He explained to the House the situation as it was when he was in the Department.  He explained the attitude of the veterinary and other advisers in the Department, and that he had acted in accordance with that advice.  He inquired as to whether or not the people who attended to this had changed their opinions.  It is quite true that the technical advice was as stated by Deputy Dillon, and it is quite correct to say that a Minister should be tremendously careful, tremendously cautious, and tremendously slow to arrive at a decision that is in conflict on an important matter with technical recommendations.  I believe that in matters of that nature, I must admit I am as conservative as most other people, but I do not admit that that rule should be observed slavishly from the beginning to the end of the road.</P>

      <P>On three different occasions since I came into the Department I found myself confronted with such situations.  The second was in relation to swine fever and the advice that was tendered on the methods to be employed in stamping it out.  I may say again that I have always been as hesitant about this question as anyone&mdash; and rightly so.  I was faced with the knowledge and information tendered to me by the technical people, I had my own knowledge and my own experience, I had a knowledge of all the facts and factors surrounding the case&mdash;to which, of course, the technicians need not refer at all, or to which the technicians need not have any regard.  All the technicians have to do is walk on this tight <Col N="548" /> rope.  They need only keep on the dotted line; if there is a risk in a million, the safe thing for them to do is say: &ldquo;Do not take it.&rdquo;  That is the background, that is the lead up, to my taking the decision to which Deputy Dillon referred, in regard to this question of the introduction of the Landrace pig.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, I am afraid I cannot oblige; I shall have to continue. As I am dealing with Landrace pigs, I shall say a word also on this whole matter of the industry.  We have been criticised because of the announcement some time ago, in regard to the price to be paid, from the 1st of July, for Grade A and Grade B.1 pigs. When the scheme was introduced by Deputy Dillon, it contained a provision that a six-month notice should be given.  Bacon prices on the export market were very low.  I think the provision in the Estimate for the sale of our surplus bacon was £60,000 or £70,000, and it cost about £750,000, and there was every appearance, as far as one could see, of a continuance of that situation.</P>
      <P>I do not think that I am misrepresenting the situation, or doing any injustice to anybody, when I say that even the representatives of the pig producers realised that, if that picture were to continue and if we were to be faced with those enormous subsidies, we would just have to ask the producer to make a small contribution. We did ask that and, as it so happened, the contribution was only one-third of what we regarded as the cost, roughly estimated, of exporting whatever surplus bacon we might have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting that producers, <Col N="549" /> or producers' representatives, will willingly and gladly accept that.  I am not suggesting that these people will just throw their hats in the air with delight when they hear that something is necessary, to deal with a situation such as that which the disposal of our surplus bacon has presented.  If we do not get reason&mdash;as I suppose, in the political sense, we cannot expect to get it&mdash;from our critics in this House, we shall get reason and understanding on the part of the people down the country who see this picture and who understand it.  It was in pursuance of that general line, that I had discussions with all the people interested in this business and we hammered out a scheme to come into effect on the 1st of July.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk as to the effects of the slump in the pig trade, caused by the poor price of bacon on the export market, and a number of other factors as well.  One of the things all of us would like to avoid is that sudden switching from heavy pig production to much reduced pig production, which used to be the pattern of things many years ago.  It has been claimed here that, as a result of this, there has been a tremendous fall in pig numbers but I am glad to say that, while there may have been some reduction&mdash;and there has been some reduction&mdash;we have devised the best means we can of keeping a check upon these <Col N="550" /> tendencies and, from the evidence and information we can gather in that way, we find there is no justification whatever&mdash;and I am very glad to say there is not&mdash;for the contention that pig numbers have fallen very rapidly and that all this has been the result of the decision announced, as to the very small reduction that might be effected in the guaranteed price as from the 1st of July next.</P>
    <P>I was about to go on to another matter, but I shall have to leave it over until to-morrow, as I do not want to make half a bite of a cherry.</P>
