      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that it is alleged that persons taken up by the R.U.C. and British military forces in the Six Counties are subjected to ill-treatment by them and forced to make false admissions; if he has any information to confirm this, and, if so, what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain (thar cheann an Taoisigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>Reliable figures for total emigration are available only for net emigration in respect of intercensal periods.  The reasons for this are set out at length in replies to previous questions on this subject.  I would, in particular, refer the Deputies to the replies to Deputy Hession on the 1st May, 1952, to Deputy Declan Costello on the 22nd October, 1952, and to Deputy McQuillan on the 27th October, 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics of emigration by sea to countries outside Europe are compiled annually and are published in the <i>Irish</i><Col N="3" /><i>Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin.</i> The figures in respect of 1957 are not yet available.</P>
    <P>Efforts have been made in the past to compute annual net emigration figures but experience has shown that, while these methods may enable total intercensal net emigration to be allocated on an annual basis with some degree of reliability, they do not enable reliable annual figures of net emigration to be computed in advance of intercensal data.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy" hpid="Mr. J. Murphy Mr. J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Government would never dare to tell the people the extent of emigration after another year of bungling?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach incline to the view that a figure of 50,000 would be approximately correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not express any opinion as to the figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanation has been given by the Parliamentary Secretary in the statement that has just been made that when the census figures over the previous five or ten years are known it is then possible to allocate backwards, not in advance, the annual figures by way of estimation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that in the past estimates of annual emigration have been made?  They have certainly been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, estimates have been made and afterwards the statistical authorities found that the bases on which they were made had become unreliable or unavailable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say if the Statistics Department has discontinued the procedure which had been carried on by the Registrar <Col N="4" /> General's Office of estimating the annual population from year to year, in an estimated way, until the figures of the census were available and before any adjustment backwards was made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the relation between the Registrar General's Office and the Statistics Department may be but I am sure&mdash; because I know that I myself have made representations time after time to the Statistics Department in an effort to get annual figures for emigration and they have told me so&mdash;that it is not possible to give an annual estimate except when the results of the census are known and when they can then allocate retrospectively the annual figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that when the work of registering was with the Registrar General's Office under the Department of Local Government an annual estimate was made year by year of population and that was adjusted when a census return became available as the record of year to year estimates of popular tion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer that specifically except to say that I assume, because of representations I myself made to the Statistics Department, that if they were able, by means of the Registrar General's estimates, to get reliable figures that system would have been retained.</P>

      <P>In case Deputy General Mulcahy's supplementary question might give rise to any misunderstanding let me say that there is a representative of the Central Statistics Office working in the office of the Registrar General to transfer to the Central Statistics Office all the information which was previously furnished to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the estimations and calculations <Col N="5" /> carried out by the Registrar General's Office are not now made available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And in the meantime would the Taoiseach consider stationing somebody at Shannon airport to see the aeroplanes, on which Deputy Russell I believe has information, exclusively filled with Irish speakers from Connemara?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

The index number for the fourth quarter of 1957 is not yet available.</P>
      <P>The quarterly inquiry does not extend beyond transportable goods industries.  Consequently it is not possible to furnish quarterly volume index numbers of production for all industries and services covered by the annual Census of Industrial Production. The volume index number for the year 1955, to base 1953=100, was 107.8.  It is estimated that the corresponding figure for the year 1956 was 104 while that for 1957 is not yet available.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 17, 18, 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The agreement for the operation of the Aerlínte transatlantic service provides for the use of chartered aircraft. No question of capital expenditure on the acquisition of aircraft arises, and any working capital required will be met by Aerlínte out of their own resources or by borrowing.  No additional capital investment by the Exchequer is contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that the Aerlínte service can achieve the same average year-round utilisation of seats as has been experienced by all companies operating on transatlantic routes, and <Col N="13" /> on that basis, it will operate profitably. As regards employment, it is intended to make arrangements to cater for the service through the Aer Lingus organisation.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the proposed transatlantic air service does not affect the Government's policy to develop Shannon as the only transatlantic airport in this country. Arrangements are being made for the construction of a new jet runway there, and a new Shannon development authority has recently been set up further to develop the facilities and amenities of the airport and surrounding areas so as to attract additional traffic, and particularly terminal tourist traffic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether any assurance has yet been received from any of the transatlantic air companies that they will use the extended runway at Shannon for the new jet planes when the runway has been constructed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know, the companies which will be acquiring these aircraft and which are now making plans for their utilisation from 1960 onwards, will certainly use that runway for these aircraft.  I do not quite follow the question.  I do not see what option they would have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that 12 months ago or thereabouts it was not possible to ascertain from the transatlantic air companies whether in fact they would use the extended runway, if it were provided, but it was felt at that time that you might remove an excuse for their not using it, if the runway were provided.  I caused the Secretary of the Department to go to America to discuss the utilisation of the extended runway with these transatlantic air companies.  Would the Minister say whether, since then, any assurance has been received from these companies that they will in fact use the runway at Shannon, when it is provided, instead of overflying Shannon and using another equally serviceable runway, perhaps, in some other European city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="14" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Deputy's question, it is divided into two parts.  First of all, the existing runways at Shannon are not capable of taking the heavy jet aircraft.  Unless Shannon is to be closed down altogether, a runway capable of taking these aircraft must be provided.  With regard to the effect of the development of jet aircraft on the transatlantic routes upon the future of Shannon, as I have explained, we have set up a Shannon development authority which has been charged with the duty of developing the amenities at Shannon, investigating the possibility of increasing the freight business there and generally exploiting the tourist potentialities of the Shannon airport and its hinterland with a view to the increase of the business of the airport, particularly terminal traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point is that the transatlantic air companies are believed to be interested in finding long runways, heavily reinforced, for the new jet planes.  It was desired&mdash; 12 months ago, at all events&mdash;to ascertain if they would continue to use Shannon with that new type of plane if the Shannon runways were extended and reinforced&mdash;because they can take a decision that Shannon is not to be a landing-point for this particular type of aircraft.  Has any assurance been received from the transatlantic air companies that, in fact, they will stop at Shannon in the case of this new heavy type of jet aircraft?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is far too sweeping a question.  There are about 20 air companies operating through Shannon.  I do not want to suggest that we have discussed with every one of them their operational plans after 1960.  The problem that will arise for Shannon, with the development of the jet aircraft, is under active discussion with all those who are in a position to advise us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us cut out 17 of the 20 air companies.  I have in mind now three specific air companies&mdash;T.W.A., P.A.A., and Trans-Canada.  Have any of these given an assurance that they will use the new jet runway?</P>

    <Col N="15" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by &ldquo;assurances&rdquo;. There have been discussions with all these companies regarding their future operational plans.  As regards using the new jet runways, we will not allow them to use any other with these heavy aircraft because the others would not stand them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not what you will allow them to use, but what they will use.  Has any effort been made in the past 12 months to ensure that, having constructed and reinforced this new runway at a cost of £1,000,000, these transatlantic air services will use the new runway?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Shannon was established as this country's transatlantic airport with the full support of the transatlantic operators and to meet their special needs, and it is the Government's policy to maintain that position.  When these special needs required extended runway facilities, because of the introduction of new types of aircraft, it was only logical to provide them where they were required &mdash;at the country's transatlantic airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country cannot afford two transatlantic airports and a decision in favour of Dublin would have meant the abandonment of Shannon, with the serious social and economic consequences which this would involve, as <Col N="16" /> well as the provision at Dublin of an entirely new terminal building and terminal facilities at heavy cost.</P>
    <P>The new works at Shannon airport are estimated to cost about £1,000,000. The cost of providing the necessary runway facilities at Dublin and a new terminal building if it were to replace Shannon would obviously be far greater.</P>

      <P>At a conference held in the Department on the 16th January, 1956, at which the local authority's technical consultants on the proposed Cork Regional Hospital project were present, it was agreed that some preliminary site development works, that is, bulk excavations for buildings, excavations for one main roadway and provision of temporary surfacing therefor, etc., could be carried out in advance of the main contract as these would not affect the tendering for the building work and would not result in any increase in cost.  The architects undertook to have the matter taken up with the local authority, as it was desirable that any such work should be put in hands as soon as possible in order to avail of the favourable weather during the summer months.  Subsequently, on 19th May, 1956, the South Cork Board of Assistance requested the sanction of the then Minister to the acceptance of a tender for the carrying out of preliminary site works at the Regional Hospital.  Sanction was given on 1st June, 1956.</P>

The employees of the Dublin Corporation who are directly employed on health services are undoubtedly a very small fraction, but they are a very small fraction also of the total number of health employees throughout the country.  In the case of health employees in general, the cost of any award which may be made by the Labour Court will fall, as to 50 per cent. of it, to be borne by the Exchequer, that is to say, by the taxpayer whom Deputy Declan Costello purports to represent in this House.

      <P>As regards the last part of the Deputy's question, I do not intend in present circumstances to ask the Government for funds to increase further the level of social welfare benefits; and I would remind him that old age pensions, widows' non-contributory pensions and unemployment assistance were all increased last summer in order to offset as far as possible the effect of the ending of the food subsidies.</P>

Further measures which will ensure closer administrative control are under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any <Col N="31" /> increased illegal traffic in cattle across the land frontier.  There is little reason why there should be since no duty is chargeable on Six-County cattle and, apart from certain restrictions as to times and routes under the land frontier regulations, cattle may be freely imported and exported across the land frontier.</P>
      <P>I am also satisfied that, generally speaking, illegal traffic in other goods across the land frontier has not increased appreciably in recent years.</P>

    <P>NOTE: Lower rates of contribution can be accepted where a scheme affords a substantial measure of general public utility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> (g) The scheme was curtailed during the latter part o the financial year 1956-57 and the beginning o 1957-58 as a result of decisions taken by the Government of the day (i) to make reduced financial provision for 1956-57 and (ii) to make a further reduction in the provision for 1957-58.  These financial arrangements involved the suspension of offers of grants in outstanding cases and a close-down on the receipt of new applications.  The present Government decided to re-establish the scheme on a sounder basis by increasing the 1957-58 Vote provision from £150,000 to £200,000 and by requiring beneficiaries to contribute a somewhat higher proportion of the total cost.  The revised scale of contributions was based on the considerations that the benefits afforded to landholders by the carrying out of these works were such as to allow ample margins for an increase in the rates of contribution without imposing hardship, and that the applicants willingness to bear a reasonable proportion of the total cost, according to their means, would ensure that the available State grant would be applied towards the most urgent and necessary schemes.</P>

They suggested to me that a new chairman from outside the committee should be appointed, but I was unable to agree with this suggestion, for the reason that it would prolong for an undue further period the committee's already lengthy proceedings.  As it was the view of the members of the committee that it would be impracticable to have a chairman appointed from within the committee's membership, I wrote to the members on 20th December, 1957, asking them to furnish me by 1st March, 1958, with their comments, either individually or otherwise, on the revised report of the technical director which, I understood, had been furnished to them shortly before.</P>

      <P>As regards parts (d) and (e) of the question, records of subsidy payments are not kept in respect of calendar years but are available for financial years.  In the financial year 1955-56 commercial exports of creamery butter amounted to 5,910 cwt. on which subsidy amounting to £11.761 or 4.3 pence per lb. was paid.  In 1956-57, 40,137 cwt. of butter were exported on which subsidy amounting to £355,016 or 1/7 per lb. was paid and in the current financial year 1957-58, 267,611 cwt. were exported from 1st April, 1957, to 31st December, 1957, on which subsidy, estimated at £2.2 million or 1/5.6d. per lb. is payable.</P>
      <P>As to part (f) of the question, the national average retail price of creamery butter, as calculated quarterly by the Central Statistics Office for the official consumer price index was 3/9 per lb. in 1955 and 1956 and 4/2 per lb. in 1957.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>State Guarantees Act, 1954 (Amendment of Schedule) Order, 1958,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft has been laid before the House.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this draft Order is to guarantee borrowing to the extent of £1,300,000 approximately by St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited. That is the amount of money which is required now to bring the copper mine at Avoca from its present stage of development to a stage where it will be ready to go into production and also to repay a sum of £350,000 which was borrowed in September last by St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited, on a short term basis under a guarantee given under the Trade Loans Guarantee Acts.</P>
      <P>Deputies are aware in general terms of the history of this mining enterprise in County Wicklow.  These copper deposits were investigated over a number of years by Mianraí Teoranta, a State company which was set up by legislation passed in 1947 for that and similar purposes and which received, during the whole period of its exploration work at Avoca, Government grants for that work totalling £543,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the exploration work had proven the existence at Avoca of valuable deposits of ore&mdash;valuable in the sense that the quality of the ore had been established and the area of the <Col N="62" /> deposits had been revealed so that commercial working became possible&mdash; the mines were leased in 1956 to Canadian interests who established this Irish registered company known as St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited to undertake the commercial development of the deposits.  St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited is a subsidiary of Irish Copper Mines Incorporated, which is registered in Canada; and Irish Copper Mines Incorporated is, in turn, a subsidiary of another Canadian mining company known as the Mogul Mining Corporation.</P>
    <P>Since the lease was given to St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited in 1956 they have been actively engaged in the development of the deposits, and in the construction of a flotation plant, with the object of commencing production on a commercial scale as soon as practicable.  The target date they had in mind in that regard was June or July of this year.  As Deputies are aware, they are employing a substantial number of workers in these development activities and that number may be expected to increase when commercial production commences.  Up to the present they have spent over £2,000,000 on the project and the progress reports which they have made periodically to the Department of Industry and Commerce indicate that their scheme of development is being executed efficiently and very expeditiously.</P>
    <P>However, the company have run into financial difficulties.  St. Patrick's Copper Mines, Limited, were dependent for their finances upon their parent company, Irish Copper Mines Incorporated; and Irish Copper Mines Incorporated, as Deputies will understand, were dependent on their parent company, the Mogul Mining Corporation. Credit restrictions in Canada, which became quite acute in the past year, have seriously affected all investment and development projects and the Mogul Mining Corporation informed me that they were encountering difficulties in financing the completion of the development work at Avoca.  They said they were being forced to make a selection between the various projects in which they <Col N="63" /> were interested with a view to deciding which of them should go on and which of them in the circumstances should be brought to a standstill.</P>
    <P>About another £1,000,000 is needed to bring the Avoca operations to the stage at which commercial working can commence.  If that money is not forthcoming, development work will have to cease and the mine will not be brought to the production stage at all. When they reported that position to me last September, I considered that while investigations were being made into the possibility of raising the money by one means or another, the company should be temporarily assisted to maintain its operations. Therefore, I gave a trade loan guarantee for £350,000 which was raised by the company on a short term basis from an Irish bank.  If that financial accommodation had not been made available to the company they would have had to cease operations in September last.</P>
    <P>Since then the promoters, that is to say, the Canadian interests which are backing the St. Patrick's copper mines, have been very active in their efforts to secure financial accommodation from various sources.  After exploring some other possibilities, they succeeded in procuring an offer of a loan of £1.3 million from a Canadian issuing house. The terms and conditions of that loan which would have involved a guarantee by the Government here of payment of interest and repayment of capital&mdash; that was a condition under which the loan was offered&mdash;were regarded by me as so onerous as to make it a transaction for which it would not be appropriate to give the guarantee of the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>During the course of discussions which I had with the representatives of the company in the matter, I became aware that there was an Irish company which was prepared to consider granting them the loan they were seeking on more favourable conditions. Subsequently, the Canadian interest negotiated with that Irish company for a loan of £1,368,420.  It is a condition of that loan that it should be <Col N="64" /> guaranteed by the Government both as to interest and principal.</P>
    <P>The loan will be secured by a first mortgage on the present and future assets of the St. Patrick's copper mines.  It is a substantial liability, reckoned in a financial way, for the Government to undertake and we naturally gave very careful consideration to the question whether we would be justified in guaranteeing a loan of that magnitude.  In our appraisal of that situation we had regard to the fact that these copper deposits in Avoca represent a national asset of very considerable value.</P>
    <P>When I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, persuaded the Dáil to enact the legislation and vote the money which started the process of exploration at Avoca, I expressed my view then, based upon the information which was available from our technical advisers, that these deposits would turn out to be a considerable national asset but, in fact, the investigation of them has disclosed that they are even more important than I then assumed. That is, I think, a factor which the Government was entitled to take into account and which the Dáil should have due regard to also.</P>
    <P>Very substantial employment is, as the House knows, being provided by the development work now in progress and the value of the production that will eventually take place and which, of course, will be entirely for export in the form of copper concentrates, will be also important from a national viewpoint. The deposits which have been proved, in the technical sense of that term, are sufficient to justify commercial development on a substantial scale for a period of about 12 years.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact that we have spent £550,000 on the preliminary work on these deposits and that expenditure will be wasted or at any rate unproductive for the time being unless St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd. are able to obtain the additional funds which are now needed to enable them to complete the development work.  While I would be most reluctant to contemplate the possibility that it would be necessary for the Government, if it guarantees <Col N="65" /> the loan, to enforce the security, nevertheless, the fact remains that if this security had to be enforced as a result of default in repayment by the St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited, the Government would acquire, under the agreement, control of an undertaking upon which more than £3,500,000 will have been expended and which will have been then brought to the stage of full development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the general situation.  The company have spent approximately £2,000,000 to date of their own resources.  Perhaps, there may be some misunderstanding in that regard; £350,000 was the amount they borrowed under the short-term guarantee loan; £2,000,000 has been spent including the £350,000 on development work and £1,000,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>By July next the mine will be at the stage where it can commence the production of concentrates. At that stage £3,500,000 will have been spent.  If it should happen that the company cannot carry on and have to default on their obligations under the loan arrangements, then we come into control of that mine in consideration of paying off the amount which the company has borrowed and which we are guaranteeing under this arrangement.  I should not like to see that situation developing because I think it is far better that the existing arrangements for the commercial working of the mine should be carried through.</P>
      <P>In that regard the House must take cognisance of the very substantial fall in the price of copper during the course of the past year.  That fall in the price of copper has created difficulties for St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd. Presumably it was one of the factors which made it difficult for the company to procure the additional finance which it needed to complete its development operations without recourse to the assistance of a Government guarantee. It is certainly a factor which must be taken into account in deciding whether or not we should guarantee these borrowings by the company.</P>
      <P>In March, 1956, when the Dáil was discussing this matter previously copper had reached £436 per ton; since then it has fallen to £164&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is about right. That collapse in the price of copper is stated to be due to the very considerable increase in production which the rise in the price of copper prior to 1956 had set in train.  In this matter, however, we have sought to obtain views from the most authoritative sources open to us.  They tell us that while mining development throughout the world is certainly not being planned upon the assumption that copper would remain at or over £400 per ton for long, it is based in the main upon estimates that the price <Col N="67" /> may average around £220 to £240 per ton.</P>
      <P>These competent authorities advise us that the fall in the price of copper is sharper than most experts in that field would have attempted to predict and that the present price of copper is considerably lower than the oversupply position would appear to justify. The outlook for copper is regarded as quite hopeful because of the prospective growth in the use of electric power and in industrial output which will involve an increase in the world's demand for electrical equipment and for apparatus made from copper.  The size of the known copper reserves of the world is said to be remarkably small and the prospects for mines such as Avoca are reasonably good, in the light of estimates that world consumption of copper will increase by 1,000,000 tons or about 33? per cent. between this year and 1960 or so.</P>
      <P>However, before we came to a conclusion upon the question of guaranteeing these borrowings for St. Patrick's Copper Mines we had the benefit of a report on the Avoca mine which was prepared by a well-known investment trust which has a substantial mining interest including copper in various parts of the world. A study of the report shows that the experts, employed by the trust to prepare it, had formed a distinctly favourable impression of the Avoca deposits.  It was stated in the report that the development and construction work at the mine was proceeding in a very workmanlike fashion and they described the approach to the mining operation involved there as &ldquo;imaginative, yet sound&rdquo;.  The original estimates for mining and milling costs which were made by the Mogul Mining Corporation when the question of the lease was being negotiated have been confirmed by the report, and the estimates of mineral reserves which were made then have been shown to be very conservative.  The mill design was stated by these experts to be sound and the anticipated recoverings and the costs were reasonable and were amply supported by laboratory tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crucial factors which were the <Col N="68" /> concern of the experts who prepared the report were the anticipated forward price of copper and, of course, the possibility of finding sale for the pyrites concentrates which will be obtained from ore at Avoca as byproducts.</P>
    <P>A decision regarding the guaranteeing of the loan obviously depends therefore upon some imponderables.  A risk has to be taken but it is a closely calculated risk and, of course, unless it is taken there can be no hope that the development of the Avoca Mine will be undertaken in present circumstances. We reached the conclusion, therefore, that we would be fully justified in guaranteeing the loan and we recommend to Dáil Eireann that it should approve of the draft Order under the State Guarantees Act which has been laid before the House.  By doing so we will ensure that the development of the mine will be completed, that it will be brought to the stage of production and, as I said, at the worst it means that we would acquire control of this valuable national asset, to be availed of as circumstances allowed; at best we shall have helped the fulfilment of a very useful type of undertaking which will add substantially to our national resources.  Therefore, although I had to give a considerable amount of thought and time to the examination of this matter I have no hesitation in expressing my view that the right course is to give that guarantee and I would ask the Dáil to approve the Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And St. Patrick's copper mines.  I must confess that I heard the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce with considerable pleasure.  In that speech, in a few words, lasting for perhaps half an hour at the most, he tore to ribbons everything that he had said in February, 1956, everything that Deputy Aiken, as he then was, on this side of the House, and other speakers had said.  I congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce for having provided so completely in his speech to-day the vindication of the measures that were taken by Deputy Norton and me two and a half years ago.  The Minister can be assured that on this occasion&mdash;and I know that I am speaking for Deputy Norton in this; he will be speaking himself afterwards &mdash;he will get from this side of the House far more constructive help in <Col N="71" /> dealing with this mining venture than was given to us and to me when I was handling the Mining Bill when I was on that side of the House and the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party were over here.  Even down to the very last details the Minister has confirmed and has vindicated the views that we then expressed.</P>
      <P>I shall give the Minister the references if he wishes.  All the references that I shall quote come out of Volume 154.  I remember quite well how the Minister and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party made the welkin ring because, in accordance with the normal practice and because of the difficulties of commercial working, the lease was not at that time put on the table of the House.  Now the Minister proposes to do exactly the same thing in respect of the draft agreement.  I want to say categorically now, as I said then, that the practice is correct in both instances.  Perhaps in an effort to hide and to gloss over some of the things the Minister said at an earlier stage, we have not got down really to the bedrock or the roots of the necessity for this motion.</P>
      <P>First of all, let me say quite categorically, also, that I think it is right that a project of this size should be dealt with under the State Guarantees Act with this procedure rather than under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts because the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts did not visualise anything as comprehensive or as large as this project.  But I do think it would be desirable, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance&mdash;a Minister, shall we say&mdash;was coming to this House that he would have given us more information as to the examination that has taken place on a similar basis to that carried out under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to a report that he had received from an investment trust and that such report confirmed the methods of working and the costings.  I find considerable difficulty in relation to that in agreeing the figures.  The original figures were that <Col N="72" /> it was to take £1,500,000 for the erection of the concentrator and £750,000 additional to that for other workings and for the purpose of bringing the mine to productive working.  The figures the Minister has given in relation to the necessity for this guarantee make it appear that those original estimates have been somewhat exceeded.  If the position is that £2,000,000 has been spent up to date and a further £1,000,000 is now required, setting off the £385,000 against the £350,000 trade loan guarantee already obtained, then it would seem that approximately £3,000,000 is required and I think the Minister should give us some indication as to the reason for that change.</P>
    <P>When the St. Patrick's copper mines authorities came to the Minister for Industry and Commerce subsequent to the change of Government and requested a loan under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts first of all and requested this loan now, it was open to the Minister of the day to make any changes or terms that he wished.  It was open to him to suggest any variation that he wanted to suggest in the terms of the existing lease or the terms of the existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>We all know the manner in which the existing arrangements were attacked up and down the country and the manner in which the personal reputations of Deputy Norton and of myself were attacked by Fianna Fáil some two years ago, without any regard for the truth or without any regard for the facts and it is at least satisfactory to us now to know that the Fianna Fáil Minister for Industry and Commerce has come into this House to say, in his own words, that he could have varied those terms but he thought that it was far preferable that the existing arrangements should be carried through.  I doubt if there could have been a more complete vindication of the steps that were taken by Deputy Norton and myself and that were attacked so viciously at that time.</P>
    <P>It would have been possible for us in February, 1956, to refute in a more categoric way much of the bunkum and nonsense that was talked in this House and outside it by, let me add, Deputy <Col N="73" /> Lemass, as he then was, amongst others but even more so by Deputy Aiken as he then was, but for us to do so would have meant decrying the value of the work that had been done, the value of the work that was likely to be done and the possibilities of profitable operating.  We preferred, and were right in preferring, no matter how much we were attacked at that time, to say nothing in our defence that would in any way affect the working of a national asset.  We remember particularly how Deputy Lemass, as he then was, made the welkin ring with estimates that St. Patrick's Copper Mines, Limited, the Canadian interests, would be able to extract out of this venture some £13,000,000 profit.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has any doubt about his recollection, he would be wise to refer to column 97.  We were accused, up and down the country, of giving away a project to Canadian interests that would mean a profit of £13,000,000 for them.  Now the facts emerge.  The Minister has just said that this is a borderline mine.  It has a good volume of a fairly low-grade copper concentrate. It is a borderline mine that can produce satisfactory workings and an adequate volume of copper concentrate but it will not be on the basis suggested by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party at that time in an attempt to delude the country.</P>
    <P>They had an opportunity, as the Minister said a few minutes ago, of changing the arrangements, if they wanted to.  He then said it was preferable that the existing arrangements be carried on.  If there had been any truth in the figures put before Dáil Eireann in February, 1956, by the members of the then Opposition, there would not be any necessity now to come to this House with this motion. If those figures were operative, the money could be obtained anywhere without the slightest difficulty or necessity for a Government guarantee.</P>
    <P>We can remember, too, how, at that time, the then Deputy Lemass pinned his faith to the opinion which he voiced in February, 1956&mdash;when the price of copper was over £400&mdash;that anybody except a fool knew that that price <Col N="74" /> would be maintained and would probably be exceeded.  We preferred to take a more realistic view.  The course of events in relation to copper prices has shown that our view was correct. Time has proved that the view so cheaply bandied about by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, in an attempt to decry the work of the inter-Party Government, was entirely without foundation.</P>
    <P>This motion is to ensure that the work we did in interesting the Canadian people in this mine can now be carried through to the benefit of the Irish people, both in relation to employment and to the production that will operate in Avoca.  We support the view that funds should be invested in something that will give a productive result.  Our whole trouble has been one of too little investment in production. This is an opportunity for further productive effort.</P>
    <P>We shall not make the case&mdash;as I know Fianna Fáil, judging by their 1956 effort, would make the case&mdash;that there was a sum of £1,385,000 for the Canadian interests, while, at the same time, the grants for farmers who wanted to rid their herds of bovine tuberculosis were being halved because there was no money for them.  We shall not attack this project in the cheap political manner in which it was attacked two years ago.  I regard the Minister's speech to-day as a complete vindication of what was done by us and as a withdrawal&mdash;albeit, an implied withdrawal, but as much as one can hope to obtain from the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;of the very scandalous propaganda which he started two years ago and which he has now found to be entirely without foundation.</P>
    <P>Apart from this project in Avoca, does the Minister propose to make similar arrangements available for possible copper mines in other parts of the country?  There was a report recently of an investigation by a geologist on the work to date in the Berehaven peninsula.  Another company are operating there.  Is it proposed that that interest will be fostered in the same way?  Is it proposed that the many other exploratory operations in <Col N="75" /> relation to our mineral resources which, 12 months ago, were being carried out in various parts of the country will be assisted by the Government in the same manner as this project?</P>
    <P>Whether one likes it or not, the fact remains that, with the exception of Slieveardagh and Avoca&mdash;we are aware of the work that was done in both these instances by Mianraí Teoranta&mdash;until the inter-Party Government came into office in 1954, nobody was interested in any minerals anywhere else in the country.  If there was&mdash;and there has been&mdash;interest in Irish mineral resources in the years 1955 and 1956, it was because of certain steps that were taken for the purpose of publicising, in the then high mineral price atmosphere, the resources we had.  As the present Minister knew very well, there were such high prices for minerals that you could get almost anything considered in the then existing boom. That was the moment to do it, and it was done.  It was possible to get that interest only because of the steps we took as a Government to change the tax laws in relation to mining ventures &mdash;a task which the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, some 20 years previously, had to tackle but failed completely to carry out.  Having learned his lesson&mdash;and having, by implication, come to this House to-day with a white sheet around him for all the things he said two years ago&mdash;I hope the Minister will learn further lessons and assist the other projects in the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>I had, unfortunately, to listen to some of them and I never suffered myself to be tortured by such dishonesty and claptrap in my life before or since, thank God.  I suggest to the Fianna Fáil Deputies sitting here that a nice little mental recreation for themselves this evening or to-morrow would be to go down to the Library and get a copy of the debate on this matter in February, 1956, to read it carefully and contrast what was said then with the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce here this evening.  Then they will know how quickly some quicksilver-minded gentlemen can change their outlook.</P>
      <P>If there is any such thing as human shame left, the Minister ought to have opened his speech this evening with an apology for what he said in 1956 and what was said also at that time by his colleagues who now, for their then political dishonesty, are rewarded with seats on the Cabinet benches.  Even during the last election, members of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;and, of course, the kept organ of the Party&mdash;engaged in all kinds of misrepresentations about the Avoca mines.  It was then alleged, in 1956, that this was a spoof, that this was not a sincere business, that if it was sincere, it was dishonest in its whole concept and a kind of political dodge by the inter-Party Government.  The present Minister for Industry and Commerce was the spearhead of all that misrepresentation.</P>

      <P>That is not true, and I hope the Minister will quote it when he is replying.  What the Minister should now read is what the present Minister for Finance said during the last election about the Avoca mines, what Deputy Aiken said; and it will all prove very interesting and entertaining, particularly for anyone in search of objective truth.</P>
      <P>I can understand the Minister being annoyed about these quotations.  Everybody is annoyed when they are reminded about misstatements they have made and false prophecies they have made.  The Minister turned out to be a perfect mineralogical quack, so far as the Avoca mines are concerned.  All his prophecies have proved to be thoroughly unfounded.  The price of copper and every other thing the Minister had a try at, turned out to be just not true.  Now he comes into the House this evening and says he is satisfied this is a good venture; he is satisfied, on the technical advice which he has got, that the Government should back this venture to the extent of £1.3 millions.  A reputable investment trust which has copper interests in various parts of the world has also furnished a report on this, which has so impressed the Minister that he comes into the House to ask the House to give a guarantee in these terms.  I think that is a very good conversion on the part of the Minister.  He has realised now in 1958 what he ought to have realised in 1956, if he had not been concerned with making so much political mischief at the time&mdash;and making it at a time when in fact the development of the mines might then have been seriously imperilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Look at the facts surrounding this matter.  This mine was in the hands of Mianraí Teoranta for quite a while. They had been told by the Fianna Fáil Government, previous to 1954, to try to make the mine merchantable, to try to get the mine sold to some commercial interest which would exploit it. <Col N="78" /> All efforts to get anybody to interest themselves in the mine completely failed.  Nobody was interested in the mine&mdash;not even the trust to which the Minister referred to-day, not even probably some of the advisers on whom the Government relied for advice on this matter within the past 12 months. But we succeeded, by a revision of the mining taxation code, in getting a Canadian group interested in this mine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give a fair and full answer and, what is more, the file in the Minister's own Department will testify to the truth of what I am saying. When we had the discussions with the Canadians, they were long and at times tedious discussions, at which officials of the Department sat in.  It was clear to us that nobody would be interested in the development of the mines&mdash;except somebody from a mental home, perhaps&mdash;unless the mining taxation laws were revised. In the discussions with the Canadians, we said to them that, if they were interested in this matter, we were prepared to revise the mining taxation laws and make a lease to them on the basis of the revised mining taxation laws.  The Canadians would never have looked at Avoca, if it had not been for the revision of the mining taxation laws.  I am certain of that.  The Minister will have the opportunity, between now and the introduction of his Estimate, of checking the files in his own Department and seeing that what I assert here represents the whole truth and that there is no suppression of any portion of it.  Therefore, the Avoca development came about as a result of the amendment of the mining taxation laws.</P>

    <P>Similarly, because of the amendment <Col N="79" /> of the mining taxation laws, other groups were encouraged to start in other parts of the country.  To the extent that they could make a success of those mining efforts, I felt it was all to the good, that it might help to kill the notion that whatever we could do with Irish men and women, we could not mine minerals and could not successfully exploit the minerals.  I was, therefore, favourable to almost anything that would rekindle in our people a feeling that we had minerals here which, in then existing circumstances, could be profitably exploited and that our people were not inoculated in some supernatural way against the possibility of being able to produce minerals successfully.  Let there be no doubt about it, however&mdash;there would have been none of that mineral development if it had not been for the revision of the mining taxation code&mdash; for which we were responsible.</P>
    <P>I do not want these somersaults by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on this question of Avoca mineral development to colour my view on the Avoca project.  I think the Avoca project is as good to-day as it was when it was started.  I think the Minister has done right in offering to guarantee this sum of money, because I believe that if we can make a success of Avoca, we will do a lot, first, to develop a source of wealth not previously available to us and, secondly, to rekindle the enthusiasm of our people for the possibility of further mineral development in those areas.  In any case, having undertaken and carried through so much development work at Avoca, it would be a great tragedy if at this stage the work were to stop and the mines perhaps become flooded again because of the inability of the present owners to carry on development work at the mines.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask a few questions in connection with this guarantee.  It is said that approximately £1.3 million is required.  Is portion of this for the purpose of providing a concentrator and is any portion of it related to the possibility of the installation of a smelter?  I had discussed with the Canadian group the possibilities not <Col N="80" /> merely of extracting the concentrates from the ore, but of smelting the ore here.  There is a shortage of smelting capacity in Europe and the Canadians intended to take out the concentrates from the ore and to export the concentrates for smelting in Canada, subject to our right to buy back whatever copper we wanted at an agreed price. I tried to get them to discuss the question of the installation of a smelter.  One of the points, which I felt was a strong one, put to me at that time was that it would require a few mines like Avoca, or a mine a few times the size of Avoca, to justify the economic operation of a smelter.  The possibility was raised of our taking in some other mines in this country or outside it and of smelting the concentrate here because of the possibility of profitable and valuable employment which, I felt at the time, would be advantageous from a production point of view.</P>
    <P>I should like to know now whether any portion of this £1.3 million is to be used to provide a smelter or whether at this stage, the Avoca Company has taken any decision on the question of the installation of a smelter or whether it is to continue exporting the concentrates for smelting elsewhere.  I should like also to know how much employment is given in the mines at present and whether the State mortgage on the mines in this instance represents a first mortgage on the mines or whether any other Canadian group have any mortgage other than the original £500,000 which the company is liable to repay to the Government.  May I also ask what rate of interest the Avoca Company will pay on the money which the State has now guaranteed?</P>
    <P>The question of barytes was discussed during the formation stages of the Avoca Company.  It was thought that the disposal of the barytes partly here and partly elsewhere would represent a valuable source of income to the country.  Will any portion of this money be devoted to the exploitation of this matter and, if so, what are the estimated prospects of a profitable sale of barytes elsewhere?  Is it proposed to develop the processing of barytes for use here?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> I want to sound one word of warning in connection with this guarantee. I am strongly in favour of giving it. I think it is the right thing to do.  We just have to pin our hopes on the possibility that the people engaged in Avoca will be able profitably to exploit the mineral deposits there.  Mind you, it is going to be difficult unless copper prices change.  When this was discussed with St. Patrick's mines&mdash;the company operating at Avoca&mdash;it was believed the company could operate profitably so long as copper prices did not fall below £220 per ton.  At that time copper was selling at about £400 per ton and there was therefore a pretty deep cushion between the current price and the price at which it was believed the company could operate profitably.</P>
    <P>Prices now are down to about £170 per ton and have been falling for quite a time.  There is no sign of a rise in copper prices and copper is one of the commodities which goes up inexplicably and comes down inexplicably speedily.  There are a limited number of copper deposits throughout the world.  Some of them are in places which can become politically hot from time to time.  Therefore, copper deposits situated in a country which enjoys relatively tranquil periods of Government are well worth safeguarding, exploring and exploiting.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the Avoca people may not be able to get anything like £220 per ton for the concentrate for conversion into copper.  They may be faced with heavy losses.  The situation which exists to-day might recur and we might be faced with the prospect of another guarantee.  On the other hand copper prices may rise, as the optimists believe they will.  The hope of all of us is that they will rise sufficiently so that when this company has copper for sale it will be able to sell it at a price which will keep the mine working in an economically rewarding way.</P>
    <P>One of the great blessings at the moment is that the Avoca company has no copper to sell, because if they tried to sell at the moment only catastrophic losses would result.  It is accordingly fortunate they have no copper for sale.  It is hoped that by <Col N="82" /> the time they can make copper concentrate available the price will have adjusted itself to a much more satisfactory level.  I am glad the Government have decided to do this.  Certainly it is the only decision that could be taken in the circumstances and I am glad the occasion has arisen to enable Ministers who engage in that advantageous pastime of conscience examination to examine their consciences in this regard.</P>

      <P>I am primarily concerned to ask the Minister a few questions.  For the good of his soul, it will be no harm if I refer him to the Fianna Fáil <i>Pravda</i> for January 19th, 1956.  I think it will do some of his colleagues sitting around spiritual good to hear his words again. They were uttered by the Minister when, as Deputy Lemass, and speaking to the Dalkey Literary, Historical and Debating Society, he said that bringing foreign capital into Irish industry was not the real answer to the country's economic problems if it also meant the uncontrol of the production of that industry.  He then continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The method chosen for the development of the Avoca mineral deposits seems a good example of how to exploit Irish natural resources so as to get the very minimum of national advantage from it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was Deputy Lemass, speaking in contemplation of the General Election which was then coming over the mountain.  Speaking here later, the Minister consecrates himself to the task of inducing the largest possible investment of foreign capital in the industrial development of this country. In the House to-day, he sponsors a guarantee of £1,250,000 for the company, a short two years after he said that such a move represented a good example of how to exploit Irish natural resources so as to get the very minimum of material advantage from them.  I am familiar with the techniques of the Minister and that <i>volte face</i> in his case does not surprise me, but for some of his more unsophisticated junior colleagues&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it might be well for them to study this closely.  I see the Deputy from Cork City.  It is good for his soul to brace himself for the effort of following the Minister fleet of foot, in anticipation of the fact that at any moment he may be expected to start running just as fast backwards.  Let none of them dislocate their knees in the execution of that operation in the future.  This is one of the first exercises in the acrobatics they may be called upon to do from time to time and they would do well to prepare themselves for others, if my long acquaintance with the Minister is any guide to his future performance.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to quote at length. Sometimes jewels are lost to Deputies because they are not in a position to get the appropriate reference, but I would advise Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party to turn to Volume 154 of the Official Debates and to dwell on Deputy Lemass's&mdash;as he then was&mdash; forecast as published at columns 96 and 97.  They may be surprised to find it in a debate on the Finance Bill, but a jewel found in an unexpected place has no less lustre.  These words were uttered by the then Deputy Lemass to persuade the Fianna Fáil Party, and were echoed by <i>Pravda</i> to persuade the Fianna Fáil supporters of the country that the inter-Party Government was dissipating the national resources. There are Deputies here to say there is no use trying to teach them sense. I do not believe that.  I have been at it now for a quarter of a century.  When I began, it was positively dangerous. The utterance of common sense used to provoke tumult and one was liable to be waylaid in the lobbies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Still, the season of Lent is approaching and it will help him to get through.  I want to ask him a few questions which I hope he will be kind enough to answer. When I was Minister for Agriculture, I was authorised by the Government to inaugurate what was then known as the Connemara development scheme. My colleagues kindly authorised me to initiate a number of projects in the strictly limited area of Connemara which really belonged to several different Departments.  At that time, I was greatly beholden&mdash;and I am glad to say so in public&mdash;to Mr. Chester Beatty, the distinguished international authority on mineral deposits.  I asked his assistance to get a survey of the mineral resources of Connemara and he was good enough to call in mining engineers who made a peripatetic survey of Connemara.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know that. <Col N="86" /> That was just one of the fraudulent pieces of nonsense which the Minister for Industry and Commerce started as a stunt.  The danger is that these kinds of stunts bring into serious discredit legitimate mineral prospecting operations such as it is now proposed to pursue.</P>
      <P>I want to ask further, has anything been done or is it proposed to do anything to investigate or promote the exploitation of the deposits in Maam. I was informed there was a high probability that they were exploitable and I would be glad if the Minister would say whether he is having any inquiry made into these deposits.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Sweetman said, this is the kind of investment which, if it produces results, will increase our exports and enlarge our other resources. That is a reason for taking the risk and going ahead at a time when world prices are substantially below the minimum at which these prices happen to be economically worth while.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister another question which I think is of greater urgency.  I remember, in the general context of these inquiries, being told by our own geological survey, and it was confirmed afterwards by an international authority, that prior to the opening of the Rhodesian copper mines the Allihies were recognised as the richest copper deposits in Europe and it was only the catastrophic fall in the world price consequent on the discovery of the Rhodesian copper that made them uneconomic to work as late as the twenties of this century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Allihies to be a richer source of copper than Avoca.  If we are going ahead so energetically in Avoca, is there anybody to give us an indication of what resources we are in a position to deploy for the exploitation of the Allihies.  If the Avoca deposits can be effectively exploited it is probably true to say that the Allihies deposits would be 50 per cent. more exploitable than the best we can hope for from Avoca, so far as copper is concerned.  I understand there is a pyrites aspect of this question and possibly they may be more favourable in Avoca than in the Allihies.  I do not <Col N="87" /> know if copper is the only criterion.  I would be glad to hear from the Tánaiste what plan he has in mind for development in the Allihies.</P>
    <P>The last question is this: I do not know if his attention has been drawn recently to the fact that in certain copper and tin mines in Cornwall some extremely rare mineral has been found in commercial quantities.  I do not know if any survey has ever proceeded in the Allihies area to determine whether that mineral occurs in that area, or whether it has ever been looked for.  Having regard to the geographical situation of Cornwall and the Allihies deposits, it does seem that it is not outside the bounds of possibility that this mineral, which has never been discovered in this hemisphere before, could occur in the Allihies area as it has in Cornwall.  I should be glad if the Minister would examine the position in regard to that development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I am wholly in support of this guarantee both for the reasons advanced by the Minister and those given by Deputies Sweetman and Norton.  In addition, I think it also should have the support of the House because I think it is not incorrect to say that in Avoca lies the future of mining in this country.  If anything happens to jeopardise it or cause it to close down, there would be serious repercussions. The revival which started ten years ago&mdash;incidentally, by private enterprise and not by Government assistance which came later&mdash;might be put in jeopardy for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of expert mining personnel it is something which is extremely difficult to acquire.  Due to the fact that we had no mining for 70 to 80 years, up to quite recently, we were faced with the necessity of acquiring personnel from outside the country.  The building up of an expert mining team takes quite a number of years and if that team is dissipated by the closing down of the mine it might be difficult to get a similar team together again.  I am not quite clear from the Minister's introductory speech <Col N="88" /> as to what company this guarantee is to be given, whether it is the St. Patrick's Copper Mines, which is the Irish subsidiary firm, the Irish Copper Mines which are the Canadian owners, or again, with the Mogul Mining Corporation which is the complete owner.</P>
    <P>I think it is correct to say that this enterprise has been completely financed by outside capital.  That being so it is more than ever necessary that the interests of Irish nationals should be safeguarded in any agreement arrived at.  The mining industry all over the world is going through a very difficult time and if Deputies care to read a report they will see that in countries like the U.S.A., mines are closing down and individual mine owners are looking to the Government for assistance.  The same thing is happening in Germany and South Africa.</P>
    <P>I do not know a great deal about the mining potentialities of this country. I understand that there are two or three very encouraging prospects of which one is the Avoca Copper Mines. I understand there are other smaller mines in the country but, in general, the pattern seems to indicate certain encouraging aspects but that generally the grade of ore is low and requires a considerable amount of capital to bring it to the production stage and a considerable amount of capital to make it economically favourable.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that it would require £1,000,000 more to bring the mine to the producing stage.  That may not be the same thing as bringing it to a profit-earning stage.  If the present level of prices continues for the next 12 months or two years, I think the Minister, or the Government, may take the view that the mine will not be making a profit for some years. In that event, what happens under this State Guarantees Act?  If the company is unable to repay its loans within a few years, due to the fact that it cannot make reasonable profits, does the Minister step in and the Government take over the mine?  There is another factor, too, that it will be the end of this year before this mine is producing.</P>
    <P>The time is opportune to review the taxation concessions introduced by the <Col N="89" /> previous Government, and referred to by Deputy Norton and Deputy Sweetman.  It may be necessary to have more than the eight years' period of concession granted, four years of 100 per cent. free taxation, and four years of 50 per cent. free taxation. That may be necessary, due to the low level in the price of base metals, and it may take longer now for the Irish copper mines to pay their way, even taking advantage of these concessions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter of a smelter, referred to by Deputy Norton, I do not think in present circumstances we could hope to produce enough concentrates to keep an economic smelter going.  I do hope, however, that if prices recover, we will be able to keep several economic smelters going throughout the country.  I did not catch the Minister's remarks with regard to the repayment terms and perhaps the Minister would indicate in his reply the term for which this loan is outstanding.</P>
    <P>There is another point in favour of the export of ore, whether in concentrated form or in crude form, that is, that these concentrates of copper are exported into a hard currency area. That is a factor to be taken into consideration and is one which is of benefit to the State.  Even though the sum indicated under the State Guarantees Act is a substantial one, I think the Minister is right in saying it is a calculated risk which we should take. Taking the long-term view the House should give this proposition its full support and, from my own meagre knowledge of mining, I welcome it, and I wish every success to the mines concerned.</P>

      <P>I do not hope to give Deputy Dillon sense, but I do hope, by process of constant repetition, to give him an understanding of what is taking place in his immediate vicinity. The fact is that consequent on this motion £1,300,000 of Irish capital is going on a loan basis into the Avoca mines.  Deputy Dillon's leader has been talking about the need for a new outlook and Deputy Norton has been talking about the need for new thinking. From where I sit here, the new outlook <Col N="90" /> and the new thinking are precisely the same as the old.  I love a political dogfight.  I would love to deal with this matter we are now discussing on the basis on which Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Norton dealt with it.  That type of debate appeals to my baser instincts.  I feel handicapped by the fact that, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I am the custodian of national interests, and I cannot use these as a club with which to beat the Opposition.  I hate being handicapped in that way as I might injure the club in the process of beating sense and reason into the Deputies.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, preposterous to suggest that this Avoca mine started some day in 1955 or 1956 when some Canadians walked into Deputy Norton's office.</P>

      <P>I will smooth out the process for the Deputy.  A State company, financed by public funds, was charged with the responsibility of investigating the resources of Avoca. That company was set up before the war.  Do the Deputies opposite not remember that?  Unfortunately, when the war came, the development work could not be proceeded with, and that particular company worked the mines in Avoca for the purposes of producing pyrites to keep our superphosphate industry going during the war.</P>
      <P>In 1947 there was a new Act which set up Mianraí Teoranta and provided £85,000 per year for seven years for the express purpose of exploring the mineral deposits in Avoca.  The process started in 1947, but it stopped in 1948. Who stopped it?  The Government of which Deputy Dillon and Deputy Norton were members.  They decided it was not worth while going on with the investigation of Avoca.  They were not warm in their seats before their colleague, Deputy McGilligan, came into the Dáil and said that, as an economy, they were going to shut down the works in Avoca.</P>

      <P>That was a phoney excuse offered later by the Coalition Government for their decision.  Perhaps some of them did not even know the decision had been taken before Deputy McGilligan announced it here. When they did know about it, they did nothing but sit down to reverse it. The mines were shut down for 18 months and this development work ceased, but, when pressure of public opinion had built up, they allowed development work to resume again on a very limited scale.  It was kept going on a very limited scale indeed, until that Government left office in 1951. Then the delayed work went ahead, and went ahead so rapidly, that the money I got the Dáil to vote in 1947 ran out and we had to get supplementary funds voted by Dáil Éireann to get the work completed.</P>
      <P>The work was completed before I left office in 1954.  That company reported to me that mineral deposits were in Avoca of such character and extent that commercial operations could be contemplated.  I had discussions with them as to whether commercial operations should be attempted in the form of leasing the mines to a private company to do it, or whether it should be attempted in the form of an extension of the activities of Mianraí Teoranta.  Deputy Sweetman referred to the debate we had here in 1956.  The chief issue in that debate was whether it was preferable to lease these mines to Canadian interests that had sought them, or to develop them as a State enterprise through Mianraí Teoranta.  I am no socialist and Deputy Norton sometimes poses as one; yet at that time I was considering the possibility of State enterprise and Deputy Norton was the defender of private enterprise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is, to a large extent, an agreed measure, as the previous Government had approved the preparation of legislation on the general lines of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not amend the general law relating to trusts.  Its primary purpose is to redefine the investments in which trustees may invest trust moneys unless expressly forbidden by the instrument (if any) creating the trust. The law concerning the investment of trust funds affords guidance to trustees who are given no specific direction or authority in the instrument of trust. For the protection of the beneficiaries, the choice of trustees, in such cases, is limited by law to certain investments. The primary qualification of these investments is that they should be secure and, subject to this, that they should favour the life tenant in regard to the <Col N="93" /> annual yield so far as that is compatible with the preservation of the capital for the benefit of the remainderman.</P>
    <P>The law to-day in this country in regard to trustee investments is based for the most part on the Trustee Act, 1893.  Subsequent to that Act, numerous amendments of and additions to the basic list of trustee investments were made by British statutes up to the time of the setting up of the Irish State.  Since then the range of trustee investments has been further affected by a number of Irish statutes and by the rules of the High Court and the Supreme Court.  At present a wide range of statutes and the rules of court have to be consulted to ascertain what are trustee investments, and there is doubt about the trustee qualifications of some of the securities mentioned in the earlier British Acts.  Apart from the difficulty of ascertaining what are in law trustee securities, some which are legally available to trustees are not appropriate to the circumstances of this country.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, amends and, at the same time, consolidates the list of authorised trustee securities so as to make it more appropriate to current Irish conditions.  It was circulated in draft form to interested bodies, including the Central Bank, the Irish Banks Standing Committee, the Dublin and Cork Stock Exchanges, the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, the Incorporated Law Society, the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Superior Courts Rule-making Committee.  The draft Bill was amended so as to take into account, where appropriate, various points raised by these bodies.  After the Bill had been introduced, one of these bodies&mdash;the Incorporated Law Society raised points in connection with the investment of court moneys and redeemable bond insurance policies; there matters will be further examined prior to the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill lists the securities in which trustees may, in the absence of any prohibition in the trust instrument, invest trust moneys.  This list replaces that set forth at Section 1 of the Trustee Act, 1893, as amended and extended by subsequent enactments. <Col N="94" /> It is, broadly, the 1893 list, so amended and extended, with the exclusion of foreign securities, other than British Government securities inscribed or registered in the State, and with the addition of certain Irish investments such as deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank and Trustee Savings Banks, certain local authority stocks and debentures or debenture stocks of certain Irish industrial and commercial companies.</P>
    <P>It is considered desirable that, in general, foreign securities should be excluded from the authorised list not alone because they are outside the jurisdiction but also because, so long as capital for domestic needs is scarce and there is an adequate range of Irish investments suitable for trust moneys, it is inappropriate that trustees should have statutory authority for investing trust funds outside the State.  British Government securities registered or inscribed in the State have, however, been retained in the list in deference to the view expressed that their inclusion would provide a more gradual approach to the intention of the Bill and would enable trustees to avail of the convenience of a local register.  The retention of these securities in the list does not involve a departure from the principle that, ultimately, foreign securities should not have trustee status.  No new securities have been added to the Irish Legister since 1922 and the existing securities on the Register will, therefore, eventually disappear through redemption and sales; since 1922 the nominal value of British Government securities on the Register has diminished from £100,000,000 to its present figure of £40,000,000.</P>
    <P>Taking marketable securities alone, that is, ignoring items which are not quoted on a stock exchange, such as bank deposits, saving certificates and real securities, the total nominal value of the quoted securities included in the authorised list is about £314,000,000. An active market for the National Loans included in the list is secured by the arrangement initiated in 1954 by which the Government stock broker stands ready to buy and sell Governmental Stocks at stated prices and up to stated amounts.  These arrangements <Col N="95" /> have also been extended to certain local authority and other securities included in the authorised list.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the revised list will provide trustees with adequate investment outlets.  If, however, this expectation is not realised, the Bill provides machinery in Section 2 whereby the list can be varied, as considered necessary from time to time.  Variations will be effected by Orders which will be made after consultation with outside bodies and which will not come into effect until they have been approved by each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides that moneys under the control of the courts shall be invested only in the securities authorised for the investment of trust funds.  Under the Trustee Act, 1893, a trustee may invest in any securities authorised by the High Court for the investment of cash under its control.  In consequence of this position there are at present two codes of trustee investments; one consisting of the securities specified in the 1893 statute, as extended and amended, and the other consisting of those authorised by rules of court.  The power of the courts to add further to the trustee list was removed by Section 13 of the Approved Investments Act, 1933, but the courts were left authority to invest court moneys as they saw fit to prescribe. By prescribing the same investment list for court moneys as for trustee funds, the Bill completes the process which was begun in 1933.  Given an adequate range of trustee investments specifically authorised by an Act of the Oireachtas, there is no case for a separate court list.</P>
    <P>Section 4 enables trustees to effect redeemable bond insurance policies, against redemption by drawing of bonds at a price less than current or cost price, and also provides for the charging of the premiums against income or capital, or partly against income or partly against capital.  Under the section, trustees would, for example, be empowered to take out insurance against the redemption of land bonds by lot at a price less than market or cost price.  In present <Col N="96" /> circumstances, when the market prices of such bonds are less than par, the question may not be material, but the power to take out such insurance could be of importance to trustees in the future, as it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>Section 5 contains a saver for existing trustee and court investments.  The position of existing trustee investments is already secured by Section 4 of the Trustee Act, 1893, Amendment Act, 1894, which provides that a trustee shall not be liable for a breach of trust by reason only of his continuing to hold an investment which has ceased to be an investment authorised by the instrument of trust or by the general law.  Since, however, the present Bill consolidates and amends the authorised investment list to which the investment of court funds would also be restricted, it is considered desirable that it should contain an express saver for existing trustee and court funds.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the repeal of previous enactments which conferred trustee status on certain investments.</P>
    <P>It will be seen from Section 7 that the Bill will not come into operation until three months after it has been passed.  This waiting period will give adequate notice to trustees with money in course of investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which will be largely acceptable by both sides of the House because of the fact that it is a Bill the birth of which was commenced when the inter-Party Government was in power.  On the general principle that it is desirable that we should have a code of our own on trustee investments, there will be no difference of opinion whatsoever.</P>
      <P>This Bill, therefore, provides that the code will be one which will be set down in our own Statutes and it goes some part of the way towards ensuring that, where no specific discretion has been given in the instrument setting up the trust, the investment of the trust funds will be utilised, while preserving the value of the investment, for the purpose of the development of the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some misconception in certain quarters about the purpose of the Bill.  It would be as well, therefore, <Col N="97" /> as the Minister himself said, I think, that it should be restated that the purpose of this Bill is to deal solely with cases in which the instrument setting up the trust has not itself defined the investment in which the trust or portfolio is to be invested. It is only to cover such absence of specific direction by the set law, whether that set law be deed or will, that this Bill comes to operate.</P>
    <P>I was a little surprised that the Minister did not expand more on the power in the Bill, for the first time, I think, to have debentures here extended as a means of investment of trust funds.  The 1893 Act permitted the investment of trust funds, as well as I can recollect, in both railway and water concerns, but not ordinary commercial concerns.  Therefore, the power of investment that is given in clause (i) of sub-section (1) is a considerable extension over and above the existing law.  It is an extension which, while preserving the capital of any fund, should make it easier for some Irish industrial concerns to obtain loan capital.  We all agree that that is a good and progressive move.</P>
    <P>I always understood that it was not considered appropriate to count the placing of money on deposit as an investment and yet I see in clause (g) of Section 1, I think, for the first time, the specific provision by virtue of which money on deposit is an authorised investment.  It was always the feeling that it was permissible to place money on deposit while trustees were awaiting a suitable investment and I understood, certainly at one stage, that this Bill did confirm that existing practice and that it would not carry on as it does now carry on in Section 1 to authorise trustees permanently to keep trust funds on deposit.  I do not think it is desirable that trustees should be so authoried to deal with the matter on a permanent basis like that.  It is obviously right that trustees should have the widest possible discretion during the period for which they keep money on deposit, pending investment, but as a permanent investment, the placing of money on deposit account with one of these specified banks does not appear to me to be the correct approach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> In relation to clause (k) in Section 1, has the Minister got any information to show how the volume in nominal value of British Government securities inscribed or registered here has been decreasing over the years?  The Minister suggested that those securities, having been all created before 1922, would gradually go by redemption or by sale.  I do not think that is quite an accurate picture because, when securities which were created by the British Government before 1922 come to the maturity date, if they are securities with a specific maturity date, it is always the practice to offer a conversion alternative and the conversion alternative continues to be inscribed and registered here.</P>
    <P>War stock was originally created somewhere between 1916 and 1922.  I do not know the exact date.  It was converted in 1931 and in 1932.  Again, I am not sure of the exact date.  It was converted from 5 per cent. stock on maturity to the present 3½ per cent. stock and, when it was so converted, the converted stock subsequently retained its inscription in the Bank of Ireland.  Therefore, I think it can be taken as a pattern that every time a security comes to maturity, the conversion offer will be availed of to some extent, that the inscription of the conversion offer will remain in the Bank of Ireland, and that, therefore, the stock will remain there.</P>
    <P>From my recollection, the clause permitting continued investment in British Government securities is a new clause in the Bill as I had seen it drafted before submission to various Parties.  It may be that there are overwhelming and cogent reasons for its inclusion.  I should have thought that a better provision would be to provide that where there were already funds in any such investment, further funds in that investment might be bought rather than new funds put into such investments. I think it would often be desirable to even up a trust portfolio in relation to any specific investment in that portfolio.  I can quite understand and accept that, but to open out a new trust investment in the circumstances indicated would not appear to have at all the same merit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> I did not quite understand the Minister's reference to the points that had been raised with him by the Incorporated Law Society.  He said they would be considered, if I heard him aright or that they had been considered&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that they would be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I understood, but a few minutes afterwards the Minister said flat-footedly that there was nothing at all in one of the points that the Incorporated Law Society had mentioned.  Of course he did not say that they had mentioned it, but the society raised the question of discretion of the court to arrange investments in certain cases and the Minister then came along and said flat-footedly a few minutes afterwards that there was no case whatever for the court to have any such discretion.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that if the Minister really meant that, he is not likely to give much consideration to the points put forward by the society but since we are, I think, in a very much nicer and milder atmosphere in discussing this measure than the atmosphere that was operative when the Minister came in at 6 o'clock, I think I might say there was a slip of the Minister's pen or tongue.  I feel sure that he will give full consideration to the points put up.  Obviously it is an entirely different situation for individual trustees, people dealing with trust funds, to have to consider the point from the position when there are funds held in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are often cases where a person has become of unsound mind and who, for example, has a business of some sort and it is necessary that the business should be carried over a dangerous period or necessary that the business should have more liquid funds for its maintenance on a capital basis. Such cases will often arise and, in my view, it would be wrong if the President of the High Court who has jurisdiction over persons of unsound mind, as he has over minors, could not permit investment in the business belonging <Col N="100" /> to the ward of court by reason of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I do not think that was in any way intended when the Bill was being framed and I believe it would be very undesirable that the power of financing a business for a ward of court, particularly for one who is only temporarily a ward of court, should be hampered or prevented as it is prevented in this Bill as now drafted.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a point in relation to Section 4.  He is aware that representations have been made to him that it is undesirable that power should be there to charge the premium payable for redemption of bonds either against capital or income.  The point has been made that the law should determine where the burden should lie rather than that discretion should be left to the trustees.  It is a matter on which there could be two points of view.  Personally, while I concede the view put forward that this is a discretion which should not be imposed on trustees, nevertheless there is equally a view to be expressed that trustees should have some little discretion in making up their own minds in relation to what is fair as between the remainderman and the tenant for life.</P>
    <P>I do not feel at all as strongly on that point as I do in relation to the power that should be vested in the court to invest in the ward's own business.  Lest anybody might think I was suggesting in any way that was a pitfall that the Minister had fallen into and that I was putting up the white sheet and saying that intensely restrictive provision was in the Bill when I was in the Minister's seat and that if there is any blame, it should attach to myself as well as to the Minister for carrying it on, I want to say this is a good measure.  It is a small measure and one that should be accepted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman has dealt very fairly with many of the points that arise on this Bill.  Indeed, he has put certain points rather better than I would have been able and I should like to agree with the substance of most of what he has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking his last point first&mdash;about <Col N="101" /> Section 4&mdash;I would be inclined to agree with the view of the Incorporated Law Society that the duty cast on trustees by Section 4 should not be cast on them, but having myself acted as a trustee and having thereby gained some experience of what is involved, I feel that in a delicate matter of this kind the onus should not be left on the trustees but rather on the court.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there can be two points of view in this matter.  There cannot, however, be two points of view, I think, about the attitude of the Incorporated Law Society to the provisions of Section 3 as they stand at the present time.  It is possible that the Bill was never intended to mean that the court would have removed from it a jurisdiction which I regard as essential&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never understood by one person to mean that. Perhaps I should have understood it better, but I did not understand it would do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it does, I think there should be no doubt one way or the other about it in the Bill, when it is enacted, on this point.</P>
      <P>It did not occur to me on reading the Bill, as Deputy Sweetman pointed out, that the lodgment of money in bank is now to be regarded as a trustee investment. If that is so, it certainly represents a departure from current practice and one which I do not think is desirable.  I should like to support him specifically on that issue.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which has a very laudable purpose, and I believe the Minister will consider very carefully the points raised by the Incorporated Law Society and by Deputy Sweetman. There is nothing contentious here; the purpose of the Bill is to try to improve existing law as far as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to debentures, having consulted all the various people I enumerated when I was introducing the Bill, it was thought desirable to put debentures in amongst the securities that could be availed of by trustees.  As Deputy Flanagan says, it is a Bill that we would all like to agree upon and, if there is any strong <Col N="102" /> objection to any point like that, it can be considered.  I do not say that Deputy Sweetman expressed any strong objection against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  With regard to deposits, as far as I am aware&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;there is no change as far as a bank's deposits are concerned. The provision was already there, but it was always understood to be used as a temporary measure until permanent investments would be made and, very naturally, the person in charge of a trust would prefer to make a more permanent investment because there would be a better income therefrom. I do not think there is any change, but I can have that matter examined to see if there is a change in procedure there.</P>
      <P>I was also asked about the value of the British Government securities on the Irish Register.  The figure I gave &mdash;£40,000,000&mdash;is the present nominal value of these securities.  That is an item that will gradually disappear.  I do not know exactly when that may be, but they will disappear at some time.  Again, I am not sure what the position is as to the point raised by Deputy Sweetman, relating to British stock that is converted.  He said that there would be power to inscribe in the Bank of Ireland the stock issued by way of conversion.  I will look that up.</P>

      <P>With regard to deposits, I should say that there is no change made, except that, under the Rules of Court, deposits could be made only at the Bank of Ireland.  I think it was when the Central Bank Act was passed that provision was made to include other banks and now we are including here Post Office Savings Banks, Trustee Savings Banks and Guinness and Mahon.  It is a gradual evolution, if you like, but there is no change in principle.</P>
      <P>As I said already, the idea behind that is&mdash;the two Deputies who have spoken have much more experience of this than I have&mdash;that sometimes the transactions connected with these trusts take some time and the trustees may find it necessary to put the money on deposit while clearing things up.</P>
      <P>The other point mentioned by Deputy Sweetman related to matters raised by the Incorporated Law Society.  I may have given the wrong impression, but I certainly did not intend to close the door against any suggestion they made.  I had an opportunity of looking at the suggestions, but I did not examine them in detail. I mean to examine them in detail within the next day or two and should be in a position then to make up my mind what I will recommend to the Dáil by way of amendment, if I consider an amendment is justified.  The Deputy is aware of the recommendations made by the Incorporated Law Society and if he finds that I do not put down an amendment to cover any point he is interested in, he will be quite free to put down an amendment himself, and we can let the Dáil debate the point and see what is the best arrangement to make.  I think I should be in a position to circulate my amendments in a few days' time, so the Deputy will have time then to make up his mind.</P>

      <P>The trouble arose in relation to the question of removal on grounds of incapacity.  That has a narrow legal meaning and would not cover at all the question of complete unsuitability or inability to do his work, inefficiency, and so on.  So, trying to get out of that difficulty, I came <Col N="105" /> to the conclusion that a remark that was made many years ago in this House would supply, more or less, the solution.  At one time, there was a question of removing&mdash;I do not know was it a judge, judges or the Comptroller and Auditor-General&mdash;and the case was made by somebody in Opposition at the time that a two-thirds majority is not an effective way of dealing with a matter of that sort and that it would be very much better if two independent bodies, such as the Seanad and Dáil, had separately to come to judgment upon the matter and that the concurrence of two such independent views would be more satisfactory than any artificial majority that you might suggest for, say, the Dáil.</P>
      <P>You have, on the one hand, to make provision for the removal of an inefficient or otherwise unsuitable person and, on the other hand, you want to give the assurance of reasonable security in order to get a good man. The amendment seeks to meet these two viewpoints.  If, on the one hand, you have the council saying: &ldquo;This is a man who has proved to be unsuitable; he is really not doing the work it was thought he would do&rdquo;, they would have to take the initiative, to take action.  Then, the Government would be a sort of second line.  They would examine the matter.  They would have to be satisfied that the view taken by the council was, in fact, justified.</P>
      <P>Therefore, on the one hand, it gives the council the opportunity of taking action while, on the other hand, it provides a certain sort of reserve which would be a sort of assurance that, if these two independent bodies were to come to a common opinion about the suitability, efficiency, or otherwise of a particular person, it was fairly to be assumed that there was a just case for action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the first director, formerly, he could be removed by the Government.  The Government had appointed and could remove him.  Now power is given to the council to take the initiative in the case even of the first director, but the Government have to be an assenting party.  Previously, for the second or subsequent directors, it was the council alone that could <Col N="106" /> remove the director on grounds such as incapacity.  Now, you are substituting a provision that the council would take the initiative again, but with the Government assenting.  I think, on the whole, it would be a good arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach is slightly mistaken in respect of the second and subsequent directors.  The council was obliged to consult the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>But they need not act on his advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which, in substance, is the same as consulting the Government. In regard to the subsequent directors, the council, after consultation with the Minister, may at any time remove a director, other than the first director, from office, for misconduct or incapacity.  But I know that, under the provenance of this section&mdash; and it was the fruit of protracted reflection and consideration&mdash;we deliberately proposed that only the Government could remove the first director and that they would only remove him for stated misconduct or incapacity. We put that in for this reason.  We believed, as I think the Taoiseach now believes, that the success or failure of the whole project would largely depend on the quality of the first director and that, therefore, when you went to look for a director of sufficient stature to command confidence at the launching of this institute, you would almost certainly be asking a man of considerable position to give up his existing tenure of office in some responsible post to accept the position of first director here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We thought it would be very unlikely that you would get anybody who had attained to eminence in agricultural research or the administration of research institutes to give up the security of his existing post to accept a new post, unless you gave him a very high degree of security.  Therefore, it was felt that, after you made the initial choice, short of misconduct or incapacity, you had to bear with him. Otherwise, you robbed him of a very necessary degree of independence, without which he could not do full <Col N="107" /> justice to the work that would devolve upon him as first director of the institute.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is ever possible, when you are drafting a scheme of this kind, to make it perfect.  You have to choose, as the late Tom Kettle so rightly stated, in public life, the least &mdash;very often&mdash;of two imperfections.  It was very difficult to devise a means of constructing terms of office which would be attractive to the kind of person we wanted to get.  But, if we delete sub-section (9) of Section 7, as is proposed in this amendment, and substitute simply</P>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) The council may, with the consent of the Government, at any time remove the director from office&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>it means we have to ask someone to give up his present occupation and accept the position of director of the Agricultural Institute, in the knowledge that, at any time, the council may go to the Government and say: &ldquo;We want to get rid of this fellow,&rdquo; and, if the Government agree, out he goes.</P>
    <P>Let us envisage what a man looking at this from abroad will say to himself. If he is an American, an Englishman, a Scotsman or a Welshman&mdash;if we do invite somebody from abroad to come in &mdash;he will say to himself: &ldquo;I go in there and, inevitably, there will be certain persons who will look upon me as an interloper.  I get at odds with the council and they propose to get rid of me.  They go to the Government of the day and ask them to consent to dismiss me.  Is it conceivable in any modern society that the Government could take up the position of saying to a body representative of every agricultural interest in the country: &lsquo;We will not get rid of him; we will keep him&rsquo;?  Is it believable that any popularly-elected Government will set at defiance every agricultural interest in the country in order to keep me in my job?  You may say it is possible that in an ideal world it might happen. However, the probabilities against its happening are so high that common prudence suggests to me that <Col N="108" /> it would be much better to stay where I am and not take the risk of very temporary enployment in this place.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The tragedy in this section is that we are going too far.  We may make the securing of a suitable director impossible. What it may very possibly mean is that we will get a &ldquo;dud&rdquo;. Plenty of &ldquo;duds&rdquo; will be prepared to accept this or any other tenure to get into this job.  There will be a queue. If we find ourselves stumbling into the dilemma that we cannot get a good director, I cannot doubt that we will end up by accepting a &ldquo;dud&rdquo;.  This institute idea is something to which all of us here attach great importance. I would advise the Taoiseach to stand on the original section.  I do not know where this proposal came from for the alternative now tendered to us.  I do not believe it came from him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, now I know where it came from&mdash;from the bench behind him.  Was it?  I think the Taoiseach's judgment in this matter was much better than the well-intentioned intervention of a man who is given too much to speculative contemplation in matters of this kind.  We are concerned to get the best man for the job and I think he is concerned to defend lofty principles about sovereign authority and Mr. Austen's theory of ultimate authority reposing in somebody. These are very salutary philosophical exercises, but they very often do not work.  These may be admirable expositions of the science of logic, but in man's affairs logic is very often not the wisest guiding rule to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the original proposal was best and I am sorry the Taoiseach did not stand over it.  I think he would be quite well advised to go back to the original proposal, bearing in mind&mdash;if I can concentrate the problem in a nutshell&mdash;that our primary object here was to enable us to get the best man and to avoid the danger of having a &ldquo;dud&rdquo; thrust upon us.  This is the Magna Carta of the &ldquo;duds&rdquo;, this <Col N="109" /> amendment, and as sure as there is an eye in a goat, if this amendment is carried and incorporated in the Bill, the best man will not take the job and the &ldquo;duds&rdquo; will be there in regiments and platoons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit there is a great deal in what the Deputy has said about the danger of going too far in the other direction; but when you are appointing a man to a position for the first time, you must give the matter special consideration.  You may get a person&mdash;perhaps from abroad&mdash;who in the conditions in which he has been judged up to the present, or would be judged by us, may have proved himself excellent.  In the conditions in which he now finds himself, he might not; and you might be for a considerable period&mdash;I do not know how long &mdash;saddled with somebody who was going to make the whole idea and the whole work of the institute more or less a nullity.</P>
      <P>Again, I think the Deputy exaggerated in his argument in saying that the representatives on the council should represent the whole agricultural community, and so on.  They would be chosen to deal with research.  If they were going to do something which was found to be wrong in this respect, unfair and unjust and not in the best interests of the institute, I do not think the Government would agree with them, in the first place; and, secondly, I do not think they would carry the agricultural community with them, or that the Government would be afraid that they would.</P>
      <P>I must say I gave as much consideration as I thought possible and reasonable to both sides of this question and came down on the side of the amendment as it is.  On the whole, I believe it is the best way to deal with the situation.  If by any accident we should have a &ldquo;dud&rdquo; at the start, the &ldquo;dud&rdquo; could be fired by this system.  He could not be fired by the other system.  We can never be certain when we put a person into a post of this importance and responsibility, that he will prove equal to it, when he is given the actual responsibility for putting the work through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> I agree that, in order to get a good man, there will have to be reasonable security.  I think that is provided.  In the first place, the man will know that there will be no political incentives of any kind to interfere with a man who is doing his work well.  If he does his work well, he has the security which good work will give him.  I do not think the Government would agree to removal, if any sort of petty objections were made to the work of the director, or that they would necessarily assent to whatever propositions were put up by the council.  In any case, in the first instance, the director would have been nominated by the Government and they would naturally have tried to get a good man.  They would naturally have satisfied themselves at the start that he was a good man and they would be slow to think otherwise, until there was positive proof.  That is the position in regard to the first director.</P>
    <P>The council will have the choice of the next man and of subsequent directors. In that case, also, there would be the same natural tendency to be slow to act without positive proof.  In fact, I think the danger we have to apprehend really is that people may be continued after the period in which they are giving fully satisfactory service.  Therefore, although I see fully and give full weight to these points, in coming to a final decision on the arguments put forward, I must stand by the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach to apply this test: Suppose he were the president of one of the constituent colleges, either of the National University or of a university in Great Britain and he were offered the position of director of the institute here to-morrow, on the terms proposed in the amendment, would he himself risk throwing up the security of the position in which he was, to take what is offered in the amendment?  On the other hand, look at the original proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were Minister for Agriculture and were approaching the Taoiseach as the head of a learned body and said to him: &ldquo;I know I am asking you to give up the position you have here and asking you to give up the security <Col N="111" /> you enjoy in your present position, but I am offering you a position of relative independence, where you know that you cannot be removed except by the Government, and that for stated misconduct or incapacity; a position of independence and wide authority; and, in fact, the success or failure of the project is being substantially committed into your hands&rdquo;, which terms would he more readily accept?</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree with me that the terms originally in the Bill were terms with which one might reasonably go to a distinguished man in a position of security in any academic field; whereas in offering him the terms we are now offering, could he have a higher degree of insecurity? He can be dismissed any day, without any reason stated at all, if the council and the Government can agree that he should be dismissed, and there is no provision that he should get any compensation. Honestly, if those two propositions were made to the Taoiseach, am I not right in saying that, in all common prudence and duty to his own family, he would be quite entitled to accept the one and almost bound to reject the other, in that he was exchanging a very substantial degree of security for nothing&mdash;except the possibility that in a very difficult position he might be dismissed any day without compensation, on the council and the Government agreeing?  Would the Taoiseach accept it himself?  I would not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in continuing this argument, I am afraid, a Cheann Comhairle.  I would say that, if I were head of one of the colleges, I would not be tempted to leave it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;except on one consideration, that is, that there was some particular work I badly wanted to do.  If there was a particular work I wanted to do and could do, I would take the risks necessary to prove that I was not a &ldquo;dud&rdquo;.  The other side of this case is that you might be saddled with a &ldquo;dud&rdquo;; you might have a situation in which you had an unsatisfactory <Col N="112" /> person who was the key to the whole situation and who could not be got rid of.  I think the Government is the responsible body and it does not matter which side is in Government.  The Government must be regarded as a very responsible body which is not likely to dismiss a person from a post if the person does his work in the way it should be done.  Neither is it likely to assent to the dismissal of a person until the case against the person is proved to the hilt.  This council can also be taken as a responsible body which would not try to get rid of a person if that person were doing his work properly.</P>

I am convinced, and I suspect the Taoiseach is convinced also but he does not want to go back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He has withdrawn a very valuable element of security through this amendment.  Had it not occurred to him to provide, at least in respect of the first director, that if he is liable to summary dismissal without cause stated he would be entitled to so many years' remuneration on being dismissed? It would be a monstrous thing if we took a man who was in enjoyment of a salary of £2,000 a year in the post of director of some institute, or some person who was the occupant of some responsible post, persuaded him to give up what he had and whatever pension rights attached to that position and then, for reasons known only to ourselves, summarily dismissed him without giving him any reasons.  We should at least be able to say: &ldquo;You will get five or ten years' salary in the event of your appointment with this institute being terminated for reasons other than misconduct or incapacity.&rdquo; Should there not be some substitute element of security to offset this new <Col N="113" /> conception of summary dismissal?  If the Minister for Agriculture is to go out looking for a good man he must have some consideration to offer.  The amendment offers none at all.</P>
      <P>Suppose the Taoiseach says: &ldquo;Very well.  We shall make a proviso undertaking to see that there is a provision made that a certain number of years' salary will be given in lieu of security should the director be dispensed with for stated misconduct,&rdquo; it would meet my point, but I think you must have some substitute for the security envisaged in the original section.  If you adopt this amendment and if the Minister for Agriculture is to have any chance at all of getting a man of the stature I should like to see, you must have some substitute for the lack of security brought about by this amendment.</P>

There is an adjective &ldquo;talúnta&rdquo; and &ldquo;talúntas&rdquo; is an abstract noun formed from that adjective.  It is an easy word to pronounce according to the way it is spelled.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect it came out of the fertile mind of the Taoiseach himself. I know he likes to look upon himself as the father of his people and, in a sense, from time to time feel that he begot us all.  I speak, of course, in a purely mystical or spiritual sense, but I must call a halt if he is now arrogating to himself the function of rewriting the whole Irish language.  That is going further than his most ardent admirers would be prepared to concede, that if he gets a notion that he does not like the look of an Irish word, that the sound is not euphonious in his ear or that he feels some future generation may find it difficult to pronounce a word, there is conferred upon him a sovereign right to abstract out of the air a completely new word and say: &ldquo;If you cannot sound the other one, sound that and it will do as well.&rdquo; That is going too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to remember that, like the rest of men, he is human, and I have yet to find anyone who claims for him the right to rewrite the Irish language.  I do not think it is a good thing to do because, if the Taoiseach starts doing it, some genius in the Translation Branch or somewhere else will start doing it too.  We have a word which describes <Col N="116" /> adequately and effectively what we seek to say here.  It is in common use and we should not subsitute a new one. It is not enough to say the existing word &ldquo;talmhaíochta&rdquo; is too difficult for foreigners to pronounce, that they would find &ldquo;talúntas&rdquo; quite simple. They would find &ldquo;bó&rdquo; or &ldquo;hoe&rdquo; or &ldquo;high&rdquo; easier to pronounce but they would not be the appropriate words in the Irish language.  Some people will say I am unduly pedantic in complaining of this.  I do not think I am.  It is not a good tendency and it is not a sufficient justification to this House for doing it simply to say that foreigners are not able to pronounce the word &ldquo;talmhaíochta&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is rather astonishing that we are not to have in the Bill a title in English for the Agricultural Institute.  It should be remembered that in the Constitution we have the name &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; for Ireland when we speak in English and &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; when we speak in Irish.  It is a cause of common affront to us if certain people elect to refer to the Republic as &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; when they are speaking in English, and we are concerned to point out to them that the Constitution provides that in Irish the name of the State is &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; but that in English the name of the State is Ireland.  I remember the circumstances in which the Taoiseach himself accepted that principle on an amendment which was argued in this House.  Those who are concerned with the history of it will find that it is one of the few amendments to the Constitution which he accepted.  Why has he changed his mind?  If there is to be a name for the nation in English and a corresponding name in Irish, why is there not to be a name in English for the institute and a corresponding name in Irish.  What is the logic of that?  What was in the Taoiseach's mind when he produced this extraordinary proposal in the Seanad?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard that type of argument so often that one gets tired refuting it.  The fact is that there is an adjective in the language, &ldquo;talúnta&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;associated with the soil&rdquo;.  You could not get a more appropriate word to describe the institute and it has the added advantage <Col N="117" /> that it is easily pronounced.  On the question as to why there is not an English title, my fear was that the English title would be used very much more than the Irish title and at least in official documents we want the Irish word to be used.  That is why it is put in there as the short title of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I did not, of course, invent the word. I asked if we could get a word that could be easily pronounced in accordance with the spelling.  This was the word that was suggested and I accepted it.  It is common in most languages to form abstract nouns from adjectives and that is what was done in this case.  It seems to me there is a lot of nonsense talked about it.</P>

      <P>This amendment and No. 9 were brought in at the request of Deputy Sweetman.  I asked the Draftsman to have it examined from the point of view of endeavouring to meet the point raised.  The amendment as drafted is one which meets the point and is also acceptable to the officers of my Department. The suggestion made in the Dáil on Report Stage was that a lessor who intends to rebuild or develop property should be entitled to apply to the court for a decision as to whether or not he will be given possession at the expiration of the lease or leases concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 24 of the Bill already allows the lessor to apply to the court to settle any question arising &ldquo;in regard to the right of any person to a reversionary lease&rdquo; but I am advised that this provision alone might not suffice to enable the lessor to get the decision he required because the references in Sections 14 and 15 of the Bill to &ldquo;applicant&rdquo; appear to suggest that such a decision could only be given on application by the lessee. <Col N="122" /> The references to &ldquo;applicant&rdquo; are accordingly being deleted in both Section 14 and Section 15 but it has been more convenient for the Draftsman to insert a new section in lieu of Section 15 than to have a multitude of amendments to it.</P>
    <P>As the lessee may not apply until the lease has expired it is desirable as suggested that the lessor should be able to get a decision some years before he becomes entitled to possession in order that he may be in a position to proceed with the work when the lease expires.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for meeting this point on the case I raised on the last stage here.  I think it is right that the point that was then raised should be met.  For the life of me, however, I cannot understand how the amendment as drafted here, notwithstanding the explanation which the Minister has read, does in fact carry out what is now intended. I tried very hard to understand Section 14, as amended, and the new Section 15.  I tried to understand them as meaning what the Minister has now stated.  I am afraid my mental capabilities were not able to reach that understanding.  I take it, however, that the Parliamentary Draftsman has indicated to the Minister that he is quite certain that this amendment as drafted does carry out what was intended and what the Minister has just indicated is intended.  I can only accept the Draftsman's view, but it is still a mystery to me.</P>

      <P>15&mdash;(1)  Where the court is satisfied that a lessee would, but for the provisions of Section 14 of this Act, be entitled to a reversionary lease, compensation in lieu of such reversionary lease shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this section.</P>
      <P>(2) (a)  The compensation shall be payable by the successful objector or if there is more than one successful objector by them in such proportion as the court may determine.</P>
      <P>(b)  The compensation shall be paid to the lessee unless, apart from the provisions of Section 14 of this Act, his title to a reversionary lease was subject to obtaining the consents required by Section 10 or Section 11 of this Act, in which case it shall be paid to the lessee and the proprietary lessee or lessees whose consent was so required in such proportion as the court may determine.</P>
      <P>(3)  The measure of compensation under this section shall be the loss which will, in the opinion of the court, be suffered by the lessee and by such proprietary lessee or lessees, if any, as a direct consequence of the lessee's having been declared not to be entitled to a reversionary lease.</P>
      <P>(4)  The compensation payable to a person, being the lessee or a proprietary lessee, under this section shall become due and payable on the occurrence of whichever of the following events is the later, that is to say, the expiration of one month after the amount of the compensation is fixed or the date on which that person's lease terminates either by effluxion of time or by agreement between the parties to it.</P>

      <Col N="124" /> (5)  Where compensation is payable to a person, being the lessee or a proprietary lessee, under this section and the interest of that person in the land comprised in his lease is subject to a mortgage or charge for securing money, the mortgage or charge shall attach to the compensation and any person who is liable to pay compensation and who has notice of the mortgage or charge shall pay the compensation in accordance with the joint direction of such lessee or proprietary lessee and the mortgagee or chargeant or, in default of such direction, into court.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where compensation awarded by the court under this section is not paid within the time specified in sub-section (4) of this section or within such extended time as the court may allow, the following provisions shall have effect:</P>
    <P>(a) any building lessee, subject to obtaining the consents required by Section 10 of this Act and notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section (1) of that section, and any proprietary lessee, subject to obtaining the consents required by Section 11 of this Act and notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section (1) of that section, shall be entitled to obtain from his immediate lessor a reversionary lease of all the land demised by his lease;</P>
    <P>(b) the provisions of Section 14 of this Act shall not apply;</P>
    <P>(c) the granting of the lease shall operate as a discharge of the said award of compensation; and</P>
    <P>(d) the court may make an order for the payment by the successful objector of such damages as the court considers proper for the loss which the building lessee or proprietary lessee has suffered as a direct consequence of the declaration of disentitlement to a reversionary lease.</P>

    <P>The only people specifically authorised to prosecute an offence were previously limited.  This amendment specifically authorises an employee or trade union to prosecute an offence committed by an owner or occupier.  I think it is useful to have it here.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 24.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (d), line 35, &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; inserted before &ldquo;require&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am sure there are a number of Deputies opposite who will have learned from experience that one of the biggest nuisances a Minister can encounter when he is trying to get a Bill through the Oireachtas is the &ldquo;sea lawyer&rdquo;, who believes he can improve on the work of the Parliamentary Draftsman.  This amendment was a product of a belief that the Parliamentary Draftsman had slipped up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is quite trivial.  It was put forward in the Seanad in the belief that the Parliamentary Draftsman made a <i>bona fide</i> mistake.  The section of the Bill dealing with powers of inspection says that the inspector may go into premises at a reasonable time, may examine books and get any information from these books that he may reasonably require for the purposes of his investigations, or he can seek other information he reasonably requires.  There is one section where that word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; does not <Col N="132" /> appear.  It was assumed that that was an oversight and the amendment was moved to put that word in.  When I brought this to the attention of the Parliamentary Draftsman he said it was not an oversight, that it should be presumed to be reasonable for the inspector to ask the question, &ldquo;who is carrying on the business?&rdquo;, and that in all similar sections in other measures that was presumed to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>When the amendment was put in the Seanad I must admit I conveyed to the Opposition that I thought the amendment of so little importance that I was prepared to accept it if they completed the Bill so that I could get it back to the Dáil to be dealt with before the Recess.  But when they came along with a more foolish amendment, that did not prove possible.  If we are now dealing with these amendments, we may as well stand for purity of drafting and accept the advice of the Parliamentary Draftsman that the word is not required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that one of the big difficulties a Minister may have in piloting a Bill through the Oireachtas is the fact that he may come face to face with a &ldquo;sea-lawyer.&rdquo;  The Minister's statement to us here now that he has been advised that the requirement of the authorised officer should be presumed to be reasonable would seem to indicate that whether the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is inserted or not makes no difference.  If that be correct&mdash;and we must accept the Minister's statement as indicating that is the advice he has got&mdash;what is the reason why this House should be asked to set aside a considered decision of Seanad Éireann, a decision which was come to, not with haste but after due consideration in the other House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I remind the House, when the Minister refers to sea-lawyers, that the sea-lawyer in this particular case was the Minister's own Parliamentary Secretary, who agreed with this amendment in the Seanad and who had it inserted in the Bill with the unanimous support of the Upper House.  The position now is this.  The amendment was passed by the Seanad.  Later on, when the Minister came into the <Col N="133" /> House, apparently rather angry, he asked the House to reconsider their decision and they decided not to do so. They decided not to do so because they were told by the Minister, as we have been told here, that, whether the word is in or not, it makes no difference. Even if it makes no difference as far as legislation is concerned, we should ensure that any authorised officer operating the wide powers set out in Section 24 should, under our legislation, be told that he must act in a reasonable manner and that the information he requires must be reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word on this.  When we pass an Act of Parliament here, we create an offence against the law for anybody who does not comply with the requirements of our Act of Parliament.  That is a work about which we should go circumspectly. There still survives in this country a section of people who do not willingly place themselves in conflict with the law because it is the law.</P>
      <P>What does this Bill say?  In sub-section (d) where it is proposed to insert this amendment, it says that an authorised officer of the Minister for Industry and Commerce may require the person referred to in the sub-section to give him any information the officer may require in regard to persons employed in connection with the business.  It does not say that he is strictly confined to inquiring who runs the business.  He has full power under this sub-section to require persons in authority to give him any information he chooses to require about any person employed in connection with the business.  And the person questioned, if he chooses to refuse to answer any such question and is summoned for his failure to do so and charged with a breach of the law, is not entitled to go into court and say: &ldquo;I did not think the question was reasonable; I did not think it had any bearing on the business.  I thought it was pure snooping on the part of an excessively zealous minor bureaucrat.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the bureaucrat is entitled to say: &ldquo;I do not care what the defendant thought.  I was given explicit <Col N="134" /> power under this sub-section to ask any questions I want.&rdquo;  He is entitled to say: &ldquo;There are several other places in the Bill where my conduct was restricted by the terms of the Bill to reasonable conduct.  Here is a sub-section which deliberately excludes the word &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; and it is clearly designed to give me unlimited power to ask the proprietor any question about any person employed in connection with the business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that, under that section, the inspector might come into court and say: &ldquo;I did not believe this fellow and I determined to test his veracity by asking him a question&mdash;the answer to which I knew&mdash;about one of his employees, to invoke the power I have under this section and challenge him to answer it, and he did not tell me.  I knew why he would not answer me&mdash; because he did not want to admit what I knew.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that the power we want to give to a minor bureaucrat?  I can conceive circumstances in which it is necessary to confer very wide powers on highly responsible public servants if they are dealing with some particularly grave evil that cannot be grappled with by the ordinary processes of the law.  But we have always agreed in this House that where we have conferred very wide powers of that kind, we have always restricted them to a very limited class of very high officers in the police and high officers in the public service, such as assistant secretaries and secretaries of Departments.</P>
    <P>We have always tried to hedge around with adequate safeguards the exercise of power by minor bureaucrats, who, after all, would not be minor bureaucrats if they were people who used discretion and people in whom we had 100 per cent confidence. They would be senior bureaucrats.  I can tell the Minister that he alternates to-day between his role of gamin and his role of archangel.  At the moment, he appears to have cast himself for the role of mischief.  May I suggest that he should now reassume the wings and the haloes?  The Minister himself says that the insertion of the word makes no difference at all, that it does not make the section better or worse.  We, <Col N="135" /> the Opposition, think it will improve the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I not entitled to answer the Minister when he asks why we did not think about the matter in time?  That is one of the reasons we have a Seanad.  After a Bill has been exhaustively debated in this House, it goes to the Seanad, where it is debated and reviewed, and, if there are any imperfections left in it, they correct them.  Is that not the purpose of the Seanad?  If the Seanad does not serve that purpose, what is it there for?  The Seanad has done its work and directed our attention to the matter.  We had another case to-day when I was obliged to confess that I did not know where Section 21 of the Agricultural Institute Bill came in.  We passed it in this House.  The Taoiseach promoted it in this House.  The Seanad removed from the Bill a section which, had it stayed in, would have made the Bill unconstitutional.  When the Seanad sent it back to have the section deleted, we deleted it and expressed appreciation of the action of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we ask is to insert the word which the Minister says is in no way injurious to the purpose we have in mind.  Is the truth not this?  The Minister sent his Parliamentary Secretary into the Seanad with that Bill and the Parliamentary Secretary was trying to get the Bill through.  The Minister lost his temper and said to his Parliamentary Secretary that he was allowing the thing to go too slowly&mdash; had he forgotten the Bill had to be passed by the first of January?&mdash;and that he would go in and fix the <Col N="136" /> Seanad?  He went in and ate the face off the Seanad.  Is that not so?  The Minister lost his temper in the Seanad.</P>

The Minister should shoulder his responsibilities and shock the neighbours by getting up and saying: &ldquo;You can have your blooming amendment, if you want to.

      <P>I do not reflect on inspectors, but they are not chaps whom you would expect to have the same prudence and discretion as you would expect to find in a senior public servant.  How can the Minister stand on the proposition that the insertion of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; does not make any difference; that it does not in any way impede him, and then say he is damned if he will accept it?  That is not reasonable.  I urge upon him strongly to stagger the House by accepting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all certain that my colleague, Deputy Dillon, has accurately stated the Minister's intention.  Deputy Dillon said that he has an idea the Minister does not care whether this word is put in or left out.  I got the most definite impression that the Minister wants it out and deliberately wants it out, and that his attitude is not that it makes no difference whether it is in or out, but that he most deliberately wanted, on reflection after the Seanad had unanimously agreed to the insertion of this word, it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does the Minister want?  What is his purpose?  Perhaps he is a sea lawyer, but I have a very definite impression that the word was most deliberately left out, and that the insertion of this word by the so-called sea lawyers in the Seanad was very essential and was not in any way a <Col N="138" /> reflection on the Parliamentary Draftsman who carried out the Minister's instructions.  He was told that they wanted this without the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in it so that nobody could say that a question put by an inspector was unreasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why it is put in the other paragraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will deal with why in certain of these paragraphs the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; occurs and in others it does not.  Anybody construing that would point out that where you find the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in certain sub-sections and not in others, that is done deliberately, and that, therefore, when the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is left out, it is deliberately left out for a certain purpose.  I challenge the Minister to controvert that proposition.  I approach the construction of this section with a conviction that the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; was intended to be deliberately left out in order that nobody might say as a defence to a prosecution under this Bill, if there be one, that the question as it was put was not a reasonable one.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that he wants it left out because it must be presumed that the officer is asking reasonable questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on that section.  It must be deemed to be reasonable.  Therefore, I am right in thinking that my colleague has not interpreted the Minister's mind correctly. I noticed, and I am entitled to comment upon it, that when Deputy Dillon pressed that view of the section the Minister did not contradict him.  It is perfectly clear then that <Col N="139" /> the Minister wanted to have this word left out in order that nobody could say as a defence to a prosecution that the question was not reasonable and should not have been asked.  If that defence was put up whoever was prosecuting in the court could say: &ldquo;Look at the section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The sub-section entitles the inspector to ask for any information he may require and he may do that, as the Minister has already pointed out in interruption, &ldquo;the authorised officer may, for the purpose of obtaining any information which the Minister may require...&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is left out and I would draw the attention of the Dáil to that, so that the Minister may get any information, whether reasonable or unreasonable, unless it is within the two sub-sections. I have no doubt as to why the word is left out, and that is why the Minister decided to overbear the amendment of the Seanad, that the deliberate intention is that there should be no defence to the prosecution under this section on the ground that the information was not reasonably required.</P>
      <P>If the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; were put in it would not make any difference to the Minister unless he wants to have the interpretation put upon it that I have put upon it.  It seems to me quite clear that the Minister was endeavouring to mislead the House when he let Deputy Dillon's interpretation pass. He requires this specifically; he said it must be presumed it is reasonable to ask these questions and that therefore the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; must not be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I point out that since this House was set up Bills have been passed by the hundred containing sections similar to this, and that consequently this type of section has come to take a more or less standard form. No doubt it has been modified from time to time and to meet the needs of particular legislation.  The most recent piece of legislation containing this type of section was the Seeds and Fertilisers Bill, 1957, introduced by Deputy Dillon in 1956.  I would hate to suggest that Deputy Dillon was responsible <Col N="140" /> for bringing a bad Bill to the Dáil and getting it passed, or that Deputy Costello, as Taoiseach, allowed it to be approved by the Cabinet without having read it.  This section was taken from the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, and a multitude of other Acts of a similar kind have precisely similar sections.  I agree I cannot see that it makes any difference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When the amendment was put down in the Seanad I said to the Parliamentary Secretary: &ldquo;That will hold up the Bill if we resist it.  Accept it on condition that they agree to let the Bill out of the Seanad in time so that the amendment can come back to the Dáil and be approved by the Dáil before the Christmas recess.&rdquo; They did not do that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee disagree with the Seanad in amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2), a new sub-section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  No one shall be required by virtue of paragraph (e) of sub-section (1) of this section to answer <Col N="142" /> any question or to give any evidence tending to criminate himself or in respect of either of which he would be entitled to claim privilege (as being a matter of confidence between him and his legal adviser) in the High Court.</P>
    <P>This is a particularly stupid amendment which I cannot under any circumstances accept.  Apart from the fact that it is badly drafted, put in the wrong place, and entirely unnecessary, if it was of any effect at all, it would be completely detrimental to the enforcement of Price Orders under this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are two parts in this amendment. About the privilege of communication between a person and his legal adviser, as I explained to the Seanad on the highest legal authority, that privilege attaching to confidential documents passing between a lawyer and his client is so deeply entrenched in law that it could not possibly be removed by implication and there is consequently no necessity at all for a safeguard of that sort in this Bill.  But that is not what was being aimed at here: the aim was somewhat different. There is this suggestion that a person should not be asked to answer a question or give evidence tending to criminate himself.  Personally, I believe that the Senator who moved that amendment saw a somewhat similar provision in the Office Premises Bill which had gone through the House shortly before and thought that it should be here without recognising that the functions and powers of an inspector under that Bill, as under the Factories Bill, are completely different to the functions and powers of the inspector here.</P>
    <P>In this case an inspector does nothing except report to the Minister on the results of his inquiries or investigation. Anything that may happen after that is on the Minister's decision. Nevertheless an attempt was made to justify the amendment on a different ground.  Let me make clear what is involved.  Under the Prices Bill, 1957, provision was made that an inspector could ask a trader who was offering for sale goods for which a Price Order had <Col N="143" /> been made, what price he was charging for the goods.  That is what it is intended to prevent here.  If I understand the arguments of the Seanad at all, it is to prevent an inspector, in a case where a Minister has made an Order fixing the maximum price of some goods, having the right to ask the trader offering those goods for sale what price he is charging for them.  If you make a provision like that in the Bill, you make the whole thing nugatory.</P>
    <P>I am not, as you know, strong on the efficacy of price control but I am not going to make myself responsible for a Bill which will make it farcical.  This Bill makes it possible to introduce price control in time of scarcity, when there is a danger of profiteering and, if these provisions are to be enforced, an inspector must have the right to go in and ask a trader what price he is charging.  The purpose of this amendment would be to deprive him of that power, at least to give the trader an opportunity of pleading a sort of fifth amendment and to say, &ldquo;I will not answer that question because it would incriminate me&rdquo;.  It would be a stupid provision to have in the Bill.  This amendment would not achieve its object, if that is what is intended, because the amendment is put into the wrong paragraph, and certainly it would be quite contrary to all established precedents in that regard.</P>
    <P>In other legislation passed by this House giving power to a Minister to fix prices, we also provided for the possibility of an inspector carrying out an investigation as to the prices actually charged.  That applies only where a maximum price order has been made. There can be other inquiries carried out by an inspector under this Bill and I contemplate that, normally, his powers would be used when a committee has been set up and is seeking information upon which to base a recommendation to the Minister.  In that case the inspector will try to get the information that the committee is seeking.  But, in the particular case contemplated in this amendment, a maximum price order will have been made and it will be the duty of the <Col N="144" /> Minister to enforce the order and the duty of the inspector to get him the information to allow him to take proceedings where justified.  I could not undertake to accept the amendment.  I do not think it is desirable.  If that is what is intended, and I think it is, it is something that we should oppose.  I think it was something thought up by a sea lawyer, who saw a provision in one Bill and thought it should be in the other.</P>

      <P>I do not hold myself out as a Parliamentary Draftsman or as a sea lawyer or as a member of the Bar.  I hold myself out as a respectable licensed grocer in Ballaghaderreen for the purposes of this argument.  The Minister has pointed out that it is highly likely that the Price Orders for the enforcement of which the inspector would invoke this section would be made in times of scarcity or quasi-national emergency.  I think we can all agree that if there was a situation of scarcity or quasi-national emergency in the country, one of the meanest crimes is to avail of that emergency in order to rook your neighbour or exploit the poor.  Is that not agreed?  It would be one of the most offensive, injurious and disgraceful offences of which one could be convicted in a public court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might not carry a heavy statutory penalty and yet your good name in the presence of your neighbours would be injured by it much more than it might be if you were convicted of many other offences for which you paid the penalty <Col N="145" /> and in respect of which your neighbours would think very little the less of you.  But, it is in respect of that class of offence, an offence which you would be peculiarly concerned to go and contest in the courts most enegetically, not in fear of the penalty which the court itself would impose but in fear of the penalty of the sanction of your neighbours' contempt for being convicted of such an offence, that you are required under this section to confess to any inspector who comes into you and to strip yourself of the right to say: &ldquo;I do not propose to answer that question.  If you allege against me that I have been guilty of this peculiarly offensive crime, prosecute me and prove it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have the right to say in any court of law, charged with any offence from murder to being drunk and unrulely, that before I am convicted it is the responsibility of the State to prove that I am guilty and, until I am so proven, I am deemed to be innocent and I am entitled to get acquittal from a court of law of any charge brought against me.  But this Bill provides that I have a statutory duty to answer the question, the very question upon which my innocence or guilt depends.</P>
    <P>Let us stop and think where we are going.  We have an Act in force in this country which contains a provision analogous to that&mdash;the Public Safety Act&mdash;but we all gave those powers to the Government with great misgiving and we would only give them because we were all satisfied that they represented the only effective instrument to deal with an emergency which struck at the very foundations of the State itself.  No lesser case, I think, would have induced this Parliament to abrogate the general rule that a man is innocent until he is proven guilty. We have no verdict in this country of &ldquo;Not Proven&rdquo; as they have in the Scottish courts.  You are either guilty or you are innocent and it is the duty of the State to prove that you are guilty.</P>
    <P>I know price control is not easy to enforce but is anybody in this House prepared to make the case that the emergency is so great and formidable that we are to abrogate the right of a <Col N="146" /> man to defend himself in court and to challenge the State to prove that he has committed a crime before he is condemned, not only in the eyes of the law but in the eyes of his neighbour?</P>
    <P>I say without hesitation, and I know whereof I speak, if, in the circumstances envisaged by the Tánaiste, I were prosecuted in my own town for an offence under that Act, the penalty which it was in the power of the court to impose upon me would be of no significance in comparison with the sanction of my neighbours' condemnation of my breach of that law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

Supposing an inspector says to me: &ldquo;Did you charge 7d. for a loaf of bread?&rdquo;  Am I entitled to say: &ldquo;I will not tell you&rdquo;?  I think, under the section, I am not.  Under the section, I am obliged to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>The purpose of the amendment is no more than to give me the right to refuse an answer where the answer <Col N="147" /> would, in fact, convict me of an offence under the act.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me try and narrow it down to a simple case.  The inspector comes in and says: &ldquo;By virtue of Section 24 (1) (e) of this Act, I require you to give me any other information which I reasonably require in regard to your activity as a merchant.  I want to know this.  Did you charge Mrs. So and So 7d. for a loaf yesterday, the fixed maximum price by the Minister for Industry and Commerce being 6d.?&rdquo; As I understand it, suppose I say: &ldquo;If you believe that, prosecute me and prove it&rdquo;, he may say: &ldquo;That is enough.  If I cannot get you on the charge of having done that, I have you under sub-section (e), that is, that you refused to answer my question.&rdquo;  Suppose I am charged and that I plead that his question was of a character that left me no option, if I were to answer it truly, but to admit an offence under the Act.  I say that you have no right to ask me such a question.  It is the duty of the court to assume that I am innocent until you are in a position to prove me guilty.  Narrow it down to that simple case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> I am asking the House to pause and consider.  We are all agreed that the likelihood of Price Orders being made under the Bill, when it is enacted, is remote.  It is designed for a period of scarcity.  Do you seriously intend to override a fundamental principle of the law&mdash;that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty&mdash;in order to provide for this remote contingency?</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that this is in regard to a trivial matter which, practically, can never arise.  But there is the danger that it may.  If you put that in this Bill then, just as the Minister said that this was taken out of another Act, in six or 12 months' time there will be another Bill before us and we shall be told that some section in it was copied out of another Act. That is how Section 21 got into the Agricultural Institute Bill.  I did not know it was there and the Taoiseach did not know it was there.  Finally, when the Taoiseach inquired how it got there we were told it was copied out of another Act.  He is now wondering if he ought not introduce legislation to amend the other Act.  Section 21 of the Agricultural Institute Bill is of relative insignificance because it enshrines no general principle.  This section, however&mdash;without the amendment here proposed&mdash;makes a very serious inroad, with deliberation, on the principle that I should not be found guilty until the State has proved me guilty in public court.  I know that that increases the Minister's difficulty in enforcing a Prices' Act.</P>
    <P>I share a good deal of the Minister's instinctive opposition to Price Control Acts in that I doubt if they can ever be made effectively to work except at such a cost as is wholly out of proportion to the ultimate benefits that derive from them.  I agree that their enforcement is almost impossible.  But, having that belief, as I have, let me endorse the Minister, in his desire to repair that inherent defect in all price control legislation, not to trample down a very important principle in the hope that he will make more efficient that which he knows in his heart can never be wholly efficient.</P>

      <P>If the Minister says to me: &ldquo;You are asking for an amendment which exempts a man from admitting an offence under the Act, on being questioned by an inspector,&rdquo; if the Minister says to me: &ldquo;It is not necessary; the word &lsquo;reasonably&rsquo; will be held by any court to forbid the inspector to ask a question the answer to which would incriminate a merchant,&rdquo; if that is true, then I think the Minister has the best of the argument.  My argument is based on the proposition that the section as it stands would entitle an inspector to ask me or any <Col N="150" /> shopkeeper in Ireland that vital question: &ldquo;Did you charge 7d. a loaf although the Minister made an Order fixing a maximum price of 6d.?&rdquo;  If the section does not authorise him to do that, I cannot see any serious difficulty. But, if the section as it stands in the Bill at present, without the amendment, does authorise the inspector to ask that question and to say to the shopkeeper: &ldquo;Either you admit you did it or you tell a lie or you refuse to answer it.&rdquo;</P>

That is all I want.  All I am arguing is that the man should not be put in the position in which he has only three choices &mdash;to lie; or to say: &ldquo;I admit a breach of the Minister's Order&rdquo;; or to say or do something or give an answer which undoubtedly brings him in conflict with paragraph (e) in this section, committing a stautory offence under the Bill by refusing to answer.</P>

      <P>With great respect to the Minister's view, the amendment put down by Senator O'Quigley was&mdash;as Deputies will see if they read his speech&mdash;for the purpose of emphasising what he certainly conceived to be a principle of supreme importance.  To try to ride away on the argument that this is a badly drafted amendment or is in its wrong place, simply exposes the weakness of the other arguments, if he has any, against the principle enshrined in this. The very fact that the Minister has to fall back upon an argument of that kind and uses words about Senator O'Quigley and those who supported him&mdash;&ldquo;stupid&rdquo; and other words of that description and adjectives of that kind&mdash;emphasises the poorness of the argument the Minister has against this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> I could calmly argue with the Minister the question of whether or not the amendment dealing with solicitor's privilege was necessary or not, but where the Minister approaches this particular amendment in the way he does, reasoned argument seems to run out the window.  I will go this length with the Minister and say that, so far as part of the Senator's amendment is concerned to deal with legal privilege, there is a lot to be said for the Minister's point of view.  Equally, there is something to be said for the Senator's point of view, that he wanted to get it clearly established that nothing of that kind could be caught by the wording or by the circumstances in which this Bill was drafted.  I do not at all subscribe to the proposition put forward by the Minister when he said that he had the highest authority for the proposition that this privilege, in regard to communication between solicitor and client being the privilege of the client, is so enshrined in the law that it would be almost impossible to get it out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>

      <P>By implication, without &ldquo;expressly&rdquo; at all.  The Minister now is assuming the role of sea-lawyer and it ill behoves him.  A statute can amend another statute by implication&mdash;but, of course, subject to very rigid rules of construction.  Where it is really a matter of legal principle founded and having its origin in the British Common Law, quite a considerable number of restrictions are attached to it.  Even then, it is much easier to amend a principle of that kind by implication, particularly in circumstances such as are envisaged by this Bill, than it is for a statute to repeal another statute by implication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can well imagine the district justice&mdash;or, on appeal, the Circuit Court or even the High Court Judge&mdash;saying: <Col N="154" />&ldquo;We must consider this statute in the light of what the Oireachtas set out to do and the end intended by them; it was intended to secure price control and to prevent people selling the necessaries of life at greater prices than they should; and therefore, to achieve that, certain drastic powers must be assumed by the Legislature or the Department; and accordingly we must, in the light of that, construe the statute in that way.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If the Minister brings in a Bill here and says: &ldquo;I am bringing in a Prices Bill to control prices, but everyone must know I have my tongue in my cheek and it is &ldquo;all my eye',&rdquo; then it is a different proposal. Here is what was quoted in the Seanad by Senator O'Quigley as reported in Volume 48 of the Seanad Debates, column 1127.  He quoted what the Minister said on the Bill, as reported in the Dáil Debates, column 125 of Volume 164, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not want to present this Bill to the House as a measure of major importance.  It is not and I do not want to regard it as such.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a Bill which is supposed to control the prices of the necessaries of life and is introduced into this House as such, but in the Minister's own words, it is eyewash.  If that be so, then it does not matter how you try to construe it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>But if we take it seriously, the court coming to construe this particular power will construe it <Col N="155" /> in the light of what the court thinks it was intended to do, to control the price of necessaries; and no one can argue in court that the Minister regarded the Bill as eyewash.  At all events, I am prepared to concede to the Minister that, as far as it refers to the question of privilege between solicitor and client, it is possible that that might still be a defence to a question put by an official if it transgressed that far, because of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; inserted here; but when you come to the other branch of the amendment, namely, that a person ought not to be forced to answer questions on anything that would incriminate him, then I think there is a strong case for the Senator's amendment, on a strict legal principle.  Again, the principle that a person is not bound to answer because it tends to incriminate him is not a principle enshrined in the Constitution.  We have not got any principle equivalent to the fifth amendment in the United States, and I rather think the Minister, in his flamboyant construction, had the fifth amendment in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fifth Amendment is a constitutional provision in the U.S.A., the equivalent of which is not in our Constitution.  This is really a law and, like any other law, can be repealed by implication.  This can be amended.  Principles of that kind, which we regard as much more sacrosanct, are scattered throughout numbers of statutes that have been passed by this House.  Numbers of them provide that the onus of proof should revert to the defence, that, until the contrary is proved, the person charged is guilty of the offence.  There is nothing particularly fundamental in the law that a person is not bound to answer a question that would tend to incriminate him.  In fact the rule here, in so far as we take the Common Law as our code of laws, is very elastic and not at all founded on very sound principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very fact that a man says: &ldquo;I will not answer that&rdquo; does not end the matter.  It only begins it, because he <Col N="156" /> then has to justify his action in court. It is a very elastic rule of law, hardly dignified by the name of a principle. The Fifth Amendment in America is a different matter altogether.  If the Seanad amendment in so far as this principle is concerned were accepted, the section would then provide that an official of the Minister might seek any information that he might reasonably require in regard to the activities of the person carrying on business, but in so doing he would not contravene the principle that a person is not bound to answer any question that might incriminate him.</P>
    <P>The official question is put by the Minister's official.  The shopkeeper says he will not answer.  That does not end the matter.  The Minister says he will prosecute.  The case goes to court and the shopkeeper has to prove to the satisfaction of the court that he was not guilty of the offence.  In no way are the Minister's powers lessened by this amendment.  The language the Minister used in the Seanad bordered on that of the guttersnipe.</P>

If the Minister had a good case, it would not have been necessary for him to sink to the level he did in the Seanad, as reported at column 1137 of Volume 48 of the Official Report.  The Minister said, and I quote, &ldquo;In revenge for the Budget or in revenge for the election or something else, they are going to insert some damn amendment in this Bill....&rdquo;  Is that language calculated either to maintain the dignity of the Minister or the dignity of either House? If the Minister had solid reasons for his argument on this Bill, he should have rested on them and should not have relied on the contention that this amendment is badly drafted, put into the wrong place or, to use his own words, &ldquo;some damned amendment put into this Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to this debate and the longer it goes on, the <Col N="157" /> more confused I get, because, bearing in mind the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, that persons who carry on certain activities shall be required to produce books or documents or records relating to such activity and to answer any reasonable question regarding them that appears on such books or records, it appears to be stretching the provision very far to suggest that paragraph (e) of the section would have the effect of putting people in the position of convicting themselves.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (e) says that the inspector may require such person to give any other information which he may reasonably require in regard to such activity.  Surely we are dealing with some question of an attempt at something or another where the Minister may feel it incumbent on him to exercise his powers in relation to the control of prices, and surely it is reasonable to say that if an inspector calls to any place where trade is carried on and asks a question which is clearly aimed at acquiring reasonable information, the very connotation of the phrase &ldquo;reasonably require&rdquo; would, in the eyes of the layman, relieve an individual trader from the liability of doing or saying anything that would involve him in the imputation that he was guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, paragraph (b) requires the person to produce to the inspector any books, documents or records relating to such activities which are in the person's power or control and to give him such information as he may reasonably require in regard to any entries in such books, documents or records.  No objection is made to that particular clause, but here, where the provision requires the person to give reasonable information, the suggestion is made that in some manner the person is being deprived of legal rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot follow the Deputies who have spoken into the intricacies of law involved, but it would appear to me, as a layman, that this provision should be retained, if there is any pretension at all being made to operate a Bill designed to control prices.  During the discussion on the previous amendment, <Col N="158" /> great stress was laid on the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; and, after lively debate, the Minister agreed he would accept the amendment and would write in the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;.  If the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; was so important there surely it should be accepted by the House that it is equally important in regard to this sub-section and that it gives the protection which Deputies are anxious to seek for persons affected by the Bill.</P>

      <P>Earlier this evening the Minister, dealing with the second amendment which was before the House, justified his decision not to accept it by stating that the section, as unamended, had got precedence from earlier Acts passed in recent years.  Applying that principle to the amendment before the House now, I should like to draw the attention of Deputies to the fact that what the Seanad, by voting by a majority in favour of this amendment, was doing was merely following precedents in earlier Acts.  It is established in the Social Welfare Act of 1952 that inspectors under the Act have quite wide powers of entering premises and seeking information.  It is specifically stated in that Act that a person to whom these questions are directed may not incriminate himself and may refuse to answer questions which would incriminate him.</P>
      <P>In earlier legislation, in the Prices Act of 1937, it was similarly provided that although the commission bad power to bring people before it to answer questions on oath they would be entitled to claim the privilege which we think should be allowed here.  It was provided also in several other enactments, one of which was the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, that a person would be required to give certain information but not required to incriminate himself.</P>

It is a bad principle that we should pass legislation here which allows an authorised officer to ask questions, the answers to which might incriminate a person, and that is what we are doing here.

    <P>&ldquo;That, since modern developments have greatly modified the usefulness of present expenditure on defence and rendered it wasteful in large measure, Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that a Select Committee consisting of 14 members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, of whom six shall be a quorum, should be appointed with power to send for persons, papers and records to inquire into, consider and report upon the whole question of national defence expenditure.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputies McQuillan and Dr. Browne.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>When this debate was adjourned, I was dealing with the question of the usefulness of the Defence Forces in rendering assistance to civil defence in the event of this country being subjected to nuclear attack.  In that respect, I can assure the movers of the motion that I fully appreciate the importance of having the Army trained in the technique of civil defence.  I cannot, however, agree with one of the movers when he says that the money at present being spent on the Defence Forces should be diverted to this other purpose of civil defence.  Even if the Army were converted completely to the civil defence notion, it would not lessen the urgent need at the moment for a widespread civil defence organisation, <Col N="165" /> and it is on such a voluntary organisation that our plans must be based.</P>
      <P>I am fully in agreement with Deputy McQuillan when he speaks about the desirability of training our people as a whole in civil defence, but, unfortunately, we cannot train the people, if they will not volunteer for the civil defence services.  I must admit that so far we have not succeeded in getting the people genuinely interested in that matter of civil defence.  That is a problem which will have to be tackled. The only satisfactory way in which civil defence organisations can be got going is through the local authorities and, with one or two exceptions, the local authorities have been very apathetic in regard to civil defence.  I hope that Deputies will do all they can to encourage greater enrolment in the voluntary civil defence organisations. I feel sure that if a catastrophe, such as would result from a nuclear attack took place, everybody would want to help, but if people were untrained, they would be practically useless in such an emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was dealing with some of the ways in which the Army could help in such an emergency, in the event of the country being attacked with nuclear weapons.  I had mentioned that light aircraft and mobile units of the Army would be suitable for the reconnaissance of damaged radio-active centres. The infantry units of the Army and the engineers could be usefully employed in rescue operations and in the restoration of damaged communications. The Army medical units would be useful in rendering first aid and in assisting in the evacuation of the injured.  The Army signal units would be useful when ordinary telephonic communications had been destroyed.  I think these considerations, coupled with the undoubted fact that, in future, the conditions of warfare are unlikely to allow us any appreciable time for expanding our Defence Forces, only serve to lay emphasis on the necessity for maintaining the maximum force in peacetime, rather than on a reduction of our strength, as the movers of the motion seem to want.  It should be realised that the <Col N="166" /> existing force here is very far from excessive.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of economy, when I moved the Estimate here last year I expressed the view that it was necessary to achieve the utmost economy compatible with maintaining the efficiency of the Defence Forces but at the same time I did draw attention to the fact that there was a substantial reduction in comparison with the net Estimate for the previous year.  I said that economy could be achieved only as a result of a determined effort to bring about the maximum saving on every service and activity covered by the Estimate.  I can assure the House that in the meantime everything possible has been done, and is still being done, to achieve every possible economy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proportion of officers and N.C.O.s to the other ranks in the Army, to which Deputy McQuillan referred and has been accustomed to refer on every possible occasion in this House, it is not fair criticism merely to quote the numbers of officers and N.C.O.s and then quote the number of private soldiers in the Army and say this proportion is too high.  It is not fair to forget the fact that there is also the Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and the First Line Reserve to be trained and that there must be available a sufficient number of regular officers and N.C.O.s to assist in the training and organisation of these reserve forces.</P>
    <P>In addition, it should be remembered that the present Army is organised merely as a nucleus, capable of being expanded in the event of an emergency.  While it is not necessary to have the full complement of officers and N.C.O.s that would be required for the ultimate Army we would hope to have in the event of an emergency, still it is necessary to have a sufficient number of trained officers and N.C.O.s to allow of expansion in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I can also assure the House that the general staff is keeping abreast, as far as possible, with modern developments in warfare and that our defence organisation and planning is under constant review in the light of these <Col N="167" /> developments.  I cannot, then, subscribe to the idea, as stated in this motion, that defence expenditure is wasteful in large measure.  So far from that being so, I am convinced that the amount being spent on defence is the bare minimum if we are to make any pretence at all at defending ourselves. If the movers feel we should abandon all pretence at defending ourselves and let somebody else undertake our defence, I should be glad if they would say so and if they would indicate who they would wish to undertake our defence for us.  The proportion of our Budget devoted to this essential form of insurance is very much smaller than in the case of almost any other country that could be mentioned.</P>
    <P>The motion goes on to propose that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Select Committee consisting of 14 members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, of whom six shall be a quorum, should be appointed, with power to send for persons, papers and records to inquire into, consider and report upon the whole question of national defence expenditure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On that proposal I can only repeat that the Defence Forces are the State's insurance policy against internal disorder and external aggression.  It is the responsibility of the Government to decide to what extent they should hold this insurance, and, in my opinion, no Government worthy of the name would be prepared to hand over that responsibility to a committee, as suggested in this motion.  No Government would be prepared to allow themselves to be circumscribed by such a committee in such important matters. I find it hard to believe that the proposers of the motion expected that suggestion to be taken seriously.</P>
    <P>The only effect that the setting up of such a committee would have would be to obscure the real functions of the Government, the Minister and the general staff.  The effect of that would be to render more difficult the proper fulfilment of these different responsibilities. If these were to be done in the case of the Department of Defence, I cannot see why there should not also <Col N="168" /> be a demand for it to be done in the case of other Departments.  If a system like that were to develop, the result would be chaos.</P>
    <P>In concluding, it might be no harm to quote some remarks of Deputy McQuillan when dealing with the Defence Estimate in 1955.  At that time, as reported in column 105 of the Dáil Debates of the 5th July, 1955, Deputy McQuillan said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is little, perhaps, that we can do in the line of defence against atomic or nuclear warfare.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is, therefore, essential that we scrutinise the policy of the present Government in connection with the defence of the country and, in connection with it, the amount of money it is proposed to expend on an army and the type of army on which this money will be expended.  My personal belief is that we should have a small army composed of personnel on a permanent basis and that this small army should consist of the cream of our soldiers, officers, N.C.O.s and men; that it would be highly trained and mobile and at the same time capable of very rapid expansion and able to take in, in times of emergencies, larger groups who would be trained on a basis of three or six months a year.  The actual size of this standing army is something on which we can agree to differ&mdash;there may be differences of opinion as to whether it should be 12,000 or 8,000, and I do not propose to enter into the lists to discuss that particular aspect of the matter- I think it should be left to people who are more expert on that than we are to make recommendations as to what the actual size of that small, but well trained, force should be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that that is, to a certain extent, a description of the type of Army we have at the moment.  I note that at that time, just two years ago, Deputy McQuillan was prepared to leave to people more expert the responsibility of making recommendations as to the type of Army we should have.  I do not know if in the meantime <Col N="169" /> Deputy McQuillan thinks he has become an expert on the subject&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, if the Minister even had the decency to read or listen to my remarks, he would find that I made it clear I did not want to be a member of this committee. I am afraid he has not even read them.  However, I shall deal with him.  In all my life I never heard such misrepresentation from a Minister.  It is a tragedy, too, from a young Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan said: &ldquo;To people who are more expert than we are.&rdquo;  I presume he was including all the members of the House as well as himself.  Apparently, he has altered his opinion now, and thinks that the people whom successive Governments have considered suitable experts to make recommendations are no longer suitable for this purpose.  If that is Deputy McQuillan's idea of the matter, it is not mine and I do not intend to recommend to the Government the acceptance of this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy McQuillan saw fit to move this motion, and in such terms.  In his remarks he referred to the Army as being capable of &ldquo;Stone Age defence&rdquo;, and used similar phrases.  A speech like that can have been made for one reason only and that is a policy of denigration, a policy of trying to lower the Army in the estimation of the people of this country.  The Army is part of the Defence Forces of the State.  It is organised on what is considered the best lines for our defence.  Deputy McQuillan was a member of it.  It has rendered valuable service to the country in the past and shall do so again. In sneering at the large number of officers compared with the number of soldiers, again he is trying to smear the Army.  For years, when it was necessary to defend the country, there were always sufficient soldiers but a lack of officers.  Even in the Fenian days, the lack of officers led to failure. When they were required, there was never a shortage of men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister very properly said, with the First Line Reserve, the Defence Forces and the voluntary <Col N="170" /> defence forces, we have ample manpower to make it expensive at least for any invader who attempts to interfere with our neutrality or our independence. This country owes a great deal to the Army.  I agree with the Minister that motions of this kind are not of any help to him, the Government or the nation, and when he says that he could not accept the proposal to have a commission inquire into the matter, he is perfectly right because he would be transferring from the Government the responsibility they have and handing it over to somebody else.  That is what no Government and no Minister can ever do, in this or any other country.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, ask Deputy McQuillan not to persist in pushing this motion.  It serves no useful purpose. It helps nobody and it does not elevate our standard of citizenship to have cheap sneers directed at the armed forces of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister or Deputy MacEoin suggest that no country in the world inquires into its defence policy by having a report sent to the Government or some high authority?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an inquiry in this House every year on the Defence Estimate into the whole policy of defence.  If at any time a question of defence policy arises, there is no better authority in the world to decide that issue than the elected Parliament of the country.  If Deputy McQuillan and the other Deputies fail in that, they fail because they did not take steps to put their case to the Minister at the time the Estimate is going through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my view in a way different from Deputy McQuillan.  I should like to know precisely what is the purpose of the Army.  The Minister gave the impression that it was only for the purpose of rescue or work of that nature. I cannot visualise the Army being used for defence.  I therefore, question the form in which the Army is constituted.  The average armed force is constituted in such a way as to put up some form of open defence or offensive, but we are not in a position to <Col N="171" /> carry out any such operation.  Let us be sensible about the matter.</P>
      <P>We are an island on the fringe of Europe and if we have any enemies at all, they can only be Britain or Britain's enemies.  In either case, our enemy would be a world Power.  To put up any form of frontal defence against those great Powers would be absolutely useless.  We would leave ourselves open to immediate destruction. The country, in my opinion, would be left absolutely defenceless during the first stage of any form of attack.  I rule out altogether that the Army is there for the purpose of defending the country against any outsider.</P>
      <P>If the Army is constituted solely for internal purposes, I do not see any great threat.  There might be, if it was some form of social revolution, but so long as we have emigration, we will never have that.  As far as other people are concerned, there may be some differences over what they should be able to do in the North, but I am not aware of any threat.  I do not foresee any great threat.</P>
      <P>The Army is expensive.  We hear of warlike stores, heavy guns and weapons of every description.  These things are costly and perhaps we could economise if we could make up our minds as to what way the Army will be used.  If we made up our minds that there would be some form of guerilla defence, we could economise a good deal and perhaps the Army would ask for £4,000,000, and not £6,000,000.</P>

      <P>Let us be sensible about the matter.  Either the Army exists only for rescue purposes or we envisage an actual attack.  What defence have we against an actual attack?  I am not aware what warlike stores are housed in underground shelters.  From what we know, the very first stages of an attack would be destructive of these costly things and we would be left without any defence at all.  There is no defence in Dublin. If someone made a threat, we would <Col N="172" /> have to surrender like the Japanese because there is no place for the people to go to.  There are no underground shelters to go to.  What have we civil defence for?  If there is an attack with nuclear weapons, we know the number of people that would be killed and injured.  The few hundred that would be there for rescue work would be in a panic themselves.  There would be no communications and no form of underground shelters.  I do not know what the Minister's policy is in regard to that.</P>
      <P>We have costly aeroplanes and if there was an attack contemplated, it would be made without any notice at all and these aeroplanes would be smashed to smithereens.  Our form of defence ought to be of the guerilla type.  If a potential enemy thought we were going to put up some form of frontal defence, he would be quite satisfied as he would be able to annihilate us.  If we had some form of light mobile brigade defence that could be brought into some kind of regular army, an enemy might think twice of moving in.</P>
      <P>I do not want to enlarge on this subject, except to say that many economies could be made.  There is no need for many of the stores we purchase; they can serve no useful purpose, and I do not see how they could be used for any effective defence. As we know, in the case of Suez and other such incidents, the attack comes first and the questions are asked afterwards. Where are the warlike stores then?  I think a different view should be taken about the form of defence we should have and if we did take a different view, we might not have to spend so much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech we have just had is the greatest possible argument against the motion proposed by Deputy McQuillan, I would agree with everything Deputy MacEoin said and he is perhaps a person who is able to offer very useful opinions on matters of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked what purpose does the Army serve.  Any school-going child could answer that question.  On the question of cutting down expenditure <Col N="173" /> on the maintenance of a highly efficient army, I would say that what would be saved would be small and the loss would be greater than many people in the country can imagine.  I have a distinct recollection of reading of the time about 180 years ago when the Army was cut down or disbanded&mdash; I think, at Dungannon.  So far as I can judge, it was the greatest mistake ever made.  If it is Deputy Sherwin's suggestion that we should consider reducing or abandoning the Army&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I suggest that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I do not think he would have the people behind him in any move of that kind.  The people of the country are very proud of the Army.  The officers, as far as we can see, are highly efficient and the men, generally speaking, are a credit to the country.  It is the proper thing that they should be highly trained, and that the most up-to-date equipment should be supplied to them, even if it is only sufficient to train them in the use of particular weapons.</P>
      <P>It is deplorable that a speech such as the one we have just heard should be made in an Irish Parliament.  When the time comes that the Irish Parliament thinks we should degrade the Army by reducing it or cutting off supplies or contemplate instead, as Deputy Sherwin said, some hidden guerilla force to use in an emergency, we shall have travelled back very far.  I believe the setting-up of a committee to consider these questions would simply be a waste of energy and, further, it would be a motion of no confidence in the Army officers and personnel.  Deputy McQuillan would be well advised to withdraw the motion, especially in view of the speech we have just heard and for which the motion is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly have great respect for Deputy MacEoin and for his point of view on a matter such as this, but we put down this motion for a very simple purpose, a purpose common to the peoples of many nations, as Deputy McQuillan said.  We are not now living in the time of the Fenians, which is very far gone: we are living in the nuclear age, the sputnik age, at a time when one has to <Col N="174" /> review the desirability of maintaining a standing army of any size.</P>
      <P>It is possible that a commission such as is suggested, having considered all the points made by the various Deputies and by others, might decide that the existing Army is the correct size for our country; but we feel it is quite impossible to move into the nuclear age without accepting the fact that radical changes have been taking place in the whole conception of defence forces.  Most of the great nations now accept the general principle that the conventional defence forces have become relatively unimportant and that their place is being taken by the nuclear weapons.  As for the rest of us, the small nations, I am afraid it looks as if we have little alter native, poor as that prospect may be, but to look for shelter to one of the great nations and can only hope it does not decide to go to war.  I think that is the realistic view of the situation today, and there is no good in talking of our great heritage or great soldiers. The fact is that all one needs now is a standing Army which might take on police functions, but questions of defending the country or of going into the attack simply do not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our main point is that we want an investigation into the whole question, in the light of the very radically altered circumstances.  I do not think Deputy McQuillan, in talking about the Stone Age, wanted to denigrate the Defence Forces and anybody who has listened to him speaking here on the Estimates would agree that nobody had a more staunch and consistent defender in this House than the Army, officers and all ranks, had in Deputy McQuillan.  Deputy MacEoin must have misunderstood what he had in mind when he said Deputy McQuillan was attempting to denigrate these soldiers.  I believe nobody has greater respect for these men than Deputy McQuillan, and he has shown that over the years.  I am sure that when he spoke of Stone Age methods&mdash;and it is probably true&mdash;he was thinking of the facilities here in contrast to what science has now made available elsewhere. If they are little better than Stone Age methods, it is not the fault <Col N="175" /> of the Army, because we should provide them with proper means of defence, and if the Stone Age methods of defence exist here, it is the fault of this House, and what Deputy McQuillan said did not imply any reflection on the Army.</P>
    <P>If this motion were considered on the merits, it would be seen that it is a serious attempt on the part of two Deputies to get a serious matter considered in an intelligent way.  The attitude taken by the Minister surprises me, as does the suggestion or imputation that we wished to hand over consideration of these matters to some outside commission, without any regard to what the powers of that commission should be.  We clearly state in the terms of the motion that the commission will report upon the whole question.  They have absolutely no powers or functions other than to report back to us here, the sovereign power in this country.  It is wrong and unfair for the Minister for Defence to suggest that we in any way wish to hand over the powers of this House to any outside body.  I am particularly surprised by his very extraordinary, sneering reference to the suggestion of the establishment of a commission as if it were an outrageous, unheard-of, unthought-of, new or novel thing. There have been commissions on education, emigration, milk costings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them more than others.  The Taoiseach has recently broken out in a regular rash of commissions in regard to the language revival, trying to resuscitate that unfortunate thing, a commission on the desirability of abolishing the Seanad, and so on.  In our suggestion that a commission should be established to try to discover the wisest move to adopt in the years ahead, we are not tracking any new paths or making any novel suggestions.  The Minister has no need to be frightened of this sort of thing because the suggestion has been made by all Governments in every country in the world, <Col N="176" /> and particularly in our own country, over the centuries.</P>
      <P>There is one other point arising out of the question; do we wish to let somebody else take over our defence? Again, of course, if the Minister had read the motion he would not have made such a silly imputation.  We made no such suggestion.  We asked that a commission be established to investigate and report back.  There was no suggestion that we should vacate the powers of control or the defence of our country and hand them over to anybody else.  The imputation there is that we would allow Britain to do this for us.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave us a homily on civil defence.  I hope he will not waste any money on civil defence, to be quite frank.  It is quite clear that, as civil defence is at the moment and as attack is likely to be in the future, there is no real use in civil defence.  As most countries have decided and as most thinking people in different countries in the world have accepted, there is very little or no defence against any nuclear attack.</P>

      <P>We will not hear from the Deputy, the expert.  There is one other point.  In the last few years we have been asked in this House to economise on all the really essential <Col N="177" /> services under Government Departments. We were asked to economise on food subsidies, health services, care of the aged, old age pensions, education. All these economies have been entered into in a high-spirited way.  We feel that it is possible to make a useful economy as the result of cogent, intelligent, well-thought investigation into the Army, which, with all its merits in the past, with all its ambitions for the future, in the reality of the present situation and in an assessment of the present situation, has little or no function, certainly as a defence force and more than likely as an offensive force. It would help the Minister to find one economy which would hurt nobody instead of inventing ones that hurt many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the very few opportunities this House has of speaking about the Army is on the Estimate for the Army.  One of the justifications for the acceptance of this motion is the fact that there have been so many different speeches and so many different impressions about the Army. I do not mean the deliberately wrong impression that certain people here got with regard to the personnel of the Army because&mdash;I do not think there is any exception to this&mdash;nobody, I think, attempted in this debate or attempted during my time in the Dáil to run down the Army in any way, either generally or individually.  If anybody attributes to any member of this House a statement to the effect that he ran down the Army, that is merely to make a case against this motion and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose one of the justifications for the acceptance of the motion is the impression that was got by Deputy Loughman of the speech that was made by the Independent Deputy, Deputy Sherwin.  If there is such divergence of opinion about defence and the methods of defence, the size of the Army and the efficiency of the Army, is it unreasonable to ask that 14 members of this House and of the Seanad should conduct merely a fact-finding commission, to get a general view, an agreed view or a majority view, to be presented to the Minister or to this <Col N="178" /> House so that there will not be any wrong thinking about the efficiency of the Army or the size of the Army?</P>
    <P>Deputies from all sides of the House might be astounded by what Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy McQuillan or I might say, but these are views, not necessarily our views, but the views of people to whom we listen.  From that point of view, therefore, in a very important matter such as defence, it would be a good thing that 14 members should present a report either to the Minister or to this House and that all of us should be on the right foot as regards defence because that is something that should not be the subject of Party politics.  Everybody will agree that defence is a national matter.  Like foreign policy, it is a matter on which all of us should be agreed.  Therefore we who in some respects are supposed to be the leaders of public opinion&mdash; more often we are pushed&mdash;should be on the one foot and on the right foot as far as civil defence or general defence is concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be unusual for a committee of the House of the Oireachtas to inquire into the matters that this motion asks should be inquired into.  The Army is not sacrosanct. The Army has not a tremendous number of highly important secrets that ought not to be divulged to members of the House.  Certain questions can be asked by the Committee on Public Accounts with regard to expenditure on the Army and expenditure by other Departments.  If I interpret the mind of the movers of the motion, the proposed Select Committee is merely to conduct an inquiry such as would be conducted by the Committee on Public Accounts, only in a more detailed way, without trying to pry from top Army staff secrets or information that might be regarded as absolutely confidential. There is the impression abroad&mdash;again I say this does not reflect on the Army generally or the personnel of the Army &mdash;there is a widespread impression, even among supporters of the Government Party, that there is waste in the Army.  Especially there is the impression that we are spending money on things that are obsolete or that become obsolete in a very short time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> That is not an absolute criticism of the Army economy.  This proposed committee merely wants to ensure that the best type of defence possible&mdash; having regard to our circumstances, our geographical position, the amount of money we can spend on the Army&mdash; will be available to ensure that our Army will be the best we can make it, bearing all these circumstances in mind.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that, on a motion such as this, as on many motions, we should have to vote, because it deters, in particular, members of a Government Party&mdash;I do not say this particular Government Party&mdash;from speaking their minds honestly.  However, this motion has done good if only from the point of view of getting a discussion on the subject.  The proposed committee does not want to usurp the functions of the Minister, the Government or the Army staff.  It merely wants to satisfy itself about conditions in the Army.  I do not think that anybody who spoke in favour of the motion suggested that we should hand over the defence of our country to, say, Russia, Great Britain or the United States, and anybody who says to the contrary is, I suggest, merely trying to make a case against the motion.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, the Government have been prepared to accept the advice of organisations such as O.E.E.C.  Therefore, it would be for the benefit of the country as a whole if this motion were accepted.  It does not commit the Government to anything. The motion may prove as abortive as the Commission on Youth Unemployment and the Commission on Emigration and some other commissions which we set up.  The Minister has nothing to lose, unless it is that he objects to the expense that might be incurred in relation to the meetings they might hold.</P>
    <P>I am not too conversant with Army matters in this or in any other country. Everybody knows, however, that a special committee is sitting in the United States which advises the Government and the Army.  That committee is composed of members of the two Parties in the United States. <Col N="180" /> They make public many things which we would regard as top secrets.  Surely, then, we in this small country should be prepared to permit the elected representatives to carry out an inquiry on the lines indicated in this motion.</P>
    <P>I cannot say much about civil defence. Deputy Haughey takes exception to what Deputy Browne had to say.  It shows a big difference of opinion between the two Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne gave a very good answer when he said that if a nuclear war touched this country, then neither of the two of them would be there to say who had been right or wrong.  I have no suggestions to offer in respect of the Army because I have not been in it, and neither do I know much about detailed Army work.  I have no idea what amount of money is spent on the F.C.A.  Lest anybody should misinterpret me, I want to say that those who volunteer for the F.C.A. are making a tremendous sacrifice and are doing a good job, as far as they are allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the money spent on the F.C.A. would not be more usefully employed in training young men of a certain age for about a fortnight each year in a military training camp.  I do not know whether or not the Minister is satisfied with the result of the F.C.A., but I often think that, from the point of view of discipline, morale and general physical well-being, I would be in favour of action by the Government requiring young men of a certain age to undergo military and physical training for about a fortnight each year for a certain number of years.  Some people might describe that as conscription, but I would not. To my mind, conscription is the yanking of a fellow into an association, body or army, and making him do something he does not want to do.  I think it would be of tremendous advantage, physically and morally, for young lads in the age group, say, 16 to 21 years.  Then, if the Minister wants it, he can have his Irish classes there; I think they would be accepted more readily there rather than by the method of ramming Irish down the <Col N="181" /> throats of people in schools and different places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a little confused by some of the speeches in this debate because it appears to me quite clearly that if this motion were carried and if the Select Committee were set up, the Minister for Defence would virtually be out of a job.  I cannot think what he would be doing while the Select Committee would be in operation because <Col N="182" /> the terms of reference seem to me to be precisely the same terms of reference as those given to the Minister himself by the Government.  Surely it is the Minister's job to acquaint himself with modern developments, to see whether present expenditure on defence is rendered wasteful in large measure in view of modern developments and to consider and discuss with his advisers the whole question of national defence expenditure.  That, I regard as the Minister's job and I gather from him that that is also the way in which he regards it.</P>
      <P>I feel that there is a certain amount of confusion in people's minds as to the actual purpose of the Army, and that there always has been.  I think that that is because a number of people have never tried to understand and do not want to understand the matter.  I have always regarded it&mdash;I think, rightly&mdash;as having a two-fold role in peace-time.  In the first place, it is a training cadre for home defence. The emphasis is on the training end, rather than on the building-up of a force which, in itself, is a striking force.  Anyone who studies the establishment will have that clearly brought home to him.  The peace-time establishment of an infantry battalion, or any other unit, is far too small to render it an effective fighting unit on its own.  All the infantry men we have in the Army at the moment would not, probably, form more than two full war-strength infantry battalions.  The privates are expected to be training as potential N.C.O.s and the junior officers are expected to be training as senior officers, so that, in the event of a national emergency, we have the basis on which a national army can be built up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some speakers have assumed that the next emergency&mdash;if we can call it so&mdash;will inevitably be a nuclear war. However, they overlook the fact that the defence forces of other countries, both small and great powers, are still largely equipped with what are now known as conventional weapons.  There are small units armed with artillery, formed as tactical nuclear fighting units.  In some armies there are infantry units which are trained with <Col N="183" /> or experiment with small-scale tactical nuclear weapons.  But in spite of all that, we still get masses of infantry, tanks, armoured cars and artillery.  We get quite an amount of what Deputy McQuillan would call stone-age aircraft, even piston-driven, propeller-driven aircraft, for spotting, army co-operation, and so on.</P>
    <P>Here we come to another misconception, of course, of which Deputy McQuillan is always guilty&mdash;that is, our famous three &ldquo;Jets&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tell us about those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be only too glad to try to explain this extremely difficult point.  If the Deputy looks into the question of the three &ldquo;Jets&rdquo;, he will find that they are three training aircraft only; they are designed and built as training aircraft only.  If Deputy McQuillan could just get that into his head, everything else would become clear but he insists on regarding them as first-rate fighting aircraft, on whose defence the whole nation relies.  That, of course, is fantastic.  It is quite impossible for us to build up an air force on our own which in itself is a real defence.  We never have had it, but we have always employed pilots in the Army Air Corps to train in the flying and operation of the most up-to-date aircraft which are available and which are within our means.  With those three aircraft, we are able to train all our Air Corps pilots in the operation of jet aircraft, and without them we would be miles behind everyone The fact that you can have much faster ones, the fact that you can have guided missiles which can go for 3,000 miles without a pilot, and all that sort of thing, does not necessarily render these completely useless.</P>
      <P>The only thing which appears to be generally regarded as completely useless now is the ordinary anti-aircraft artillery.  We had at one stage costly defence artillery, but that has long been abandoned also.  Anti-aircraft artillery is going out to some extent with the greater Powers but, curiously enough, it is not going out with the less powerful nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> We must regard this whole position in its general aspect and realise that it is not half as simple as Deputy McQuillan or Deputy Dr. Browne makes out.  It is not as if the main military Powers, either of Europe or of the world, had all decided that they would rely now solely on nuclear weapons.  It is becoming increasingly clear that all Powers are becoming increasingly nervous of the use of nuclear weapons, even by their own Forces, because they know that, with the spread of knowledge of nuclear warfare, retaliation will be inevitable and will be very very drastic indeed&mdash; so that whoever starts a nuclear war may wipe out his opponent but will certainly lead to his own destruction as well.</P>

      <P>That is on the assumption that the next war must be a nuclear war, which no great Power and no small Power has yet decided. Nobody knows.  All we know is that nuclear war has become so utterly terrible that everyone is scared to start it.  They are equally scared that somebody else may start it, so they feel&mdash;I think, quite wrongly&mdash;that the only defence is to say: &ldquo;If you have got a H-bomb, we have one, too; if you let yours go, you will not be able to find where ours is until it arrives on you; then both of us will be wiped out&mdash;and we are both damn fools.&rdquo;  I think there is much more danger of having wars with conventional weapons again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Another speaker expressed a grave doubt or grave anxiety that there was the impression of waste in the Army and he stated that there had always been an impression of wasteful expenditure.  That, I think, applies only to those who have not been in the Army because anyone, including Deputy McQuillan, who has served in the Army will know it is, and always has been, the most cut-price outfit that has ever existed, that its expenditure is cut to the minimum that it has never been allowed to buy half the stuff regarded as essential, that successive Ministers for Finance have always cut the Army Estimate and that in actual fact the Defence Estimate has never been fully expended or anything like it.</P>
      <P>There were numerous instances of that during the last war and immediately before it.  There was the question of the adoption of the Bren gun.  It was adopted by our forces considerably before it was adopted by the British Army but, due to cuts in expenditure, we went into the war without Bren guns because the expenditure had not been approved.  In actual fact we went into the war with little modern equipment. The position at the moment is that we have extremely little modern equipment.  All we have is basically what one might call training tools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Army is not a striking force at all.  It is an effort to supply our Forces <Col N="187" /> with examples of modern artillery, modern signalling equipment, modern infantry weapons so that the maximum training can be given and that our Forces can be kept as up to date as possible with the minimum of expenditure. No one who has seen the efforts made to get approval for defence expenditure could ever say that there is any wastage of expenditure as far as the Army is concerned.  Perhaps it could be said there is waste as far as the civil side is concerned, but in so far as warlike stores come into the reckoning, as far as transport and fuel are concerned, either on motors or aircraft, every possible economy is effected.</P>
    <P>As far as its role as a training unit for a larger scale Army for national defence goes, there is no waste of expenditure. But the Army also has the rôle of aiding the civil power.  That is the most distasteful rôle and the most difficult one, but events have shown that under certain circumstances it is necessary to have a small force available to aid the Garda in the maintenance of law and order.  I would regard that as a very minor rôle, however.  I think the main attitude to our Defence Forces has always been correct&mdash; namely, that it should be a small force, as highly trained as possible, capable of rapid expansion at short notice and capable of using the most modern weapons which might become available.</P>
    <P>We cannot hope to maintain big armies like other countries.  It would be wasteful if we re-armed all our Army personnel with most modern weapons as they became developed.  All we can do is to get examples of modern weapons and train our men in the use of them in the hope that if and when the time comes we may be able to lay our hands on these weapons in greater numbers.  There was no question ever of using the Army as it stands for frontal defence, making a sort of thin green line across the centre of the country.</P>

      <P>What defence would the Deputy envisage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to see <Col N="188" /> what our defence plans are.  Having been a junior grade officer in the Army, I am not fully conversant with our plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two defence plans&mdash;break-through or guerilla methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that errs slightly on the side of oversimplification, but at the same time it is difficult to train purely guerilla fighters.  We must have some sort of organisation.  During one part of the emergency towards the end of the war in Europe the brigade in which I was serving was broken up into flying columns.  We were divided into infantry companies with detachments of artillery, engineers, ambulances and so forth.  We acted purely as independent flying columns.  The idea was to strike, retire, outflank and get around the enemy, fight, run, dodge and annoy the enemy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the need for heavy equipment in that case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin has already made his contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little doubtful as to what Deputy Sherwin knows about our so-called heavy equipment.  I get the impression that he feels we have large-scale armoured forces held in reserve, possibly in the Curragh.  In actual fact, we have a few tanks which possibly Deputy McQuillan would say were stone-age tanks.  The few we have are used for training men in the operation and maintenance of armoured fighting vehicles.  Apart from that we have very little heavy equipment.  The only equipment, apart from weapons, with which men serving in the type of flying columns I have mentioned would need to be supplied would be sturdy boots.  At the same time, these men must be taken to their positions by motor vehicles and dropped at the posts from which they are to start operations.  After that the transport would have no further significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot imagine anybody dropping nuclear weapons on this country.  It <Col N="189" /> would be entirely wasteful.  Millions of pounds' worth of nuclear weapons would be dropped on a big city but I do not think it would be an economic proposition to use such weapons here. Any army invading this country would be more likely to do so by the use of conventional weapons.  Therefore, I cannot see any good reason for the appointment of a Select Committee. It would be wasting its time.  It would be getting very much in the way of the Minister and the general staff.  On <Col N="190" /> those grounds I would urge Deputy McQuillan to desist from pressing this motion which, I think, is aimed at discouraging our Army and amounts to a vote of no confidence in the Minister, whether Deputy McQuillan looks on it in that way or not.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, ba mhaith liom comhbhrón na Dála a chur in iúl do mhuintir an Teachta Pádraig Ó Beacháin, a fuair bás ó bhíomar anseo cheana.  Iarraim cead dom Rúnaí Parlaiminte ráiteas a léamh thar mo cheann.</P>

      <P>Ba mhór an suathadh a baineadh as Comhaltaí uile na Dála nuair a chualadar gur sciob an bás leis, seachtain go leith ó shoin, an Teachta Pádraig Ó Beacháin, Rúnaí Parlaiminte an Aire Airgeadais. Go dtuga Dia suaimhneas síoraí na bhFlathas dá anam uasal!</P>
      <P>Aontófar liom go mba dhuine neamhchoitianta ar fad é an fear seo, Pádraig Ó Beacháin.  Ní hionadh gur fhág a bhás gan choinne scamall bróin ar a chairde uile agus go mór mhór ar mhuintir a Dháilceantair.</P>

    <P>Ó tháinig sé in aois fir, bhí sé síorpháirteach i ngach aon eagraíocht náisiúnta lena linn.  Ba óglach calma éifeachtach é ó 1917 anuas; thuill a stuamacht agus a dhílseacht céim oifigigh ina chath dó, agus chruthaigh sé seasamhach daingean i mbroid an <Col N="57" /> chatha agus sa phríosún, mar ar chaith sé tréimhsí.  Ba thaca mór do chúis Sinn Féin ina cheantar féin é, agus bhí suim i gcónaí aige i gceist na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ón uair sin go dtí lá a bháis, ní bréag a rá gur chaith sé a shaol ar fad ag saothrú go dian ar son leasa na tíre agus leasa phobal a cheantair féin.</P>
    <P>Toghadh ina Theachta Dála é den chéad uair i 1932 do Dháilceantar na Gaillimhe, agus atoghadh é i ngach toghadh ó shoin i leith.</P>
    <P>Toghadh ar Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe i 1934 é, agus thug sé seirbhís, freisin, ar na fo-choistí éagsúla den Chomhairle sin, go mór mhór ar an gCoiste Talmhaíochta agus an gCoiste Sláinte, ar a raibh sé ina chathaoirleach.</P>
    <P>Ba fear tíre é; bhí eolas agus tuiscint faoi leith aige ar fhadhbanna agus ar riactanais mhuintir na tuaithe, agus chaith sé a dhúthracht ag saothrú gan stad le feabhas a chur ar a gcúrsaí.</P>
    <P>Nuair a ceapadh é mar Rúnaí Parlaiminte don Aire Airgeadais, thug sin deis dó ar éirim a intinne a dhíriú ar scéimeanna agus ar shlithe a chur in éifeacht a chabhródh le saol phobal na tuaithe a fheabhsú, agus ba é togha an fhir é le cúramaí na hoifige sin a chomhlíonadh mar bhí doimhin&mdash;eolas agus géar-thuiscint aige ar na cúrsaí sin ar fad.</P>
    <P>Tá fear uasal, cneasta, grámhar, imithe uainn.  Bhí gean agus meas ag gach duine air, agus is rí-mhór an chailliúint a bhás dá chairde, do mhuintir a Dháilceantair agus don tír.</P>
    <P>Iarraim ort, a Cheann Comhairle, comhbhrón croí na Dála a chur in iúl dá mhuintir.</P>
