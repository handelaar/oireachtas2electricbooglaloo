    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a number of matters to which I was anxious to refer.  One of these was the number of occasions on which Deputies who spoke to this Estimate referred to the task of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  Members of the House know, I believe, the general pattern that has been growing up in regard to that task.  In the early stages, a start was made in a small little parish down in Tipperary.  I suppose it was purely an experimental effort.  After that a good deal of thought and a good deal of discussion took place as to the areas <Col N="554" /> to be selected for an intensive approach.  The two counties selected were Clare and Sligo.  These two counties were selected because of geographical and other reasons and, with Bansha, they have been the subject of intensive treatment since then.</P>
      <P>As for the rest of the country, there was free treatment and after some time it was felt that a new approach would have to be made.  The Department came to the conclusion, again having regard to geographical factors and the incidence of the disease, that the next effort should be directed to the counties west of the Shannon, with Donegal thrown in, and that the remainder of the country should be treated on the basis of the establishment of accredited herds.</P>
      <P>This whole matter of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis is tremendously difficult.  During the course of this discussion, I think it was Deputy Sweetman who, when speaking of the meeting which took place in Kildare the other day, at which I was present, made a number of statements.  While I have no hesitation in admitting they did not represent any effort on his part to misrepresent me, they did not give a fair presentation of the position &mdash;at least as I saw it and as we see it in the Department.</P>
      <P>There was and there is the feeling, not only in this country but outside it, that a good deal of this scattered free testing effort was wasteful and was not achieving the purpose it was urgently necessary to achieve, and that the best policy would be to concentrate on clearing some particular area, be it large or small.  I must confess that that line of argument fitted in with my reasoning also.  I have no complaint to make because of other procedures which may have preceded this change because it is only natural that there will be a fair share of groping round in order to find what is the best method.  But now this course has been decided upon and I believe it is the right one.  For geographical reasons and because of the low incidence of the disease, we should concentrate on the area I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even after the making of that decision, <Col N="555" /> there are a few problems which present themselves.  We were in some doubt as to whether or not we should face the complete clearance of County Sligo or whether we should wait and attempt the complete clearance of the area I have mentioned because, when we make the decision, we will have to make other decisions that will present difficulties and impose hardships on some people.  We will have to control the movement of stock inwards.  In fact, we will have to make that decision fairly soon.  It would have been made now were it not for our desire, because of its being a matter of only a couple of months, to save as many people as possible from the hardship that decision would cause.  I refer to the movement which is always taking place&mdash; the movement of young calves from the south to the west, part of the north and north Leinster.  It was not a time of the year when one would want to clap down restrictions and cause a good deal of trouble to these people.  The time is quickly approaching when we will have to make a decision on that and some other matters.</P>
    <P>From my replies to a number of questions in Kildare, Deputy Sweetman seems to have got the impression that I was hesistant about making decisions; that I was unable to see clearly and that I was apparently incapable of making up my mind on these matters.  Whatever can be said about me, whatever charge can be made against me, I do not think that represents my form at all.  I believe that I have the capacity to make up my mind. I also feel that I have the wisdom in a case of the kind I have attempted to describe to make the necessary postponement so as to ease as many as possible of the hardships which will result from a decision of this kind.</P>
    <P>The immediate task now is the concentrated effort on that area.  I want to assure Deputy Sweetman that there will be no hesitancy or no doubts that are not justifiable, in so far as I am concerned, where decisions have to be made in regard to the achievement of that task in that area in the shortest possible space of time.  What we were thinking of, following that, was that Kildare and the effort in Kildare <Col N="556" /> seemed to fit in entirely with our thoughts in this regard.  We were thinking of encouraging farmers and others in the midlands to give us as many accredited herds as possible.</P>
    <P>Kildare proceeded to organise themselves. They had discussions with the officers of my Department and, all the herd owners, having canvassed the area, held this meeting.  I am told now&mdash;I was told then&mdash;that, as result of the announcement which I made, I killed much of the enthusiasm which existed there.  I do not think there was any justification for that.  It certainly was not my mission to kill enthusiasm; it was not my mission to mislead.  My mission entirely there was to announce as clearly as I could what we were prepared to do in regard to their efforts.  What we were prepared to do was to give them free first testing of all animals and remove reactor cows on the same basis as they are being removed from the clearance areas.  The herd owners of Kildare were then expected to follow this by carrying out tests themselves and if, after two separate tests, a particular farmer could show that the herd was clear, we would proceed to retest and accredit the farm and be responsible for an annual test afterwards.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand the attitude of many Deputies who say, &ldquo;What is the Department prepared to do for us in Kildare?  Are you not prepared to give us the same facilities as you are giving in the clearance areas west of the Shannon?&rdquo;  In the Munster counties, in the milk producing areas, you are met with the question, &ldquo;What are you prepared to do for us in the way of replacements.  Who is going to provide the replacement stock for us?&rdquo; I do not know but I think it right to say that the time has come when those whose interests are most affected and bound up in this matter&mdash;all our interests are bound up in it but those whose interests are most bound up&mdash; will have to demonstrate their seriousness.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that we were not prepared, and are not equipped at the moment, to go into the rest of the country on an intensive basis, I do not think it unreasonable <Col N="557" /> to expect the people of Kildare to take that first test from us free, to accept our gesture of purchasing from the herd owners of Kildare whatever cows were shown to be reactors on the terms and conditions on which they have been purchased in the clearance areas and to follow that up by trying to establish as best they could the highest number of accredited farms so that, when the whole area west of the Shannon came to be an accredited area, whatever store cattle were produced there, whatever percentage might be exported direct to Britain or the Six Counties or purchased as stores for further development and feeding, we would have all over the midlands, starting with Kildare&mdash; because it is Kildare that started this campaign&mdash;and hoping that it would spread to Meath and Westmeath, a chain of accredited farms to which the store cattle could be transferred and in which they would retain their immunity and the high standard to which they had been brought in the areas where they were raised, I do not know if there is any lack of clarity in that approach.  I do not see where it arises.</P>
    <P>I did say at the meeting the other night, and I would say it wherever that meeting might be held, that in inviting the herd owners of County Kildare to take what has been given to them without cost, we in the Department were not unapproachable and that if, in the course of carrying out the test, they could make suggestions that would be acceptable to us as to the manner in which that approach could be amended or improved, we would always listen to them.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the fact that it is a common occurrence to find questions emphasising the difficulties that present themselves to herd owners, whether they live in the store beef raising areas of Kildare or belong to Limerick, Cork or Kerry, where the cow population is heaviest.  In one case you are met with the query, &ldquo;Where will we get T.B. free stores?&rdquo;  In Limerick, Munster and the dairying areas, you are met with the query, &ldquo;Where will we get replacements?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Department cannot provide T.B. <Col N="558" /> free stores or replacement heifers. Suggestions have been made that farms could be purchased and taken over and that the Department itself could get into the business of breeding heifers, testing them and having them there to meet the requirements of those areas that are so heavily stricken with the incidence of the disease.  That is not serious.  Even if it were attempted, it could not be achieved to the extent of making a real, serious contribution to the replacement problem.</P>
    <P>No matter how much a Minister for Agriculture or the Department of Agriculture may preach, lecture and talk, there would still have to be, and it is vital that there should be, evidence of a serious approach on the part of those who alone can provide themselves with these replacements and T.B. free stores which is what I expected in County Kildare following their great effort in organising themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might not co-operative societies do it for their own members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that they cannot do it.  If co-operative societies can do it as a demonstration, by all means.  No matter what they do, it will still be only a very small contribution to meet what will be required in this regard.  I am not discounting anything that can result from any effort, even if it were by the State to some extent.  The State is doing, and has been doing for a number of years, this kind of thing in a very small way. With regard to this mental attitude, &ldquo;What will we do for this and what will we do for that?&rdquo;, expecting the Department to be able to solve that problem, I am trying to make it quite clear that it cannot be done.  If it is not done on some other basis, I can see no hope of its being done in any reasonable period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of this discussion Deputy Dillon invited me to deal with one matter.  However much I would prefer to let the whole business pass, the words in which the invitation was couched tempt me to respond.  Shortly after I came into this office, the need <Col N="559" /> arose to review certain matters.  One of these was how we stood in relation to the provision of what is known as the double byre grant.  I asked for all the papers in connection with it. I sought, as all Ministers do, the assistance of the officials in my Department.  I reviewed the whole background to this question.  I saw what had been done and I agree 100 per cent. with what Deputy Dillon has stated here in this invitation to me.  So much do I agree with it that I have already placed this exact same view on the records of this House, that is, that no Minister should in a deliberative assembly, or outside it, start to whine about what his predecessor did in the way of making a decision that is reversible by him.  I accept that fully if it is a reversible decision.  If it is a decision that cannot be reversed then you simply have to put up with it and say to yourself: &ldquo;I would not have done it that way myself if I had the power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I saw the decision that had been reached in regard to this matter. Having studied every line of it very carefully.  I agreed wholeheartedly with what had been done.  As a result of that agreement on my part, an announcement was made; following that announcement I was invited down to County Kerry to meet the members of the Committee of Agriculture there. One of the items on the agenda for that meeting was the abandonment of the double byre grant.  Naturally I would prefer if the Deputies opposite believed me but I am not going over this litany merely for the sake of inducing them to believe me if they do not want to.  But I went down to that meetings knowing that that was one of the items on the agenda and I am quite sure, although I did not see them, that the local papers there will confirm that in the course of my discussion with the members of that committee on that question, I never once mentioned the fact that this matter had been considered by anybody other than myself.</P>
    <P>I took that line because of what I have already stated, that no publicity <Col N="560" /> had been given and that it was a decision made that was reversible if I wanted to reverse it.  I did not want to.  That was my own decision and I defended it on that basis.  When the change came as far as this attitude was concerned it came at Parliamentary Question Time.  Even though, in supplementary questions and further remarks directed to me by Deputy Dillon, he indicated that I was misleading the House, that I was not truthful, and so on, I did not feel any way hurt about it, because I know that, as he has stated, it could not be expected that a Minister leaving a Department even for six months, a Department such as Agriculture where you are signing documents and plunging through papers every day, could be in a position after that length of time to say: &ldquo;This is what happened here, and that is what happened there,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have a clear recollection of this.&rdquo; I have a fairly good memory myself and I know I could not do that.  When Deputy Dillon was confronted with my reply to his supplementary, I suppose it gave him a bit of a shock and his first reaction was to say: &ldquo;I never did that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To me that was understandable, but let me say here and now that I have been in more Departments than this and I have been served by officials of these Departments just as these officials serve other Ministers, and I have always admired the attitude of the senior officials, because it is mostly these with whom the Minister is dealing. After a change of Government you know how suspicious we all might be inclined to be about things that might have happened.  You might see some decision and you might just fall for the wrong sort of conclusion.  This kind of situation has not arisen for me very often but to whatever extent it has occurred I have never known a State official in any of these Departments in which I have served who did not make it clear to me&mdash;irrespective of their own inward feelings about which you would know nothing and would not want to know anything&mdash;as to how this happened, as to how that happened, and so on.  I do not like to &ldquo;plaster&rdquo; officials.  What they do is their duty. <Col N="561" /> They are men who get to the top on merit; they serve all Governments and all Ministers, but the public outside do not realise how hard they work and the credit that is due to them.  I want to say that, although I do not want to give the impression I am just plastering them.</P>
    <P>I served in this Department for a short time before, and some of the people who have been serving other Ministers since are there now.  Does any Deputy think that I would dig up or attempt to dig up documents in relation to a decision to prove something against some man to who preceded me in office which these officials would know was untrue, inaccurate and incorrect?  Even if they were never there to keep me on the dotted line I would not do it.  I am not doing it now and I have not done it.  I hear Deputies&mdash;I suppose it happens on my own side also&mdash;rushing to the defence of a Minister or rushing to the defence of a former Minister in some matters concerning which they could not possibly know anything.  I heard a former Minister say here that this question I had mooted here never came before the Cabinet.  I never said it did.</P>
    <P>I heard other Deputies on the Fine Gael benches rising to the defence with great vehemence.  I suppose if I were accused Deputies on this side would come to my rescue also without knowing the facts fully and I am prepared to admit that this matter that I have been discussing for some considerable time would only be completely understood by a person who is immediately in contact with the file and the relevant documents.  Only such a person would know what is happening.  Do not let it be said that I am trying to shirk my duties or hide behind anybody's decision.</P>
    <P>I shall show how this arose as far as I am concerned.  In the Official Report, Volume 165, column 649, we find under the heading &ldquo;Cow Byre Grants&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. E. Rooney asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state (a) why the amount of the grant available per cow in respect of the <Col N="562" /> construction of cow byres has been reduced, particularly having regard to the importance of the bovine tuberculosis scheme, and (b) the amount of such grants paid since the scheme for the payment of a double grant was commenced.</P>
    <P>Mr. Smith: Because I find myself with a commitment of £3,000,000 in respect of applications for these double byre grants which cannot be disposed of for a considerable time, I cannot accept further commitments. I have, however, decided that the grant payable for repairs to byres, will in future be the full approved estimated labour cost of repairs subject to a maximum equivalent to three-fifths of the appropriate grant for a new byre.  This is double the rate of grant for repairs payable up to now.</P>
    <P>A sum of £645,100 has been paid up to 31st January, 1958, in respect of double grants.</P>
    <P>Mr. O.J. Flanagan: Having regard to the statement made by the Minister that he is considering resigning, is he in a position to tell the House when he will reach a favourable decision and resign?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That had not much to do with cow byre grants.  The report continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon: Bearing in mind the supreme importance of an expeditious realisation of the tuberculosis eradication scheme in cattle, would the Minister not reconsider his decision, especially as the liability in respect of these double byre grants does not come in course of payment until the herd has attained an attested status?  Though his present liability may appear very large, as it does not come in course of payment until each new herd has attained attested status, the probability of the charge falling on any one year is remote in the extreme.</P>
    <P>Mr. Smith: That is a supplementary question on which I could make a very long speech but I do not propose to do so.  In fact, it is not a decision made by me at all because my very good friend and former Minister, Deputy James Dillon; in January, 1957, decided <Col N="563" /> that the double byre grant should be abandoned.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>I heard a good deal of talk about <Col N="564" /> milk prices and the reduction of them and, just as in the case of some other subjects that were discussed here, the talk and the criticism came from rather surprising sources.  Shortly before I came in to reply I heard a Deputy here last night say that the announcement in regard to milk prices would result in a reduction of 1½d. a gallon.  I would suggest to that Deputy that there is no purpose, not even a political purpose, to be served by saying that when he must know that the reduction would not be more than half that amount.  I wonder what interest will be served by a statement of that kind?  I cannot think of any.</P>
    <P>I also heard Deputy Dillon talk of all the decisions that had been made in recent times that would affect milk producers and producers of wheat, bacon and barley.  But how does a former Minister for Agriculture think that kind of criticism will go down with people whose memories surely serve them to the extent of being able to recall his own attitude at a time that was entirely different, so far as milk was concerned, from the present time?  We scarcely had the taste of New Zealand and Danish butter out of our mouths when Deputy Dillon proposed to the farmers that they should take a shilling a gallon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The people outside, especially the dairy farmers, will agree I am telling the truth when I say that such a proposal was made for acceptance by the creamery organisation by the then Minister in a letter he issued on the subject and in the speech he made in Dungarvan.  That proposal was made at a time when we were having butter imported from New Zealand and Denmark.  What do the members of the Fine Gael Party think they are likely to achieve by talking about butter and milk prices as they have been for the past two or three days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I do know. There has been evidence for the past 30 years.  That is a good enough test, even for spirits.  That evidence shows that the people do not trust you or believe you, and I believe they are using their intelligence in coming to that conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> When I came into this office ten or 11 years ago shortly after the war the removal of many of the restrictions which had operated during the war enabled me to consider the circumstances of the milk producers.  They know that I understood their circumstances and made a case to the Government to secure a reasonable improvement for them.  I do not want to be shouting this from the house tops, but they know it is a fact.  No matter how you try to paint the picture otherwise they will not believe you.  It is because of their confidence that there was really no outcry against my approach to the present situation in regard to our butter surplus.</P>
    <P>I am not so sensitive that I mind the Opposition criticising my policy.  I have no hesitation in going to Limerick, Cork or Kerry and defending myself with the greatest of ease.  I do not want the Fine Gael Party, which has been on the border of extermination from one year to another, to be using arguments which only tend to further discredit and weaken them.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Estimate I made clear our position in regard to other problems which have arisen concerning our butter surplus.  The New Zealand Government, the British Farmers' Union and the Butter Marketing Board made an application concerning our butter surplus as well as that of two other countries.  The British have considered that application and we have presented our case. In reply to a question in the House of Commons they conveyed their decision, so far.  We have been invited to further discussions with them and these will take place.  I do not think it would be useful for me to make any further comment on the matter at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister but would it be reasonable to ask him&mdash;I do not press him to go beyond what he has already said if he thinks it better not to&mdash;whether our position under Articles 4 and 5 and Section G of the Annex to the 1948 Trade Agreement will be energetically pressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say if there is <Col N="567" /> any document in existence, whether it be the 1948 Agreement or the 1938 Agreement, containing any evidence useful to us in establishing a case&mdash; and I think it can easily be established &mdash;you can take it from me we shall avail fully of it.</P>
      <P>Last night I was speaking about the importance of expert advice.  When I was in this Department in 1947 the first artificial insemination station was being established at Ballyclough Creamery.  The experts of my Department, with all due respect to them, were very sceptical of that proposal. In fact, they cold shouldered it to such an extent that none of them would even visit the place.  I decided to go and see it myself.  Following that visit it became necessary to introduce a Bill here to control the activities of artificial insemination stations and ensure they would be supervised only by proper persons.</P>
      <P>We were discussing wheat last night. I remember in that year, too, there were grassland experts who pointed out to me that if one broke up a certain swarth, it would take 30 years to restore it to its original condition. That was one of the arguments advanced against compelling people to till.  I was no time out of the Department when the whole tune changed. One would think that I never had any enthusiasm at all or interest in artificial insemination.  One would not think now that, in relation to the grassland problem, the experts ever took the line or gave the advice that I have just recounted to the House.  I do not think it is one bit of harm to put that factual story briefly on the records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one disappointing thing that I see about this cattle breeding business, and I have no deep prejudice for or against any particular breeds, is that the people do not seem to want to help themselves.  Now, I am quite prepared to accept whatever the majority desire. Those who are interested in milk production and the breeding of store cattle will have to wake up and realise that, unless they breed for themselves, nobody else will do it.  In the fairs and markets with which I am familiar, even <Col N="568" /> in areas where it was possible with one's eyes shut to buy young Shorthorn heifers, it is now just not possible to buy them to-day.  There are herefords and Polled Angus and all the rest of them, but there are no Shorthorns.</P>
    <P>The artificial insemination stations all over the country certainly meet this problem in a very special way, but the worst of it is that in matters like this everybody leaves something that should be done to somebody else, and somebody else leaves it to the other fellow, and the other fellow leaves it to someone else.  Nobody does anything and finally one gets to the stage when nothing at all is done.  At the moment they talk about Herefords and Polled Angus, but no animal is as dear at the present time as the small Shorthorn heifer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I would prefer if they were more plentiful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But the way to make them plentiful is to keep the price up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One can go too far east as well as too far west.  Many farmers will not buy a Shorthorn bull because they know that they will be more or less isolated and, unless their own herds are very large, the expenditure is not justifiable.  Artificial insemination comes to the rescue there.  As I say, I have no special prejudices. I accept fully what the public do, but I recommend very strongly the breeding of more replacements.  Not only do I believe it will be a good thing, but I believe it will be a paying thing. There will be the double-barrelled inducement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  References were made here to the activities of the Marketing Committee and the small amount of money spent.  The comments were fairly critical.  Deputies know, of course, that a long period elapsed before the composition of the board was finally determined.  It is not easy to get people to serve on a board like that.  I was Minister when <Col N="569" /> the first meeting took place and in the course of my remarks to the board, without claiming to have any special knowledge of the difficulties confronting them or the task assigned to them, I told them: &ldquo;The task we ask you to undertake is a very difficult one and, as far as I am concerned, I want to rest assured that if, as a result of your labours, you contribute anything of tangible value, you will have justified your being set up.  Do not think I do not appreciate the difficulty of the task assigned to you. I know you will be criticised.  Big things will be expected from you and we who are close to you, realise that the problems with which you have to deal and in relation to which you will be expected to make recommendations are tremendously difficult.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amount of money spent so far has not been large.  If the occasion arises that they have to spend, the money will be there and will be freely available to them.  The sub-committees that have been set up to deal with specific problems have been working very, very energetically.  These people are working voluntarily and, whether they succeed or fail, their contribution will be substantial in the way of time and I would not like them to think there was nobody to say a word in their defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister covered a very wide ground.  I should like to ask him if he has had time to consider two matters which I drew to his attention.  Can he give us any further information about this systematic remedy for warble fly which was part of his exhibit at the R.D.S. Show? Secondly, does the Minister propose to extend the parish plan beyond the region where it is at present operating, or has he any alternative plan for increasing the availability of technical advice for farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot give the Deputy any information on the first question.  I have seen the result of the experiment.  I think the Deputy has addressed parliamentary questions to me on this matter.  I just cannot tell the nature of the reply.  It is a very technical matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister happen to know if the drug or the drench used in that experiment is now available in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say; I am told it is not.  As to the parish plan and my intentions in regard to increasing the advisory services, I have not yet had time to give much thought to all these matters.  I do not hesitate to say that I believe in the provision of the fullest possible advice on all technical matters and subjects.  There is one thing I am always doubtful about, and its effect, and there is one line on which I think it is not serviceable to get ahead of public thought and public demand.  However much or however well many people may be qualified to advise and encourage and help the farmers, the worst and the most demoralising thing is to have many officials loose through the country, if there is not a full demand for their services.  It is very difficult for them to create the demand for advice unless it originates with the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of the parish plan and the supervision of <Col N="571" /> those who have been employed on the parish plan.  I have seen one example only where it was necessary to make certain inquiries as to the activities of a parish agent.  The amount of time and money that was lost in that, the amount of racing up and down from Dublin to and from that parish in that part of the country and the overlapping of services as between the county committee of agriculture and the parish agents created an unfavourable impression in my mind.</P>
    <P>I have not, then, given this matter all the thought which I suppose it would require.  The policy to be <Col N="572" /> pursued is very important.  It is essential that we should provide and encourage all the advisory services we can but we must not allow ourselves to get ahead of the demand.  If we do, it means we have parish agents, officials of county committees of agriculture, land improvement officials, land drainage officials, housing inspectors of one kind or another and so on.  To my mind, all these add up to a good deal of confusion and overlapping, to a good deal of waste of time and effort and to a good deal of assisting in the creation of an impression in the public mind that is objectionable from every point of view.</P>

The more I study the amendments, the more it appears to me their purpose is much wider.  It seems to me the whole principle of gathering the rod licence money into one central fund and distributing it to the boards of conservators has now gone.</P>

      <P>The debate on the Committee Stage centred in the main around the reimposition of the salmon export levy and the introduction of increased licence duties on fishing engines.  The additional revenue to be raised by these measures and credited to the Salmon Conservancy Fund is required to pay for improved protection services which I am urging boards of conservators throughout the country to provide and is also to be applied towards the cost of improvement schemes whereby it is hoped that the yield of the salmon fisheries may be materially increased.  I have shown that the additional charges required to feed the Salmon Conservancy Fund for these essential purposes are not unreasonable and I am satisfied that the salmon industry as a whole recognises the justice of the case that they should contribute in this manner.  Arguments were put forward from both sides of <Col N="575" /> the House to the effect that a rod licence duty of £4 would bear with undue severity on the angler who fished only in the rivers in his own district.  I may say that a few of the boards of conservators have made much the same point in commenting on the Bill.  I gave an undertaking on Committee Stage to look further into this matter and I am now bringing in a series of amendments, the adoption of which will I think go a long way towards meeting these representations.</P>
      <P>There are 24 amendments in all, and, with the exception of No. 6, all the amendments have to do with provisions for rod licences available in the district of issue only.  The main provisions making this change are the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 provides for an additional class of salmon rod licence, namely, a salmon rod (annual) (district) ordinary licence issuable for a year and available for use in the district of issue only.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 12 brings in a salmon rod (late season) (district) licence.  Amendment No. 8 which is ancillary to Amendment No. 12 is enabling in form, that is to say, that licences of this class will be issuable by a board of conservators only when enabled to do so by Order of the Minister.  This is in effect the same procedure as at present applies in regard to licences issuable after 1st July, and it is necessary to preserve this form as licences of this class have to be issued with due regard to the type of fishing prevailing in the district in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 24 adds to the Second Schedule the two additional classes of salmon rod licence with appropriate licence duties, namely, £2 for the district licence available for the whole year and £1 for the district licence available for six months from the 1st July.  These are the existing rates for the corresponding types of rod licence at present.  It is my intention to increase the £2 licence available in the district of issue only by 50 per cent. by Order under Section 15 and not by 100 per cent. as in the case of other licences, as the holder will not <Col N="576" /> have the right which he at present enjoys of obtaining endorsement licences at 10/- each enabling him to fish in other fishery districts.  The £1 fee for late season licences available in the districts of issue only will be liable to the general 100 per cent. increase. A licence duty of £10 s. will be fixed by Order for payment by the holder of a Foyle area salmon rod licence who wishes to take out a district licence under Section 15 as extended by Amendment No. 22.</P>
    <P>The remaining amendments, with the exception of No. 6, are ancillary to or consequential on the amendments just described.  As to the exception, No. 6, this is merely a drafting amendment to give more comprehensive effect to the provision in sub-section (9) (a) of Section 8 extending the purposes for which moneys may be paid out of the Salmon Conservancy Fund.  As amended, the provision will enable the Minister to pay out of the fund &ldquo;such sums towards the expenses incurred in connection with any scheme for the improvement of the inland fisheries as the Minister thinks proper.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As a result of these changes, there will be some short fall in the revenue which I anticipated would find its way back to the boards of conservators and I shall have to examine, in the light of experience, the effect of the comparatively small fall of revenue.  We can always review the financial situation at a later date.  As I already indicated, our officers are going around among the boards examining the whole position of waterkeepers, what can be done to assist them and what improvements may be affected in various rivers to improve salmon spawning and salmon stocks.  We are asking the boards to co-operate with us in making use of the increased subventions they will get as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the boards of conservators have taken a very reasonable view of the general proposal to increase rod licences.  Of the 17 boards, three met and made no comment at all; seven approved but asked that there be a district licence, saying that the licence of £4 was too high for a great many types of anglers and for the man who fished only in his own district, <Col N="577" /> and that there should be a district licence such as is provided for in these Report Stage amendments.  Apart from that, they recognised in general the need to secure more revenue for water-keeping purposes.</P>
    <P>Some of the anglers' associations protested against the increase of rod licences, but the Salmon Anglers' Federation, while asking for a compromise in the form of a district licence, made no other antagonistic comment. These amendments are really a result of the privilege I have that the Minister for Finance has not got, in that I present a budget of expenses for the boards of conservators; I receive complaints from the Opposition and from members of my own Party and I am enabled to make a compromise between the Committee and the Report Stages. The compromise is in the form of issuing a district licence available for fishing only in one area.</P>
    <P>If I may, I will now read to the House the proposed duties that will come into operation in 1959.  They will be: £4 for an ordinary annual licence available for all districts; £3, an increase of £1 on the previous licence, for an annual district ordinary licence for fishing only in one district; a seven-day licence available in all districts of £1; a 21-day licence available for all districts of £3; a salmon rod late season licence, after 1st July, available in all districts, of £3 and a salmon rod late season licence which has again to be with my permission, because of the difficulty that might arise in certain areas when the whole of the main season of fishing is after 1st July; and a district licence of £2.</P>
    <P>That is the total array of licences. It can be said that they have received the general support of the boards of conservators.  I cannot say the absolute support, but the board of conservators recognised the need for increases and asked me to consider what I could do in the way of providing a district licence available only for a particular district.  I have done so and I should like to feel that I had the consent of the House as a whole as this is a genuine effort to compromise between the previous decision and a <Col N="578" /> position in which I could forsee no possibility of finding sufficient revenue for the operations of the boards of conservators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that these amendments are being introduced as a result of a row between Deputy O'Malley and the Minister, in the course of which the Minister told Deputy O'Malley that he was talking sentimental nonsense.  Deputy O'Malley said that he threw those words back in the Minister's face and that the Minister could not talk to him in that way. I believe that there was a row in the Fianna Fáil room and that now the Minister is running for cover as best he can.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the Minister comes in as with some marvellous gesture, as some kind of superman.  The truth is that Deputy O'Malley has him on the run and somebody said to the Minister: &ldquo;You had better back pedal. You cannot tell your Deputies they are talking sentimental nonsense.  You better try to pacify him.&rdquo;  I suppose he is in process of being pacified now. The Minister has enough trouble on his hands, without having Deputy O'Malley on his hands, too, and if he is unloading him as a result of this operation, I do not blame him.  He has my sympathy.  The Minister has a passion for dropping bricks, and if he was not so full of himself, he would not drop so many bricks.  If he drops bricks on Deputy O'Malley in certain circumstances, Deputy O'Malley is prone to react energetically.  That is largely the reason why we have these 24 amendments before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not concerned with the row between the Minister and Deputy O'Malley, but the Minister presents these amendments to the House as his <Col N="579" /> reactions as Minister for Fisheries to the necessity of enriching the conservators' funds.  That is all eye-wash.  There is not one penny of this money designed to increase the resources of the conservators' funds.  Every penny of these increased charges will go in relief of the Exchequer.  Every year that I was in office, and that my predecessor was in office, such funds as it was necessary to make available to supplement the revenue accruing to the boards of conservators from rates and rod licences were provided from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Why was that decided upon?  I want to tell the House that the proposals in this Bill, of doubling the salmon rod licence and raising the cost of fishing generally, were pressed on me year after year when I was Minister for Fisheries.  I turned them down year after year by explaining to the Minister for Finance that, in my opinion, the tourist attractions which we had to offer in this country were limited.  We had no bright lights and no exotic entertainment such as is available in Paris.  We had not got the night life of London and we had not the climate of the Mediterranean but we had certain amenities here which were not available, so far as I knew, anywhere else in the world.  One of those amenities, I explained, was cheap fishing.</P>
    <P>Now that salmon fishing and sea trout fishing in Scotland and Great Britain have become furiously expensive and are available now only to people in the millionaire class, I explained that I wanted to build up, in the tourist world, the idea that we had here in Ireland not only fishing that you could rent at a reasonable rent from proprietors, but we had what I do not believe exists in other parts of Europe, large areas of free fishing, and that a man who came here was not expected to pay immense licences fees, and that only a nominal fee was payable in respect of a salmon rod, so that we could offer a certain very desirable type of tourist amenity that no other country in the world was in a position to offer at the present time.  I said that if you wanted to <Col N="580" /> sell that idea, you had to label it clearly and obviously as cheap fishing.</P>
    <P>I think it is utter folly, for the sake of the relatively insignificant revenue that will be derived from this, to double the salmon rod licence.  We are granting to An Bord Fáilte, £400,000 annually and I am bound to say that An Bord Fáilte, recognising the value of fisheries when I approached them, agreed with me, and have agreed since with the present Minister to embark on a five year programme to which An Bord Fáilte will devote part of their funds, for the development of brown trout and coarse fishing.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister brings a good deal of trouble on his own head by talking about all the peregrinations and peripatetic inspection he is going to carry on to improve the service of water beiliffs and look after the rivers better than they were looked after before.  You would imagine that until Deputy Erskine Childers turned up in 3 Upper O'Connell Street, the Department of Fisheries was in a state of chronic somnolence; that they never stirred out or did a hand's turn until he arrived to excite everybody.  What in the name of goodness does the Minister imagine the Department of Fisheries has been doing for the past 20 years except to try to improve boards of conservators, the Fishery Laws and bring things up to date? That was largely done by the immense Fishery Consolidation Bill that was brought into this House and is still in the process of passing through this House.  The process of attempting the improvement of the supervision of fishing is a constant process but anyone who has any knowledge of the problem knows that there is nothing you can do by peripatetic inspection or anything of that kind.  It is very largely a matter of winning the support of the local people through the supervisory activities.</P>
    <P>One of the great arguments I always used or sought to use with the Minister for Fisheries was that the poorest creature is in a position to fish for trout and he need not pay any licence. People can fish for salmon on the payment of £2.  The view was pressed on <Col N="581" /> me strongly that I ought to put a licence on trout fishing.  I always argued that if we cannot get the local people to regard this amenity as their own you will never get the local co-operation you must have if you are to arrest the worst abuses of poaching.</P>
    <P>I think that the whole idea of increasing the salmon rod licence is all wrong.  The Minister says that a great many boards of conservators do it. Of course they do.  Who is on the boards of conservators?  Everybody on the boards of conservators is a died-in-the-wool salmon fisher.  These are the men to whom an extra £1 or £2 on the licence makes very little difference because they are at it all the time.  If you catch a great many salmon in the year and sell them at the present prices ruling, £1 or £2 makes very little difference.  Such people feel that the fewer people who fish for salmon the more pleased they are, because more of the river is left for their exclusive enjoyment.</P>
    <P>Human nature says if you are an enthusiastic salmon fisher the fewer rods on that river the better pleased you are but it is a short-sighted policy. I would much sooner see a multitude of rods legitimately fishing than a small select coterie of rods on the river in daytime and an army of poachers on the same river every night.  If you keep the people off the river and make them feel that the river is the prerogative of a small privileged coterie in their vicinity, we have got to face the fact that our people, being what they are, if they cannot do it legitimately by day, will have a very strong tendency to go out and do it illegitimately by night.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think this whole idea of making it more expensive to fish in this country is wrong and foolish and the gain is not worth the candle.  To my mind it is dishonest for the Minister for Lands to make the case to this House that this money is designed to supplement conservancy funds.  He knows it is not true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hold your horses.  Note the Minister concedes that the provision this year from the Exchequer is £6,000 where it used to be £14,000. Say what you like, when you have those figures before you, am I right or wrong in saying that these increased rod licences are going in relief of the Exchequer?  The boards of conservators will get £14,000 from these two sources.  Before this, they got the £14,000 from the Exchequer.  Who will it benefit&mdash;the boards of conservators or the Exchequer?  I think it is complete imbecility, for the sake of relieving the Exchequer to the tune of £8,000, to get the reputation of doubling the cost of the salmon rod licence. Four pounds for a licence is a pretty stiff charge to make in rural Ireland. The Minister seeks to meet that, as a result of the ruckus with Deputy O'Malley, by reducing it to £3 for a local area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tries to bring in an entirely new element.  He intervened to say that the boards of conservators were going to get money from Bord Fáilte.  I do not think they are.  I think that the Inland Fisheries Trust is getting assistance from Bord Fáilte under the five-year development scheme.  That was agreed before the Minister came into office.  This is not all because this is not the only charge that is being raised from fish in relief of the Exchequer.  Over and above the increased rod licences, the Minister has <Col N="583" /> introduced a levy of 2d. per lb. on all salmon exported.  He wants to persuade the House that that is going to boards of conservators.  It is not going to boards of conservators.  It is going in relief of the Exchequer and it is a rotten bad principle.  It is not true to say that the bulk of the salmon bearing that levy of 2d. for a lb. is salmon caught on the rivers of Ireland.  It is not caught on the rivers of Ireland.  It is caught by poor fishermen in the estuary and outside the estuary.  It is a very arduous, doubtful and difficult form of earning a living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has chosen to change.  There is no point in bringing in a Bill on one basis on Second Stage, then changing the basis&mdash;not on Committee Stage but on Report&mdash;and then not allowing the House to discuss the new proposal.  I do not believe the House is apprised of the true facts of the situation.  I believe the bulk of Deputies accept the proposition that all this extra subvention is being raised to strengthen the position of the boards of conservators and increase their resources for the protection of the fisheries.  I want to say that there is not a word of truth in it.  All this extra money is being raised from poor fishermen in the estuaries, from rod licences in the country, in relief of the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it to this House that <Col N="584" /> they are travelling the wrong road. Our line here should be that we offer the public at home&mdash;and, as a result thereof, demand the co-operation of our own people in the protection of the fisheries&mdash;abundant fishing of good quality on terms that the humblest citizen can afford.  Secondly, our objective should be in the sphere of tourism to proclaim to the world that we can offer in many cases free game fishing here at the cheapest rates available in any country in the world.  This Bill and all the policy that the Minister is advocating are moving steadily away from these two objectives.</P>
    <P>If that course is continued, two evils will ensue.  If you make legitimate fishing too expensive for our own people, you will promote poaching and you will build up public sympathy with the poaching and that is the very thing we should try not to do.  Secondly, if we get the reputation of raising our charges for fishing the moment we have some success in drawing fishing tourists to this country, we lose that most valuable element in our potential tourist income.  Surely they are not so crazy, when the matter involved is a few thousand pounds, to follow this course.</P>
    <P>I observe that here the Minister is taking some step in the direction of reducing his proposals to charge £4 in respect of licences and to make some such licences available for £3 but, in my opinion, the whole principle on which this design of increasing licences is based is wrong and will lead to great evils.</P>
    <P>What I deprecate most strongly is that the Minister for Lands has consistently sought to convince the House that the increased revenues to be raised hereby are designed to strengthen the boards of conservators, when I say, and the figures prove, that the primary purpose, both of the salmon levy and of this increased charge on rods, is to relieve the Exchequer of the burden it bore during my period of administration and during the period of my predecessor's administration.</P>
    <P>I believe our policy was right.  I believe that Exchequer expenditure was prudent.  I believe it yielded a splendid return and I believe that the effort to <Col N="585" /> discharge the Exchequer from that liability at this cost is a most ill-considered and imprudent departure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I leave it to the Minister to reply to Deputy Dillon's point, but there is one point that occurs to me.  In the Limerick conservators area, the main impost, as I pointed out on the last occasion this Bill was before the House, is not the rod licence charge, which is not unreasonable, even at £3, but the charge which the E.S.B. levy on anglers in the area, which was £10 up to last year and which was to be raised to £25 this season, but for the fact that, due to the most unusual procedure of asking licence owners to vote as to whether or not they wanted the increase, the E.S.B. suggestion was turned down and temporarily, at least, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Limerick district, the position therefore arises that you have the estate agent and the conservators' agent demanding from the fishermen two licence fees, one for £10 and now one for £3.  I do not know if that apertains to any other section in the country.  In the case of the E.S.B. having control over the Shannon fisheries, I do not think that licences should apply at all.  The arguments put forward by Deputy Dillon with <Col N="587" /> regard to the ordinary sporting angler applies more strongly in the case of the Limerick angler than to anglers in any other area in the country.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Dillon's point that, if we cannot provide the bright lights of paris and London, we should as an alternative provide tourists with cheap rod licences at the expense of our taxpayers.  After all, the funds of the Exchequer are provided by thousands of small taxpayers who never had the opportunity or desire to fish.  Even if we had, Deputy Dillon's own suggestion, that the increase in the levy on the export of salmon and the increased cost of rod licences does help to relieve the Exchequer, by which we mean the taxpayer, of some of the overhead cost it carries, I do not see that that is a bad principle.  I do not see why the unfortunate taxpayers should be asked to provide by far the cheapest fishing in Europe for tourists.</P>
    <P>This country provides far greater amenities and attractions for the type of tourist that comes here than the bright lights of Paris or the night clubs of London.  If we are to approach it from the point that our alternative is to provide cheap rod fishing licences, I would rather do without that type of tourist.  We should strike a fair balance between what the taxpayer provides in assistance in the development of fisheries and providing sport at a reasonable cost in the first instance to our own people at home and also to the tourists.  If the Minister can strike a fair balance, I shall be glad to support it.  It is completely wrong to say the Exchequer should be called to to provide ridiculously cheap fishing just in order to boast about it as an alternative to the bright lights of Paris.</P>

      <P>This amendment would seem to outlaw the small angler and make fishing a hobby of the idle rich and the wealthy class.  Eventually, if the Minister goes on as he has been going, before a man can flick a rod it will cost him at least £8.  Now he will not be allowed to flick that rod without paying a fee of £4 to the Minister afterwards. I have a protest from the Galway and Corrib Anglers' Association <Col N="588" /> proprietors of the Oughterard Hatchery, the largest brown trout hatchery in Ireland, from which over 500,000 trout try are turned out annually for Lough Corrib.  This is an association which has done more for fishing in the West than any of the Departments over the years.  They say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We, the members of the above association, representing over 100 anglers in the Galway area, resent most vehemently the proposal of the Minister for Lands to increase the current salmon licence fee from £2 to £4.</P>
      <P>The case made by the Minister is that the increased charge is offset by the fact that this new charge of £4 will apply to any area in the Republic as compared with the existing system, whereby the basic licence fee is £2 for any one area, but an additional fee of 10/- has to be paid if the angler moves from one area of conservation to another.  For example, a local Galway angler takes out a £2 licence for the Galway area.  If he wishes to fish for salmon or sea trout in the Connemara area, he must take out a supplementary licence costing 10/-; and if he wishes to fish in Donegal he must take out a further supplementary licence costing 10/-, and so on.</P>
      <P>The normal resident Galway angler is confined entirely to his own area throughout the fishing season; the only free salmon fishing available for him is in Lough Corrib.  His work and his purse confine him to Lough Corrib.  He is not concerned, because he cannot, with fishing in other areas of conservation.</P>
      <P>The anglers who avail of supplementary licences are a wealthy class who can afford the leisure and money to fish the country from end to end. The increased charge of £4 will make salmon fishing cheaper for this class of angler, but the run-of-the-mill angler&mdash;the angler who can least afford it&mdash;is being penalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Few local anglers will pay a £4 licence on the off-chance of killing the odd salmon on Lough Corrib and the net result will be to turn the decent and poorer angler into a poacher and <Col N="589" /> the local board of conservators will suffer the loss of £2 per local angler.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As I explained on Second Stage, when Deputy Dillon was not present, the object in securing increased revenue for the boards, apart from whatever gift the Minister can make, was to ensure the future preservation of the boards.  In connection with an industry such as the salmon industry, it is very important that there should be a permanent source of revenue, independent of the particular views of the Minister for Finance of the day; and it will be easier for any Minister for Lands to secure such extra revenue as he requires from the Minister for Finance in the form of a Grant-in-Aid or as a contribution to the work of the Inland Fisheries Trust where it improves game fishing, or as a contribution to An Bord Fáilte for the provision of publicity and other amenities for salmon anglers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is better to rely on the Minister for Finance for additional sums over and beyond the normal needs of the boards of conservators.  I have said that with absolute sincerity and I am absolutely convinced we will be proved <Col N="590" /> right in the long run.  There would be additional revenue of some £14,000 were it not for the short fall of revenue which will be occasioned by the amendments put in on the Report Stage of the Bill, which will reduce slightly the rod licence revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>By how much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>By about £3,000 or £4,000.  There would have been between £13,000 and £14,000 more total income payable after allowing for the actual reduction in the grant made under this head by the Minister for Finance.  The revenue we anticipate would be received in 1959-60 when these licences come into operation is based on the assumption that the same conditions exist as existed in 1956-57 from the point of view of the actual sport of salmon fishing; and one has to make an assumption obviously in making an estimate.  The total revenue would be £80,000 as compared with £66,000 odd in the financial year 1956-57.</P>
      <P>In regard to the other observations made, I should like to commend Deputy Russell for what he said. Salmon fishing in Ireland is still by far the cheapest of any country in Europe and the fees payable both to owners and to boards of conservators are very much lower than in any other part of Europe.  In particular, in England and Scotland, the fees are far higher.  This Bill is asking anglers, whether rich or poor, to pay, in a great many cases, the equivalent of not more than the cost of 3¼ lb. weight of salmon at the average price received for salmon last year.  It surely is not a very great impost.  An additional fee of £1 for a district licence equivalent to about 3¼ lb. weight of salmon is really not excessive.  I think Deputies should be reasonable in agreeing that that is not an excessive impost to place on the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that salmon at certain times of the year is very much dearer than 6/3 &mdash; it goes up to 12/- 15/- or even 18/- per lb.  For the local man who fishes and for whom it is only a part-time sport at week-ends, the impost is not very much greater.  He need only get 3¼ lb. more salmon and he has paid the extra licence.  If he fishes <Col N="591" /> after July 1st, for example sea-trout fishing, he has only to pay £2.</P>
    <P>The facts are that these rod licence fees go back to 1925 when salmon was 1/8 per lb., but it is now 6/3 or more. Adjustments of taxation of every kind have been required to compensate the boards and the State, incidentally, for the decline in the value of money.  As I indicated on the Second Stage of the Bill, if you allow for the fall in the value of money, the revenue accruing to the boards of conservators was £3,000 less on the figure of £69,000 in a recent year than it should have been to compensate for the fall in the value of money since 1939, in spite of the great increase in salmon fishery rates and in spite of whatever grants have been made available by Governments from time to time.</P>
    <P>I do not think I am putting an impossible impost on the industry.  I do not believe this is a grievous burden to be carried by rod fishermen who fish in their own district now that we have made this provision for district licences.  I believe that the industry should carry its own impost to the greatest degree possible and that the Minister for Finance should make such extra contributions as he can.  I do not believe that the present Minister for Finance will be slow to give extra contributions if such are required for the general capital development of the industry.</P>
    <P>We know there will be a net increase of nearly £10,000 to the boards, assuming all things are equal in relation to the success of the salmon fishing next year as compared with recent years&mdash; one has to make that assumption.  That will be an increase which is very badly needed.</P>

We differ fundamentally and we shall not agree about it, but that is what Parliaments are for, I suppose.  I object strenuously to the whole scheme.  I think it is wrong, shortsighted and unrealistic. I believe Deputy O'Malley agrees with me, but I doubt if I could get him to come into the Lobby with me even if I challenged a division.  I saw some Fianna Fáil Deputies trotting into the Lobby to-day to support reductions in the price of wheat, pigs and barley and after that I almost despair of callling a division.  If I thought I could bring Deputy O'Malley into the Lobby with me in support of what I am convinced he believes, I might trouble the House with a division; but as I am not quite so optimistic.  I do not propose to divide the House on any of these amendments unless Deputy O'Malley gives me a signal that he will come into the Lobby with me.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Garda Síochána Bill, 1958&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill, which proposes to authorise the recruitment of women Gardaí, will, I think, commend itself to all sides of the House. Initially, only 12 women will be recruited and they will be assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Division and later, if the experiment is successful&mdash;as I am confident it will&mdash;to the county boroughs of Cork, Limerick and Waterford. At present four women are employed as police assistants in Dublin but they are not members of the Garda Síochána and have no special powers of arrest or authority to take statements.</P>
      <P>It will be generally agreed that there are many police duties, mainly in connection with matters affecting children and young women, where it is desirable that policewomen should be employed.  I do not say that male Gardaí have not handled such difficult matters successfully and tactfully, with the assistance, in Dublin, of the women police assistants, but in recent years the trend in other countries has been to place women on these duties as much as possible and this trend is in accordance with humanitarian principles.  It is the intention that women police will be concerned, primarily, with these matters but they will be given general police training and may be required to do any police duties which women would be capable of performing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preliminary arrangements are being made by the Civil Service Commissioners for holding the entrance examination for women recruits.  I expect that the examination will take place in the autumn.  There will be a qualifying written examination in educational <Col N="600" /> subjects (including Irish) but the final placings of the successful candidates will be determined by the Commissioners solely on the results of an interview at which the personal qualifications of the candidates and any special qualifications will be taken into account.  The successful candidates will be required to pass an oral Irish test before appointment.  Entrants will have to be at least 5 feet 6 inches in height and to be between the ages of 20 and 25 years.  Women Gardai will be obliged to retire on marriage in which event they will receive a gratuity on the same basis as women civil servants.  Their pension rights will be more favourable than their male colleagues in that they may retire after 25 years' service without age qualification, whereas men may retire only after they have completed 30 years' service and have reached the age of 50.  The pay of women Gardai will range from a minimum of £5 5s. on appointment to £8 7s. 6d. at the maximum of the scale.</P>
    <P>I believe that the admission of women to the police force will be in the interest both of the public and of good police administration.  Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to record that I went to Ballingeary as a boy and I went to Gortahork because I loved the language and wanted to learn it for its own sake, that all belonging to me were of the same mind and that we were enrolled in the Gaelic League when we were infants by our parents. But, against that background, I want to express my loathing and contempt for the proposition to Dáil Éireann that you cannot get a competent woman police constable without submitting her to an oral test in Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can you imagine a police woman patrolling Meath Street, Marlboro' Street or Summerhill being challenged in Irish or being required to discharge her duties through &ldquo;the medium&rdquo;? That is the kind of cod that makes those who love Irish shrivel with shame that we have reached such a stage of fraud and codology in this <Col N="601" /> country that even in a simple, good Bill of this kind we have to prostitute common sense to that kind of grotesque fraud, and the evil of it is that in the choice of these women for these most desirable and necessary services some most excellent candidate may be rejected and an inferior candidate preferred before her, because she masquerades as having a competent knowledge of Irish.</P>
    <P>How the Minister, who has an intimate knowledge of the conditions in that part of Dublin where I was born and reared and where, I think, he was born and reared himself, could some in and say that for the purpose of discharging a police woman's duty in Ballybough, Summerhill or Mountjoy Square, a competent knowledge of Irish is necessary, surprises me.  It is not like the Minister to engage in cod of that kind and I am amazed that he has allowed himself to be manoeuvred into the absurdity of presenting that ridiculous addendum to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the Bill in its purpose will commend itself to all sides of the House.  I am a little uneasy about the scale of pay.  I do not know whether the scale of pay provides for any additional amenities over and above the five guineas referred to.  I do not think you will get, or can hope to get, the kind of people we would like to get for this delicate and most important duty at this scale of pay.  Nothing is more important than that, in making this new departure here, which is so well established and justified by experience in London, New York and other great cities of the world, we should get the right women to inaugurate the service, which I cannot doubt will grow, but if it is to grow the first entrants ought to be the best, so that we can build upon the foundation laid by them.</P>
    <P>Although we may assume that some of the original entrants will regard this service, partially at least, in the line of a vocation, I do not think it is right to trade on that fact, and I do not think it is right to offer a lower rate of pay than would otherwise be requisite because we believe there will be forthcoming a number of women <Col N="602" /> who are prepared to accept the relatively low rate of pay because they love the work and believe it is something in respect of which they can serve. Perhaps the Minister would tell me whether the five guineas comprises their entire compensation, or are there any other perquisites?</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be better if I answered that point when replying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, they have uniforms, but I do not assume there will be any provision for their living in, as there are for members of the Garda Síochána, because that could not be conveniently arranged.  Therefore, five guineas seems to me to be a very low figure and the Minister should, I think, reconsider that.</P>
      <P>The only other matter to which I want to refer is the fact that these women police will have a very large part of their duty in dealing with children, and I think it right to ask the Minister if, when he is making this provision, he will not concern himself to go this extra step forward.  If children are taken into his custody, will he not take more interest of a practical kind in how these children are dealt with when they are in his custody?  I am well aware that the traditional reply to that is that Marlborough House is under the control of the Minister for Education and the Minister for Justice has nothing to do with it and, therefore, on the Estimate for the Department of Justice one is headed off.  But this is a Bill designed for the better protection of children requiring custody or intervention on the part of the State. I want to put it to the House that it is not enough to provide women police to protect children from criminal interference by others or to apprehend children engaged in what we will call &ldquo;juvenile misdemeanours&rdquo;.  We have also the very solemn responsibility that, if we take these children into the custody of the State, we ought to be certain that we do for them the best that it is humanly possible to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the existing system children, who may become subject to apprehension by women police in the future, are <Col N="603" /> removed to Marlborough House and there may rest for anything from a week to a month.  They go there for every sort of reason, from vagrancy to transit from one industrial school to another, and at ages ranging from five years up.  Not infrequently you may find a child of five spending a week, a fortnight, or a month in Marlborough House in intimate association with children of fourteen and fifteen who have been apprehended for misdemeanours and aberrations of the most extreme and difficult kind.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is any adequate provision for segregation in that establishment and I have repeatedly asked the Minister does he think it right to take children of tender years into custody and to seek to have them disposed of by a court of law unless he is in a position to put before the court, for its guidance and information, a report from a competent child psychiatrist as to what the true psychiatric condition of the child is and in how far that is due to conditions in the child's home, or in the child's surroundings, or in the company habitually kept by the child?</P>

      <P>I do not wish to curb the Deputy, but it seems to me he is travelling outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My only concern is to make the point that it is not enough to provide a force carefully trained to handle children in the streets, if part of the duties of such force involves the possibility of arrest and detention, unless we are satisfied that the conditions under which the children are subsequently detained are the best that we can provide.  I believe the Minister is sympathetic and I am obliged to confess that I was a Minister myself for six years and I did not get as many reforms effected as I should have liked.  But anyone with experience of Government knows that Ministers are expected to look after their own Departments and their intervention in their colleagues' affairs is not always welcome, if they get too querulous with Departments with which they are not primarily concerned.</P>
      <P>I have been trying for, I think, 20 years to get this modest reform: if we take children into custody, as is certainly envisaged under this Bill, we should provide the district justice, who ultimately disposes of them, with all the information requisite for a just and prudent decision.  I have made the submission repeatedly that a detention home such as Marlborough House&mdash; and my memory goes back to a detention home behind barred windows in Summerhill, but we shifted them out of that and went one step forward to Marlborough House&mdash;is not suitable.  I want to make the case that, if the Minister is embarked upon this reform, he ought to go a step further and claim his right, as Minister for Justice, and discharge his duty, as Minister for Justice, of satisfying himself, as distinct from the Minister for Education, that conditions in Marlborough House are safe and satisfactory and effectively complementary to what he is trying to do under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to those observations, I join with the Minister in commending this Bill to the House and I exhort him to make any improvements in it that this discussion may indicate are necessary in order to ensure that this new departure <Col N="605" /> will secure the services of the best available women, whether or not they talk Irish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonorMaryCrowley" hpid="Mrs. Crowley Mrs. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  For a great number of years, various bodies and those engaged in social welfare work have urged successive Ministers for Justice to bring in a Bill of this character.  I am sure this experiment will be a success if the women are trained on the right lines.  I think it would be a great mistake to put them in a kind of watertight compartment and allow them to deal only with women and children.  I know they will be trained in the same way as men are trained but, apart from that, I think they should be allowed to take part in all the duties that the men have to undertake at the moment so that they will have as wide a knowledge of the duties as possible.</P>
      <P>I think it will help them in their specialised work to have that extra knowledge.  For instance, it would be very valuable in the detection line.  It is acknowledged that some of the best detective story-writers are women.  I think the reason for that is that women are used to dealing with details.  Perhaps their special gift for detail would help them in work connected with detective work.</P>
      <P>The main object of this Bill is to provide women police to look after women and children.  That is very necessary because, in any city, there is always dangers for younger girls.  Some of them come up from the country where there is not that danger.  Public opinion carries a good deal of weight as regards the way women conduct themselves at home and in public; the neighbours talk, and so on.  The result is that that, in itself, is a deterrent. When they come up to a big city they are very isolated.  Nobody can be so lonely as in a city.  They have no friends, perhaps.  They do not know their neighbours on either side.  They may run into trouble.  The very fact that women police are walking about and looking after their interests will, I think, have a deterrent effect upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people may ask: &ldquo;Why put women into uniform?  Can women <Col N="606" /> social workers not be just as good? What is the point of putting women into uniform?&rdquo;  The whole point of the uniform is that it gives an air of authority.  When a Guard is off duty and is in civilian clothes, though he still remains a Guard, I think he suddenly loses that air of authority.  Perhaps we have the feeling that it is all right to park in the wrong place or to do something we should not do because he does not look like a Guard.  That is why I think there is a sort of psychological effect created by a uniform.</P>
    <P>I hope the girls will be well turned out.  I hope they will be smartly dressed, that their uniform will be smart and will look good.  I hope it will not be frumpish but, instead, welldesigned and attractive.  The girls will have that extra feeling of smartness if they know they look smart and they will be better Guards for that reason.</P>
    <P>There have been women police in many countries for very many years.  I do not think any country which started a women police service has given it up. They have all decided it is a good service, that it helps to look after the morals of the young women and also that it helps in the care of children. There are many ways in which young children can get into trouble.  If they have a sympathetic policewoman to keep an eye on them, I think there will be less of that vagrancy, general pilfering and other things that go on in a city.  Therefore, I think the Minister is very wise to bring in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope that, when the experiment in Dublin has ended, the service will be extended to other cities because any city, no matter what its size, can benefit by this service.  If the women are well-trained, they will be a great help. As I said before, I know they will be trained in the same duties as the men, but I think they should also be trained by women experts in dealing with women and children.</P>
    <P>These girls will be very young when they are first trained: they will be between 21 and 25 years.  Consequently, they will not have had very much experience of life.  For that reason, I think it is necessary to have specialists to give them that extra training in <Col N="607" /> their special work.  I congratulate the Minister very much on this experiment. I hope and I am sure it will be a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure all Deputies hope and trust that this experiment will be successful.  I should like the Minister to tell us what the estimated cost of the service is.  Deputy Mrs. Crowley pointed out that previous Ministers for Justice failed to bring in this measure.  I want to refer to the reason why I did not do so during my term of office as Minister for Justice. I received representations, on occasions. I was not personally against the idea of having women police, but I recognised the fact that, at the particular time, we had voluntary organisations in other parts of the country as well as in Dublin.  The fear Deputy Mrs. Crowley expresses does not, therefore, arise.</P>
      <P>The percentage of females convicted is very small.  I was not prepared to have the experiment in Dublin and to leave out Waterford, Cork and Limerick.  At the time when I asked for the returns, we were going through a financial crisis.  The estimate I was given for special barracks, accommodation, and so on, did not, in my view, justify my recommending the Government at that time to undergo that heavy expenditure which, I felt, was out of proportion to the number of recruits involved.</P>
      <P>I suggest that this experiment should be extended to help the voluntary organisations in Cork, Limerick and Waterford and that a certain number of policewomen should be stationed in these centres.  We shall have the demands afterwards and we might just as well begin at the beginning.  Why is the experiment to be carried out in Dublin only?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also confronted with the problem that there would be no night duty for these women police after 8 o'clock. That was against all the arguments that had been put up to me for having women police in the various cities.  I do not want to mention the amount which I was given as an estimate of the cost of the service but I may say I <Col N="608" /> considered it very heavy at a time when we were going through a financial crisis.  The Minister must have had an estimate of the cost of having 12 women police, with special accommodation, special barracks, in Dublin. Will we have cars for them?  How many officers will be in charge of the 12 policewomen?  If we had full information in regard to all these matters we would be in a better position to judge whether or not we can extend the service to the other cities at the one time.</P>
    <P>Personally, I am not against the Bill and I hope it will be a success.  I am very glad that, like previous Ministers, the Minister has recognised the work of the female assistance and the work of the male Guards in dealing with difficult cases.  No female was ever arrested without having female searchers and female assistance and there were voluntary organisations to give the advice which Deputy Mrs. Crowley considers necessary for young girls coming up to the city from the country.  We are very glad to have the organisations in the various cities throughout the country.  Even though we may have women police, the cooperation of the voluntary organisations in Cork, and elsewhere will be most helpful.  With their assistance, I believe we shall be able to secure what we all have in mind.</P>
    <P>I do not want an imitation of what has happened in Northern Ireland or in England where women police, under 25 years, are trying to act as male policemen&mdash;probably watching the licenced premises, hotels, and so on. I was assured by the powers that be that there would be no night duty for the women police.  Probably the Minister has some other information which he can give us.  If we have a Supplementary Estimate for this purpose we shall be better able to judge the position and debate it more fully and accurately.</P>
    <P>Why confine the experiment to Dublin? Why not try it out also in Cork, Limerick and Waterford, for example, and give these centres an equal number who will work, for the time being, with the voluntary organisations there?  I had in mind that, with the <Col N="609" /> co-operation of the two groups, we should be able to assure the success of the new force we are now about to organise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In recruiting a police force, the first thing we require is a force that will inspire confidence, and to get that we must have commanding personnel in it.  The old Dublin Metropolitan Police and Metropolitan Gardai were probably the best known police force in Europe, and they were known as such because of the commanding physical personalities of the individuals comprising that force.  I am not going to criticise the personnel of the force to-day&mdash;I think that would be very unfair&mdash;but now that we are starting off to recruit a woman police force it is very essential that good physique be one of the requirements.</P>
      <P>Unlike my colleague, Deputy Dillon, I welcome this test in oral Irish.  When I heard in the Minister's speech of a written test, my combs automatically got up.  I hoped that the commanding personalities of the women of the West and North-West would form the nucleus of this force.  We must not forget that the old D.M.P. and the D.M.G. were recruited from rural Ireland and not from the City of Dublin. The majority of them were from rural Ireland and I hope the majority of this new force will come from rural Ireland, and that they will be 100 per cent. Irish speaking.  However, when I hear of a test in written Irish, I can see the recoiling of prospective applicants from entering this force.  One can imagine girls down in Mayo, Kerry or Donegal, native Irish speakers, being asked to come to town here to pass a test in written Irish set by the Civil Service Commissioners.  One can imagine how they will recoil from such a test, or entering for it.  I believe examinations, written examinations, are the curse of the country, as far as the Irish language is concerned.  We ought to concentrate on more oral Irish and try to build up an Irish-speaking country as distinct from a country composed of scholars of the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I am in agreement with everything the Minister has said, with that exception, that there <Col N="610" /> should be no written test in Irish.  I see nothing in the Bill for the promotion of members of this new force. Perhaps the Minister in replying might tell us if there will be provision made for the promotion of the members of this new force.  I sincerely hope there will be.  I should like to see these 12 recruits under the control of their own sergeant and own inspector in the very near future and working in close cooperation with their male counterparts.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is to happen the four or five women attached to the police force in Dublin?  Is there any provision for their pension rights? I understand these poor old ladies have been attached to this force for years and years.  They are attached to it but are not of it, and I sincerely hope the Minister will see they are properly compensated when they retire on the recruitment of this new force.</P>
    <P>I was very interested to hear what Deputy Mrs. Crowley had to say on this.  I think her contribution was a most useful one, and perhaps, the Minister would consult not only lady Deputies of this House, but organisations which are run by very many voluntary women's associations in the city.  I, with Deputy Everett, hope this new force will be extended to other cities, but we would like to know what is to be the cost of the force.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett pin-pointed the trouble in his time, an estimate for separate barrack quarters and separate transport.  We know all these things will mount up and it would be very useful if we knew what it is to cost to provide 12 women police for the City of Dublin.  I should like to see the force extended later to rural areas, particularly Border areas.  I do not know if any person here has any experience of women searchers on the Border.  I, as a solicitor, have.  Clients of mine have been searched on a number of occasions by lady searchers on the Border, and I can assure you their standard of education is not very high.</P>

It is a bad thing that some person be called in at a few moments' notice to assist customs and excise officers to carry out these unpleasant duties.  I welcome the Bill, but I should like to know what the new force will cost.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> I was very much surprised to hear Deputy Dillon speak against the holding of an oral examination or an oral test for candidates for the women police force.  It appears to be looked upon as a kind of privilege for people who have some knowledge of the Irish languages themselves to be able to criticise and condemn its use.  That is what it amounts to.  The language has been taught in all the schools in this country for the past 40 or 50 years, to put it mildly.  Consequently, everyone between 20 and 25 years of age at this juncture has a fairly good knowledge of the native language.  We have experience of that every day.  I am sure no one will be failed if a reasonable knowledge is shown.  The Minister has explained that the interview will be the most important part of the test. Everyone has seen, from time to time, that when those breaking the law are questioned by the Gardaí, particularly the older Gardaí, some people will answer in Irish, thinking they are embarrassing the Guards by doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bad motive to attribute to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone has had that kind of experience.  I have seen it myself, and I am sure Deputy O'Donnell knows it and recognises it as well as I do.  It has happened again and again.  Those connected with the Garda know it is a habit of cheeky young fellows when they are misbehaving and are brought to task for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they not right to give their names in Irish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are, but they do not do it for that purpose.  They do it to embarrass the Guards, in the hope they may not be able to take a proper note of it or a proper note of the answers to questions.  In consequence, one of the essential things at the present day is a knowledge sufficient to carry out the simple discharge of their duties.  I am sure the Minister or those responsible for recruiting a responsible body of people for these duties could not ignore the fact that part of their education is a knowledge <Col N="613" /> of their own language, and that it would be helpful to them to have it.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, it is the national duty of everybody.  The Opposition know that their own Leader has, through the years, advocated the teaching and use of the Irish language. No one wants to make this question an issue as to its being only a school subject in all the schools&mdash;primary, secondary and university, the same as the other subjects of English, French or other languages that may be taught. If a knowledge of another language and of other subjects is a qualification, surely a knowledge of our own language should be so recognised?</P>
      <P>The Bill is a welcome one.  No doubt, this whole question has been under examination for some years.  Articles have been written in newspapers and elsewhere for and against it, but mainly in favour of it.  It is good and desirable that these ladies should be recruited for these duties.  I am sure they will work in close contact with the voluntary organisations.  Much of their work, as Deputy Mrs. Crowley has said, will be on the social side, as guides, and so on, to the wayward, and they will be helpful in that regard.  Of course, those who are recruited cannot all be brought in from country districts. Some of them will need a knowledge of the city and of city life.  There will be an admixture, I am sure, and their qualities and knowledge will be of mutual help.</P>
      <P>In time, some limited numbers will be extended, as has been said, into the other cities, to help there in the same type of work as that for which they are being recruited in the metropolis.  It is better to try here in the centre and then extend, when training and experience have been acquired.  Some of those who have been trained can be sent then to the other cities, to guide along the new recruits.  That the numbers be limited is desirable, as it also is that the best quality and the most striking in personality and appearance be recruited, so as to make an impression of the purpose for which they are recruited and the aims of the Minister in bringing in the Bill, in order to have their help in the administration of the laws and in the social guidance of the population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill very much.  I know this matter has been under review for a long time in the Department of Justice, and I also know&mdash;as probably other Deputies know&mdash;that there has been considerable pressure from social organisations and women's organisations to have a women's police force established here.  I find myself very much in agreement with the speech of Deputy Mrs. Crowley, who has expressed very lucidly to this House what most of us must feel on this subject.</P>
      <P>As I read the Bill and the Minister's speech, it appears that we are to have a small force of 12 women Gardaí, set up in Dublin, whose ages are to be between 20 and 25.  It seems to me that, as this is a new force and a specialised force, it would be to advantage that they should have a certain amount of maturity within their ranks. They will have a difficult job, due to the inherent conservation of the Irish race in regard to any innovation, and to set up such a force of young people might not achieve the objective sought.</P>
      <P>I notice in the Minister's opening address that we already have four female counsellors who are not actually police but people who advise the Gardaí on certain matters.  I do not know what their ages are or how long they have been in their present positions but it seems to me that they should get priority in being absorbed into this new force.  They must have had experience already and they must have had contact with the Garda authorities.  It would make for the better establishment of this force if they were absorbed into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell says so, but perhaps the Minister will tell us more about it.  Even if they are fairly advanced in years, they are mature and would help to build up a new force.  This force is to be established in Dublin.  I do not know what the exact pattern is within the force itself and whether it is possible to transfer on temporary duties members of the force in Dublin to other areas. <Col N="615" /> I feel the Minister is wise in starting this recruitment and setting up the force in Dublin and I see no reason why these members of the force should not be transferred to other areas, not necessarily permanently, because there may not be work for them in other areas, but they should be transferred whenever they are required in a particular area.</P>
      <P>I am in agreement with this Bill and I feel the approach is right generally but I should not like to feel that we are going to set up a police force and have it purely as an experimental element in Dublin.  What I mean is that this force is the nucleus of a female force which everybody believes to be essential here to deal with children and young women.  Police are not only for the purpose of putting people in jail or dealing with criminals; they also have a very important part to play in giving advice in regard to children and young women.  In many instances female police are far better qualified to do that than the male force.</P>
      <P>That brings me to my final point.  I do not think I am putting my case over well.  What I am trying to convey to the House is that you have this new force coming into existence and I feel that if you are to recruit 12 young girls between the ages of 20 and 25 you will have a separate arm of the police force. Naturally young people of that age will come under the direct jurisdiction of the male members of the force and under the jurisdiction of the commissioner, but I think in the final analysis they should have some kind of control for themselves.  That is why I suggest that those who are already affiliated with the police, these counsellors who, Deputy O'Donnell says, have already reached the age of 60, should be placed in control of this force so that they may have direct liaison with the existing police force.</P>
      <P>I think this Bill will be welcomed generally throughout the country, but it is bound to receive a certain amount of criticism because the Irish nation is firmly conservative, which perhaps is no harm.  This is an innovation which it is no harm to try and I congratulate the Minister on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>All sides of the House <Col N="616" /> appear to welcome this Bill but I personally have some reservations.  I am not so apprehensive, however, since I heard the Minister state that these proposals are simply experimental.  I have delved through three volumes of the Reports of the Royal Commission established by the House of Commons. They were very informative indeed and very lengthy documents and I would commend them to any Deputies who are interested in this project.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to say that I could not possibly agree with the Minister's suggestion that the age limit for these girls should be 20 to 25 years.  I think it is completely unrealistic and that the minimum age should be 25 and the maximum age 35. I also disagree with the method of recruitment through the Civil Service. Evidently it is to be in accordance with the exact procedure adopted for the recruitment of members of the Garda Síochana.  It is unfortunate that the Minister could not see his way to having a separate body or sub-committee set up to choose and recommend to the commissioner the most suitable candidates.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Irish language I am in entire agreement with the necessity for that.  I suppose it is inevitable also that, if recruitment is through the Civil Service, the usual procedure must ensue, that they must have a knowledge of written and oral Irish.  I subscribe to Deputy O'Donnell's sentiments regarding the written section of the paper but that could be got over by having the written paper set by an Irish speaker from the area from which the recruit comes.  There is a great difference between the spoken and written language as between one place and another.  Even taking an ordinary school textbook like &ldquo;Sé Dia an Fear is Fearr&rdquo;, which was written in the Northern dialect, there is a great difference between it and Munster Irish and even Connaught Irish.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister if he possibly could to revise the age limit.  We hear that one of the main duties will be protective.  Someone mentioned protecting the morals of the young.  Who is going to protect the morals of these young girls?</P>

      <P>There is something else which I think should be a qualification for this force.  I think it appalling to have recruitment through the Civil Service.  There are excellent schools in this area which teach physical culture.  Evidently physical culture is not a qualification.  I suppose some Deputies would suggest that we should recruit the 12 members from a camogie team which would be appalling. Much depends on the mentality of the individuals who will compromise the selection board.  The Minister has not enlightened us whether it is to be a typical Civil Service selection board, and if the marks are to be allotted in the usual Civil Service way.</P>
      <P>In the Royal Commission Reports which I read, of 25 girls who were put on the streets in uniform only three were kept on because it was found that in a probationary period of six months the remainder were unsuitable for various reasons.  Will their appointment, in the first instance, be the same as that for the Garda Síochána.  Is there to be a probationary period?  The Minister has not enlightened us on that not has he enlightened us as to what their height and general physique are to be.</P>

      <P>In their stockinged feet.  Under the Garda Síochána Act, 1925, I think the Minister is empowered to issue regulations to deal with such things.  Deputy Dillon mentioned that the pay was five guineas to £8 odd.  The rent allowance at present paid to members of the Garda Síochána is completely and utterly unrealistic.  In the City of Limerick, I think it is £53 per year.  Is it proposed to put these 12 women into a hostel with a Reverend Mother over them, or is it proposed that they should seek flats? Everyone knows that the cost of a flat or &ldquo;digs&rdquo; in Dublin at the present time can be between £3 and £4 per week.  If they are to get five <Col N="618" /> guineas per week, we might not be able to attract the right type of recruit.  With regard to the rent allowance, I presume the Minister will point out, when replying, that the commissioner has the right to use discretionary powers in that connection.</P>
      <P>The duties of these women polices will evidently not be confined to what they should be.  They will have the powers of ordinary members of the force, should their superior officers so desire.  If their superior officers do not so deem, automatically these police will have the right of arrest.  I understand that the ordinary citizen has power of arrest in the case of a felony. I wonder is it at all wise to give these females the same duties as the male members in certain respects?  In other words, why not confine their activities to certain specified duties?</P>
      <P>Deputy Everett was apprehensive in relation to night duty.  It is quite obvious that some of their duties will begin only after 8 o'clock.  I suppose, like the people in other Departments or in other concerns, they will have to take their rota on day as well as night duty.  If the Minister could have given us more information in his opening statement on these various points, it would have cut this debate very short indeed.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which is a very serious one.  Some Deputy referred to the raiding of licensed premises.  Women being what they are, you might get one of them who has a complete aversion to alcohol. She might be a certain type of social worker and very genuine, but she might spend most of her night duty raiding certain premises when the ordinary male member of the force would exercise his discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to let us know if the commissioner has the power of directing specified duties to which these women will be allotted. Furthermore, it should be clearly understood that none of this force will be allotted to duties which might result in supplanting a male member of the force.  In other words, it should be clearly understood that no male member will become redundant and that they will not be paid for clerical <Col N="619" /> and other work which would be competently carried out by a male.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to the view of Deputy Mrs. Crowley with regard to the uniform.  It will be most interesting to see how the Civil Service arrive at a design for the uniform for the new women police.  I shudder to think what they might be turned out in.  The Aer Lingus hostesses have very nicely designed uniforms.  They are a credit to Ireland.</P>

Women's organisations have been fighting hard for the introduction of a women's police force for many a long year, particularly the Joint Committee of Women's Societies and Social Workers who have done trojan work in getting the Government to come to an agreement about the establishment of the force.</P>
      <P>It is not a revolutionary step, for most countries in the world have women police forces.  There is a women's police force in America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, England, Wales and the Six Counties. We welcome, indeed, the decision of the Minister and the Government to introduce this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for women police is based <Col N="620" /> on two well-established facts.  Women are best suited to deal with women and children.  We have women offenders and child offenders.  As the Minister said, the duties of the new force will be of a specialised nature.  Their main duties will consist of taking depositions from women and children, attending women in court.  Very often a woman offender is the only one of her sex in a court.</P>
    <P>These women police will be of great value.  They will help and advise girls in moral danger.  They will attend women prisoners.  All these duties were very distasteful for policemen and they were also distasteful for the women offenders.  These women police will be very welcome.  We hope that this force, doing specialised duties, will help to see that women offenders make good citizens and, on that account, we welcome this Bill.</P>
    <P>I conclude by again congratulating the Minister on having introduced the Bill and I wish the new women police force every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are entitled to welcome the measure introduced by the Minister.  It has not been unexpected.  There has been a good deal of pressure brought to bear on Governments for many years.  The acceptance of the necessity for such a force was welcomed by all, for very good reasons known to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not heard the Minister's opening statement but I take it that the number &mdash;12&mdash;for initial recruitment, is purely experimental.  I hope it is intended to extend the force to areas other than Dublin.  It is completely fallacious to think that a women police force is not necessary in rural areas.  Anybody who has seen Gardaí trying to arrest itinerants or camping visitors who periodically annoy the rural population would immediately appreciate the necessity for having female assistance at times. If women police are not located in rural stations, they could be stationed withing striking distance of any area to which they could be brought by squad car when necessary.  I hope that that is the intention.  While nobody wants to see women replacing Gardaí, <Col N="621" /> it is to be hoped that the women police will be extended to carry out duties of a suitable type in all areas when necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not think it feasible that women police should be assigned to special duties only.  I could visualise a situation where a policewoman would have to close her eyes to something that might ordinarily lead to crime if she was not permitted to take part in the ordinary duties of a police force.  Women police should be allowed, generally, a free hand in all police duties, concentrating, no doubt, on those specialised problems for which their sex makes them suitable.</P>
    <P>A good deal of stress has been laid on the question of uniform.  I suppose it is important.  It is important only in so far as that it should be sightly and a means of attracting a good type of recruit, but I would be in favour of the people who recruit the force concentrating more on the amazon type than on the glamorous type.  If there is emphasis on glamour we may not get the type of person best suited to carry out police duties.  There should not be too much concentration on the smart cut of the uniform and the angle of the hat and so forth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That would attract more than the delinquent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We might not get the best type of recruit.  While I agree with Deputy Mrs. Crowley that the uniform should be smart and in keeping with the good force we are now establishing, the entire emphasis should not be on that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a women police force is a new venture in this country. We are making history so far as that is concerned.  The future of the force will depend on what the first effort is like.  I agree with Deputy O'Malley that the age limits 21-25 are rather low and will produce rather immature persons to do the work that they may have to do.  As years go on, they will mature but it could not be expected that at that early age they would have all the attributes of a good working police force.  One can visualise what their duties will be.  It is not a matter <Col N="622" /> of parading the street to let the public see how smart they are.  Their duties can be very tough and will require all the stamina and ability of a mature woman.  I do not know if they will carry batons and be permitted to use them.  Women are reputed to be fairly good with the rolling-pin at times and they might be just as well able as a man to wield a baton.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, that one is more likely to get the better type of recruit for this force from the rural areas than from the cities.  I would strongly recommend that the Irish language be obligatory in the test for recruitment.  I cannot follow the point made by Deputies that the written portion of the Irish test should not be compulsory. As Deputy MacCarthy said, speaking in Irish, there is no person of the age prescribed, or there should be no person, who is not capable of doing a written examination in Irish just as well as an oral examination.  That applies particularly to persons on Gaeltacht areas who most certainly would be quite capable of doing the entire examination through the medium of Irish, if necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest that it should be the deciding factor but it is essential that candidates should have a good knowledge of Irish. Deputy MacCarthy was very realistic when he said that sometimes people who are not imbued with the spirit of Irish will insist on speaking Irish to the Gardaí in the hope that it will embarrass them because some of the older members of the force may not have the competent knowledge of the language that most of the younger members have.  For that reason, it is imperative that the women police should have a reasonably good knowledge of oral Irish.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more one can say without repeating what has been said already.  This is an innovation in this State.  It is important to step off on the right foot and to see that the best possible type, adaptable to the particular duties, will be recruited in the initial stages.  It is on this first attempt that the future of the force will depend.  If we select the <Col N="623" /> right people now, we shall have considerably increased numbers in a few years, because I am certain that the establishment of this force will justify itself, as it has in other countries in which it was tried, and will lead towards not merely the detection of crime but its prevention, which is much more important.</P>
    <P>I am at one with those people who do not agree with that system of police duty where the policeman goes out merely to make the catch.  I am entirely in favour of the advice which has been given by the commissioner to all the recruits who have been passed our recently, that the book should be kept in the pocket as much as possible and that they should rely more on advice than on going out to catch people for the sake of having a record of detection to their credit.  I hope the same advice will be given to the force to be recruited now.  However, I think we can rely on the commissioner to place the emphasis on that type of advice and training.</P>
    <P>I, with the other Deputies, congratulate the Minister on taking this decision. It was taken, I am sure, only after the most careful examination and with the best advice available.  I think it will have the approval of all sections of the community, and we shall look forward with interest to see how the force will develop.  As I said at the outset, I hope that a limited number of them will be distributed throughout the country where they will be within striking distance of any area where such a police force may be required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the advance made by the Minister in introducing this Bill for the establishment of a women's police force.  It is in the experimental stages now, but I should like to see recruited to that force ladies who have a knowledge of social work.  We have in this city ladies who have been associated with the welfare of their fellow men and women and of children over a long number of years.  There is one organisation of which I have great experience and which has a great <Col N="624" /> record in relation to the number of women they rehabilitated to a proper way of life.  This women's police force should be recruited from women of that type, who have good knowledge of psychology, who have a good approach to a problem and who will be looked upon by the people anxious to commit crime in this city&mdash;young and old women and children&mdash;as their friends and not as somebody who is spying on them.</P>
      <P>The probation officers in the courts, who have been trained for this work, have succeeded in doing excellent work in dealing with crime and through the passing of this Bill I look forward to a great advance in the elimination of offences by women and children and even by men.</P>
      <P>However, it is my opinion that the age limit of 20 to 25 is too restricted. If it were from 23 to 30 we would attract a more mature type.  I should also like to see a better scale of pay being offered, if we are to attract the best type of girl to the force.  There is a Deputy behind me talking about a pension, but if they are attractive, they will not be long enough in the force to draw a pension.  I welcome the Bill. I wish the new force luck and congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>

      <P>I was not present to hear the Minister's speech, although I got the gist of it on the radio.  I regret that I do not know what has been said and I suppose what I am about to say has already been covered.  Such a force as this is necessary here because it has been established throughout the Continent and in the Six Counties.  I saw them there directing traffic quite competently and they could be used for the same purpose here and also for secretarial work&mdash; I am sure we could save money in that way&mdash; but primarily to deal with matters which are peculiarly the duties of women, such as the welfare of children and, particularly, the detection of shop-lifting offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficulty for a male member of the Garda to follow shoplifters into stores which are mainly concerned with women's wear.  They are usually recognised <Col N="625" /> but a woman Garda could do that job.  I had myself to report a woman shoplifter.  She lifted several things on me and the Garda informed me that they found it quite difficult to detect her.  This person was on their list for six months and had got away with hundreds of thefts, particularly where women's wear was concerned. That is a case where women could easily do something which male members of the Gardaí could not do.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that on marriage members of this force must resign.  I agree with that because I do not think married women should be employed by the State but I am concerned about how much it will cost to retire these ladies.  If pensions are to be given on marriage, how long must members of the force serve beforehand?</P>
    <P>Finally, I would suggest to the Minister that while recruits should not be actually horsefaced, they should not be too good-looking; they should be just plain women and not targets for marriage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true, as has been said here by numerous Deputies, that requests for the establishment of a force of this kind have been made over many years.  As far back as 1931 a committee which was known as the Carrigan Committee reported on the Criminal Law (Amendment) Acts and juvenile prostitution.  It recommended that in the Dublin Metropolitan Division a staff of at least 12 specially-trained policewomen should be provided. In 1950, a committee was set up to inquire into the organisation of the Garda.  It was known as the Deegan Committee, and that committee, having heard evidence from the Joint Committee of Women's Societies and Social Workers, examined the case for appointing policewomen.  After discussions with the Garda authorities and individual officers it made the following recommendations:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;From our examination of the problem we are satisfied that there are many duties, mainly in connection with matters affecting children, young women and girls, on which policewomen could be usefully employed <Col N="626" /> in the cities.  We recommend therefore that policewomen should be recruited as members of the Garda Síochána.  Until experience has been gained of this innovation we would confine their activities to the Dublin Metropolitan Area, and we recommend that as an experiment, and when amending legislation is enacted, a corps of 12 policewomen should be assigned to that area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The committee thought that while the duties of policewomen would primarily be concerned with matters affecting children and young women and girls they should be given wide experience and should, as far as possible, be employed on the same duties as their male colleagues.</P>
    <P>These recommendations were made by committees of very responsible persons and Deputies will notice that, in this Bill, we are in effect adopting the recommendations contained in the reports of these committees.</P>
    <P>The written examination which these young ladies will undergo will be on the same basis as that for male candidates for the Garda.  In addition to the written qualifying test there will be an interview at which appearance, intelligence, personality, special qualifications and general suitability will be taken into account.  Final placings will be based on the results of the interview only and women candidates will be required to pass an oral test in Irish before appointment.</P>
    <P>I casually mentioned in the course of my statement that there would be a qualifying written examination in educational subjects including Irish and apparently arising from that simple statement Deputy Dillon made a most impassioned attack on such a requirement.  He asked what benefit the use of knowledge of Irish would be to these women in dealing with people in Summerhill or Ballybough. He said he was born in that area and knew all about it.  I submit Deputy Dillon is living in the past and is dealing with the situation that may have existed when he was a boy.  He forgets that since that time, and for a generation now, knowledge of the Irish language is a necessity in almost every examination for public posts.  I have <Col N="627" /> never heard Deputy Dillon attack the requirement of a knowledge of Irish in respect of civil servants, nor in respect of any of the other public appointments where Irish is regarded as necessary and I fail to understand why he should attack it in this case. The people of Summerhill and Ballybough have been taught Irish in the schools.  It may not be the type the purists would speak but at least they have an elementary knowledge of the language and most of them would be able to understand it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also fails to realise that these policewomen patrolling in the centre of the city, say in O'Connell Street, might very well be asked questions in Irish and if they were incapable of answering it would make them, and the State also, appear ridiculous.  That is all I want to say about the Deputy's remarks regarding the requirement of a knowledge of Irish.</P>
    <P>The Deputy took the minimum pay figure of five guineas and said it was not sufficient.  That five guineas is actually for the period after they are accepted into the force and while they are undergoing training.  Later on, that amount will be increased.  They will get £6 7s. 6d. on completion of training.  At the end of a year after their appointment, it will go up to £6 10s. 2d. and it will then go up by the usual increments year by year to £8 7s. 6d.  The Deputy also mentioned the question of uniform, as did a number of other Deputies.  That is under examination and I have no doubt but that a suitable type of uniform will evolve.  I agree it is necessary that these ladies should look well and, as some Deputy remarked, the very fact that they feel they look well will make them efficient.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett seemed to be concerned about the cost of the women police force.  He mentioned that it was one of the things that had deterred him, when Minister, from taking any action on the matter.  I secured the agreement of the Government to this project by reason of the fact that the cost will be negligible because, instead of recruiting 12 men, we will recruit <Col N="628" /> 12 women.  Therefore, whatever extra cost there may be will not, as the Deputy seemed to suggest, necessitate a Supplementary Estimate or something of that kind.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies said it was desirable to extend this force from Dublin to Cork and other county boroughs, and even into rural Ireland.  This may arise in time.  As I have said, this is merely an experiment and we have got to see how it will operate in its initial stages.  If it is successful&mdash;and I believe it will be because it is a necessary step and one which should have been taken many years ago&mdash;I shall be very happy.  A similar experiment was carried out in the Six Counties in 1943. They began with only six policewomen. The force has operated very successfully there and, from that initial six, its strength has grown to one district inspector, one head constable, three sergeants and 29 constables.  I feel confident that similar success will obtain here in the course of some years.</P>
    <P>I was also asked about promotion. Promotion in the women police will operate in due course as it is operating in the Garda Síochána.  I was also asked what will become of the women police assistants who are at present operating in an unofficial capacity. They will continue as at present.  They are probably outside the age limits for entry into the new force.</P>
    <P>The discussion, if it does nothing else, will have served a very useful purpose by drawing the attention of likely candidates to the fact that one of the essential requirements for becoming a member of the force will be a knowledge of the Irish language. But I disagree completely with Deputy Dillon's remarks about the necessity for having a knowledge of Irish.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, in view of the increased cost of bus fares, he will consider either relaxing the regulations for unemployed persons residing in the Upper Ballyfermot area so that they will be required to attend the local employment exchange on one day only each week or, alternatively, establishing a branch office in the Ballyfermot area.</P>

      <P>The regulations to which the Deputy refers were relaxed a little over a year ago to provide that unemployed persons in the Dublin area residing between two and four miles from an employment exchange should be required to attend at the exchange should on two days a week instead of on three. The great majority of unemployed persons residing in the Ballyfermot area benefited by this concession.  Unemployed persons residing more than four miles from an exchange&mdash;of whom there are some in the Ballyfermot area&mdash;are required to attend on one day a week only.  I think these requirements are very reasonable and I do not think any further relaxations are called for.  Lest the Deputy may not be aware of the fact.  I should point out that unemployed persons living outside the Dublin area who live between two and four miles from an employment exchange are required to attend at the exchange on three days a week.</P>

      <P>Everything possible is being done to accelerate the acquisition of land for forestry purposes in the areas referred <Col N="634" /> to but at this stage I am not in a position to state when work is likely to commerce on any of the additional lands which the Department is seeking to acquire.</P>
      <P>Since the Deputy last inquired about the matter on 5th March, 1958, my Department has reached agreement on price with 19 out of 21 co-owners of an area of 118 acres in the Liberties Commons district; the other two owners concerned are in England but are being contacted.  Negotiations for the purchase of two areas totalling 38 acres at Ballymakellett are in progress.  Commonage areas at Ballaverty, Castletowncooley, Earlsquarter, Grange Irish, Mullaghattin and Glenmore, with a total area of about 1,400 acres were offered recently and will be inspected as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>There has been no change in the position regarding commonage areas at Cornamucklagh, Cornakit and Ballymakellett totalling about 1,200 acres in which progress is held up pending the framing of regulations under the Forestry Act, 1956.

      <P>Is it not a fact that the Bill introduced to make it easier for the Forestry Division to acquire land was introduced in 1956 by the previous Minister for Lands and that a very long time has elapsed since then without these regulations being made?  Will the Minister draw the attention of the Minister for Lands to the fact that it is very urgent that these regulations should be made?  They should have been made long ago.  It is now two years since the Bill was passed and yet. we have not the necessary regulations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>An tAire Oideachais a bhí ann romham, An Ginearál Ó Maolchatha agus an tAire a bhí ann roimhe sin, Seán Ó Maoláin, beannacht Dé lena anam, chuadar ag coraíocht go calma leis an bhfaidhb sin agus dheineadar réiteach ina chóir sa mhéid gur fhéachadar chuig sciatháin nua do chur leis an dá Choláistí Oiliúna do Chailíní, an ceann sa Charraig Dhuibh agus an ceann i Luimneach.  Ina thaobh san ba mhaith liom tagairt go speisialta don chomhar fíal a fuarthas ón a <Col N="639" /> Ghrása An Dr. MacUaid, Ard-Easbog Bhaile Atha Cliath, agus ón a Thiarna, An Dr. Ó Néill, Easbog Luimnighe a bhí, beannacht Dé lena anam san leis, leis an dá sciathán chostasacha san a chur ar fáil.  Ós ag trácht air atáim ba mhaith liom na Sitúracha difls ar a bhfuil an t-ualach airgid ag titim go déreach do mholadh go mór, leis. Ins na hiarrachtaí atá acu á ndéanamh ar son cideachas leanaí na tíre tá pobal na hÉireann chomh mór san fé chomaoin acu nach mbeidh sé in ann an comhar san d'íoc leo choíche.</P>
    <P>Rud eile a deineadh 'sea gur ligeadh do mhúinteoirí oilte fanúint i seirbhís go ceann trí mblian tar éis na gnáth-aoise scoir.  Ar an dhrochuair, ámh, níor éirigh leis na h-iarrachtaí seo ar fad an fadhb a réiteach.  Idir an dá linn is ag dul in olcas do réir a chéile atá an scéal Ó thaobh múinteoirí oilte.  Fé láthair, cailltear timpeall ochtó is cúigear múinteoirí oilte gach bliain tré mhná a bheith ag imeacht ar phósadh dóibh.  Bhéadh an chailliúint san ag méadú in aghaidh na bliana go dtí go sroisfí pointe ina dtárlódh fiú dá gcuirití dhá Choláiste Oiliúna breise ar fáil, go mbéadh glún iomlán imithe sul a bhféadfaí bheith ag súil le leor-fhoireann a bheith ins na scoileanna.</P>
    <P>Agus an scéal sin a bheith amhlaidh agus tar éis bheith ag cuimhneamh air gur beag an chaoi i gcóir oideachais leanúna atá ag na páistí ins na ceantair tuaithe is iargcúlta, chíthear dom-sa gurab é an príomh-rud a caithfear a chur san áireamh ná bun-cheart na bpáistí sin don bhun-oideachas is fearr is féidir linn a thabhairt dóibh. Tá beartaithe agam, dá réir sin a chur in iúl go luath dóibh súd ar fad a bhfuil páirt acu sa scéal go bhfuil ar intinn an riail a chuireann iachall ar bhan-mhúinteoirí éirí as an tseirbhís ar phósadh dóibh a chur ar ceal le héifeacht ón gcéad lá de Mhí Iúil seo chugainn.</P>
    <P>Ina leith sin, ní mór dom a rá gur breith í sin gurab eol dom go bhféadfaí argóintí a bheith ina choinnibh.  Ar eagla, ámh, go gceapfaí nach bhfuil ann ach rud a oireann don ócáid, ba mhaith liom a rá go láidir go bhfuilim sásta, tríd agus tar éis gach <Col N="640" /> aon ní a chur san áireamh, gurab é an toradh faid-théarma atá tagaithe as feidhmiú na rialach ná cailliúnt ó thaobh cúrsaí oideachais agus cúrsaí sóisialta.</P>
    <P>Gné amháin den scéal is ea gur ag an am a mbíonn barr éifeachta mar mhúinteoirí á shroisint acu a chuirtear iachall ar na ban-mhúinteoirí úd éirí as an tseirbhís.  Gné eile den scéal go mb'fhéidir nár bhfuras a fheiscint láithreach, is ea go mba chóir go mbeadh anathionchar ag cealú na rialach ar imirce agus eisimirce ó na ceantair iargcúlta tré mhúinteoirí oilte a chur ar fáil ins na ceantair sin.</P>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin, tar éis dom gach aon ghné den scéal do scrúdú go mon, táim sásta, i gcomhlíonadh mo dhualgais dom i leith leanaí na tíre, nach bhfuil aon bheart réasúnta cile seachas an ceann atá luaite agam go bhféadfainn é do dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir nár mhiste a lua freisin gurab é an chaoi a raibh an scéal le blianta beaga anuas go mb'éigin don Roinn bheith ag ligint do Bhainisteoirí ban-mhúinteoirí pósta d'athfhostú go sealadach.  Bhí 235 múinteoirí dá leithéid sa tseirbhís ar an tríochadú lá de Mheitheamh seo caite.</P>
    <P>Sé toradh ba chóir a theacht láithreach as cealú na rialach ná go gcuiffí idir ceithre chéad is cúig chéad múinteoir oilete ar fáil le haghaidh seirbhíse i bhfeadhmannas aitheanta agus an dá chéad tríocha is cúigear atá luaite roimhe seo a chur san áireamh.  Gach bliain ina dhiaidh sin, beidh timpeall cúigear is ochtó múinteoirí breise ar fáil.  Séard a thiocfaidh as sin i dteannta leis an gclár oiliúna leathnaithe atá ann cheana féin, go gcuiffear do réir a chéile múinteoirí oilte ins na scoileanna in áit na múinteoirí neamh-oilte ar fad agus go bhféadfar ar ball an coibhneas idir múinteoiríagus scoláirí d'fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>Rud eile a bhí fé bhreaithnuú agam i gcaitheamh na bliana an córas earcaíochta atá ann i leith na GColáistí Oiliúna do Mhúinteoirí Náisiúnta.  Nílim sásta gur bh'fhéidir fén gcóras san oiriúnacht na n-iarrthóirí do ghairm na múinteoireachta do mheas mar ba cheart.  Dá réir sin, tá socair agam deireadh do chur ón mbliain seo chugainn amach leis na trialacha béil <Col N="641" /> agus na trialacha praicticiúla a bhíonn ann um Cháise; go gcuirfear na h-iarrthóirí in ord feabhais do réir na marcanna a gheobhaidh siad ag Scrúdú na hArd Teistiméireachta agus go nglaofar ina dhiaidh sin orthu súd is airde san ord feabhais, le haghaidh trialacha béil agus le haghaidh agallmha os cómhair Boird ar a mbeidh ionadaithe ón Roinn agus ó na Coláistí Oiliúna.  Ní ligfear chun oiliúna ach amháin iarrthóirí go measfaidh an Bord Agallmha go bhfuilid oiriúnach ar gach slí.</P>
    <P>Deineadh roint ráiteasaí poiblí i gceaitheamh na bliana mar gheall ar an gcigiríocht ins na scoileanna náisiúnta. A lán de na ráiteasaí, is tura liom a rá, níorbh é an chuid ba troime den bhreithiúnas a bhí ag baint leo. Sé bheadh le tuiscint astu ná go bhfuil saghas éigin daor-thiomáinte ar siúl. Ní fíor san.  Tá bun agus fáth agam lena chreidiúnt go bhfuild i gcoitinne dea-thoil idir na cigirí agus na múinteoirí. Ní h-ionann san is a rá go bhfuil an córas cigiríochta atá ann gan locht ná nár bhfhéidir é d'fheabhsú.  Tá an gné sin den scéal fé ghéar-bhreithniú.</P>
    <P>Do tugadh le tuiscient sa Tigh seo agus in áiteanna eile gur laghdaíodh i mbliana ar an airgead le haghaidh scoileanna náisiúnta a thógáil.  Cé nach as aon cheann de na Bhótaí atá fé dhíospóireacht anso anois a thagann an t-airgead san ach as Bhóta na nOibreacha agus na bhFoirgintí Poiblí, baineann an scéal chomh dlúth san liom-sa nach mór dom tagairt dó. Ina leith sin ba mhaith liom a rá arís ná fuil aon laghdú á dhéanamh ar an méid atá i gceist.  £1,400,000 atá á sholáthar i mbliana, sé sin, £193,650 níos mó ná an méad a caitheadh anuraidh.  An rud amháin atá ag cur teora leis an airgead ná innmhe Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí len a dtaobh san den chlár tógáil scoileanna a láimhseáil.</P>
    <P>Dhealródh sé ó rudaí adeirtear ó am go ham gur fíor-bheag atá á dhéanamh chun saoráidí oideachais do chur ar fáil do na haicmí páistí go bhfuil máchail coirp nó intinne orthu. Ní h-amhlaidh atá.  Rud nach eol don phobal i gcoitinne is ea go bhfuil cúig cinn fichead de scoileanna speisialta ann atá ag freastal ar na páistí sin. <Col N="642" /> Fé láthair tá tairiscint ann chun a thuille scoileanna dá leithéid a chur ar fáil.  Ar na scoileanna atá ann fé láthair tá cinn j gcóir na ndall, na mbalbh, na bpáistí maill-intinneacha agus ina gcóir san go bhfuil iarsmaí na ngalar so ortha&mdash;croithleaghacht, pairilís inchinne, eitinn agus polio.  Níor mhaith liom an ócáid seo a ligint tharm gan a chur in iúl cé chomh mór is atá mo mheas ar an obair iontach atá á dhéanamh ag na daoine dílse idir Chléir agus tuath atá ag stiúrú na scoileanna speisialta so.</P>
    <P>Sé an meastachán iomlán do Vóta an Mheán-Oideachais ná £2,171,840. Sin £136,860 de laghdú ar Vóta iomlán na bliana 1957-58.  An laghdú san, áfach, is fén Mhír-cheann a bhaineann le breisthuarastal thagann sé ar fad agus is dóigh gur cuimhin leis na Teachtaí gur tugadh meastachán breise isteach go luath sa bhliain sin i leith riaráiste agus costas reatha tuarastail mhéadaithe a dáileadh do na Meánmhúinteoirí ó mhí Shamhna, 1955 fé réir Scéim Eadrána na múinteoirí sin.</P>
    <P>An Méadú atá ins na Mír-chinn eile den Vóta, sé is cúis leis, den chuid is mó, ná:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  An fás atá ann arís sa líon daltaí atá ag freastal Meán-scoileanna agus deontas caipitíochta iníoctha ina leith.</P>
    <P>(2)  An Méadú atá ann sa líon daltaí atá ag cur isteach ar na Scrúdaithe Teistiméireachta.</P>
    <P>(3)  An Fás atá sa líon ranganna a bhfuil deontais Eolaíochta iníoctha ina leith.</P>
    <P>(4)  An thuille múinteoirí bheith ag tarrac bhreais-thuarastail.</P>
    <P>Le 35 bliana anuas, is amhlaidh atá méadú fá thrí, beagnach, tar éis teacht ar an méid daltaí atá ar rollaí na meán-scoileanna.  An Seasca sé mhíle dhá chéad agus duine is fiche (66,221) de dhaltaí a bhí ann sa bhliain 1957-58, b'in trí mhíle seacht gcéad nóchta is beirt (3,792) de bhreis ar an mbliain roimhe sin.  B'in í leis, an bhreis, ba mhó a tharla in aon bhliain riamh. Tá méadaithe, leis, ar ndó, ar líon na scoileanna.  489 de mheán-scoileanna atá ann anois, sé sin, 176 níos mó ná mar a bhí ann i 1932-33.  An 489 san de scoileanna, tá an teagasc ar fad nó <Col N="643" /> cuid den teagasc á dhéanamh tré Ghaeilge i 234 acu, agus 81 ina bhfuil an teagasc ar fad á dhéanamh tré Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>21,143 de dhaltaí a thug fé na scrúdaithe i 1957 agus táthar ag ceapadh gur timpeall 22,000 a bheidh ag dul fé scrúdú i mbliana.  Dea-thuar is ea é gur lucht Ard-Teistiméireachta timpeall tríocha is cúig fén gcéad de na hiarrthóirí, oir sé tátal atá le baint as san ná go bhfuil ag méadú go rialta ar an riar de dhaltaí na meán-scoileanna atá ag fanacht ar scoil go dtí deireadh an chúrsa.</P>
    <P>An líon ranganna a bhfuil deontas speisialta Eolaíochta iníoctha ina leith, tá san tar éis dul suas ó 2,535 i 1956-57 go dtí 2,659 sa scoil-bhliain ina bhfuilimid.  Sé iomlán an deontais lena aghaidh seo ná £62,000.  Sé is cuspóir do na deontais sin na cabhrú le meán-scoileanna lena gcuid saotharlanna eolaíochta, cistineacha agus ceardlanna a chothabháil, lena gcuid fearaistí a athnuachaint agus le nithe eile a dhéanamh a bhfuil baint acu leis an teagasc paraicticiúil atá leagtha amach i gCláir na Roinne i leith na n-ábhar eolaíocht thalmhaíochta, tíos agus siúinéireacht.  An ráta deontais is airde, sé sin £30 go dtí £45 ar rang Ard-Teistiméieachta, don Eolaíocht Thalmhaíochta atá sé ag dul.</P>
    <P>Tá 113 de bhreis ann i mbliana de mhúinteoirí atá ag tarrac bresithuarastail thar an méid a bhí ann anuraidh. Den 2,814 de na múinteoirí sin atá ann, tá timpeall 2,500 a bhfuil Céim Iolscoile agus an tArd Teastas san Oideachas acu; tá 1,592 acu a bhfuil incrimint speisialta acu a fháil, mar gheall ar Chéim le hOnóracha nó a iontasamhail bheith acu, agus tá 830 acu, sé sin 80 nîos mó ná anuraidh, ag fáil incrimint speisialta as bheithe ag múineadh tré Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ag iompó dom anois chun an mheán-oideachais i gcoitinne, b'fhéidir gurbh é chéad rud ba cheart dom a lua ná an deich fén gcéad de ghearradh atá i bhfiedhm le bliain i leith na ndeontas caipitíochta.  An figiúr atá tugtha i Leabhar an Mheastacháin fén Mhír-cheann as a bhfuil na deontais seo iníoctha, is ar an mbonn go bhfuil an gearradh úd i bhfeidhm fós atá sé ann. <Col N="644" /> Is oth liom ná rabhas i riocht fós, agus an chaoi a bhfuil cúrsaí airgeadais i gcoitinne fé láthair, an gearradh a chur ar ceal.  Ach an drochbhail a bhí ar chúrsaí airgeadais, tá feabhas áirithe tagtha air agus sé mo dhóchas go bhfeabhsóidh sé a thuille chun a chur ar mo chumas an bhearana so a líonadh comh luath in Éirinn agus is féidir é.</P>
    <P>D'fhógraíos tamall ó shoin go bhfuil beartaithe béaltriail Gaeilge a thabhairt isteach i Scrúdú na hArd-Teistiméireachta i 1960 agus is mór an chúis áthais dom gurb é an tuairim choitianta gur maith is gur mithid sin.  An riar ghinearálta a bheidh ann chun an triail a dhéanamh, tá san curtha in iúl cheana féin do bhainisteoirí na meán-scol agus do na scol-chumainn.</P>
    <P>Ní miste a rá nárbh annamh don Roinn sna blianta atá caite bheith ag breithniú na ceiste seo ach gur mhór iad na deacrachtaí.  Bé deacracht ba mhó acu ná scrúdaitheoirí a fháil a bheadh oiriúnach agus a mbeadh na scoileanna sásta leo.  Sé tá beartaithe ina thaobh san ná cigirí ó na scoileanna náisiúnta a chur i mbun na h-oibre comh maith le cigirí meán-scoileanna. Beidh an triail bhéil ina cuid den scrúdú iomlán sa Ghaeilge agus, fé mar atá curtha in iúl agam do lucht ceannais na scoileanna, laghdófar fé mar is gá, i bhfianaise a thuille teagaise béil a bheith ann, an méid eolais ar théacsanna a bheidh á iarraidh sa scrúdú scríofa Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá daoine ann, b'fhéidir, agus ní ar lucht na hArd-Teistiméireachta ach ar lucht na Meán-Teistiméireachta ab fhearr leo an bhéal-triail a chur.  Tá daoine eile ann, is dócha, agus is ar idir lucht Meán-Teistiméireachta agus lucht Ard-Teistiméireachta ba cheart í a chur, dar leo.  Do deineadh machnamh trom ar gach gné den scéal san sar a dtánathas ar bhreith.  Na scrúdaithe seo, tá ana-chuid iarrthóirí ag cur isteach orthu, agus tá a bheag nó a mhór den chomórtas ag baint leo i dtreo go gcaithfear na freagraí a mheas níos cúramaí ná dá mba ná béadh ann ach scrúdú cáiliúcháin.  Rud nua sa tír seo is ea béal-triail bheith ann ina leithéid sin de scrúdú agus ar an ábhar san amháin do b'éigin ana-bhreithniú ar fad a dhéanamh ar an gceist.  Mar sin de, ón uair a bhí i gceist ceann <Col N="645" /> amháin den dá Scrúdú seachas a chéile a thoghadh chun an bhéil-triail bheith ina páirt de, ba léir agus ba lán-léir gurbh é Scrúdú na hArd Teistiméireachta an ceann ceart, óir, cé gur lú an líon iarrthóirí a bhíonn ag tabhairt fé, is é barr agus buaic an Chúrsa é agus téann sé i gcionn dá réir sin ar an gcúrsa meán-oideachais ar fad ón chéad lá. Ní hé atá agam á rá, ar ndó, ná tiocfaidh an lá a mbeidh béal-triail ann i Scrúdú na Meán-Teistiméireachta, leis, ach chíthear dom gurbh fhearr fanacht go fóill ina thaobh san go dtí go bhfeicfimid conas a éireoidh leis an ngnó san Ard-Teistiméireacht.</P>
    <P>Táim ag ceapadh go dtiocfaidh anamhaitheas as an mbéal-scrúdú so, agus, ní hamháin don Ghaeilge é ach do na modhanna múinte.  Táim lántsásta, leis, go mbeidh dea-thoil lucht údaráis na scoileanna leis mar bheartas agus gur mór and chabhair a bheidh ann don lucht foghlama.  Sé tiathneamh is mó, is dócha, atá le baint ag an ngnáthdhuine as teanga nua a fhoghlaim ná é bheith i riocht a thaispeáint go bhfuil cumas cainte aige sa teanga sin.</P>
    <P>Do luas figiúirí cheana féin á léiriú go bhfuil cuid mhaith scoileanna ina múintear abhair eile tré Ghaeilge.  Ba mhaith liom an saghas san scoile a fheiceál ag dul i líonmhaireacht go mórmhór ó tá téacsleabhair i nGaeilge ag éirí níos flúirsí diaidh ar ndiaidh. Tá soláthar áirithe breise á dhéanamh sa Vóta so chun téacsleabhair mar sin a chur ar fáil.  Na scoileanna atá ag múineadh tré Ghaeilge, gheobhaidh siad amach, measaim, gur fusaide an múineadh san treis bheith á cur le labhairt na Gaeilge i gcoitinne, agus ar ndó, is líofa-de agus is cumasaí-de Gaeilge an lucht foghlama iad bheith ag foghlaim trén teanga féin.</P>
    <P>Tá suim bheag áirithe á soláthar i mbliana chun athchúrsa gairid sa tíreolaíocht bheith ann do mheánmhúinteoirí i mí Iúil.  Do bé mo mhian a thuilleadh den saghas san athchúrsaí a fheiceál ann, iad á dtabhairt ar ábhair éagsúla nó b'fhéidir sreath acu á dtabhairt bliain i ndiaidh bliana ar ábhar áirithe éigin.  Ba mhór an leas a thiocfadh as a leithéid agus be mhór an áis é do mhúinteoirí ar mhaith leo <Col N="646" /> bheith ag baint triail as modhanna nua teagaisc.</P>
    <P>Tá roinnt gnéithe de chlár na meán-scol go mbeadh fonn orm iad a lua, ach maithfidh Teachtaí dom má fhanaim den chuid is mó i mbun tagairt a dhéanamh do na h-abhair Eolaíochta. Le linn dom é sin a dhéanamh, ní hamhlaidh atáim ag dearmhad go bhfuil and Chomhairle Oideachais ag breithniú chlár na meán-scol fé láthair. Go deimhin, is amhlaidh atá tuairisc na Comhairle á dréachtadh i láthair na h-uaire.</P>
    <P>Táthar ag cuimhneamh dúinn de shíor gurb í an aois seo aois na heolaíochta.  Cloisimid, leis, ó am go h-am, ó dhaoine ar cheart fhios bheith acu níos fearr, ná fuil tada againn á dhéanamh chun aghaidh a thabhairt ar aois na heolaíochta, ná fuil aon eolaíocht, nó ar aon nós gan ach an fíor-bheagán di á múineadh inár gcuid meánscoileanna, ná fuil aon mhúinteoirí eolaíochta againn nó má tá ná fuil siad cáilithe, agus mar sin de.  Ní furas a thuiscint cad ina thaobh a mbíthear ag caint mar sin.  Níl éinne á shéanadh gurbh fhéidir an scéal a fheabhsú, ach bheadh duine ag súil go mbeifí ag tabhairt roinnt bheag molta, roinnt bheag uchtaí, anois is arís, do na scoileanna agus na múinteoirí atá ag déanamh a ndualgais go dícheallach dúthrachtach rathúil den taobh san.</P>
    <P>Do luas cheana go bhfuil 126 de ranganna abreise ann i mbliana atá ag tuilleamh na ndeontas speisialta a tugtar i leith ranganna eolaíochta. D'fhéaddfainn a chur leis sin gurb amhalaidh atá le deich mbliana anuas go bhfuil 1,000 breise de na ranganna san ann.  Ní amháin sin, ach an áit ná raibh ach 292 de scoileanna ann i 1948-49 a bhí ag fáil na ndeontas san, 388 den saghas san scoileanna atá ann anois.</P>
    <P>Tugtar na deontais seo i leith múineadh an tís, leis, ach taobh amuigh ar fad den tíos, as an 202 de scoileanna buachaillí, 225 de scoileanna cailíní agus 54 de scoileanna measctha a bhí ann ar fad sa bhliain seo caite, do bhí 159 de scoileanna buachaillí, 160 de scoileanna cailíní agus 18 de scoileanna measctha a bhí ag múineadh ábhar amháin nó níos mó ná abhar <Col N="647" /> amháin eolaíochta.  Is ionann san is a rá, go raibh 144 de scoileanna ann ná raibh ag múineadh ábhar eolaíochta, mar adéarfá, gnáth-ábhar colaíochta, ach ina thaobh san ní miste a mhíniú gur ábhar éigeantach an eolaíocht tís ar chlár minimum scoileanna na gcailíní. Ar nós a lán eile de na h-ábhair, ní ábhar éigeantach aon ábhar gnátheolaíochta. Ní furas na gnáth-ábhair eolaíochta a oibriú isteach i gclár na scoileanna beaga, óir is gá saotharlann agus fearaistí ina gcóir, agus tá roinnt áirithe de na scoileanna beaga sin ann.  Sin cúiseanna le cuid de na scoileanna gan bheith ag múineadh eolaíochta.</P>
    <P>Tá ceithre cláir eolaíochta ann (ceann acu i gcóir cailíní amháin) do chúrsa na Meán-Teistiméireachta, agus clár san eolaíocht thalmhaíochta, lena gcois sin, agus sa scoilbhliain 1956-57 bhí 60% de na buachaillí agus 20% de na cailíní ag déanamh clár éigin acu san.  Caithfear a admháil, áfach, ná raibh ach 488 de bhuachaillí na Meán-Teistiméireachta ag déanamh eolaíochta thalmhaíochta i ranganna aithinte lena linn sin.</P>
    <P>An cúrsa dhá bhliain i gcóir na hArd-Teistiméireachta, tá seacht gcinn de chláir eolaíochta ann, mar atá, an fhisic, an cheimic, an fhisic-agusceimic, eolaíocht choiteann, luibheolaíocht, corpeolaíocht-agus-sláinteolaíocht, agus eolaíocht thalmhaíochta. Cailíní ar fad beagnach a dheineann an chorpeolaíocht-agus-sláinteolaíochta. Tar éis a chur san áireamh go bhfuil cúpla céad nó níos mó de na buachaillí atá ag déanamh níos mó ná ábhar amháin eolaíochta, dheallródh sé go bhfuil ós cionn 50% de na bhformhór foghlaim eolaíchta, agus a bhformhór san ag déanamh fisice nó ceimice nó an dá ábhar san.  Caithfear a admháil, aon uair amháin eile, ná raibh ach 206 de bhuachaillí Ard-Teistiméireachta, agus iad san i 6 de na scoileanna, a bhí ag déanamh staidéir go formálta ar an eolaíocht thalmhaíochta.  Ar an taobh eile de, áfach, bhí 40% de chailíní na hArd-Teistiméireachta a bhí ag foghlaim corpeolaíocht-agus-sláinteolaíocht agus 576 de chailíní Ard-Teistiméireachta ag déanamh luibheolaíochta, maraon le líon áirithe is lú ná san de chailíní a bhí ag foghlaim na fisice nó na ceimice agus dá réir sin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="648" /> Béifear ag mairgnigh nach mó ná san de scoileanna buachaillí atá ag luí isteach go formálta ar an eolaíocht thalmhaíochta.  &ldquo;Go formálta,&rdquo; adeirim, ar an ábhar go dtuigtear dom go bhfuil roinnt scoileanna ann ina dtugtar roinnt áirithe oiliúna san Tuaitheolaíocht nó sa talmhaíocht ach gan clár na Roinne bheith á leanúint iontu.  Ach más teagase formálta na heolaíochta i meánscoil atá i gceist, is mó san deacracht atá le sárú.  Is riachtanach, cuir i gcás, feirm talmhan ach go háirithe agus a mbaineann leí, ní furas i gcónaí céimí sa talmhaíocht a mhealladh chun bheith ag múinteoireacht i meánscoil, is achrannach an ní rang san eolaíocht thalmhaíochta a oibriú isteach I gclár-ama laethúil na scoile, agus ansan, fé mar adúras cheana, scoileanna beaga is ea cuid dár meánscoileanna.  Ina theanta san uile, ní foláir a admháil go bhfuil idir thuismitheoirí agus aos óg agus gan iad ró-cheanúil ar an eolaíocht thalmhaíochta mar chuid de chlár meánscoile. Sílim go bhfuil an claonadh san i gcoinnibh na heolaíochta talmhaíochta ag ceiliúradh diaidh ar ndiaidh de bharr léargas níos fearr bheith ag teacht don phobal ar cad é a leas féin.</P>
    <P>Timpeall 50% díobh súd atá ag múineadh na heolaíochta ins na meán-scoileanna, tá céim iolscoile acu san eolaíocht.  An chuid eile, agus na múinteoirí corpeolaíochta-agus-slainteolaíochta agus eolaíochta neamhthrialaí ina mease san, tá freastal déanta acu ar na cursaí samhariadh atá leagtha síos ag an Roinn dóibh ins na cláir éagsúla agus tá cáilíocht bainte amach acu i scrúdú cinn chúrsa na Roinne chun na cláir sin a mhúineadh.</P>
    <P>Na figiúir san go léir, agus iad a chur leis an bhfigiúr den líon breise macléinn Iolscoile atá ag déanamh eolaíochta fé láthair, léiríonn siad, measaim, nach olc an bhail atá ar an eolaíocht ins na meánscoileanna.  Ba cheart dúinn, leis, gan a dhearmhad nach foghlaim speisialta ar roinnt bheag ábhar fé leith an bonn atá le clár na meánscoileanna. Bonn agus eagras níos leithne ná san atá mar nós againn le fada sa tír seo, agus ná caithimis uainn an bonn leathan sin sul a mbeimid lánchinnte gur maith oiriúnach fónta an rud a chuirfí ina áit. Is furas an rud atá agat, olc maith é, a bhascadh.  Tá rud againn i gclár agus in <Col N="649" /> obair ár gcuid meánscoileanna a d'fhóin go maith dúinn go dtí seo.  Níor mhaith an comhairle an rud san a chur i leataoibh gan lánbhreithniú, óir ní fios nach é an sop in ionad na scuaibe a gheobhaimís ina áit.</P>
    <P>Tá ní amháin eile ba mhaith liom a lua, sé sin na nuatheangacha Eorpacha. Is baol ná fuilimíd fhad chun cinn sa ghné sin den obair is a d'fhéadfaimís a bheith.  Maithfear dom é má chuimhním do lucht stiúrtha na meánscoileanna gur gairid uainn, do réir deallraimh, an Limistéar Saorthráchtála úd san Eoraip. Tá ábhar machnamha ansan acu agus níor mhiste dóibh bheith á n-ullmhú féin chuige tré níos mó teann a chur ar mhúineadh na nua-theanagacha san.</P>
    <P>£1,246,960 an soláthar glan don Ghairm-oideachas i mbliana.  Sín £111,340 ar Vóta na bliana anuraidh. Na deontais bhliantúla do choistí gairm-oideachais a bheith curtha ar ais ar a lán-ráta is mó is cúis leis sin. Mírchinn eile a bhfuil soláthar do chaiteachas breise á dhéanamh ina leith sea oiliúint mhúinteoirí, deontais a híoctar fé Alt 109 d'Acht Gairm-oideachais 1930, íocaíochtaí i leith pinsin agus aiscí, agus íocaíochtaí leis na húdaráis ráthúcháin i leith iasachtaí a tharraingíonn siad chun scoileanna nua a thógáil.</P>
    <P>Bhí an-áthas orm gur fhéadas a chur in iúl do na Coistí Gairm-oideachais níos luaithe sa bhliain gur chinn an rialtas an Gearradh 6% a chur ar ceal. Ina leith sin, ní miste é d'athrá arís nach bhfuil deireadh forbairte déanta fós ar an ngairm-oideachas, mar tá sé againn, sa gcéill nach eol ar fad fós don phobal, agus go háirithe don chuid sin de ba mhó a ndéanfadh an cineál seo oideachais leas dóibh, an tairbhe agus na buntáistí d'fhéadfaí a bhaint as. Ar an dtaobh eile dhe, bíonn ar an scoil ghairm-oideachais féin, mar bhárr ar an gcuid sheasta dá clár oideachais leanúina agus ceard, a bheith i geónaí ag triail agus ag féachaint cúrsaí nua nó mallairt chúrsaí de réir riachtanas an cheantair a bhfuil sí ag freastal air. Gheofar le haimsir agus leis an saothar bunúsach atá ag na scoileanna gairm-oideachais á dhéanamh, measaim, an ceann is fearr ar na deacrachta sin ar fad nó a bhfuil fágtha dhíobh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> Sa scoil-bhliain 1956-57, bhí 260 de scoileanna gairm-oideachais lae ag obair, maille le 537 d'ionaid eile inar tugadh cúrsa amháin teagaisc nó níos mó i ngach ceann díobh i rith na bliana. H-osclaíodh chúig cinn de scoileanna nua an bhliain sin agus ó thús na scoilbhliana reatha i leith críochnaíodha tógáil deich gcinn de scoileanna nua eile.  Sa tréimhse céanna ó 1956, méadaíodh sé cinn de scoileanna chun cóiríocht a thabhairt do ranganna breise agus dá thuille mach léinn.  San am céanna, tógadh seacht gcinn de scoileanna aon-tseomnra nó dhá-sheomra mar chóiríocht do ranganna oíche do dhaoine fásta.</P>
    <P>Tá seacht gcinn de scoileanna nua á dtógáil agus cheithre cinn á méadú fé láthair, agus tá súil go dtosnófar, roimh an aonú lá tríocha de Mhárta 1959, ag tógáil dhá cheann déag de scoileanna nua agus ag méadú deich gcinn de scoileanna atá ann cheana.  Meastar gur thimpeall £320,000 a catithfea ar thógáil scoileanna gairm-oideachais sa bhliain reatha airgeadais.  Ar na scéimeanna atá beartaithe tá méadú a dhéanamh ar an gColáiste Teicneolaíochta, Sráid Bhólton, i mBaile Átha Cliath, a bhfuil cuireadh tugtha chun tairiscintí conartha len aghaidh. Tá gá leis an méadú seo chun cóoiríocht cheart a chur ar fáil le haghaidh ceardaithe innealthóireachta agus tógála d'oiliúint agus le haghaidh ard-chúrsaí áirithe den chineál sin a tugtar sa Choláiste.</P>
    <P>Féadaim a lua freisin go bhfuil cead tugtha chun pleaineanna d'ullmhú do Choláiste nua Teicenolaíochta ar Shráid Chaoimhín, Baile Átha Cliath, in áit an fhoirgnimh atá ann fé láthair agus chun freastal ar ghanntanas cóiríochta le haghaidh oiliúna i gcearda agus i dteicneolaíocht leictreachais agus eolaíochta. Níl meastachán baileach ar chostas na scéime seo ar fáil fós, ná ní féidir a rá cá fhaid go dtosnóidh an tógáil, óir braitheann sin go mór ar a fhairsinge and bheidh airgead caipitil sna blianta seo chugainn.  Luaim an dá scéim mhóra sin i mBaile Átha Cliath go háirithe de bhrí nach don phríomh-chathair amháin a raghaidh siad chun tairbhe ach don tír fré chéile chomh maith.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="651" /> Cé go léiríonn na figiúirí atá tugtha agam gur maith atá tógáil scoileanna ag dul chun cinn, is dóigh go bhfuil coistí ann nach leor leo an forás sin. Tá tórainn, áfach, lenar féidir a sholáthar d'airgead caipitil chun scoileanna Gairm-oideachais a thógáil, de bhrí gur riachtanach an méid tóranta caipitil atá againn a dháiliú chomh cothrom, cóir agus is féidir.  Féachtar chomh fada agus is féidir, áfach, le tosaíocht éigin a thabhairt do na coistí is mó a bhfuil gá acu le scoileanna nua. I leith tuille leathnú a dhéanamh freisin, níor mhór do choistí cuimhneamh ar staid a gcuid ioncam agus ar a ngustal chun an caiteachas breise a théann le scoileanna nua, i leith foirne agus oibriú, a sheasamh.</P>
    <P>Bhí 1,487 de mhúinteoirí lán-aimsire ar fostadh ag na coistí sa scoilbhliain 1956-57, méadú de sheasca ar líon na bliana roimhe sin, ach ba lú de sheachtó is triúr líon na múinteoirí páirt-aimsire, dream a raibh míle, céad is naonúr déag díobh ann.</P>
    <P>Le roinnt bhlian, tá an líon daltraí, lán-aimsire agus páirt-aimsire, a fhreastalann scoileanna gairm-oideachais cuíosach seasta thart fé nócha míle. D'ardaigh an líon go hobann go dtí 94,506 sa scoilbhliain 1955-56 ach thit sé arís an scoilbhliain dár gcionn go dtí 88,624.  Tharla formhór den titim seo de bharr laghdú sa líon mac léinn ar ranganna oíche, laghdú arbh é an cungú a rinneadh ar ranganna den tsórt sin, go háirithe ag ionaid lasmuigh, ar loirg an ghearradh 6%, ba chúis leis de réir chosúlachta.</P>
    <P>Ábhar sásaimh é, áfach, an fás seasta atá ar fhreastal ar chúrsaí lán-aimsire oideachais leanúna agus ceard-oideachais do dhaoine óga agus ar chúrsaí páirt-aimsire agus ar chúrsaí saordhula do phrintísigh.  Sa scoilbhliain 1956-57, bhí 21,786 ag freastal ar chúrsaí lán-aimsire oideachais leanúna, nó míle níos móná, mar bhí an bhliain roimhe sin.  Ag an am céanna, bhí 705 aga fáil ceard-oideachais lán-aimsire, sé sin 150 thar mar bhí an bhliain roimhe sin.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir a rá go cruinn cé mhéad printíseach ar fad a fhreastalann ranganna oíche i scoileanna gairm-oideachais, toise nach gcláraítear astu <Col N="652" /> féin iad, ach meastar gur thimpeall ocht míle é.  Bhí 2,600 ag na cúrsaí speisialta saordhula lae do phrintísigh i 1956-57, áfach, agus mar dúras tá a líon ag méadú gach aon bhliain.  Bhí cúrsaí lae den chineál seo ar siúl i ndathad ionad i rith na bliana, agus, i mBaile Átha Cliath, do dhein printísigh as fiche ceard éagsúil freastal orthu. Mar fhianaise ar an gcaighdeán ceirde a bhaineann na daoine óga so amach, ní miste a mheabhrú chomh maith is chruthaigh dornán beag d'ionadaithe díobh a bhí ag coimhlint sna comórtais i Madrid in éineacht le printísigh as tíortha eile san Eoraip anuraidh. Gnóthaigh triúr acu duaiseanna agus bhain duine acu an chéad-áit amach ina cheird áirithe féin.  Tuigim go bhfuil foireanna iomlán d'iomaitheoirí le cur isteach ar chomhórtais den tsórt céanna i mbliana.  Gan trácht ar aon bhun a bhainfid amach, cuideoidh an thaithí agus an mhuinín as a gcumas féin a thabharfaidh na comórtais dóibh, ní hé amháin leis na hiomaitheoirí ach leis na cearda agus leis na scoileanna arb as iad.</P>
    <P>Tá iarrachtaí á ndéanamh i mórán gach contae chun cúrsaí tairbheacha, éifeachtúla a chur ar fáil don fheirmeoir agus don bhean tí fén dtuaith.  Is samplaí na cúrsaí i dtógáil tithe feirme, in innill feirme agus in ithireolaíocht, de chúrsaí atá á soláthar agus a bhfuil tarraingt chinnte acu ar an bhfeirmeoir agus ar an talmhaí. Maidir leis an mbean tí feirme, is féidir cúrsaí ina dtugtar teagase féna cuid oibre, amuigh is istigh, a lua, ar nós na gcúrsaí a tosnaíodh anuraidh i roinnt ionad i gCo. Liatroma. D'oibrigh múinteoirí gairm-oideachais, teagascóirífé choiste talmhaíochta an chontae, agus dochtúirí fén údarás áitiúil sláinte, as láimh a chéile chun an teagasc a thabhairt ar na cúrsaí seo fén gcoiste gairm-oideachais agus, i dteanta ranganna tís, tugadh ranganna freisin fé chothú éanlaith, déiríocht, garraíodóireacht, banaltracht theaghlaigh agus maisiúchán tí.</P>
    <P>Tráchtaim air sin ar fad mar shampla den chomhar agus den ghustal áitiúil ar chóir fáiltiú roimhe agus é a mholadh. Sa gceann eile den tír, i gCo. Chorcaí, tá tóir mhór go fóill ag mnátí agus eile ar scéim &ldquo;chomhairleachan <Col N="653" /> teallaigh&rdquo; a tionscnaíodh cúpla bliain óshoin féna dtugann múinteoirí cuairteanna ar na tithe le cois ranganna a thionóil sna scoileanna.  Bhí an scéim seo á hoibriú i gcúig cinn déag d'ionaid i rith na scoilbhliana 1956-57.  Amach ón dá cheantar sin, i mórán gach aon chontae, tá rud den chineál céanna ar bun, rud ar cinnte gur mór an gar é dóibh seo ar mhaith leo a mbealaigh feirmeoireachta nó riar tí d'fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>Tá súil le cúrsaí, in oiliúint oibrithe tithe ósta, den chineál atá ar siúl cheana i gContaethe Dhún na nGall, Chorcaí agus Loch Garman a thosnú an scoilbhliain seo chugainn i gCo. na Gaillimhe, áit a bhfuil foirgneamh tí ósta curtha i gcóir ag an gCoiste lena n-aghaidh.  Cuirfear freisin leis na cúrsaí i ndéanamh báid agus na cúrsaí i riar tithe aíochta atá ar siúl sna ceantair iascaigh agus dubhánachta. Sé cuspóir na gcúrsaí seo uile cuidiú leo siúd a bhíonn ag obair i dtionscal na cuartaíochta agus tá an Bord Fáilte ag cabhrúlena gcur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Tugann a bhfuil ráite agam fén Vóta seo réidh-thuairim den obair a déantar sna scoileanna gairm-oideachais. Tá súil agam gur leor échun Teachtíi do shásamh go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh agus, cé gur mór an tsuim atá á iarraidh ar an Stát-chiste, gur maithe is fiú ann iad na seirbhísí ar a bhfuil an t-airgead á chaitheamh.  Sé an Stát is mó a chaitheann leis na seirbhísí seo, ach bíonn ar an údarás áitiúil freisin scar maith a sholáthar de chostas an ghairm-oideachais fé gach aon choiste. Táim cinnte nach bhfuil ach fonn ar na húdaráis áitiúla, óna gcuid taithí dhlúth ar obair na gcoistí, a gcuid féin den chostas a sheasamh.</P>
    <P>Ina leith sin, mheasas gur thráthúil dom le gairid scríobh chuig na coistí gairm-oideachais á chur ina luí orthu cloí le gach beart indéanta a chur i bhfeidhm chun go n-oibreoidís a gcuid scéimeanna chomh barrainneach, tíobhasach agus ab fhéidir ó thaobh caiteachais dhe, ionas go gcoimeadfaí an t-ualach ar lucht díolta rátaí agus ar lucht díolta cánach araon chomh héadrom agus ab fhéidir.  Ag an am céanna, do dheineas a that haint orthu gur chosúil go raibh, de réir gach réasúin, cás maith ann chun a n-ioncam ó tháillí mic léinn d'ardú, de bhrí <Col N="654" /> gurbh fhiú, ó cheart, an tseirbhís atá ag an ngnáth-mhac léinn á fháil táille roinnt níos mó a chur air ná mar cuirtear.  Tuigim go maith go gcaithfear, chun teacht ar an ardú baileach a déanfar fé gach aon choiste, áird a thabhairt ar staid an cheantair, na cúrsaí a soláthraítear ann agus an scála táillí atá i bbfeidhm ann fé láthair.  Bíodh gur fíor, agus an deathoil is móann chuige, nach mbeidh san ioncam ó tháillí ach céatadán beag den chaiteachas iomlán, féadfaí go réidh an céatadán atá ann fé láthair d'ardú.</P>
    <P>Cun ceangal a chur ar mo chuid cainte fén Vóta seo, ní miste dhom a rá gur mór is maith liom buíochas a ghabháil go poiblí leis na comhluchta agus leis na heagraíochta a chuidigh an bhliain seo caite le hobair na gcoistí gairm-oideachais, thrí scoláireachtaí agus duaiseanna a thairiscint, thrí fhearais nó innealra a bhronnadh nó a thabhairt ar iasacht in aisce i gcóir chúrsaí áirithe, thrí shaineolaithe nó múinteoirí oilte a sholáthar in ábhair áirithe, agus thrí chúnta teagaisc, cairteanna, scannáin agus a leithéidí a thabhairt lena scaipeadh ar na scoileanna.  Spéis den tsórt sin sa nGairm-oideachas agus fonn cabhruithe lena chur chun cinn, léirionn sé cad is fiú é dar leo siúd atá cáilithe go maith chun a thoradh a mheas.</P>
    <P>Is fé Vota 41&mdash;Eolaíocht agus Ealaíon &mdash;a soláthraítear na deontais a thugann an Stát d'institiúidí agus d'eagraíochta cultúra, d'fhoilseacháin i nGaeilge, agus do scoláireachtaí Iolscoile agus do dheontais taighde de chuid an Stáit. An tsuim atá dá hiarraidh chun na gcríocha sin i mbliana, sé sin £186,870, is mó é de £17,280 ná Meastachán na bliana so caite.</P>
    <P>Mar tabharfar fé ndeara, tárlaíonn bunáite an mhéadú sin de bhárr breis soláthair de £15,000 a bheith riachtanach fé mhírcheann B.l. ar mhaithe le foilseacháin Ghaeilge.  Den tsuim sin, tá £7,000 ceaptha le caitheamh ar chló agus ar cheangal an Fhoclóra nua Béarla-Gaeilge, foclóir a bhfuil géarchall leis.  Tá obair na heagarthóireachta i ndáil le bheith réidh agus tá súil leis an saothar a bheith ar fáil roimh dheireadh na bliana.  Chun athchló a chur ar an leagan Gaeilge den Leabhar <Col N="655" /> Aifrinn atá £6,000 eile den tsuim in áirithe.  Cuireadh cúig mhíle cóip den Leabhar Aifrinn fé chló ar dtús fé Nollaig, 1952, ach tá sé as cló ó 1956 i leith.  Tá súil leis an eagrán nua a bheith ar fáil roimh an Nollaig seo chugainn.  Tá £2,000 eile dá soláthar chun riar ar mhéadú a bhfuil súil leis sna deontais a íocann Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge, bord comhairlitheach neamhspleách a bunaíodh ar dtús sa bhliain 1952-53 agus a riarann scéim atá beartaithe chun cuidiú le foilsitheoirí príobháideacha i ngnóthaí gnáthlitríocht agus téacs-leabhair Ghaeilge d'fhoilsiú.  An méid leabhar ar híocadh deontais ina leith anuraidh, sé sin, sé cinn déag, ba é an uimhir ba mhó é in aon bhliain fós.  Ó bunaíodh an Bord, híocadh deontais i leith trí leabhar is caoga ar fad agus orthu san bhí ocht dtéacs-leabhar meánscoile a bhí ag teastáil go géar.  Thógh na Clubanna Leabhar Gaeilge dá gcuid comhaltaí roinnt de na leabhair ghnáthlitríochta a foilsíodh sa tslí seo.</P>
    <P>Níl, dá réir sin, aon athrú dhá dhéanamh sa soláthar de £10,500 a caitheadh roimhe seo ar ghnáth-fhoilseachán an Ghúm.  Níor mhiste dhom a lua gur fhoilsigh an Gúm anuraidh dhá cheann déag de bhun-tsaothair agus seacht geinn d'aistriúcháin de leabhair ghnáth-litríochta, téacs-leabhar Iolscoile amháin&mdash;aistriúchán&mdash;agus píosa amháin ceoil.</P>
    <P>Ó tosnaíodh ar an scéim seo chun litríocht i nGaeilge d'fhoilsiú sa mbliain 1928 go dtí seo, fhoilsíodh ós cionn míle leabhar ar fad, ag áireamh 577 de bhun-leabhair agus 433 d'aistriúcháin. Ina dteanta san, foilsíodh 168 de phíosaí ceoil.  Chomh maith leo sin, d'fhoilsigh an Roinn, fé Vóta 39, Mírcheann E, 123 de théacs-leabhair Mheánscoile, idir bhun-tsaothair agus aistriúcháin.  De na foilseacháin seo go léir, clóbhuaileadh timpeall 2,100,000 cóip agus tá ós cionn 1,250,000 de na cóipeanna sin díolta. Sin le rá gur díoladh dathad míle leabhar ar an meán in aghaidh na bliana, rud a léiríonn go bhfuil pobal léitheoireacht ann do Ghaeilge.  Go fiú na leabhair sina foilsíodh ós cionn chúig bhliana déag ó shoin, is beag ceann díobh atá fós i gcló nach ndíoltar roinnt chóipeanna de gach aon bhliain agus <Col N="656" /> tá ceannach cuíosach briosc ar na leabhair sin a foilsíodh le deich mbliana anuas.</P>
    <P>Tá sé le meabhrú, cé gur bunaíodh an Gúm chun leabhair Ghaeilge d'fhoilsiú, nár ceadaíodh dó, ar chúiseanna maithe is dóigh, oibriú mar chomhlucht gnótha sa riocht ina bhféadfadh sé leabhair d'fhoilsiú go mear agus taistealaí a chur amach á ndíol.  Thairis sin, is cosúil sna blianta tosaigh gur clóbhuaileadh níos mó cóipeanna, d'aistriúcháin ón mBéarla go háirithe, ná mar bhí de mhargadh ann dóibh. Is annamh anois a glactar le haistriúchán ón mBéarla chun a fhoilsithe, cé go bhfuil roinnt aistriúchán a bhí cheana ag na clódóirí dá bhfoilsiú fós.</P>
    <P>Ní hé ab áil liom a rá, mar adeireann daoine, gur díchéillí an rud é roinnt éigin aistriúchán d'fhoilsiú.  Más amhlaidh go bhfuil dul nua-aoiseach dhá chur go tréan ar théarmaíocht na Gaeilge agus a foclóir á leathnú, is mór dá choimaoin sin atá orainn ag saothar na n-aistritheoirí.  Ní mistre go dtuigfí freisin go gcaitear in amanna leabhair d'fhoilsiú gur beag de na gnáth-léitheoirí a mbeadh spéis acu iontu, agus chomh maith leis sin go dtarlóidh don Ghúm, mar tharlaíonn d'thoilsitheoirí eile, go bhfoilseaoidh siad anois is arís leabhar nach mbeidh éileamh mór air ar chúis nó ar chúis eile.</P>
    <P>De bharr na poiblíochta a tugadh le gairid don scéal seo, áfach, tá ceist na leabhar de chuid an Ghúm atá gan díol á scrúdú agam as an nua chun a shocrú cé mar féadfaí an díolachán d'fheabhsú nó cén bealach eile ab fhearr a féadfaí iad a chur chun leas don teanga.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar breise á dhéanamh i mbliana, fé Mhírcheann B.6. den Vóta, le haghaidh na ndeontas i leith tinrimh a híoctar le Coláistí ina dtugtar cúrsaí samhraidh i nGaeilge gach bliain do mhúinteoirí, do dhaoine eile ós cionn ocht mbliana déag d'aois agus do pháistí idir deich mbliana agus ocht mbliana déag d'aois.  Sé an méadú atá aga teacht ar an líon mac léinn a bhíonn ag freastal na gColáistí seo, a bhfuil cheithre cinn déag acu ann, iad ar fad beagnach sa Ghaeltacht, is cúis leis an mbreis seo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt do dhá mhír eile fén Vóta seo, sin Scoláireachtaí Iolscoile, B. 3, agus Léiriúchán <Col N="657" /> Drámaí i nGaeilge, B.2. I dtaobh na scoláireachtaí Iolscoile, féadaim a rá, cé go bhfuil sé beartaithe chúig cinn fhichead de scoláireachtaí, ag áireamh chúig cinn a cuireadh ar athló ó chomórtas 1957, a bhronnadhi i mbliana ar mhic léinn a bhfuil fúthu cúrsaí Iolscoile a dhéanamh thrí Ghaeilge, gur lú an méid scoláireachtaí a bheidh le hathnuachaint sa bhliain acadúil seo rómhainn ná mar bhíothas ag súil leis nuair bhí soláthar á dhéanamh dhóibh don bhliain 1957-58.  An chúis atá leis sin ná nár éirigh le roinnt scoláirí coinníollachtai athnuachainte a gcuid scoláireachtaí a chomhlíonadh nó, i roinnt chás, gur scor scoláirí dá geúrsaí staidéir.</P>
    <P>I dtaobh na Léiriúcháin Drámaíochta i nGaeilge, tá fé Chumann Drámaíochta na Scol a bhféile bhliantúil drámaíochta don bhliain seo chugainn a chur ar bun thar éis an 31ú Márta, 1959.  Dá réir sin ní bheidh aon chaiteachas ó chiste an Stáit fén mír-cheann sin sa bhliain airgeadais seo.</P>
    <P>Lasmuigh de na nithe sin a luas, tá an soláthar atá á dhéanamh fégach aon cheann de na mírchinn eile den Vóta d'Eolaíocht agus d'Ealaíon mórán mar bhá le haghaidh na bliana 1957-58.</P>
    <P>Fé Vóta 42&mdash;Scoileanna Ceartúcháin agus Scoileanna Saothair&mdash;táim ag iarraidh ar an Tigh aontú le £243,630 de mheastachán sé sin £59,720 níos mó ná Meastachán na bliana seo caite. An soláthar breise, tá sé go léir ag teacht as rátaí méadaithe atá le bheith ann ón aonú lá d'Aibreán, 1958 sa deontas caipitíochta atá iníochta ón Stát i leith leanaí agus daoine óga a chotabháil i scoileanna teastaithe, méadaithe gurb chúis áthais dom bheith i riocht iad a fhógairt do bhainisteoirí na scoileanna san le déanaí. Ós de réir na ráithe siar a íocthar na deontais seo, ní gá a sholáthar i mbliana ach an bhreis airgid is gá i leith thrí ráithe.</P>
    <P>Fé mar is eol do na Teachtaí, tá deontais chaipitíochta cothabhála iníoctha, fé réir Achtanna na Leanbh, ón Stát agus ó na h-údaráis áitiúla. Go dtí seo, siad na deontais seachtainiúla a bhí i bhfeidhm ó 1952 ná:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Scoileanna Ceartúcháin&mdash;17/6 iníoctha ag an Stát agus 15/6 go dtí 16/6 iníoctha ag an údarás áitiúil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> Scoileanna Saothair&mdash;15/- iníoctha ag an Stát agus 15/- iníoctha ag an údarás áitiúil.</P>
    <P>Siad na rátaí nua seachtainiúla ná:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Scoileanna Ceartúcháin&mdash;25/- iníoctha ag an Stát agus 23/- go dtí 24/- iníoctha ag an údarás áitiúil.</P>
    <P>Scoileanna Saothair&mdash;22/6 iníoctha ag an Stát agus 22/6 iníoctha ag an údarás áitiúil.</P>
    <P>Táim cinnte go mbeidh gach uile Theachta ar aon tuairim gur láidir an cás a bhí ag bainisteoirí na scoileanna seo agus iad ag áiteamh orm nár leor na sean-deontais.  Na rátaí nua, tugann siad 15/- de mhéadú iomlán sa tseachtain i leith gach linbh atá i Scoil Saothair, sé sin, timpeall 50 fén gcéad de mhéadú fré chéile.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh na Teachtaí go léir ar aon fhocal mar an gcéanna nach míochuíosach an iarracht é sin, agus cúrsaí airgeadais mar atá, ar bheith ag riar ar riachtanais na scoileanna so sa mhéid a bhaineann leis an gcostas breise atá ann chun na páistí seo a chothabháil.</P>
    <P>De na trí scoileanna ceartúcháin tá slí do 250 de bhuachaillí i scoil na mbhuachaillí.  Sé an líon buachaillí a bhí fé choimeád ansan ar an 31ú lá de mhí na Nollag, 1957, ná 159 sé sin, naonúr níos mó ná cothrom an lae san i 1956.  An dá scoil cheartúcháin do chailíní, tá slí iontu lena chéile do 130 de chailíní, agus sé líon cailíní a bhí iontu ar an 31 ú lá de mhí na Nollag, 1957, ná 44, sé sin, seachtar níos mó ná cothrom an lae san i 1956.</P>
    <P>Tá fé láthair 49 de scoileanna saothair ann.  Do dúnadh scoil shaothair amháin i 1957, agus is amhlaidh a aistríodh na páistí a bhí inti go dtí scoil shaothair eile a bhí féen aon-bhainisteoireacht léi. Tá slé i scoileanna na gcailíní i gcóir 4,310 agus slí i scoileanna na mbuachaillí i gcóir 2,934.  B'iad líon na mbhuachaillí agus líon na gcailíní a bhí fé choimeád i scoileanna saothair ar an 31 ú lá de mhí na Nollag, 1957, ná 2,268 agus 1,865 fé seach.  Do b'ionann san agus 166 agus 108 fé seach níos lú ná cothrom an lae sin i 1956.</P>
    <P>Sé £69,300 an soláthar atá á dhéanamh i gcóir Vóta 43, Institiúid Ard-Léinn Bhaile Átha Cliath, sa <Col N="659" /> bhliain airgeadais reatha.  Méadú é sin de £5,000 ar an soláthar le haghaidh 1957-58.  Le Scoil na Fisice Teoiriciúla a bhaineann na príomh-mhéaduithe&mdash; £2,140&mdash;agus fós le Scoil na Fisice Cosmaí&mdash;£1,830.  I geás Scoil na Fisice Teoiriciúla, tá soláthar á dhéanamh chun ollamh sinsearach a cheapadh mar chómharba don Ollamh Schroedinger a d'éirigh as an bpoist cúpla blian ó shoin.  Siad na príomhnithe is cúis leis an ardú i gcás Scoil na Fisice Cosmaí ná scoláireachtaí, ollamh cúnta a cheapadh i Roinn na nGae Cosmacha agus costaisí taistil. An £700 breise atá dá lorg do Scoil an Léinn Cheiltigh is le haghaidh caiteachais bhreise ar fhoilseacháin, leabhra agus scoláireachtaí atá sé ag teastáil.</P>
    <P>Sé iomlán an mheastacháin i leith Vóta 44, Iolscoileanna agus Coláistí, £670,200.</P>
    <P>Is lú de £1,440 é ná meastachán na bliana 1957-58.  Ar thaobh amháin, tá laghdú de £1,940 san méid atá dá íoc le Coláiste na hIolscoile, Gaillimh, rud is ionann agus an méid atá caite ag an gColáiste sin agus atá íochta cheana leo as suim de £10,000 a bhí curtha in áirithe le haghaidh cóiríocht bhreise.  Ar an taobh eile, tá méadú de £500 ann do na cúrsaí eachtracha oideachais do dhaoine fásta atá ar bun i gColáiste na hIolscoile, Corcaigh. Ó tharla Coimisiún a bheith ag breithniú ceist chóiríochta ioscoile, b'fhearr liom gan níos mó a rá fé láthair fé dheontais ioscoile i gcoitinne.  Tá rud nó dhó, áfach, nach mbeadh as alt agam a lua.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an deontas i gcóir Oideachais do Dhaoine Fásta, níor mhiste dhom a mhíniú nuair ghlacas oifig go bhfacas gur £1,500 an soláthar a bhí déanta do na cúrsaí eachtracha seo i gCorcaigh.  Ba é sin freisin an méid a soláthraíodh ina gcóir i meastachán na bliana roimhe sin.  Nuair a bhí meastacháin na bliana seo á ndéanamh amach, scrúdaíod na scéimeanna a bhí ceaptha do na cúrsaí seo sna Coláistí éagsúla agus bhíos sásta go raibh ceart ag an scéim a bhí beartaithe ag lucht a riartha i gCorcaigh ar ardú áirithe a thabhairt ina leith.

    <P>I hope I shall not give the Minister any bad example if I discuss this question in English.  I appreciate what he says in regard to the committee to be set up to deal with the general question of Irish, but I should, and I am sure the House would also, like to have more information about that, as to the ground it will cover, the personnel that will be asked to look into the matter, and some impression as to how they will assemble their information, whether they will hear witnesses, and so on.  It is very desirable that we should have that information because it is quite true that too much blame is being attached to the schools for the failure with regard to the greater spread of the language.  I think it very desirable that we should know how the committee is to go about its work.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach announced in the Seanad that such a committee was to be set up, he announced the terms of reference as being limited to an examination of the work being done in the schools.  As a result of further consideration of the matter, it was decided to extend the terms of reference so as to look at the position in general with regard to the Irish language, and, as a result, it is a matter not for me any more but for the Government in general, possibly for the Taoiseach.  I think that should be explained, and that is why I made no detailed reference to it.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, and it is because I did so that I mentioned it now, so that before the discussion on the Department of Education ends, we might get further information. So much of the impact of the discussion falls back on the Department and on the schools and the teachers that it is desirable that, before the end of this discussion, we should know what the terms of reference are, or some information about them.  I make that point only in passing. I appreciate there may be a certain amount of delay in deciding on the terms of reference, and on the personnel, and in figuring out whether any kind of directive should be given to the committee as to the way they should examine the present situation.</P>
      <P>I hope I shall not give bad example to anybody if I discuss this Estimate now in English.  I appreciate that the Minister introduced the Estimate in Irish and I hope that by the time this committee the Minister has spoken about has done its work, we shall be a little more familiar with the language.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us two things. He proposes to introduce a béal-scrudú for Irish in the Leaving Certificate and he feels there is general approval of that and he has indicated to those concerned with schools and their management the lines on which the examination will be conducted.  I wish we had a little more detailed information on that point.  The Leaving Certificate is a competitive examination from many points of view and the Minister in his statement, I understand, made some point about dropping the Easter orals for entrance to training colleges and substituting an interview, an examination of the qualifications of applicants, but says that they will be called on the basis of the results in the Leaving Certificate.  There are other competitive elements in the Leaving Certificate and I should like a general indication of how the Minister thinks he is going to keep an equitable competitive standard where a particular type of examination covering, say, 7,000 students is to be carried out.  I do not know what period it will take, but, as I understand it, there will be some inspectors and secondary school teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="664" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

      <P>National school inspectors</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, national school inspectors and teachers.  I cannot imagine a competitive scheme being worked in that way.  If we take the 7,000 pupils who go for the Leaving Certificate every year&mdash;I think the figure is somewhere between 6,000 and 7,000&mdash;and consider an oral examination in Irish, I do not know whether it is to be a cat's lick of an examination for the generality of students or whether it will be a real oral examination. I do not know how long a proper oral examination would take.  Probably it would require at least ten minutes. In oral examinations&mdash;I suppose they have plenty of experience of them in many ways&mdash;I think the greater part of the examination time may go on the candidate's warming up or being warmed up, and how you can have a reasonable examination in any less time than ten minutes, I do not know.</P>
      <P>That problem expresses itself then in terms of the number of people who will carry out the test and the number of days it will take and the standard of the questions put.  The questions cannot all be the same: if they were, the people examined one week will have an advantage over the people examined the week before.  I know there is a systematic way of maintaining a standard in dealing with competitive examinations on the basis of written tests, but whether you will be able to apply that to oral examinations is another question.  The Minister has, therefore, left us a little in the dark in respect of his proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to quarrel with the Minister in trying to get in a scheme of oral examination in any part of the secondary education programme by way of experiment and I can understand his attempt to do that at the point of least difficulty, but whether an oral examination applied at the tail end of the secondary school career can have very much effect is a matter that remains to be seen.  I must say it is completely experimental, and the Minister having decided it, I do not know that anybody here will quarrel with him.  Perhaps a parliamentary institution is not the place where the <Col N="665" /> question may best arise.  It will probably come from others more closely connected with education and I think they would be in a better position to judge the advisability of it. I do not question, or criticise in any way, the Minister's experiment in the matter, but I should like a little more information</P>
    <P>The Minister has also indicated that he intends to remove the marriage rule in relation to women primary teachers. That naturally strikes me, at any rate, as one of those complete reversions of policy that we run into now and then. The Minister has declared his complete faith in the belief that he is doing the right thing, but he has not told us any more about it, except that it will relieve him somewhat in regard to the present shortage of teachers.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his introductory speech:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ba mhaith liom a rá go láidir go bhfuilim sásta, tríd is tríd agus tar éis gach aon ní a chur san áireamh, gurab é an toradh faidthéarma atá tagaithe as feidhmiú na rialach ná cailliúnt ó thaobh cúrsaí oideachais agus cúrsaí sóisialta.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's opinion on that at all.  I should like to hear the A, B, C, D of the points the Minister had in mind as to how it has affected education and what are the social drawbacks to require women primary teachers to retire on marriage.  The Minister is forced into the matter entirely by the condition of staffing that exists in the primary schools.  I can appreciate the Minister's taking the easy way out of a very pressing problem there.  I know if this is not done now, it will continue for a long time.  When the Minister says there is a problem to be dealt with and that he will do this, I would not make it a matter of controversy either here or any place else, but it does seem like jerking a situation in a direction contrary to the direction that was deliberately set out upon some 20 years or more ago.</P>
    <P>It is brought about by a situation in which there is a lack of the proper <Col N="666" /> numbers of teachers in the primary schools, in which there are a certain number of unqualified teachers in these schools at present and in which there is a recommendation from the Council of Education that would indicate that the classes generally are too large and that a substantial additional number of teachers, both men and women, is necessary.  While it is encouraging to see that the Minister can make up his mind to do a particular thing, I wish I could take it that he will go ahead with other tasks.</P>
    <P>I have moved to refer back this Estimate for the purpose of asking the Minister to take notice of a particular aspect of the present position which is of vital urgency and which will have to be faced.  The Minister told us he will have additional teachers, that the proposal to retain married teachers will leave him with something over 500 additional teachers now.  I am not quite sure if that is so?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into question and answer on this, but I do not understand what is the significance of 1st July, whether it <Col N="667" /> applies to new entrants to the training college after that or to people who have already gone out and can to be taken back &mdash;whether the marriage rule has been wiped out with retrospective effect or not?  We are not told in relation to this substantial additional provision of teachers whether the Minister proposes forthwith or in the immediate future to make any change in the size of classes or in the number of teachers who will be allocated to various types of schools, based on either attendance or enrolment.</P>
      <P>The question of education has found itself mixed up with a lot of other things.  Quite a number of commissions which have looked into the general position in this country in regard to youth unemployment and emigration have had occasion to bring into their reports the position in regard to education.  The Youth Unemployment Commission, which was set up on 26th May, 1943, found it desirable to issue an interim report in June, 1944, nearly 14 years ago, on certain aspects of education.</P>
      <P>When I addressed the Council of Education in May, 1950, when it was set up, I had occasion to draw their attention to the fact that in June, 1944, an interim report had been received by the Minister for Industry and Commerce from the Commission on Youth Unemployment, which was presided over by His Grace, Most Rev. Dr. McQuaid, Archbishop of Dublin. That interim report was to the effect that the commission had decided unanimously to recommend the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  That the school-leaving age should ultimately be raised to 16 years of age;</P>
      <P>(b)  That as soon as conditions shall permit, education up to the age of 16 years should be full-time education, in a sense later to be defined by this commission, for urban and rural areas;</P>
      <P>(c)  That immediate steps should be taken, especially in the County Borough of Dublin, to provide the accommodation, equipment and teaching staff required to give effect to the foregoing recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> I have quoted from page 15 of the Terms of Reference and General Regulations for the Council of Education.</P>
    <P>That report was made in June, 1944, by a commission set up in 1943, and which did not finish its work and issue its report until July, 1951, because a certain aspect of education struck them as being a matter of urgency. Almost at the same time, the Department of Education had set up a departmental committee, and in posing this problem to the Council of Education I had to draw attention to the examination of the situation that was made by the departmental committee set up in March, 1945, and which reported in June, 1947.  It had been set up by the Minister for Education at the time for the purpose of considering how primary, secondary and vocational education could be improved and what were the facilities available for university education.  I told the council what the implications of that report were, and I quote from page 14 of the same document:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  particularly in the small schools satisfactory primary instruction is difficult to assure to children beyond the age of 12 years;</P>
    <P>(2)  the curriculum up to 12 years requires to be revised with possible differentiation in the case of girls;</P>
    <P>(3)  a completely fresh approach is required to the curriculum from 12 to 14 or 15 or 16 years of age, with a very definite differentiation here between boys and girls;</P>
    <P>(4)  special attention requires to be given to the question whether the post-12 instruction considered desirable can normally be given in primary schools; and</P>
    <P>(5)  if so, what steps can be taken for the provision and/or training of teachers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those were the implications of a purely departmental report which reported to the Minister in June, 1947.</P>
    <P>Looking at the situation generally, I adopted the policy of setting up a council of education and I announced in April, 1950, that that council had been set up.  It held its first meeting in May, 1950.  It made its first report <Col N="669" /> in May, 1954, and in September of that year I arranged that a departmental examination and consideration would proceed with all possible speed and that the recommendations made in the report would be sent to all the principal bodies responsible in the educational world, whether managerial, Church or on the teaching side.  The idea was that everybody connected with the educational world, and outside it, would have an opportunity of giving evidence to the Council of Education on the subject matter under consideration.</P>
    <P>When the recommendations were made, and while the Department was looking at these recommendations prior to taking any decision to take action, I felt that the bodies concerned with the actual carrying out of the work should review the recommendations, say what they had to say about them, and the final review in the Department would be in the light of what they had to say; and any decision that the Minister, after consultation with the Government, might take would be taken in the fullest possible knowledge of what was thought of the recommendations by the bodies principally connected with education and in the light of their own view as to how the situation in the educational world was likely to affect people generally.</P>
    <P>The last comment on the council's recommendations came in in January, 1956, and the resulting departmental examination of the situation was finished in April, 1956.  Then the matter, fully digested and considered, was in my hands.  I put it before the Government.  It was not until November of that year that I was able to give publicity to the conclusions to which we had come.  There was publication in the matter in November, 1956.</P>
    <P>There was then a change of Government and I do not know whether anything definite has been decided.  I am not speaking of the Council of Education. I am speaking of the position in which the Minister and the country generally find themselves.  This examination was carried out in that way. Suggestions and recommendations were made and, in so far as the schools and <Col N="670" /> education, children and teachers, are concerned, we are dealing with something that has reached a particular point.  It is 14 years now since the Youth Unemployment Commission had certain suggestions to make with regard to the school leaving age and the Department, as long ago as 1947, had something to say from its own knowledge and examination of the position.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in the position now that he has a report making recommendations, a report made four years ago.  The digest of the situation, with the conclusions reached, are two years old and they should, therefore, relate to what ought to be happening in the primary schools up to 12 years of age. The council were asked in November, 1954, to consider the general pattern of primary and post-primary education, to advise as to the curriculum which should be followed in recognised secondary schools as a condition of the payment of grants from State funds to these schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that that report will shortly be in his hands. With that report shortly in his hands, the Minister's position will be that, if he does not make up his mind now as to what will be done with regard to the recommendations of the Council of Education in the work of the primary schools up to 12 years of age, then not only will there be a delay in relation to the national school but there will also be delay in the super-structure to be raised on that.  At any rate, the Council of Education or any other body, will not be in a position to say what they would recommend should be done, or what they could hope would be done in the national school from 12 years onwards; and they will not be able to examine what improvements could be made either on the continuation side or on the technical side of things.</P>
    <P>I want, therefore, to impress on the Minister the importance of getting clear immediately as to what will be done with regard to the recommendations of the Councils of Education on the one hand and, on the other hand, what machinery will be used for further pursuing an examination as to what improvements are required in the <Col N="671" /> primary schools after 12 years of age, and what kind of examination will be carried out in respect of continuation education and technical education to assure to those concerned with education a satisfactory review of the whole position, clearly demonstrating that the Department and the Government have taken a clear line as to curriculum and organisation in relation to the national school, the continuation school, the technical school and the secondary school.</P>
    <P>I do not want to discuss anything that was done in the past by any other person.  I am dealing with the position as it is to-day.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he considers that the Council of Education on the lines on which it is at present constituted for examining certain aspects of education, and having their proposals reported on to the Department by those vitally concerned with the actual carrying out of education, should be continued.  If not, what would be substitute in its place?</P>
    <P>The importance of the question arises in many ways.  In November, we had arrived at the position that certain recommendations of the Council of Education could be accepted, that the curriculum for primary education ought to be changed in a particular way and that the staffing of national schools should be improved.  However, just as the Minister is not able to restore the 10 per cent. grant to the secondary schools at the present time&mdash; I am glad he is able to restore the 6 per cent grant to the vocational schools&mdash;either in capital expenditure, on the one hand, or in increasing current expenditure, on the other hand, we were in the position that the Government were not able to agree that they could have the additional expenditure contemplated by some of the things which I thought should be brought into operation.  Nevertheless, that does not get away from the problem.</P>
    <P>One of the things about which it is necessary to be clear is the fact that the general educational system here is fundamentally sound.  Both in the corps of teachers and in the corps of <Col N="672" /> managers, together with the various bodies of one kind or another that take an interest in education, it is a native production.  It has established itself not only in the country generally but by its work it has shown abroad that we compare quite favourably with any other country that has educational difficulties or that has any kind of an educational establishment.</P>
    <P>We hear Americans to-day asking what has gone wrong with United States education.  We hear all kinds of criticism as to the ineffectiveness and unsatisfactory position of education, in certain aspects, in Great Britain to-day. However, consider some of our young children whom circumstances bring to Britain.  Only some weeks ago we saw that a young Irish boy who went to Manchester created quite a problem for the Manchester education authorities.  According to his age, he should be in a particular class there but, because of his attainments and educational standard, he would be wasting his time in that class.  Quite a problem was created for the educational authorities there at almost a constitutional level.  Ultimately, the boy was allowed to go two or three classes ahead.</P>
    <P>We hear the criticism that too little science is being taught in the country. A very distinguished engineer from Great Britain, talking to some engineers here comparatively recently, was able to say that for a country with such a relatively small population he did not know how we managed to turn out so many highly-qualified people. Therefore, our system is sound and it is native and you do not want to blue-print in a way that will dig up the educational humus that is there.</P>
    <P>Criticism of a petty and of a big type is developing outside.  You know how an atmosphere can be created that becomes inflammatory and that bemuses people.  People who are not close to the work of education become disheartened and believe something that emanates from the atmosphere of criticism.  In these circumstances, it is vitally important that our people should know the bodies and the people that, fundamentally, have the qualifications <Col N="673" /> to advise and to act in the educational world.</P>
    <P>I do not think this House is a proper place in which to say how algebra or even how Irish should be taught. However, we ought to have shown to us clearly the people on whose judgement we can rely with regard to these matters.  Through our administration, we ought to bring about a situation in which these various bodies are dovetailed and their work co-ordinated so as to enable them to work in the most effective and harmonious way, to exchange their experience, energies and outlook.</P>
    <P>In the Council of Education, 30 people, odd, were brought together, not as representatives but as people qualified in particular ways.  I think that a council of that kind is good.  I do not speak about it either as an idea of my own or as personnel brought together.  I am just putting the question to the Minister: does he propose to continue to have a council of that particular type?  It brings the Department, in a fresh-air kind of way, into close touch with an organised machinery for examining matters and assembling thought.  It enables thought and ideas to be put at the Department's door in such a way that they can be examined and the results sent to the various representative bodies.</P>
    <P>With regard to the curriculum in the primary schools, with regard to the staffing of the primary schools, with regard to what has further to be considered in relation to the continuation and technical schools, very important points have to be cleared up.  It is imperative, also, that there should be cleared up for people in national schools and other schools the question whether or not the machinery of examination will be of the Council of Education type.</P>
    <P>With regard to those matters which require to be decided at the present moment, there is the curriculum in the primary schools.  I had the idea that, by November, 1956, or at least by January, 1957, the Department would be in a position to tell the various organisations connected with teaching, the recommendations the Minister for <Col N="674" /> Education at that time would like to bring into force so far as the change in the curriculum is concerned.  I think he might be in a position to say what the Government approach is with regard to changes and improvement in the staff.  I thought it might be possible to have these communications made to the various people concerned in time to have all the information before the I.N.T.O. by the time they met at their Easter congress in that year, but, as I say, it did not happen.</P>
    <P>I should like the House to understand what that meant in a general way.  Under the proposal with regard to the research and advisory section, the provision of certain manuals, the provision of needlework and kindergarten equipment, the provision of presses and particularly the establishment of additional training facilities for national teachers and the increasing of the staffs in the schools inside a particular time, the cost would be £100,000 in 1957-58, about £192,000 in 1958-59 and about £180,000 in 1959-60, including in the whole of that time a capital expenditure of £250,000 for the buildings for teachers, if the Department or the Department of Finance had to make that provision.</P>
    <P>The position has been that the training colleges' authorities themselves have nominally provided the capital for their buildings and that the grants to the training colleges have been such as to help them to pay off their capital expenditure. As regards the cost, once the capital sum goes out, the increasing cost would mount from £103,000 in 1960-61 to about £300,000 in 1965-66 and about £1,200,000 at the end of a period of about 15 years.  That did not include things we would normally have liked to have done with regard to proposals for heating and cleaning or the maintenance of some of the schools.</P>
    <P>When we consider what these figures run to and the amount being spent on education now as compared with a few years ago, it seems a great pity to be disturbing our educational world by not having the necessary teachers, or not having them trained, or not having the type of equipment necessary to make the teaching in the national schools satisfactory from the teachers' <Col N="675" /> point of view and enable a more satisfactory curriculum to be pursued.</P>
    <P>In the year 1947-48, the total amount of money spent on the Primary Vote was £5,159,000, while in the current year it is £9,200,000.  I am dealing only with the primary side of things.  With that type of expenditure on the proposals that could reasonably be put into operation, it seems strange that difficulties should arise in the schools. The Minister spoke about the removal of the rule in relation to marriage. According to himself, that eases the position on the teachers' side.  I should like to ask whether that easing enables him to make any concessions in the staffing of schools or, in consultation with teachers and managers, to improve the curriculum in accordance with the proposals made in November or December of 1956.  It is of the greatest possible urgency that that matter be attended to, from the point of view of the work to be done in the future in the national schools up to the age of 12.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether the Council of Education will be encouraged to continue its work or, if it is proposed to make a change, whether some other body will be enabled to say what the national schools curriculum should be from the age of 12 upwards.  That is a matter of very serious importance.  Furthermore, I should like to ask the Minister if he proposes to make an examination into the continuation side of education.  I submit that is the kernel of the problem in the Department.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Irish language, the recommendations of the Council of Education imply that they consider this question should be reviewed systematically and scientifically.  In regard <Col N="676" /> to the council's proposals for the setting up of a research and advisory section in the Department, I would ask the Minister whether, if he proposes to set up such a section, the teaching of Irish is to take priority in that section.  There is no reason why such a research section should not deal with other important questions, at the same time as it is dealing with the question of Irish.</P>
    <P>In relation to the committee which is inquiring into the position of University College, Dublin, I am glad the universities have now come into the position that the Minister is answerable for them in the Dáil.  There is a wide gamut there and, from the point of view of practical discussion, it cannot be covered very well.  Some of the difficulties can be overcome by the placing of responsibility on the various bodies dealing with education and by more definite agreement between the Department and those bodies, that the curriculum is sound and that everybody is doing the best he can.  Then we might be able to give more attention to some of the higher educational problems, of which there are many.</P>
    <P>I saw comparatively recently that there was some application for additional funds for the dental school.  I should like to ask the Minister if he has anything to say with regard to the position of the dental school and dental education, or with regard to the difficulties of other medical schools.</P>
