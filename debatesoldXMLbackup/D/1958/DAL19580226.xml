    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the ever-increasing cost of living, he will state the policy of the Government in regard to wage increases to offset increases in the cost of living which have arisen since 20th March, 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (thar cheann an Taoisigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence that the cost of living is at the moment increasing.  In fact, the Consumer Price Index showed a reduction of one point in November last, compared with the previous August.</P>
      <P>As has been made clear in a number of public statements, the Government are convinced that higher money incomes not accompanied by increased productivity result in higher prices and, in our present circumstances, tend to create increased unemployment.  This fact was recognised by both parties to the agreement reached last year between the Federated Union of Employers and the Provisional United Trade Union Organisation.  The principles expressed in that agreement are in harmony with the Government's views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Higher standards for workers are one of the main objectives of economic policy, but their realisation must follow, not precede, increased output and efficiency.  In present circumstances, the Government consider that increased employment, following on expansion <Col N="612" /> of trade, should be the predominant aim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is not serious when he tells us that there is no evidence of a rise in the cost of living! Everybody knows quite well that the cost of living has risen considerably and is rising still.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As was stated in the reply, there is no evidence that it is doing so at the moment.  In fact, there has been a drop of one point since August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

      <P>The posts of director and assistant to the director of the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office were created on the 1st April, 1951, but the first occupant of the post of assistant to the director did not take up duty until the 7th April, 1952.  The inclusive annual salaries of the present holders of the posts are £2,301 and £1,848, respectively.</P>
      <P>The director is responsible, under the general instructions of the Attorney-General, for initiating proposals for law reform and consolidation and for preparing draft Bills to give effect to such proposals.  In addition, the office prepares for publication the annual volume of the statutes, the separate index thereto and the periodical consolidated index to the statutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> The Bills for the following law reform, statute law revision and consolidation Acts, which were drafted by the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office since its establishment, have been enacted:&mdash;Defence Act, 1954; State Property Act, 1954; Arbitration Act, 1954; Mortmain (Repeal of Enactments) Act, 1954; Fisheries (Statute Law Revision) Act, 1956; Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956; Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, and Statute of Limitations, 1957, and the texts of the following consolidation Bills drafted by the Office are at present before either the Dáil or the Seanad:&mdash;Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1957, and Destructive Insects and Pests (Consolidation) Bill, 1957.</P>

I am advised that this system has no such merits as <Col N="617" /> would justify its being imposed compulsorily on suppliers.  Developments in other countries are being kept under review, and should a system which gives promise of greater accuracy than that now in use be developed consideration will be given to introducing it here.</P>

      <P>The operating arrangements are based on a revival of the agreement concluded with the American company in 1952, subject to certain changes designed to bring that agreement up to date.  The most significant change is that the service will be operated initially not with D.C.4 aircraft, as provided for in the 1952 agreement, but with Super-Constellations.</P>

    <P>I informed the Deputy in reply to a supplementary question on the 12th February that I would consider communicating the full terms of the agreement to the Dáil but that prior consultation with the private interests concerned would be necessary.

      <P>The total capital expenditure on the acquisition of lands, construction of runways, erection of buildings and the provision of equipment, etc., at Shannon Airport including Foynes amounted to £2,913,073 at the 31st March, 1957, the latest date for which figures are available.  This figure includes expenditure both by my Department and by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  While it is not possible fully to segregate the expenditure between Shannon and Foynes, the expenditure incurred by my Department at Foynes on constructional works including the furnishing of buildings and on the acquisition of land, amounted to £178,100.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the hostel at Foynes was disposed of to Limerick County Council for use as a hospital. The total amount realised on the disposal of buildings and equipment at Foynes was £15,422; in addition, certain items of equipment, the value of which cannot readily be stated, were transferred from Foynes for use at Shannon.</P>
      <P>The operation of the airport has shown an operating surplus since 31st March, 1955, as a consequence of which the aggregate of the deficits of earlier years was reduced to £1,253,213.</P>

      <P>As shown in the company's published balance sheet as at 31st March, 1957, the sale by Aerlinte Éireann Teo. of aircraft in 1948 realised a capital profit of £457,005, which, when added to the company's issued capital of £1,425,005, brought the total amount of the company's resources to £1,882,010.  Of this amount, £1,083,470 was advanced to the Minister for Finance and £798,540 to Aer Rianta.  These advances are repayable and are free of interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether the State Government of West Bengal, from which State 80 per cent. of this country's tea requirement is shipped, has for the past several years imposed a tax of approximately 1¼d. per pound on all tea coming within its jurisdiction, other than tea for consignment to London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the tax referred to by the Deputy was imposed by the State Government of Bengal, in May, 1956.  The tax does not apply to tea consigned on behalf of the producer for subsequent sale in any tea market outside India, whether <Col N="627" /> in London or elsewhere.  In the opinion of Tea Importers, Limited, this tax, like other charges on tea imposed by the Central Government and State Governments of India, is payable by the seller and not by the buyer.  It is not known what is the objective of the tax which appears to be contrary to the declared policy of the Central Indian Government to favour direct purchases of tea in India.  Representations on these lines were made by Tea Importers, Limited, to the Indian Tea Council immediately after imposition of the tax and I have since caused representations to be made to the Indian Government in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit there is a certain inconsistency.  If the view of Tea Importers, Limited, is correct that tax is payable by the seller of the tea and does not affect the price of tea sold at the auctions then we have not much interest in the matter; but in so far as it indicates support for a policy of sending tea on consignment to auctions in other countries, we are seeking clarification.  So far as we know it is the policy of the Indian Government to favour the direct purchase of tea in India and not the sending of tea on consignment for auction abroad. It is possible that what has happened in the State of Bengal arose out of internal Indian politics and I do not imagine it is a situation which can last very long.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that all the townlands mentioned in the Deputies' questions are included in Bohola rural area which was developed under the rural electrification scheme in 1950-51 but that when the area was being developed the householders in the townlands in question showed little interest in taking supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board are prepared to extend supply to these townlands as post-development <Col N="629" /> work and as the capital costs are likely to be considerable, it may be necessary for the board to quote special service charges to many of the householders, in addition to the standard rate of fixed charge.  I understand that the householders concerned will shortly be given a further opportunity of taking supply and, if a sufficient number of them accept the terms quoted, the board hope to have the work of extending supply carried out by a construction crew which is now operating in an adjoining rural area.</P>

      <i>(a)</i> These figures represent the expenditure to which the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, applies.  In addition there has been some expenditure, e.g., on loan charges, which does not rank for health grant.  The amount involved, however, is relatively small.</P>
    <P>In the case of any individual health authority, the division of the expenditure on tuberculosis services, to which the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947 applies between central and local funds in the years up to and including 1952-53 was determined by the relative levels of expenditure on all health services in that year and in the standard year.  For the year 1953-54 and from then onwards when the total expenditure of every health authority exceeded twice the expenditure in the standard year, the expenditure on tuberculosis services has been divided equally between central and local funds.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i> This represents the amount paid on foot of deficits in the special voluntary hospitals dealing solely with tuberculosis.  There were deficits payable in respect of other hospitals which had tuberculosis sections but it has not been possible to determine how much of the deficits of these hospitals is attributable to the tuberculosis beds.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(c)</i> This represents the estimated expenditure of the Department of Social Welfare on sickness, etc. benefits paid to insured persons suffering from tuberculosis.  An accurate figure could be obtained only by an expenditure of time and labour which would not be justified.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(d)</i> This represents authorised borrowings by health authorities from the Local Loans Fund and from their treasurers.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(e)</i> This represents the total capital expenditure from the Hospitals' Trust Fund in respect of tuberculosis hospitals.  During the years 1953-54 to 1956-57 inclusive that Fund received subventions from the Exchequer amounting to £6,780,000 but such subventions were applied in respect of the expenditure from the Fund generally and were not allocated to specific purposes.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a certain number of persons have become liable for unforeseen expenses in the circumstances mentioned in the question, but I have no reason to believe that the number involved is substantial.</P>
      <P>The benefits available under the Health Acts to eligible persons who enter private or semi-private accommodation in a hospital are limited to a daily subvention of 8/-, together with contributions towards the cost of certain drugs and appliances.  Any further charges by the hospital and any medical fees are the liability of the patient.  These provisions have been explained in communications from my Department to local authorities, hospital authorities and other interested parties and considerable publicity has been given to the provisions of the Health Acts by means of statements in the Press and explanatory leaflets on the subject issued by health authorities.</P>
      <P>In their own interests, people should, before accepting private or semi-private accommodation, make inquiries as to their liability for additional charges, and I do not see what further action I could usefully take in the matter.</P>

The representations made by the Birr Urban District Council and other interested parties, together with the report of the inspector who held the public local inquiry in the matter, were carefully considered by me before I arrived at a decision to confirm the order.</P>
      <P>In this connection, I would like to mention that, under the provisions of Section 85 of the Health Act, 1947, a person who or whose property is affected by a compulsory acquisition order may, in certain circumstances, appeal to the High Court for the complete or partial annulment of the order.  Any such appeal must be lodged within three weeks after the first publication by advertisement of notice of the confirmation of the order by the Minister.  As I have already mentioned, I understand that notice of confirmation was published on 15th instant; accordingly, the three week period expires on the 7th prox.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>A letter dated 19th February containing the request referred to in the question has been received in my Department.  The request raises an issue of wide application. The fundamental basis of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, is that the State bears the whole of the cost of construction works and that liability for the full cost of maintenance of the completed works rests with the county councils concerned.  It is not proposed to introduce legislation to amend these provisions and, in the circumstances, the reception of a deputation would serve no useful purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the imposition of the cost of this maintenance work will increase the rate in County Louth by at least 8d. and, in view of the fact that the main arterial drainage work was carried out for the express purpose of increasing agricultural output throughout the country as a whole at the expense of the Exchequer, does he not agree that the maintenance work should be borne by the Government for the very same reason?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state (a) why the amount of the grant available per cow in respect of the construction of cow byres has been reduced, particularly having regard to the importance of <Col N="650" /> the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme, and (b) the amount of such grants paid since the scheme for the payment of a double grant was commenced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I find myself with a commitment of £3,000,000 in respect of applications for these double byre grants which cannot be disposed of for a considerable time I cannot accept further commitments.  I have, however, decided that the grant payable for repairs to byres will in future be the full approved estimated labour cost of repairs subject to a maximum equivalent to three-fifths of the appropriate grant for a new byre.  This is double the rate of grant for repairs payable up to now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind the supreme importance of an expeditious realisation of the tuberculosis eradication scheme in cattle, would the Minister not reconsider his decision, especially as the liability in respect of these double byre grants does not come in course of payment until the herd has attained an attested status?  Though his present liability may appear very large, as it does not come in course of payment until each new herd has attained attested status, the probability of the charge falling on any one year is remote in the extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a supplementary question on which I could make a very long speech but I do not propose to do so.  In fact, it is not a decision made by me at all because my very good friend and former Minister, Deputy James Dillon, in January, 1957, decided that the double byre grant should be abandoned.  He reported his finding to the then Minister for Finance who approved of his decision.  I am not blaming my predecessor for this nor am I disputing the wisdom of <Col N="651" /> his decision.  Certainly, I do not blame him, for not announcing in January, 1957, that he had arrived at this decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Minister he is mistaken in that belief.  It is perfectly true that I changed the basis of the double byre grant to a new basis which required the farmer to attain an attested status for his herd in order to qualify for it.  I did that and I announced it in this House.  That is the only decision I took.  I think the Minister will agree that the farmer has no other inducement at all, beyond the public good&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The alteration to which he refers now was made in November, 1956, but I am referring to a decision made in January, 1957, and reported as being made by him to the Minister for Finance at the time, who approved of that decision.  But, as I say, do not think that I will shelter behind that, because I believe that having regard to the circumstances the decision was a very wise one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The alteration in the floor price was made in order to bring the price of native barley to the feeder more into line with the price of imported barley; the c.i.f. prices quoted for imported barley at present vary from 35/6 to 40/9 per barrel. (b) Deductions to be made for excess moisture content are designed to encourage the delivery of barley in good condition.  (c) The price announced is not a statutory price; it is intended to ensure that barley growers will not get less than 37/- a barrel delivered for barley with 20 per cent. moisture or less&mdash;if they are able to obtain a higher price they are free to do so.  Growers' representatives did suggest that provision should be made for the payment of allowances in respect of barley with a moisture of less than 20 per cent.</P>

      <P>On the 22nd February, I received a letter on behalf of six of the eight members of the committee intimating that, while very considerable progress had been made in the preparation of joint comments by them, it was unlikely that the comments could be furnished before the 1st March as requested by me, but I was assured that the matter was being dealt with as expeditiously as possible and that there would be no avoidable delay.  The answer to the remainder of the question is in the negative.  Now, has the Deputy anything else to say?</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if it is a fact that he and he alone has been responsible for circulating the rumour in the dairying districts to the effect that the price of milk is about to be considerably reduced; so that when the Minister comes to make a statement he will leave the price of milk as it is and then there will be a rush, on a signal, to say he is a great man, that he did not allow the price of milk to go down?  It is a fraud and he knows it is a fraud.</P>

      <P>That the Committee of Public Accounts, to be appointed in pursuance of Standing Order No. 123 at the beginning of the financial year 1958-59, be, notwithstanding the said Standing Order, now appointed, and that the members of the committee be nominated by the Committee of Selection;</P>
      <P>That the committee have power to send for persons, papers and records;</P>
      <P>That the Appropriation Accounts, with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General for the year ended 31st March, 1957, be referred to the committee for examination and report.</P>
      <P>Standing Order No. 123 of the Standing Order of Dáil Éireann relative to Public Business provides that there shall be appointed, at the beginning of each financial year, a Select Committee to be designated &ldquo;the Committee of Public Accounts&rdquo; and assigns certain duties to the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past the general practice has been to set up the committee as soon after the commencement of the financial year as the Appropriation Accounts next due for publication were <Col N="662" /> available.  Generally, the report of the committee was presented to the Dáil about two years after the close of the financial year to which the report refers.</P>
    <P>There has recently been a move by the Department of Finance to have the Appropriation Accounts for each financial year issued as soon as possible after the close of that year and, in pursuance of that policy, the Accounts for the financial year 1956-57 are now available.  The Committee of Public Accounts on the Appropriation Accounts for 1955-56 completed its work and reported on 19th February, 1958.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it is felt that rather than wait for the reassembly of the Dáil after the Easter Recess, the Committee of Public Accounts for the coming financial year should be set up now and work commenced on the 1956-57 Appropriation Accounts.</P>
    <P>A similar procedure was adopted in 1939 when the committee for the year 1939-40 was set up on the 22nd February, 1939&mdash;over five weeks before the close of the preceding financial year&mdash;and again in 1940 when the committee for the year 1940-41 was set up on 1st March, 1940&mdash;over four weeks before the close of the preceeding financial year.</P>

      <P>Before Section 3 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.&mdash;Nothing in the Act shall be construed as affecting within five <Col N="663" /> years of the date of the passing of this Act the tenure of office of any person who immediately before the passing of this Act is the holder of any of the offices specified at (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Section 1 of this Act.</P>
    <P>This day week I made a case for this amendment so I would just like now to submit to the Minister the heads of what I said.  This is a time for retrenchment.  If the Waterford City Manager is retired now it means he will be paid a pension and the incoming man will be paid a full salary and he will take some time to settle down.  The present man has shown he is competent to do the job and he should be left there.  I would also point out to the Minister that, in my opinion, this is a precedent, and in respect of any member of the Civil Service who has been employed and whose terms of employment say he should be retired at 65, it may be possible for the present Minister or future Ministers to bring in a Bill to remove him.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned here during the debate the last time that I did not mention any other public servant than the Waterford City Manager.  I consider that this Bill concerns the Waterford City Manager and nobody else. Therefore, if I mentioned any other type of people I would be out of order. The last thing I will say for the Waterford City Manager is that in Waterford at present and going on for the past seven or eight years we have one of the best direct labour schemes in the whole country.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to meet me in this amendment.</P>

It is a bad thing and I am wondering if the Minister could find any way of getting round that objection. These persons were appointed on certain terms.  Going back over those appointments is undesirable and it does create a precedent which might be followed in the future with detrimental effects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the last speaker would be that, as has already been said on the Second Reading of this Bill, the purpose of it is merely to confirm what has already existed but about which some doubts were raised. The question of its being retrospective really does not arise as it has operated and has been accepted by a number of managers over recent years and I think a few of them&mdash;which will answer Deputy Casey's question&mdash;the managers of Laois-Offaly, Wicklow, Monaghan, Cork and Carlow-Kildare, have gone out under the terms of the existing law before this was brought in at all.  The reason for bringing this Bill in and making it appear retrospective is the fact that in a particular case doubt has been raised as to the effectiveness of the existing legislation which seemed to have been legal enough and binding enough for many others to have gone out under it in years gone by.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Lynch's plea, I can only say that, particularly due to its nature and the manner in which he has made the plea, I am sorry I cannot go some little way to meet him.  It is impossible, as I have already indicated, to allow one officer or a few officers as the case might be, to benefit from a doubt that may or may not exist and which has never been tested, and it is in order to avoid the testing of that doubt possibly that we come with this Bill at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> It would be an unfair argument, to point out, as has been done by the Deputy, that, in retiring any specific manager&mdash;he mentioned the Waterford City Manager&mdash;in these times of retrenchment we are adding to the cost of the public service.  That is quite true but is it not also true of every other public servant who is reaching retiring age?  If we were to do it in this case, is there not a case to be made for leaving all of them in their present positions until they die or retire of their own free will to the exclusion of the younger people who are coming up and looking for work and who, if they do not get it and have no prospect of it, would only add to the stream of people who must of necessity leave the country?  That is all I feel it is necessary for me to say in regard to the argument put forward.  No real case has been made for the acceptance of this amendment and I would ask the House to reject it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has rightly pointed out, this Bill is merely a Bill to tie up certain knots in an Act which I introduced some years ago.  I should like to say that those knots could have been tied at the time were it not for the pressure exerted by some of the Minister's colleagues to have certain managers retained at that time and I think I did go a long distance towards meeting them.  But again, as the Minister has said, the manager to whom Deputy Lynch has referred is a man whose period of office has been extended over five years and who is now 70 years of age.  However, I do remember the ex-Lord Mayor of Dublin, Deputy Briscoe, making a special plea for the retention of the present city manager, for whom I have nothing but the greatest respect, but this Bill will tie that knot and put him out of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill in itself is a good piece of legislation.  It is a Bill that is necessary to tie up these loose ends which we all discover in legislation after we have had some practical experience of it.  I am sorry I was not here when the Bill was introduced and I assure the Minister it was not out of disrespect to <Col N="666" /> him that I was not present when he brought this measure before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is right to say that the Waterford City Manager is five years over his time. Under his conditions of employment, there was no question of 65 years as a retiring age.  Therefore, that does not arise, I respectfully submit to the Minister.  What I am endeavouring to point out is that for the future this matter could be tied up, but that where people are employed under certain conditions&mdash;I am glad that Deputy Russell agrees with me&mdash;this could be called retrospective legislation.  All legislation cannot be perfect and we will say that this Bill is necessary, but it should exclude people already in employment, who had conditions of employment as laid down by the Waterford City Management Act, 1939 &mdash;the Act under which the Waterford City Manager is employed.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Lynch, I do not think be seriously expects to have it both ways.  In the first argument, he says that, as retrenchment is in the air, we should economise by keeping on those already serving, and, when the illogical consequence of that is pointed out, he changes feet and puts it on another <Col N="667" /> looting, that is, that somebody already there should not be disturbed.  I would not mind if we were disturbing this&mdash; in my estimation and I am sure in the estimation of the House&mdash;very excellent manager&mdash;as I understand him to have been down through the years&mdash; and treating him harshly.  He has gone into his 71st year, I believe, and is approaching six years over the ordinary retiring age and he is going out on a substantial pension and a fairly good gratuity.  I cannot see where any hardship is being created or that we are really taking something from him to which he is entitled.</P>

      <P>I was replying to what one of my colleagues said, when he mentioned the conditions of the Waterford City Manager's employment. I am sure the Minister will agree with me that I gave him an argument that it was time for retrenchment and that I gave him a second argument.  I do not see what could be wrong with that. I would say that not alone am I moved by a certain amount of personal admiration for the manager, but I am moved by a love for Waterford City itself and for its welfare.  I have always tried to judge things by results and the results that the City of Waterford had from this manager justify what I am asking the Minister to do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct attention to the point raised by Deputy <Col N="668" /> Russell.  I do not think it is enough to say that this is a Bill tying up loose ends.  This is a Bill repealing sections from five previous Acts.  Now, as I understand the position, in the initial stages of the institution of the managerial system in this country, the appointment of certain urban managers was incorporated in the Act setting up the managerial system in a specific municipality, so that the Cork City Manager was appointed under the Act relating to Cork, the Dublin City Manager under the Local Government (Dublin) Act, the Limerick City Manager by his Act and the Waterford City Manager by his Act, and in each case these persons were appointed on terms set out in the Act.  It is now desirable to bring the terms of tenure of office of all managers, county and city, into line.  We brought all the county managers on to a common footing in regard to tenure of office by the Act which this Bill will amend.  We are now trying to bring the city managers under the same Act.</P>
      <P>I think there is great force in the proposal that it would be a much more suitable procedure to provide that, after the present occupants of these offices has retired, the new conditions which we seek to institute under this Bill would apply to their successors. I am not concerned for any manager. I do not know any manager but I want the House to bear in mind that when we enact a statute of this House under which we confer rights upon an individual, they want to be the most secure contract of service that either a citizen or a foreigner could get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It creates, in my submission, an extremely dangerous precedent if this House reserves to itself the right to say that &ldquo;notwithstanding the fact that, by Act of the Oireachtas, we gave you certain conditions of employment ten or 15 years ago, we are now going to take them away.&rdquo;  It is true, I think, that, under our Constitution, it is possible to do that; it is not at all equally true that it is something we ought to do.  Most of these gentlemen may very likely opt to retire themselves, if they have reached the point where they have qualified for the maximum pension.  Some may stay on <Col N="669" /> for three or four years, but there is going to be no serious public inconvenience by leaving these specific individuals enjoying the rights conferred on them by Acts of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There certainly could be no reason in any way commensurate with the deplorable principle that would be here established, that, by unilateral action of Oireachtas Éireann, we are taking, without consultation or agreement, from these men that which we gave them by Act of the Oireachtas, in the first instance.  Would the Minister feel that this consideration would justify an amendment on Report Stage, providing that the new conditions of employment would apply as the existing managers cease to hold office and thereafter, and that, in view of the fact that these men had the warrant of the Oireachtas for their belief that they enjoyed these conditions for life, their existing tenure would not be unilaterally altered by the Oireachtas?  That is a point worthy of consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that what the Deputy has said does not in any way change my attitude in this matter. In reply to what he has said about rights given by Act of this House to a person or persons&mdash;that there now seems to be a taking away of those rights and that the principle there is unfair and unsound&mdash;I should like to say that I understand the intention to do this was set out in the Act of 1941. In respect of county managers, it was effective from 1942 and in respect of city managers, it was effective from 1946.</P>
      <P>While it was set out in 1941 and was effective for city managers in 1946, the present holder of the office in Waterford City was appointed in 1945, at which stage he would have been aware of the intention of the 1941 Act and, therefore, he would know he was not being misled by any Act of this House, passed prior or subsequent to his appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the fact that <Col N="670" /> doubts exist, and to resolve those doubts, I have been advised by my legal advisers to bring in this to consolidate the matter, so that there will be no disputes in the courts, or otherwise, about it.  I should like to say at this stage that the matter which Deputy Dillon has now raised might very well have been raised, and would have been very appropriate, on the passing of the 1955 Act dealing with these matters.  It could have been very relevant to the section now involved in dispute here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very debatable point.  The question raised then was that there was an agreement arrived at, a signed copy of which I have got, made by the then Minister. It was signed, not only in the presence of a colleague of mine who is still a member of the House, but also in the presence of Deputy Lynch.  The agreement was to the effect that the then Minister, now Deputy O'Donnell, would not tie up all the ends and all the knots which he knows himself he possibly could have tied up.  The reason for that was that he acceded to the representations of the two Deputies I have named, with specific reference to the manager of Waterford City.  The agreement was to the effect that if the knot was not tied so that person would then have to go, he would voluntarily go on 31st December, 1957.  That is all I am asking him to do now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all concerned with the City of Waterford Manager, or any other manager.  I am concerned with the principle and it appears to me that some right must exist in some form, at the present moment, which it is our object to take away by virtue of Section 3 of this Bill.  That impression is strengthened in my mind when we hear the Minister say we do not want any litigation about this matter.  We want to take time by the forelock and make it impossible to have recourse to the courts in that there is any ambiguity in the legislation that has gone <Col N="671" /> before.  That is not a healthy mentality for a Government.</P>
      <P>We tried to do that in this House once before.  Deputies must remember the Sinn Féin Funds Bill.  It was brought into this House to prevent people having recourse improvidently to the courts.  The result was that the whole Act was declared unconstitutional and was scarified in a judgment by the late Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy, a judgment which has never been paralleled from the Irish Bench.  I do not like Bills in this House which are designed to prevent citizens of this State having recourse to the courts.</P>

Unfortunately, I have not had recourse to the various Acts quoted in Section 3 (1) and so forth.  Would it be correct to say it was not intended in these Acts that the city managers concerned would, in fact, retire at 65?  In other words, are we removing doubts or endeavouring to remove doubts that do not exist?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I thought perhaps only Deputy Dillon was interested in this little bit of explanation in relation to this matter.  Lest I may be taken up wrongly, or lest it should be represented by anything Deputy Dillon may have said, that I am trying to get through the House legislation which would have the effect of preventing people having recourse to the courts, I am doing my utmost to refrain from encouraging people going to the courts.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Sinn Féin Funds Bill, which the Deputy quoted, the comparison does not stand because in that instance legislation was introduced after recourse had been had to the courts.  That is not the position in this case.  No recourse has as yet been had to the courts.  Therefore, the analogy is not correct.  Far from preventing anybody from having recourse to the courts in relation to their rights under this Bill, the Waterford City Manager had the right up to 12th of this month to have recourse to the courts, and he did not avail of that right.</P>

I believe it is perfectly clear, possibly by inadvertence, that the Waterford City Manager acquired the right to hold his position for life, or until he resigned, and that he had that right from the day on which he was appointed.  We may never have meant to give him that right, but, on a true interpretation of the statute passed by us, that right was conferred upon the Waterford City Manager.  Apparently there was some discussion and it was agreed that if the Waterford City Manager would undertake voluntarily to resign on 31st of last December, no legislative steps would be taken.  The Minister of the day was apparently left under the impression that the Waterford City Manager had given such an undertaking.</P>

      <P>Let the Minister go out and chase his greyhounds.  The moment he came in here I knew a row would start.  I am arguing against the amendment of Section 13 of the Waterford City Management Act in Committee.  It seems to me I must have a right so to argue.</P>
      <P>We are now seeking to provide, by the amendment of the original Act, that the Waterford City Manager be made to resign.  I do not give a fiddle-de-dee from the point of view of the Waterford City Manager himself.  I am concerned with the principle that we should, by unilateral legislation, seek to change conditions of employment that we ourselves by Statute laid down.  I am asking the Minister&mdash; possibly he is not fortified at the moment by the opinion of his legal advisers on this question&mdash;would he be kind enough between now and Report Stage to ask the legal advisers to the Department of Local Government if a county manager sets up his rights in court and challenges the constitutionality of paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 3 of this Bill, what view do the legal advisers of the Department of Local Government take as to the success or failure of such an appeal?  I doubt very much if they will get away with it.  I do not know whether the City Manager of Waterford would take upon himself the burden of struggling through the Supreme Court with the Executive, but I am quite sure of this: if we know that some legislative proposal is susceptible of successful challenge in the court on constitutional grounds, we ought not to go on with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It changes them, but this Bill does not change them; it only confirms what was already the clear intention but apparently not sufficiently clear from the legal point of view.</P>
      <P>I am quoting from the Second Schedule to the Local Government Act, 1955, relating to Section 24 of that Act:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The declaration may relate to all the offices in relation to which the declaring Minister is the appropriate Minister or to such of those offices as belong to a specified class, description or grade or to one or more specified such offices notwithstanding any other provision made by or under Statute in relation to holding such offices, offices of such class, description or grade or such one or more specified offices (including, in particular, a provision for holding office until death, resignation or removal from office) and in any such case, the declaration and this section shall have effect notwithstanding such other provision.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> That is contained in the 1955 Local Government Act which was enacted by this House when Deputy Dillon was a member of the then Cabinet.  When this officer was appointed in 1945, he did know that, as a hazard of his occupation, under the 1941 Act, the Minister for Local Government or the Government might make a retiring age order, and the only provision contained in it would be that six months' notice of the intention of the Minister to retire the holder of that office of Manager of the City of Waterford should be given.  The manager so appointed in 1945 must have been aware of that.  Knowing the great tributes that have been paid to his ability, I am quite sure that, since this was part of Local Government law, he surely would have been aware of what was contained in that Act and what has been carried into this Bill here, and that any or all of the provisions in regard to this matter would be effective from the year 1946, the year after he accepted this position.</P>
    <P>No move was made to remove him in a positive way until six months' notice, as provided, was given him on 1st July, 1957, expiring on 31st December, 1957, and as and from that date, he ceased to be Manager of Waterford City in a permanent capacity.  As I already said, lest any doubt might arise as to the functions he might perform, he was then by Order appointed acting city manager in a temporary capacity.</P>
    <P>Apart from making arguments, I do not think that anything that has been said by Deputy Dillon in regard to this matter really makes any difference to any individual in the employment of this State.  I doubt even if it was his intention that anything he said would make any difference.  I do not say that in any disparaging manner.  The Deputy has been in a rather happy frame of mind these last few weeks and he wants to give us the benefit of some entertainment this afternoon.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to say, except in regard to this gentleman in Waterford City, that I do not even know him.  Neither do I know any of the other men concerned who might come <Col N="680" /> within this legislation.  I am in the happy position that I cannot be held to have any prejudiced views about the matter.  Since I did not have any contact with them or knowledge of them until my official contact in the ordinary way during the past few months, I can only say that I can see no grounds whatever for the acceptance or the non-acceptance of this section.  I cannot see any reason in the world why anybody should say that the holder of the Waterford City managership has not had a fair run for his money. Nobody is creating any hardship for him in tying up the loose ends and giving him, at the age of over 70 years &mdash;and I am not reflecting upon the Waterford City Manager&mdash;the same treatment as any other men who gave good service and had to go at 65 years of age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister misses the point.  I tried to explain that I am not in the least concerned about whether the Waterford City Manager continues in the post or not.  What I am concerned with is the principle, that that which a man has to-day shall not be taken from him by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What does &ldquo;copperfastens&rdquo; mean?  Either the man has the right or he has not.  If he has not the right, this Bill is unnecessary; if he has the right, this Bill is necessary, as the Minister euphemistically says, to avoid encouraging him to go into the courts to vindicate his rights.  You cannot have it both ways.  Either he has the right&mdash;this Bill is trying to take it from him&mdash;or he has not the <Col N="681" /> right, and then this Bill is unnecessary. The real fact is that the Minister's advisers told him it is not at all impossible that if this individual chooses to stand upon the letter of the law, the courts will hold he has the right and the Minister is concerned to prevent him asserting it.</P>
      <P>I think it is not at all impossible that it is beyond the Minister's power and the power of the Oireachtas to do what is being attempted.  Of course, we have to bear in mind that the Constitution is only a very qualified protection for an individual because it costs so much to vindicate that right in the court of first instance and in the Supreme Court, where the question would certainly be brought for final determining.  What I am saying is that I have no objection to the Oireachtas, in its wisdom, setting any conditions of employment for a public employee as from to-day forward, provided the Oireachtas does not take from anybody that which he enjoys. There is no difficulty at all in saying that these amendments will operate only as from the date of the resignation of the present incumbents of the office.  Then, it merely becomes a question of what it is advantageous to do from the point of view of public administration.  That is not regarded as copperfastening.</P>

It has been said by the present Minister that when the Waterford City Manager was appointed he knew he should go under the 1945 Act.  If he knew that, what was the meaning of bringing in successive Acts ever since?  It is definitely a worsening of this man's conditions.

      <P>I am not interested in the Waterford City Manager at all, but I am interested in the principle.  I am with Deputy Dillon when he suggests that legislation to change the conditions of any civil servant retrospectively is a bad principle.  The Minister replied to that by saying that the principle was intended to be included in the 1955 Act, but, through some inadvertence, certain loose ends were left untied and he proposed to tie them up now, or, as has been suggested, to copperfasten them.  Was it intended by leaving these loose ends in the 1955 Act to provide specifically for the fact that certain men were in office whose conditions would be changed if the Act of that time had been made more specific?  Are we doing an injustice to one or two or three or four city managers by attempting to tie these loose ends now, or would it be more just to let the position remain as it is, allow the present incumbents to see out their period of office, to resign or die, and leave things as they are?  In other words, was this purely a piece of innocent drafting to tidy up legislation that does not need tidying up in fact?</P>

      <P>No; it is just to clear this matter up once and for all, and to put these people on exactly the same basis as all the other servants of like nature at the moment.  None of them raised a voice in protest over the years since these things applied to them and quite a few of our managers have retired. I cannot see at all where the <Col N="687" /> injustice arises.  I would not like to do anything unjust.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of the legalities or illegalities or doubts that may have existed in previous legislation, I have no doubt whatever in my mind that what I propose to do in this Bill is not an unjust thing to any serving officer of any local authority or State service. The reason why I said that and the reason why I am so satisfied, is that, as I have already said, the 1941 Act was there.  The intention to have an age limit and the possibility that an age limit might be invoked by the Minister was known and was conveyed to all interested parties in the 1941 Act.  The particular manager whom we are now discussing and any other manager who may be concerned in this were appointed subsequent to the passing of the 1941 Act, and therefore knew the terms of that Act, some of the terms creating this hazard of employment, namely, the power given to a Minister in some future year to decide an age limit.  The only requirement that was laid down as necessary on the part of the Minister to make that retiring age limit effective in the case of this or any other manager was that it should not be done before 1946 and that when it was being done subsequent to that year, six clear months' notice should be given of the intention of the Minister.  In the case of the Waterford City Manager that has been done and the six months expired on 31st of last December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidentally, in regard to the matter that has been mentioned here, I should like to ask Deputy Lynch, when the 1954-55 Act was going through this House, did he or did he not agree, in the company of Deputy Kenneally and of the then Minister for Local Government, and in the presence of the Secretary of the Department of Local Government, that, provided the Manager of the City of Waterford was not disturbed in his office until the end of 1957, the amendment which Deputy Kenneally had before the House to the 1955 Act, asking that he be left until the end of 1957, would be withdrawn? In other words, he was given the benefit of the amendment that he had tabled on condition that he withdrew <Col N="688" /> it and it was not being written into the Act, nor was it being excluded.  Since then this manager has got the benefit of the amendment then proposed by Deputy Kenneally and supported by Deputy Lynch.  That benefit ended last December.  Now, surely, no one, particularly Deputy Lynch, can accuse me or anybody else who supports this measure here to-night of being unjust to the Manager of the City of Waterford above all other managers that may come before us or may be affected by this Bill if it passes through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very extraordinary argument for the Minister to put forward that, because two Deputies agreed or purported to agree, it is all right, if a man gets a particular right to which he is entitled up to 1957, to take it from him then, although he is still entitled to it and the man himself has not agreed to cede it.  It is disturbing that I could go to a Minister and say: &ldquo;Deputy Burke has four years to go and no Bill should be brought in to dismiss him now because he has a right to continue while he is alive, but if you agree with me to give him two years more, it is all right to take it from him at the end of those two years.&rdquo;  Surely that is crooked arguing.</P>
      <P>I have not the right; Deputy Kenneally had not the right; and Deputy Lynch had not the right, to give away what an official is entitled to.  The argument made by Deputy Dillon is well founded.  If a person has a fundamental legal right to remain in office, no legislation can be passed which will take that away without imposing a hardship on the individual and outraging justice.</P>

We are arguing that a citizen has certain rights under the terms of his appointment.  The Minister says that he knew that they would be taken from him.  The Minister went further and made a very interesting point, that he believed it could be done only after six clear months' notice.  What was the citizen to do in those six months? What is the intention behind the six months&mdash;that this citizen could take such legal steps as he might be advised to take?  He could go into the High Court to challenge the Minister's ruling, but that is a costly method. There is no doubt that the six months' notice meant something.  Did it mean that he was to twiddle his thumbs for the six months and, at the end of it, say: &ldquo;I will have to go&rdquo;?  No.  The intention was that he could take such legal steps as he might be advised to take, that he might petition the Minister to give him a further period or to take such steps as he might think fit and proper, which is the normal thing.</P>

    <P>Now, out of the clear blue sky, in order to copperfasten certain loose ends, this Bill is brought in.  This Bill could be brought in only because the man has rights and this Bill is to make sure that they are taken from him.

When I was a young lad, I thought everyone over 50 should be put in a bucket and thrown away, but now I do not think so.  Is there anybody who will say that the Leader of the Government to-day <Col N="690" /> would not be fit to be a county manager at 76 years of age?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Just while it is fresh, let us clear the matter up.  It is not true that my justification for taking this benefit&mdash;if benefit it be, at all&mdash;of permanent officership of Waterford City away from the present holder is only because two people, two Deputies of this House, are alleged to have agreed to its being taken away at the end of 1957.  That is the argument Deputy MacEoin is now making, and that it is absolutely wrong that these two people, or any two people, could have agreed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that&mdash;but the Deputy should not have inferred from it, without further inquiry, that it was a bad argument because I only mentioned those two people and that the man himself did not agree.  The man himself, according to the records on the file before me, did agree.  He agreed to what the two Deputies who interviewed the Minister subsequently agreed to and, as a result, withdrew an amendment but, in effect, got the benefit of that amendment for the past <Col N="691" /> couple of years.  It all boils down to the fact that this manager has got two years to which he was never entitled and to which, under the 1955 Act, he would not have been entitled.</P>

      <P>I am wise to the game that has been going on over there for the past half hour and I have taken steps accordingly.  At the moment, you are scouring the highways and the byways to get Fine Gael supporters, and others, if you can.  We have taken steps and our people will be here, in addition to the other supporters, so that you will not get away with a snap division.  That, in effect, is what has been going on here and it has been very obvious to anybody who has been keeping an eye on the movements opposite.  The crocodile tears being dropped on the Fine Gael Benches do not become the people who are shedding them at the moment either on behalf of the Waterford City Manager or, indeed, any other manager.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot of ráiméis and phoney arguments to the effect that if the Leader of the Opposition is such-and-such an age and somebody else is such-and-such another age and that if they are capable of being the leaders of the nation, surely they would be regarded as being capable of running Waterford City.  We all know that these arguments are a bit stale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was said here on the Second Reading the other night, in the case of the Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the Government, or any other elder statesman in this House, no matter what his position, they do not enjoy and will not enjoy the benefits, by way of pension and gratuity, which this man will enjoy, despite the fact that his jurisdiction has only been over Waterford City during the past 15 years whereas some of the people mentioned have had the responsibility of the nation on their shoulders for more years than that man has been the manager of a city.  Let us not cod ourselves and let us get the matter into proper perspective.  Let us realise that these elder statesmen have earned a lot more by way of retiring gratuity&mdash;<Col N="692" /> and that goes for some of those who are making the arguments at the moment.  They have earned and are entitled to more, in my estimation, than the man we are now discussing.</P>

      <P>The fact remains that this is a drafting amendment&mdash;an amendment that has showed itself to be possibly necessary in the future&mdash;to make the 1955 Act effective in all cases, even in cases that might be disputed.  A number of managers have accepted the terms of that Act without any question whatever and retired. Why cannot the present Manager of Waterford City&mdash;who has got two years in a permanent capacity, to which he was not entitled, as city manager&mdash;gracefully accept it?  I would say to his best friends not to damage him in the House by pursuing this matter to the extent that it may be to his disadvantage before the year is out.</P>

      <P>I do not intervene in the hope of delaying the House for any reason.  I happen to come from the Waterford constituency and, also, I happen to be an alderman of the corporation over which this city manager now reigns either as manager or acting-manager. I am amazed to hear that the then Minister for Local Government, behind closed doors and without the knowledge of this Deputy for Waterford, at any rate, made any arrangement with a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael alliance of the time to keep on Mr. Raftis.  I see no reason why Mr. Raftis should be treated in any different way from the ordinary city managers of this country or, in fact, from the ordinary county managers. <Col N="693" /> At the time of the 1955 Bill, I suggested to the then Minister that it was wrong to have any back-door methods or to make any attempt to continue somebody in office on a personal basis.</P>
      <P>I have no particular feeling for or against the question whether this man should be kept on or not but, if he should be kept on, a similar case can be made for many more.  I believe it is a good thing to retire city and county managers at 65 because all other local government officials are required to retire at that age and I see no reason why they should be exempt.  I suggest the Minister should continue with his amending Bill as it is and have the very same law for all city managers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Loughman intervened to-day to inquire what were the conditions originally fixed in the Waterford City Management Bill.  He did not appear to know them.  I will tell him.  If we look at this Bill, we shall see that the purpose of Section 3 (1) (d) is to repeal sub-section (3) of Section 13 of the Waterford City Management Act, 1939.  Sub-section (3) of Section 13 of the Waterford City Management Act, 1939, by virtue of which this manager holds his present position, provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The manager shall hold office until he dies, resigns or is removed from office.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (5) of the same Section 13 of the Waterford City Management Act, 1939, provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The manager shall not be removed from office without the sanction of the Minister and shall not be either suspended or removed from office by the council save by a resolution passed by the council for the purpose of such suspension or such removal (as the case may be) and for the passing of which not less than two-thirds of the members of the council voted and which was so passed after not less than seven days' notice of the intention to propose such resolution had been given to every member of the council.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> Does that not sound a very solemn and exhaustive description of the fixity of tenure that the manager is supposed to enjoy under the Waterford City Management Act?</P>
    <P>You may say, in retrospect, that that was foolish, improvident or anything else you like; but what is important to my way of thinking is that if the Oireachtas makes that bargain, by a Statute of the Oireachtas, with the humblest citizen of the State, it shall not thereafter by unilateral action cancel the agreement therein enshrined. I do not believe it ought to do it under any circumstances and I want to reiterate what I have said several times before.  I do not give a fiddle-de-dee about the Manager of Waterford City.  I do not know the man and know nothing of his merits or demerits. I am concerned here with the principle. I do not believe that in any circumstances we ought by unilateral action to cancel an agreement of that kind. But this is a peculiarly unsuitable occasion to put our hands to such work, because in the ordinary course of time this manager will resign or die.</P>

      <P>May I recall that this general principle has arisen out of an inquiry made by Deputy Russell of Limerick, as to whether there was a retrospective element in this section?  Of course, the answer is that there is and the answer made by the Minister&mdash;that this is &ldquo;a drafting amendment&rdquo;&mdash;is to be excused on the ground of his inexperience. No Minister who knew what he was talking about could say such a thing.

I think the Minister would consider it a personal affront to himself if any citizen went into the courts to challenge his right in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister is entirely wrong in describing this as a drafting amendment. It is nothing of the kind; it is a very material amendment.  It removes a fundamental section of the Waterford City Management Act of 1939 which provides that the manager will hold office until he dies, resigns or is removed from office.  Sub-section (5) of the same section, Section 13, purported to lay down very rigid conditions for the procedure appropriate for removal of a county manager&mdash;which can only be done by a two-thirds vote of the council after seven days' notice of the meeting had been issued, and subject to the sanction of the Minister himself.</P>
      <P>The more I reflect on this, the more abundantly clear it is to me that this House should be informed by the best legal opinion that can be got as to the constitutionality of this proposition, with special reference to its impact on the Waterford City Management Act of 1939.  I would invite the Minister to make that opinion available to us when the next stage of the Bill comes to be considered.</P>

After all, this Bill may be <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution and I think we should invite the best possible legal opinion that is procurable on the Bill and particularly on Section 3.  The Minister would have an opportunity between now and this day week to get that opinion or consult with the legal adviser.</P>

I would say he is aware of a lot more than has been said by his colleagues over there, that would have been helpful, but naturally he cannot be too helpful in present circumstances.  I would say that if there is a constitutional question on this matter, that is not something upon which I can pentificate in this House.  I do not suppose that Deputy Dillon, who has raised the matter, can pontificate on it either.  I do not care whether I get the Report Stage to-day or this day month, but I should like to get finished with the Bill.  The whole thing boils down to the adage that what is sauce for the goose is also sauce for the gander.

I have in mind particularly the rules that govern coursing which, to my mind, are completely out of date and could not possibly be dealt with by the board itself and a special committee would be necessary.  The same rules apply to open coursing and closed coursing, which are completely different sports.  There is also this provision in the rules about the 50 mile limit which will have to be tackled very quickly. I cannot see any direct reference to the rules themselves in the Bill, and I should like to get an assurance from the Minister that the board will be in a position to set up a committee to examine any of these aspects.</P>

      <P>What is this proviso which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) A condition prohibiting credit betting shall be attached to a totalisator licence granted to the board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is that anything more than a pious affirmation?  I understand that at present the totalisator gives nobody credit and that, if you want to make a credit bet with a totalisator operating a race track, you have to deal with a private company which gives the better credit but which itself deals with the totalisator on a cash basis.  Is there any case in which the existing totalisator gives anybody credit for any bet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is not, but one may attach as a condition to granting a licence to the board to operate a totalisator that it shall not open an office where a credit bet may be made with the ultimate intention that the bet would be laid off with the totalisator.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, this provision which is described in the White Paper as being one of the important changes in the Bill means that the totalisator licence granted to the board shall in fact function exactly as the totalisator licence granted to the existing company functions at the present time.  There is no credit betting on the totalisator and there is not likely to be but there is no means of preventing a private company or an individual from taking credit bets and laying them off for cash on the totalisator as is at present done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on this matter when Deputy Dillon was dealing with the previous Bill and I urged him at the time to bring in such a provision to prevent credit betting in connection with the tote.  Theoretically Deputy Dillon is correct that facilities do not exist for credit betting with the tote but it is to everyone's knowledge that a company, Tote Investors Limited, has the co-operation of the totalisators set up under the 1929 Act.  For instance, they have a special compartment at the end of the official tote and as such there is an obviously recognised co-operation between the two bodies.  In regard to Section 20 (2), I would ask the Minister to consider whether the endorsement on the licence could be phrased in such a way that there would be no doubt whatsoever that credit betting in any form could not be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter was before the House when I was Minister for Agriculture, I said it was a matter of complete indifference to me.  I did not care whether there was credit betting or whether it was prohibited. I knew very little about it and cared less.  I was quite prepared to be guided by the views expressed in a free vote of the House.  That was my position in regard to this issue but I have a constitutional objection to cod and eye-wash.  This sub-section which has been put in by the Minister for Health is cod and eye-wash.  It is not effective. It does not do either one thing or the other.  I do not think there is anything to prevent Deputy O'Malley appearing at a greyhound racing track, taking credit bets from all his friends and then going over to the tote and laying the offer in cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing in this Section 20 will operate to prevent that transaction. Even though the tote on the Limerick track was prohibited from credit betting, they would not be giving credit betting.  They would deal with the Deputy for cash and it is none of their business how the Deputy disposes of his winnings or his losses provided they have his cash.  I think this sub-section is cod and eye-wash and meant to hang a mantle of rather revolting rectitude around the shoulders of the <Col N="705" /> Minister.  He wants to steal around sanctimoniously and say that he protected the people from the temptation of credit betting.  It is all cod and the only reason I queried it is because it looks to me to be cod, fraud and sanctimonious rubbish.</P>
    <P>If it is effective I do not care a hoot one way or the other but I object to cod, particularly sanctimonious cod, and it may be that the Minister in endeavouring to draft an effective instrument found it legislatively impossible to devise an effective instrument and so stuck this in to make it look nice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that the Deputy has a completely wrong conception of this sub-section. The purpose of it meets my wish anyway and the wishes of Deputies on both sides of the House who spoke here before.  In my opinion where the Deputy is confused is in the definition of credit betting.  If Deputy Burke gives me £1 and I wish to put on £1 myself I give Deputy Burke credit for £1 but I am putting down my cash with the tote.  If a track has a tote licence there will be a condition, so far as I can see, prohibiting credit betting in any form whatsoever.</P>
      <P>The whole point is, if the Deputy will appreciate it, that cash passes between the person who makes the bet and the totalisator.  It ill becomes Deputy Dillon as a member of the former Government which held up this House on another Bill, to be holding up this one.  On the Gaming and Lottery Act we had Deputy Everett as Minister for Justice talking about the evils of an unfortunate old age pensioner going out to wager sixpence.  On the one hand we had a member of the Government urging restraint and, on the other hand, the Minister for Agriculture saying that he could see no real harm in credit betting on the tote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect to this. Every Deputy interested in racing&mdash;be it horses or greyhounds&mdash;knows that there was a very serious outcry in this country some months ago when a certain horse who came under starter's orders was left at the post.  The money for tote investors was not placed with the tote proper.  No one needs any <Col N="706" /> power of perception to see the injustice to the person who bets for cash and the advantage which may lie with the person who bets on credit.</P>

      <P>I have no hesitation in saying that this section caters for the main objection which people had. The main objection is that they do not want the type of person who places bets on greyhounds to get into debt. You have a wealthier type in horse racing and there is a different set-up. I am satisfied that the sub-section caters for all the objections previously raised.</P>

By arrangement with the totalisator board, bets may be placed in cash if necessary with the tote.  The purpose of this sub-section (20) (2) is to ensure that there will be a condition attached to any totalisator licence which the Minister for Finance may issue, which will prohibit that sort of set-up.

      <P>Is there anything in this sub-section which would prevent a firm being set up to-morrow with capital and being able to say: &ldquo;We shall receive credit instructions from clients amounting to a wager of £100 on each of the six dogs in the race&rdquo; and taking out 60 ten pound notes and presenting them to the tote and registering a bet of £100 on each of the six dogs in cash with the tote?  I see nothing in this sub-section that prevents that.  If that is still possible, then exactly the same type of credit betting proceedings on the totalisator on race tracks to-day is permitted.  I fully perceive and am conscious of the fact that, if the House were to take a decision, by a free vote, to prohibit credit betting, it might be very difficult to draft a section to achieve that purpose I was quite prepared to do that if that was what was desired.  I do not care a fiddle-de-dee if there is a credit section or not; I only want to avoid <Col N="707" /> shameful cod.  This sub-section (2) of Section 20 does not prevent the existing system which operates at present on horse-racing tracks.</P>

      <P>Let me try to get back to the point that the totalisator licence will be granted by the Minister for Finance who will attach to that licence a prohibition on credit betting.  The Deputy suggests that it is not possible to do this effectively and he has given us a number of hypothetical cases in support of his argument. He started off with Deputy Burke and Deputy O'Malley obliging each other, with Deputy Burke giving Deputy O'Malley £1, taking his chance that he would be paid in due course, and walking up to the totalisator and laying a bet of £2.  That, of course, is a private transaction between two individuals.  The Deputy himself saw there was not much force in that case because it would not stand examination. What we are concerned with, however, in this sub-section is to prevent a person or an organisation standing up in public, opening premises on greyhound racing tracks, and offering to provide credit facilities to enable people to use them as agents to place cash bets with the totalisator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing I would assume a Minister for Finance would do to ensure that there would be no credit betting with the tote at all would be to prohibit, or prevent, any facilities being offered on the greyhound racing tracks for making credit bets which would eventually be laid with the tote. That is comparatively simple.  The Deputy also spoke about the case of six people who wanted to bet £10 on dogs which they fancied and they gave instructions to a company, an organisation, or I think he said a corporation, to place their bets for them.  The company handling this transaction have a choice of two things.  They can either hold themselves out as bookmakers, take the bets and hold them.  The Deputy says they are not going to do that, that their clients want to have their money on the totalisator.  If they want to do that, I assume that the company will be required to send somebody to the track with the money to place the bet with the totalisator, but the credit <Col N="709" /> transaction will take place outside the track.  It will not take place on the track.</P>
    <P>We want to ensure that there will not be that sort of transaction on the track, a transaction of which the ultimate aim is to place bets with the totalisator.  Outside the track, we cannot deal with it, but on the track we can ensure that facilities for credit betting on the tote will not be offered. Other questions might arise about whether a combination such as the Deputy has suggested might not come within the scope of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, but I do not want to go into that.  It would be a very peculiar business undertaking which would provide the cash for a representative and send him to the track to make the bet with the tote and, at the same time, not get some sort of rake-off for that service, either from the totalisator or their clients.  If the undertaking gets commission from its clients, nobody can object.  If the clients say they prefer to take the odds offered by the totalisator rather than those offered by a bookmaker, the totalisator cannot make any arrangement with the undertaking to pay a commission, if a prohibition is adequately expressed as a condition for totalisator licences.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Section 21 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 22.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The board shall grant a special operating licence in respect of private greyhound schooling tracks which were already operating as such for a period of five years at the commencement of this Act, and in respect of which application is made to the board to continue as such tracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I read it, the section makes no provision for the continuation of the licences of schooling tracks, tracks that happened to be established some years ago and which have served a very <Col N="710" /> useful purpose since, but which now will have to discontinue business in accordance with the legislation we are about to enact.  These tracks were established for the most part in five or six centres throughout the country after the war, at a time when greyhound racing had commenced to develop and the price of dogs had commenced to increase substantially.  At that time, transport was rather restricted and possibly that led in no small measure to the setting up of the tracks to which I have referred.  Some of these were originally established for the purpose of having them operated eventually as licensed tracks, but they failed to get the necessary approval from the Irish Coursing Club, and were not allowed to operate.  A number of them went by the board, but quite a few held on and continued.  They have served a very useful purpose, in my opinion.</P>
    <P>The average person who owns a dog is a person of rather limited means and by the time the dog is reared and ready to race, a good deal of money has been invested in the animal.  It is a requirement of the track where the dog is raced for the purpose of getting his time officially recorded that he must be schooled in an official school. Any person who reads the report of the Advisory Body will see that, generally speaking, in recent years licensed tracks could not be sited within a distance of 50 miles of an existing track.  That was one of the reasons given by the Irish Coursing Club on many occasions for being unable to license new tracks.  In the district that I know best, Kerry and Limerick, the distance between the two tracks there is about 80 miles. That could mean that the owner of a dog would be obliged to incur the expense of hiring a car or paying rail fare in order to convey his dog to the track.  That could mean that the owner would be put to a good deal of expense and, on arrival at the track, the trial might prove abortive.</P>
    <P>The case that can be made for the continuance of these tracks is that, under existing legislation, the owner of a greyhound may school dogs on a private track run directly under his own control, whereas if the owner <Col N="711" /> takes the dog to what is described as a commercial track, or a track run for profit, he is committing an offence and the person who owns and operates the track is certainly committing an offence.  That does not make sense because it merely goes to show that if a person is well-off enough, he may have his own track and have the advantage of schooling his own dogs. If he is not sufficiently well-off, he is denied the facilities a breeder would normally get from one of these tracks. It is for that reason I have tabled this amendment and I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept it.</P>
    <P>These tracks would, of course, have to come under the supervision of the board and be licensed under the direction of the board.  The schooling arrangements would be subject to control in the same way as the schooling arrangements of the licensed tracks to which I have referred.  The number involved is not very large.  I would say probably not more than half a dozen.  I understand that they are generally well sited throughout the country.  We have two or three in the south.  From inquiries, I know that there are similar tracks in the north and east as well.  Such tracks would be a great fillip to the industry.  They would be a big help to the ordinary owner who is, generally speaking, of the poorer class.  If they are brought under the control of the board and licensed as schooling tracks, that would be a very good thing.  I sincerely hope the Minister will accept this amendment because it is a very important one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moloney has an extremely good point in this amendment. The more localised tracks, both for racing and schooling, the better for the industry as a whole.  Where there are local tracks, there is much more encouragement to the small man to breed greyhounds and to take more interest in the type of dog he is breeding.  The backbone of the industry is the small breeder, the man with one bitch which produces four or five pups in the year, one of which he keeps.  He will, of course, keep his <Col N="712" /> animal in training, if there is a local track.</P>
      <P>I shall have some comments to make with regard to racing tracks on the section when we come to it.  I firmly believe that the more localised tracks you have, the greater number of small breeders you will have and the better animals, in the long run.  I am convinced that the greyhound is an important asset in our commercial life. For that reason, anything we can do to improve the industry should be done.</P>

      <P>I would suggest to Deputy Moloney that this amendment is not really necessary.  The necessity for trial and schooling tracks is well recognised, provided that they are honestly run.  However, in connection with them, a very great problem arises because the Advisory Committee, whose advice I am prepared to take in a matter of this sort, after the exhaustive inquiries they made, did have a problem.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The problem of providing a solution of the difficulties in connection with &lsquo;time-finding&rsquo;...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>that is, an improvement in the dog's recorded time, etc., beyond what could reasonably be anticipated, having regard to the result of previous trials or races&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...is aggravated by the existence of a large number of so-called &lsquo;schooling&rsquo; tracks, i.e., unlicensed tracks laid out on private grounds, the owners of which for a monetary consideration, afford facilities for &lsquo;schooling&rsquo; and for obtaining information regarding the potentialities of dogs destined to participate in the near future in graded races on licensed tracks...We realise that a greyhound owner cannot be debarred from providing a &lsquo;schooling&rsquo; track on his own grounds for his own dogs, but we are of opinion that unlicensed &lsquo;schooling&rsquo; tracks which operate for reward should be regarded in the same light as unlicensed racing tracks, and should be compelled by the Control Board in due course to cease operations.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>From the report of the Advisory Committee on the greyhound industry&mdash;paragraph 68.  Now, that paragraph does recognise the need for having schooling and trial tracks. I have not given the full quotation, but it also points to the fact that in many instances the information gained has been of much more benefit to the owner of the track than it has been to the owner of the dog.  The board will have the power to license a track. There is nothing to prevent a trial or schooling track being licensed.  I am assuming that, having regard to the use which is made of these tracks and the convenience which they are, as has been pointed out here, to the small owner and the small breeder, the board will in due course be prepared to license such tracks, provided it is satisfied, and it must be satisfied, that they are being honestly run.</P>
      <P>There is nothing which would prohibit or stop the board from licensing a schooling or a trial track.  The only point about it is, as I say, whether we should put in another provision which would coerce the board to grant a licence to all the existing tracks, no matter what their record may be or who may be associated with them.  That would be wrong.  It would be better to leave the matter as it stands.  In due course, the greyhound owners and breeders, who are very interested in this matter, will no doubt make representations to the board that it is desirable that there should be in certain instances recognised training and schooling tracks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 57 and 58 of the Report of the Advisory Committee deal with the matter of unlicensed tracks and applications for new licences.  At paragraph 58, page 25, they say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In regard to the licensing of new tracks, some witnesses expressed the view that the establishment of a third track in the Dublin area would be justifiable.  One of the reasons advanced in this connection was that owners of dogs have at times to wait several weeks before they succeed in getting an entry accepted on either of the existing Dublin tracks.  While we are inclined to agree with the view regarding a third track, we do not feel in present circumstances in a position to make definite recommendations in the matter.  We therefore commend the suggestion to the Control Board, for consideration in the future and in the light of the conditions then prevailing in the greyhound industry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am concerned with the position of the track which was established in Chapelizod.  In the autumn of 1949, some £30,000 was expended in the provision of a first-class racing track there.  A licence for this track was applied for to the Irish Coursing Club.  This was refused and several other applications have since been turned down, on the ground that you cannot have a track within 50 miles of another track unless this other track agrees.  In this case, the Harold's Cross track agreed, but Shelbourne Park&mdash;which, to my mind, was the track less likely to be affected&mdash;did not agree.  As a result, Chapelizod opened as an unlicensed track, but those who ran dogs there were &ldquo;warned off&rdquo; so the track had to be subsidised by the owners since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Evidence was given on behalf of this track at the inquiry and I have the case they put forward.  I think they approached the matter correctly and a lot of the things they recommended have actually been incorporated in the Bill.  They have been subsidising their track since 1951 and, to date, over £60,000 has been spent.  I have seen the audited accounts.  Over <Col N="715" /> £10,000 has been paid out in wages since 1953.</P>
    <P>Chapelizod is really a village in the centre of Dublin.  Employment is created there and it would be a good thing for the village, as well as for the industry as a whole, if this track were licensed.  It caters for the entire Ballyfermot area and part of the north side, too.  Under the Bill, as I see it, there is no indication as to whether they are likely to succeed in getting their licence or not.  Furthermore, it is laughable to see a town like Arklow being refused permission to erect a track, although schemes are going ahead for a swimming pool and concert hall to improve tourist amenities.  Yet they cannot have a racetrack because there is one in Enniscorthy.  That is a matter that will have to be dealt with seriously.</P>
    <P>To revert to the question of Chapelizod, if the licence is refused by the new board sub-section (3) says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the board proposes to refuse an application for a greyhound racetrack licence, the board shall serve notice of the proposal on the applicant and shall, if any representations are made in writing by the applicant within seven days, consider the representations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That would indicate that that is their right of appeal, whereas, in Section 50, it is prescribed they have 21 days' notice to appeal to a committee which shall consist of a judge of the Supreme Court, High Court or Circuit Court or a practising barrister or solicitor of seven years' standing at least and two ordinary members.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if that period of 21 days is in addition to the seven days provided in Section 3 or will these people be compelled to appeal under sub-section (3) of Section 22 first, before they make use of Section 50? The main reason I am bringing this up is that the report of the inquiry does not make any definite recommendation, in so far as Dublin is concerned. I should like to have the Minister's view on these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The point which Deputy Lemass has raised had better <Col N="716" /> be left to the Greyhound Industry Board itself to decide.  Although the report of the Advisory Committee does not specifically recommend that a licence should be granted to a third track in Dublin, it does indicate that the committee felt that it would be reasonable that such a licence should be granted.  I would deprecate very strongly any attempt to confer on an unlicensed track the right to get a licence by legislation.  I think any unlicensed track should follow the ordinary procedure and appeal to the board.</P>
      <P>The net point to which Deputy Noel Lemass required an answer was whether the time for appeal included the seven days which is mentioned in sub-section (3) of Section 22.  It is clear it is not.  What the sub-section says is this: the board, having considered an application, is disposed to reject it; but before it is rejected, they must give the applicant the chance to make further representations and these further representations may be sufficient to ensure favourable consideration for the application.  If, however, they turn down the applicant after having heard these additional representations, then his rights under Sections 50 and 51 begin to run.</P>

At that time we pointed out it could happen that there could be a Minister having little interest in greyhound racing and little time for the bookmakers who might not think the slightest injustice existed if the maximum charges were exceeded by a considerable amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, in regard to the amendment I have now submitted, I have qualms of conscience that it is too reasonable, because I cater for the fact that the maximum charges in respect of bookmakers in relation to a greyhound racetrack shall not exceed ten times the maximum charges fixed.  I now envisage that that could happen. I introduced the amendment in the hope that it would meet the Minister's previous objections in some way.  It is most unlikely that the charges will be as high as ten times the maximum charges but I think that if <Col N="719" /> it is written into this section now, then for all time it will be established and it will give great satisfaction and a sense of security to the bookmakers. While they cannot feel too happy with the amount mentioned by me, nevertheless I would recommend to them that it is in their own interest to have something specific mentioned such as I have here in the section.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the point of the last observation.  It seems to me to be a very questionable one.  However, people know Deputy Dillon is not himself to-day.  I think that this is a rather unnecessary proposal. I think it will be found, when the question arises of compounding for the levy, to be one which the bookmakers themselves, the people principally concerned, will wish was not there.  I feel that if we put this into the Bill it will require legislation to delete it in order to arrive at an agreement with the licensed bookmakers as to the terms upon which the board can dispense with the levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the matter now stands, it would mean that a bookmaker would pay 32/6 or 35/- if he attends a Dublin track.  If <Col N="720" /> that represents the amount of the levy he would collect, he will not be doing very much business and I am afraid the board will not derive very much revenue from the bookmaker.  The purpose of Section 48 is, in fact, to enable the board at some stated time to enter into a reasonable agreement with the bookmakers in order to enable the board to dispense altogether with the levy.  I know there is a certain amount of uneasiness, and I might be prepared&mdash;I shall look into this in respect to other aspects of it&mdash;to accept the principle that the maximum charge should not exceed ten times the normal admission fee for a limited period, for a year or two years, to enable bookmakers to see where they stand and to enable the board to carry out some sort of reorganisation.  But I would not be disposed to accept this proposal to-night <i>in toto,</i> and if the Deputy cares to withdraw it and give me an opportunity to look into it from that point of view and, if he cares to consult his friends in regard to it, then I may have something on Report Stage to meet him.  I think, however, it would be very foolish from the point of view of the bookmakers that the particular provision in this amendment should be a permanent provision of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to confirm a number of Orders made under the Emergency Imposition of Duties 1932 and the Imposition of Duties Acts 1957.  There are 15 of these Orders.  The Act which we passed last year provides that Orders imposing or amending duties made under either of the previous Acts must be confirmed in the calendar year following that in which they are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these Orders relates to wheaten breakfast food.  There was a review by the Industrial Development Authority under Article 8 of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement and following <Col N="721" /> on the review the duty upon wheaten breakfast food was imposed in substitution for quota restrictions on these goods which existed before under the Agricultural Cereals Act, 1938.</P>
    <P>The second Order amended the scope of the duty upon malt extract preparations. That was made in April last year to prevent evasion of the existing duty and a further amendment of that Order was found necessary in September last.  It is that further amendment which the Dáil is now asked to ratify.</P>
    <P>The duty on iron and steel bars, rods and sections was amended for the purpose of excluding from the scope of the duty certain types of bars, rods and sections which are not manufactured in this country.  The Order amending the duty on shirts arose out of difficulties which were being created for local manufacturers by some low-priced imports from Eastern countries.</P>
    <P>The duty on forks was increased and extended to protect the output of Irish manufacturers against imports from the Continent which appeared to be in the character of dumping.</P>
    <P>The duty upon power-drawn agricultural machinery comprising certain tool bar frames, cocklifters, broadcast seed and fertiliser sprayers and certain component parts of these articles was imposed further to protect the output of the firms which are engaged in producing these articles.</P>
    <P>The form of duty on glazed fireclay pipes and fittings which was a specific duty became ineffective in the course of time with the rise in prices and the increase effected was necessary to continue to afford protection to the local manufacturer.</P>
    <P>The production of galvanised plain and corrugated iron and steel sheets is being carried out at Haulbowline and the duty was imposed to protect that industry.</P>
    <P>The manufacture of spun rayon yarn has been undertaken at a factory in Sligo and a duty was imposed to afford protection for that new industry.</P>
    <P>The duty on concrete beams was imposed to protect Irish manufacturers and the exclusion in the duty on concrete products in respect of articles <Col N="722" /> which are glazed or polished was terminated to avoid evasion.</P>
    <P>The imposition of duty on plant pots of felt, paper or paper pulp was to protect the production of these goods here.</P>
    <P>The manufacture of iron and steel cable and rope commenced in 1954 at Wicklow and the duty was imposed to afford a measure of protection to the industry.</P>
    <P>The manufacture of coil springs for motor vehicle suspensions has been recently undertaken in Wexford, and the duty was imposed to protect that industry.</P>
    <P>The production of gummed paper to be used in the manufacture of tape has commenced and the duty was imposed for the protection of that manufacture.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it possible to say anything more about these Orders at this stage, but, I shall, of course, be willing to give any further information or answer any questions Deputies wish to ask.</P>

      <P>In connection with Order No. 401, Agricultural Machinery, it was understood, when a previous Order was brought in dealing with such machinery, that there would be a periodic review, with a view to seeing how the Order was working, both from the point of view of employment at the factory concerned and the effect on the agricultural industry of the prices of the machines.  Could the Minister say if a review was carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we have had some correspondence with the parties concerned.  There was a committee, of which Dr. Beddy was chairman, which carried out a test of Irish-made ploughs, but I felt it was unfair to Dr. Beddy to leave him there because of other work he was doing.  The position now is that a committee is available with a chairman to be appointed by the Minister for Agriculture, if there is a request to carry out a further investigation.  There are, I believe, some methods on the Continent by which the suitability of design and the quality of agricultural machinery are periodically examined and some inquiries are being made as regards <Col N="723" /> these measures to see if they can usefully be applied to our circumstances.</P>
      <P>While it is obviously undesirable to have any duty of this kind expressedly temporary in its character&mdash;because that lessens its protective value&mdash;it is nevertheless necessary, in view of a certain conflict of interests that inevitably arises, that there should be periodic examinations of the suitability of design and quality of agricultural machinery.  Consideration is being given to the question of how we can get that done, without at the same time implying that protection for the industry might be amended or withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the National Farmers' Association are complaining bitterly that faith has been broken with them in relation to this matter?  I do not know whether or not the Minister read an article in last Saturday week's <i>Irish Farmers' Journal,</i> which was most vehement, that the farmers' members of the committee had been trying to get a meeting of the committee and no meeting would be called by the responsible authorities.  I think it was in that journal.  I saw it somewhere. If that is the case, then I think they have a genuine grievance.  It would be very undesirable, particularly at the present day when we are calling for a national effort to greater production, that anyone should feel that the Government had broken faith with them in not permitting a committee of which the farmers' representatives were members to sit down to consider this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The article was a reproduction of a letter which was sent.  When the committee, which carried out certain tests upon machinery produced in this country, had their report awaiting completion they had to wait for a very long time <Col N="724" /> to get the comments of some of the farming representatives upon the result of the tests and, indeed, if I recollect correctly, they decided to wind up their work and submit their report before these comments arrived.</P>
      <P>My view in this regard is that we can hand over that problem and should hand over that problem, of considering how the suitability of design and quality of Irish agricultural machinery can be periodically investigated, to the Department of Agriculture.  I think that would be regarded as a more satisfactory basis upon which to arrange for further inquiries of that kind and I think these farmers can be certain that the Department of Agriculture will be on their side in ensuring that the machinery made available by Irish manufacturers is of the kind, design and quality best suited for their use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had better watch his flanks in any proposition to hand this matter over entirely to the Department of Agriculture.  I reveal no secrets when I say that the question of the imposition of tariffs on certain agricultural instruments was the subject of considerable contention. The industrial interests said they wanted protection against the greater saleability in the Irish market of extensively advertised foreign agricultural implements with which the Irish manufacturers, because of their relatively limited resources, could not compete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seemed to me at the time when we were in Government that the particular firms who had been able to sell, strangely enough, in the export market and to sell a substantial number of implements in the export market, were finding it extremely difficult to hold the home market because of the mass advertising they had to contend with on the home market and because of the fact that the sale of imported implements was tied in on a hire purchase basis and the suppliers of the imported implements were disposed to make it a condition with the retailers that if they were selling an imported implement they could not stock an Irish part.  All that contributed immensely to the difficulties of the Irish <Col N="725" /> firms, both of which are located in Wexford.</P>
    <P>It was desired to protect this industry in Wexford, which has been there for a few generations, and it would be an appalling situation if the only two Irish industries making ploughing parts and that have been making them for the past 120 years should, when governmental control is in the hands of Irish people, disappear from the market entirely and that we would sit back and be content to use foreign-made agricultural implements.</P>
    <P>However, the problem was to convince the farmer that the Irish-made ploughs and parts were the best and, with a view to finding a <i>via media</i> by which the various angles and outlooks could be composed, we set up a committee consisting of representatives of the agricultural industry and representatives of the agricultural implements manufacturers, presided over by a very sagacious chairman in the person of Dr. Beddy.  I agree with the Minister that Dr. Beddy should be relieved of that task as soon as possible because of the immense burdens which he cheerfully bears.  At the same time the Minister will recognise that a person with his talents and skill was a very good selection at the time in order to launch the committee in conditions in which they would not have the element of self-destruction within the committee itself.</P>
    <P>It was certainly arranged then that this body would meet from time to time, that the agricultural interests would say to the industrial interests what, if any, were the deficiencies in the agricultural implements parts and that the industrial interests would endeavour to meet the needs of agriculture by adjusting their manufacture to comply with the needs of agriculture.</P>
    <P>In extremely difficult circumstances, a body of that kind was probably the best kind of arrangement that could be made, and if the two interests can be tied in permanently it may bring into this whole question an atmosphere of goodwill and amity which probably would not be present if these two interests were allowed to grow apart, <Col N="726" /> each considering its problems in its own exclusive and insulated way.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, hope that the committee would continue to function for the purpose of endeavouring to evolve here an agricultural implements industry which will respond to the known needs of the agricultural community and so that we can not only maintain the existing industry in Wexford but perfect that industry&mdash;and it probably can stand a fair amount of perfecting&mdash;to such an extent that the question of the continuation of an Irish agricultural implements industry will not be challenged in the future.</P>
    <P>My experience in handling that whole problem was that it was extremely difficult to convince the Department of Agriculture that Irish-made ploughs were in fact satisfactory ploughs.  It was extremely difficult to convince them that farmers should not be allowed to buy ploughs any place in the world that they liked.  It seems to me that here are firms that have given evidence that their products are as good as those produced anywhere else. Many of the ploughing competitions in the country and outside it have been won by the ploughs made by these particular firms.  Therefore, they are entitled to say to a well-protected Irish agriculture: &ldquo;We have to live in Ireland also and if you are protected by various tariffs and, better still, by all kinds of other restrictions, it is not unreasonable that the implements manufacturer should be permitted to survive in Ireland also.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Department of Agriculture is to run this whole committee without adequate representation of those concerned, I am afraid the committee will have a rough time.  Certainly, the industrial representatives will have a rough time unless there is some direction in principle given to the committee or to the Department of Agriculture that their function is to see that Irish agricultural implements and machinery are worked on Irish land. In these days, when there are such large imports of that heavy type of machinery, surely it is desirable that we should do everything we possibly can to maintain an industry of that kind which, speaking from recollection, has survived about 120 years.  If there <Col N="727" /> is an acceptance of that principle, well and good; I can see it working well. However, I am afraid, from my past experience in connection with that problem, that the Department of Agriculture will take the line: &ldquo;The world is your selection place when you want agricultural implements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to ask agriculture to use Irish-made ploughs and agricultural implements in order to maintain here an Irish agricultural implements industry.  If we kill that industry through want of support then the price we will pay for imported agricultural implements will be substantially higher than at present.  Putting it at its worst, an Irish industry at least keys the price of the imported article to something like the Irish production price level.  If there is no Irish production at all, you will have to pay whatever price the man outside with the agricultural implement wants to charge you because you have to buy it, in any case, and he is the seller.  I hope, therefore, this matter will be handled in such a way as to give the two firms concerned all the assurances they reasonably require that their industry will adequately be protected and that they, for their part, will make every possible effort to ensure that the articles they produce are as perfect as it is possible to make them and that they will respond at all times to the requirements of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>How many persons is it expected will be employed under this duty dealing with paper and felt flower pots?  My recollection is that about three people will be employed.  I do not think they will be employed full-time; they will have to do other work as well.  I have the idea that the paper, probably, has to be imported.  It seems very doubtful wisdom to have a tariff at this rate on an industry which offers employment to so few people.  It would be much better to encourage a national industry for the making of clay flower pots, for which we have the soil.  They could probably be made here by machinery supplying our total requirements if the problem were tackled basically from the standpoint of trying to create such an industry for the country as a whole.  To utilise a Bill <Col N="728" /> described as an Imposition of Duties Bill, which was made under the Emergency Powers (Imposition of Duties) Act, is to use very high-powered machinery for the purpose of providing employment for two or three people especially when, I think, the employment is not, in fact, whole-time for the production of this commodity. The position may have changed but that is my recollection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to urge the Minister, as well, to maintain his interest in the problem that has been mentioned by the last speaker and by, I think, Deputy Sweetman.  I appreciate the concern of the farmer in respect of this duty on power-drawn agricultural machines.  I can appreciate, too, the stress that must be put on production at the present time.  The employment of 500 people is also a matter of importance.  I do not say that anybody who has spoken has discounted that part of the problem.  I would trust the Ministry of Industry and Commerce far more so than the Ministry of Agriculture in looking after the interest of these workers.  I would say that it would be wrong of the Minister to throw this whole problem to the Department of Agriculture and ask them to determine what type of plough, harrow, or crop lifter, for instance, would suit the Irish farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would imagine from some of the articles written by, I think, the <i>Irish Farmer's Journal,</i> that there were widespread complaints about the agricultural machinery that happens to be made in Wexford town.  Such is not the case.  There are pockets of farmers in this country who do not want to buy Irish-manufactured ploughs and, in a lot of cases, I think it is more of a prejudice than anything else.  That is not peculiar to some farmers in respect of agricultural machinery.  It is peculiar to many other types of people in respect of a lot of things that are made in this country.  If the farmers are concerned about the type of plough or the type of any other agricultural machine that is made, they do not need to have this particular committee convened.  I am well aware, and I know the Department are well aware, that the employers in these two industries <Col N="729" /> are prepared to meet the National Farmers' Association, the Young Farmers' Clubs or any other type of agricultural association that may wish it.  They can visit the factories and make suggestions as to how these machines could be, or should be, changed in order to suit requirements in particular areas.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Norton has said, these two firms have been up against tremendous odds over the past ten or 11 years, in particular.  They have to compete against people who are able to advertise in a very high-powered way.  They have to compete against people who can offer facilities to their agents in this country which it would be impossible for the firms in Wexford to offer.  What is important, as far as I am concerned&mdash;and I am conscious of the needs of the agricultural industry&mdash;is the fact that, because the last Government imposed certain duties on certain types of machinery and because this Government imposed further duties on the residue of the machines manufactured down there, it is possible for employment to be kept at a reasonably high level.  It has been, so to speak, the sheet anchor of Wexford town that these duties imposed by the last and by the present Government have kept 450 to 500 persons in employment.</P>
    <P>It is only 45 miles to Fishguard.  The National Farmers' Association and farmers generally should appreciate that there must be give and take as far as this business is concerned.  I do not hear any other section of the community looking for a special committee to see whether or not, for instance, the tariff on gummed paper is justifiable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but nobody who uses it in this country wants a departmental committee set up to see whether or not a duty should be imposed upon it.  It is the first time, to my knowledge, that any section of the community asked that a special inter-departmental committee should <Col N="730" /> be established to review a tariff from year to year.  It would mean that the two factories involved could not plan ahead.  It would be impossible for them to do so if they were to have hanging over them the idea that, after 12 months, this tariff might go.  I urge the Minister to continue to concern himself about the manufacture of agricultural machinery here because, as far as employment in these two factories is concerned, from my experience the workers would not get much consideration from the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>These two factories in Wexford are old-established manufacturers of agricultural implements. They functioned for a great many years without any protective tariff whatsoever. They functioned in the open market and they exported their products. The time came when they were unable to continue to do so because they were not allowed to buy their raw material where the other companies bought it.  They were under a restrictive control which put up their costs of production considerably as against those of other countries.  As well as the question of price, there is also the question of the quality of the raw material.</P>
      <P>In days gone by, they produced machinery which was as good as that produced by any firm in the world. They supplied all the Irish agricultural holdings with machinery all down the years.  It was only when they found themselves up against this restrictive practice that there was a change.  I know that it was introduced originally by the Minister, but it was continued by the previous Minister also.  On several occasions, I had contacts with them and they have had deputations to the Department, asking that they be allowed to buy the raw material where they could.  It would not have made all that difference to the firm supplying them with the raw material here in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a particularly important industry and it was a good thing to know you had this old-established industry carrying on here and exporting in competition with the rest of the world.  If they have some difficulty in selling <Col N="731" /> their product now, it is due to the fact that they cannot pick and choose their raw material and often their castings are not as good as they should be, through no fault of their own.  The position at the moment is that there must be an imposition of tariffs to protect and safeguard them, because they are left in the position that they could not compete openly with the raw material from other countries, they could not keep prices level or get the high standard of production that they have been able to get in the past.</P>
    <P>The town of Wexford depends practically entirely on those two industries. I suggest to the Minister that, now, with the present build-up in the economic situation, he should leave these tariffs as they are for the purpose of keeping these industries going; and I suggest to him that he should consider the case again.</P>
    <P>After all, when a firm like that has proved itself in the past as being able to manufacture in this country and to export, that is what we want in Ireland to-day and they should be allowed to do that.  They had to buy their raw materials here&mdash;except what they were manufacturing for export, when they were allowed to buy them where they wanted to, which was only a limited quantity of their trade&mdash;and by being bound to the raw materials, such as they were, they have had in some cases to pay as much as 30 per cent. more than other countries.  I suggest that the real solution to this problem is that they should be free to buy their raw materials where they want and they will produce as good a material as any other country in the world, as they did in the past and as they have done for many years.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I want to make it perfectly clear that I am all in favour of Irish industry and of industries here producing as much as possible of the country's goods.  I would stress, however, that Irish industry ought to rise to the occasion. When people take advantage of the shelter they have enjoyed for a while past and which I hope they will enjoy for the future, they should turn out as good an article as possible.  Some <Col N="732" /> speaker mentioned pockets of Irish farmers who seem to be averse to buying anything Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know of any such farmers.  Most of the farmers I meet are as proud of the Irish product as any citizen of any nationality in the world is proud of his own.  I want to see Irish industry turning out the requirements of the country&mdash;that is what we are aiming at, although we have not achieved it yet after 35 years of self-government.  However, we want a good article.  The farmer is no more antiquated than any other person in the community.  He is one of the first to realise that a good tool, a properly made tool, a properly finished instrument, is absolutely essential to his trade.  I am sorry to say my experience with some Irish industries has been different.  I am not referring to the two factories in which Deputy Corish apparently is interested.</P>
      <P>Irish industries are turning out to-day products of very poor quality.  I have known Irish-made tools to break in my own hands after the first half-hour's work.  That discourages the Irish farmer from buying Irish-made goods.  I admit that Irish industries have disadvantages to contend with. First and foremost, I suppose they have not the enormous capital we are led to believe their foreign competitors may have.  Secondly, they have no huge sale.  Thirdly, I dare say that, being growing concerns, their workmen or craftsmen have not acquired the skill which has been born through generations of craftsmen in other countries competing against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proper attitude for this House to take is that Irish industries should be let know that we are willing to give them every protection and shelter by way of tariffs, compatible with reason and with the public good, but that they in turn should not take advantage of that shelter in order to foist bad articles on an unsuspecting public. Ploughs have been mentioned here.  If farmers and others have gone for foreign-made tools and implements, <Col N="733" /> the reason is that they have found, through bitter experience, that the foreign articles must be of better quality.  As a user of agricultural implements myself, I want to say that there are no foreign-made implements on my farm.  I am proud of that, but at times, when I see other foreign-made implements in use by farmers round about me, I realise they have a better article and a better finished article.  I am sorry to say that.</P>
    <P>The reason I speak at all is to make the position clear.  The farmers are not a crowd opposed to buying an article simply because it has the brand on it, &ldquo;Made in Ireland&rdquo;.  There are some Irish articles which are second to none in the world, but that does not apply to all.  Some industrialists seem to muddle along from one day to another, turning out a mediocre or poor article and hoping it will sell. That is not the way to do business.  If we are to hold the home market and expand our trade and business in the hope of exporting at some future date, we must turn out a good article. Farmers are being asked now to work harder, while at the same time the price of every commodity they turn out it being cut.  That is not the case with their colleagues in industry, who are getting shelter and protection.  The very least we ask is that we be given a decent article to work with.  We do not mind paying a few shillings or a few pounds more, as the case may be, but let us buy a good article to start with.</P>
    <P>I take advantage of the debate to say these few words.  I think the Minister would be doing a good job if the day were to come when the industrialist would be put on the same footing as the farmer, that is, that if he does not turn out the good article, it will not be sold.  Farmers grow wheat and if it has a higher moisture content than 22 per cent., they are cut in the price.  There is no such scale of cuts for industrial goods.  It is a case of take it or leave it.</P>

I am all in favour of Irish industry, but we should try to encourage, or even take stronger steps &mdash;if necessary, to compel&mdash;our industrialists not to injure the name of the country by turning out bad articles. Surely it is within their competence to employ skilled men or get the services of skilled men who would turn out articles to compete with the foreign article.  Some of our Irish factories have done so and I see no reason why the rest should not do so.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to intervene in this debate, until hearing the statement of the last Deputy, I believe it is incumbent on me to do so. He criticised to some extent the products of Irish firms producing agricultural machinery and other implements and tools for the Irish market.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that about two years ago the then Minister for Agriculture held a test at the request of a farmers' body.  The result of that test as between imported machinery and machinery of Irish manufacture was never published but it is a well-known fact that the Irish machinery, tested under various conditions, proved superior.  I should like that the result of that test would be published throughout the country.  The result is already well known to the farmers of Wexford; it is also well known that machinery manufactured in Wexford is holding its own and holding it well on the world markets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with the question of the flower pots first.  The position in that regard is that there was a firm operating in County Wexford, in Enniscorthy, which was manufacturing earthenware flower pots.  It had, indeed, established a nice industry, employing some 18 workers in the production of these goods.  The public demand for earthenware flower pots ceased, in favour of flower pots made from paper and from bitumenised felt.  Instead of deploring the change in demand and continuing to manufacture earthenware flower pots, the firm in question decided to make the goods the public wanted, and to encourage <Col N="735" /> them to continue in that way I decided we would apply to the felt flower pots the duty which was then attaching to the earthenware pots.  I do not suggest that any additional people will get employment as a result but the employment already given by this firm will be secured by that measure.</P>
      <P>About agricultural machinery, I think it is well we should be clear as to the history of what happened in regard to the recent tariff on power-drawn agricultural machinery.  Deputy Esmonde is misinformed.  These firms in Wexford were engaged in the manufacture of horse-drawn agricultural machinery. They were protected in the manufacture of that type of machinery for a number of years but there have been in that field also, changes in demand.  The demand is now for agricultural machinery to be drawn by tractors.  A large percentage of the farming community went over to tractor-drawn machinery. It was in connection with that change that the question of extending the tariff to include tractor-drawn ploughs and other agricultural equipment arose.  When the question arose during the term of office of the previous Government the issue for Deputy Norton was whether there should be a tariff or not, whether an effort should be made to secure the continued production of that type of agricultural machinery or whether it should be allowed in from outside.  That problem was met in his Government by a decision to impose a tariff on certain types of power-drawn machinery on a provisional basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tariff was imposed and a committee was set up to carry out a test of the efficiency in design and quality of the Irish manufactured machinery. It was understood that if the test did not justify the tariff it would be taken off.  That arrangement was the best Deputy Norton could get at the time. My circumstances were entirely different. This question had been put to my Party before the election by these organisations and it had been made clear that there was concern to secure the manufacture within Ireland of all types of agricultural machinery that could be manufactured here and that <Col N="736" /> there was no question of having any doubt in our mind about the decision to protect these industries in order to assist their development.</P>

      <P>The arrangement made in 1956 was not very satisfactory from the point of view of the manufacturers of agricultural machinery.  Tariffs which were stated to be provisional and possibly temporary were no great encouragement to people to undertake investment in the manufacture of agricultural machinery or to expand the production of an existing industry. The question that arose for me was not whether or not there should be a tariff but how best to ensure the continued development of the industry within the scope of the tariff, that is there now and that is going to stay, which would, at the same time, meet any legitimate complaint about quality or design of the machinery that might be forthcoming from farmers' organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That having been settled, there is still the need to assure those who may have reason to think otherwise that the machinery produced in this country is of good quality and of suitable design for the work it has to do.  There is no problem about letting the organisation of any investigation of that kind be undertaken by the Minister for Agriculture. As far as he was concerned the idea that the machinery should be made here is accepted and also that there should be some means by which any complaints about the quality and <Col N="737" /> design of machinery can be examined. There is a committee to do that, the chairman of which will be appointed by the Minister for Agriculture. Besides the question as to whether there is a good case for the conduct of such a test there is the question also of who will pay for the test.  That is one of the problems the previous Government did not solve.  There was some argument as to where the charge should fall.</P>
    <P>The tests were carried out by the committee and a report was presented. The report showed that the quality of the Irish-made ploughs tested was quite satisfactory.  There was some contention on the point as to whether the imported ploughs used in the test were similar in weight and character to the Irish ploughs.  If there is, in the view of any organisation, to carry the matter further, it can be examined but it will be examined on the basis that agricultural machinery will be made here anyway.  The question is how to get the type of plough or machine which is best suited to meet the requirements of those who have to use them.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is correct to say that there is evidence of any prejudice amongst farmers against Irish agricultural machinery.  There is some question about the adequacy of the arrangements by Irish manufacturers for the appointment of agents and there may be some inducements to certain traders in the country to push imported agricultural machines, which could be dealt with and perhaps is being dealt with, because the complaints I received in that regard were communicated to the Irish manufacturers.  It has, of course, to be recognised that in relation to tools of this kind there will be individual and local preferences.  The range of designs that can be produced in Irish factories is obviously less than the range of designs that can be produced in all the factories of the world and consequently there may not be the same variety and choice available to users as there would be if there was free importation.  However, those who are designing these implements and are engaged in their manufacture and sale, <Col N="738" /> are, I think, fully aware of the requirements of the agricultural industry as well as of the local preferences regarding design which operate and which can be provided for.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure what Deputy Esmonde has in mind regarding restrictions on the purchase of raw material.  I never had any complaint from any of the Irish firms that the quality of their products was in any way affected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill, as I explained, is an essential corollary to the Tea Bill which is before the Dáil and which the Dáil has already given a second reading.  The present arrangements for importing tea are based upon the Act which was passed in 1956.  When Deputy Norton, as Minister, was presenting that Act to the Dáil as a Bill he indicated that its life was limited to two years and that he thought that two years would be sufficient to enable arrangements to be made for putting the importation of tea on a permanent basis.  This other Tea Bill which the Dáil is dealing with and which provides for new arrangements for the importation of tea will not come into operation until the 1st July next unless, of course, an earlier date is fixed by Order by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  As the existing Act is due to terminate on the 31st March, the purpose of this Bill is to continue it until 31st July or for such shorter period as may be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of discussion upon the other Bill some Deputies appeared to think it might be of some advantage to leave a period of some months in which no control on the importation of tea would be exercisable.  I think it would be a most dangerous experiment to attempt.  Apart from whatever risks it might create for the security of our supplies of tea it would involve other substantial difficulties as well.  I mentioned that one of the problems of the present time was to secure an orderly transfer of existing stocks of tea from Tea Importers, Limited to the wholesalers who will be handling this trade in future.  That will involve <Col N="740" /> certain obligations upon these wholesalers to take over these stocks, and it may be some time before the process is completed.  If we were to have a period during which unrestricted importation might be permitted, everybody knowing it was only going to be a limited period in any case, there would be a risk that Tea Importers, Limited might be involved in substantial losses, certainly in substantial interest charges on these stocks and as the borrowings of that company are guaranteed by the Exchequer any loss that they incurred would ultimately come back upon the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>While that is a very important reason, it is not the sole reason why it would be undesirable to allow a hiatus to develop in our arrangements. It is rather difficult to forecast what the position may be this year.  Deputies are aware that tea is produced in various parts of the Eastern world, India, Ceylon and Indonesia.  In Indonesia there are political difficulties which have led to something tantamount to a civil war in progress at the moment.  In Ceylon there have been very disastrous floods recorded in recent weeks.  What the effect of these events may be on the total supplies of tea in the world is very uncertain.  It may be that stocks of old tea would be sufficient to make up any deficiency of supplies from these countries.</P>

      <P>Taking the world supply position as a whole I would say that a reduction of supplies from Ceylon and Indonesia, would substantially step up the demand for tea in India.  In any case there is a situation there to which we have to have regard. It seems to me likely that nobody in this country would make advance arrangements for the purchase of tea if there was a period of uncertainty with unrestricted and unknown imports regarding the coming into operation of the new scheme or a period during which quantities of tea might be brought in, if control was removed.</P>
      <P>In order, therefore, to secure the supplies of tea for this country, which must be purchased around June, July and August next, it is necessary to have those who are to be responsible for them know that they will have that responsibility.  It would be an unjustifiable risk to adopt any other course. Apart from that, there is the problem of very substantial stocks of tea held by Tea Importers.  Discussions are still proceeding as to how the process of transferring these tea stocks from Tea Importers to wholesale merchants can be smoothed over, so that there will be no difficulty for anybody and no loss to Tea Importers, Limited, which would react against the Exchequer.  I repeat that the effect of the Bill is to continue the existing Act for a further period of three months.</P>

He also says that the Exchequer would have to bear the brunt of any expenses that might be incurred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should they incur loss?  If Tea Importers place their <Col N="742" /> supplies of tea on the market or if they have successors&mdash;my suggestion is that they have no successors and that tea be made free&mdash;surely they will naturally buy tea from them.  They will not go to Ceylon or India to buy tea. Tea Importers can sell their stocks of tea and the Exchequer will not be at a loss and the Exchequer and the Government can get out of tea altogether. I feel confident that the tea merchants, the wholesalers and the retailers, are themselves able, in a free market, to handle this enormous sale and delivery that goes on in tea.  There seems to be no reason whatever for continuing the thing.  Surely the Minister can give it a trial for three months and then, if it has failed, start with the new company.</P>
      <P>Let tea go free.  Let it be a private enterprise and let the people who deal in tea, big and small, be allowed to show that they are well able to conduct their affairs without State interference. That is what the majority of the people want and it is what I understood the Government wanted&mdash;sensible private enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech which we have just heard and the speeches which some Deputies delivered on the previous day when the No. 1 Tea Bill was under consideration, indicated some misunderstanding of the whole position. Deputy Dr. Browne on the last occasion proceeded to regret what he called the virtual disestablishment of Tea Importers, Limited, on the presumption that Tea Importers, Limited, was in fact a State-sponsored body in the sense of Bord na Móna, the E.S.B. or Irish Shipping or Aer Lingus. Tea Importers, Limited, is not a State-sponsored body.  It represents a group of people in the tea trade who have been carrying on the importation and distribution of tea and their method of finances and purchases has been guaranteed ultimately by the State, but the whole thing has remained in the hands of tea people who have devoted their whole lives to the purchasing and marketing of tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the alterations proposed in what I call the No. 1 Tea Bill, which is now in its Committee Stage, are for the purpose of creating a somewhat similar kind of structure, except <Col N="743" /> that in this second case, it will be on the basis of tea wholesalers putting up a sum of money&mdash;I think it is £2,500 each&mdash;for the purpose of financing the new tea organisation.  You do not need to be a shareholder in the new company to get tea and there is no limitation on the kind of tea you buy.  You can buy any priced tea every day of the week wherever you like, so long as it is ordered in the country of origin. Therefore, what we are doing in the way of dismantling Tea Importers, Limited, is not dismantling a State-sponsored body, which I would question very strongly, if it had a good administrative record, but a group of tea wholesalers or tea factors.  That is what Tea Importers, Limited, is and anybody who thinks otherwise is guilty of completely misunderstanding the structure of Tea Importers.</P>
    <P>The question we discussed on the last day was what is the future of tea control to be?  The No. 1 Bill provides for the establishment of this new organisation which will have its own articles of association.  It will raise its own capital in its own way and presumably will go to the banks to finance its purchasing and perhaps may come to the State and ask for a guarantee. At all events, that body, which represents the private tea trade in Ireland, will then be the body controlling the purchase of tea; it will be the body that will do all the ordering; and it will be the body which will decide whether the tea is to be bought in the gardens or at the auctions.  It will be the body that will decide how the tea will be transported to this country. When the tea comes here, it will be packed here under its authority, it will be stored here and perhaps blended here or sent to wholesalers.</P>
    <P>There is really no State control, in fact, over the new organisation which is set up under the No. 1 Bill, once they have accepted the edict: &ldquo;You must buy tea in the country of origin.&rdquo; I do not understand the case which has been made to let the tea trade go free. Under the new Bill, it will be perfectly free and everybody in the tea trade can buy any way he likes.</P>

      <P>The new organisation will receive an order which may be for 20 lb. of half a dozen different varieties of tea.  The person who is ordering the tea will name the kind he wants and they will buy that tea for him at the auctions or in the gardens in India. His order will come back here and will be delivered to him by that organisation, of which he himself is a member. There is no restriction on the quality of tea he will buy or on the price.  This body will undertake all the work in connection with it.  Apart from the condition that it must buy in the country of origin, the new organisation is free to do anything it likes with the importation of tea.  It can buy China tea in China, Ceylonese tea in Ceylon, Indonesian tea in Indonesia or Indian tea in India, so long as it buys tea in the country of origin.</P>
      <P>Is there anything wrong with that, or will anybody assert, with any sense of enduring conviction, that you can buy tea cheaper in London than you can buy it in the countries of origin? You may, as I have said, get a small package of tea now and again, perhaps old tea, perhaps an over-plus of a particular kind, more cheaply in London or Amsterdam than you can get it at the particular time in India or Ceylon, but nobody has answered the argument that you can buy tea cheaper in the countries of origin.  It provides transport of the tea, the storing of the tea, its packing, insuring and cartage, and all that will be done from Dublin, instead of somewhere like Amsterdam or London.  That the new body can buy tea in the countries of origin is sound national housekeeping.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton's description of Tea Bill No. 1 is perfectly correct, but where I have some doubts on the matter is, why should we compel tea traders to buy in the countries of origin?  If, as the case has been made here, the advantage of buying tea in the countries of origin is based on the grounds that it is obviously going to be cheaper, then the tea traders will continue to buy in the countries of origin of their own free will.  Why should we refuse them the right to buy elsewhere, if they want to do so?  The case has been made that it will give larger employment here, but even that is uncertain. Obviously, there will be more employed in Dublin on the warehousing docks, but, in view of the centralised purchasing in recent years, it is questionable if the same employment exists in the rural towns and villages as existed formerly.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if there is justification for compelling traders to buy tea in the countries of origin, surely the same case can be made for other commodities?  On this, we should say whether we are in favour of private enterprise or not.  If we are in favour of private enterprise, we cannot at the same time regulate by restrictive requirements, as are imposed under the Tea Bill, the form and the method by which people will trade.  There is a good deal to be said in favour of continuing the purchase of tea in the countries of origin, but, if it is so advantageous, both for the traders and the public, the traders will, themselves, continue to purchase their tea there. On the other hand, if they get a better advantage periodically&mdash;and while the total consumption of tea from our view is comparatively large&mdash;I think it runs in recent years at 24,000,000 lb.&mdash; as against the world tea crop, that is a comparatively small amount&mdash;if individuals or traders can get parcels of tea at more advantageous terms elsewhere than in the countries of origin, there does not seem to me to be any compelling case why they should be compelled to continue purchasing in the countries of origin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says we should apply these regulations to the purchasing of <Col N="746" /> tea, and, if he is correct in that view, then there are a whole lot of other commodities to which we should apply them.  The monopoly which existed in recent years is altered under this Bill. Traders will have the right to purchase tea themselves, providing they place their order through the organisation that is to be set up, but only after certain conditions which are laid down in the Bill are fulfilled.  If that is sound for tea, then it should be so for other commodities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is setting up a tea cartel.  Deputy Norton indicated that the people who are concerned with this are people who have been in the tea trade for generations past.  They came together as an organised and unitary group to deal with tea in a cartel under the stress of the war.  The idea they have now to go to the countries of origin seems to me to have a very large element of the economic war mind being carried into present conditions, under circumstances in which we are working to-day, with the Common Market and European Free Trade Area pending.  It seems to me these are two very awkward ideas to have impinging on our legislation, an element <Col N="747" /> of economic war No. 1, and an element of cartel No. 2, to deal with an important commodity.</P>
      <P>If we detach from that the element to import from countries of origin at a time when we are naturally looking for certain concessions and an easing of our position, in having the Free Trade Area in Europe to deal with, we certainly ought to be very careful of our step and of the principles on which we are working.</P>
      <P>It is suggested that this is a perfectly free situation.  All the tea traders can engage in the tea trade in their own way, but, when you make them go as far as India, Ceylon and Indonesia, then the cartel is certainly in a very strong position.  It could be shown very easily that at the present time there is cheaper tea in the Six Counties than in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
      <P>The Minister may put over the idea of this cartel, establish it and set it going. If he is doing that, then he certainly ought to leave a loophole to enable it to be shown and proved that one can get better and cheaper tea by not going to the country of origin.  It is just the reaction against the Minister's intervention in relation to the cartel idea&mdash;and I think this is a tea cartel &mdash;which induces me to make these remarks at this stage.  I doubt if three months is a sufficient extension for this Bill.  The matters impacting on us in relation to the Free Trade Area, and the things that arise in connection with that, deserve, I think, to be considered a little longer and the Minister might like to have more than three months continuance of this Bill in order to enable a little more satisfactory thinking to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite confident that we can have the new company in existence within three months and start this process of transferring stocks and obligations.  I said I did not want to deal with the general problem in the context of this Bill, although it does impact to some extent upon it, as I shall show.  We are dealing, in this first Bill, primarily with the problem of 1958.  Our aim is to ensure that our tea stock position will be <Col N="748" /> handled properly and our forward tea purchases will be made in 1958.  We need not be thinking merely in terms of the future in this Bill, but the general point I have made here does come into this discussion, to the extent that Deputies will understand that anybody who is charged with the purchase of the tea requirements of this country, whether it is a company organised as the existing Tea Importers, Limited is organised, or a group of wholesalers, will have to acquire that tea over a limited period in the middle of the year and then carry the stocks for the rest of the year, until the next harvest comes in.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that, in the course of a year, supply and demand will have a definite influence on the price of tea and people buying tea this summer, which will be sold next March or April, may buy it advantageously or not so advantageously.  If the price of tea goes up in the meantime, they will have their stocks at a lower price than that at which they could obtain later on, if they were buying from day to day or week to week, and in such circumstances there would be no question of anybody going to Mincing Lane or Amsterdam, or anywhere else, to look for occasional parcels of tea.  If the price tends to fall, then there may be occasions when individual traders may be able to pick up occasional parcels at a lower price than that at which they purchased stocks held to meet their requirements.</P>
      <P>We have therefore got to think in terms of arrangements which will ensure that we will buy tea, as other countries buy it, on the basis of acquiring a full supply over a limited period and storing it, or else buying from day to day in nearby markets. We have got to think in terms of securing supplies as well as getting better value when purchasing tea at the time of the harvest, in relation to the tea requirements of the country and, whatever arrangements we make to get tea, they must protect our interests on both points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the whole period of the operation of Tea Importers, it was far more frequent to have tea for sale here by them at a price below the <Col N="749" /> Mincing Lane price; but there were occasions when the reverse was true and these were occasions when you got a merchant writing to the Press saying that he could buy certain grades of tea in London cheaper than Tea Importers are selling it.  These were very rare occasions, however, because the trend of price was, in the main, upwards and consequently a company buying in advance of the market was always more likely to be in an advantageous situation.</P>
    <P>According to reports, at the present moment, there is a fairly substantial stock of old tea around the world in the hands of wholesalers.  I do not think Deputy Esmonde appreciated that no tea can be bought now except old tea.  The new harvest will not be until the end of June or the beginning of July.  It is, therefore, now only a question of buying old tea.  No matter who is given this task of making arrangements to purchase next year's tea supply, they must know now that they will have that responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>Will Tea Importers be the body that will bargain and buy this year's harvest?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it may be assumed that will be so.  Mark you, that is part of the transition arrangement. I should hope to get the individual merchants into the market in time and, if we could devise a system which will ensure that this existing Act will go out of operation and the new Act come into operation before 31st June, that will be done. In practice, as the Deputy knows, we will be dealing with much the same body of persons, so there should not be any problem.  I contemplate that it may be as late as September of next year before the final process of transferring stocks and obligations to the individual registered tea wholesalers in the country from Tea Importers, Limited will be completed.  We have at least got to provide for that possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But others will take over from them, and no doubt they will be able to arrange amongst themselves the extent to which Tea Importers will start buying ahead of this year's harvest and at what stage they will step out and the new organisation will step in to act for them.  I admit this transition period will present certain problems, but, in view of the fact that the people who will be dealing with this matter on both sides will be much the same people anyhow, I think we will be able to handle these transitional problems.</P>
      <P>It would, however, be an impossible task to give them if we did not continue this present arrangement for the three months period.  If they could not know to what extent old teas might be purchased and held in the country, to what extent the demand in next year might be reduced by the availability of stocks of old tea in the hands of individual traders, it would be impossible for them then to plan their buying in an intelligent way.  As the Deputy knows, there is a substantial amount of money involved in the purchase and storing of these stocks.  At a certain period, the bank credit tied up in stocks can amount to as much as £5,000,000.  At the present interest rate, nobody would want to undertake that liability to acquire stocks which might not be sold for a long time.  This is the only body which knows precisely how existing stocks are moving and what purchases have to be planned and it is the only body which will be able to effect arrangements this year with efficiency and economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This appears to me to be as strange a Bill in its structure as ever there was in relation to the company.  A kind of ghostly shadow is thrown over the Bill.  The Minister gave us some kind of impression in his speech as to what kind of animal the company will be, but, as far as the Bill is concerned, the Bill says &ldquo;a company is intended&rdquo;.  It goes on to say that the memorandum and articles of association can only be changed with the approval of the Minister.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill to show how the company is formed or what the structure is.  There is nothing to show what its articles of association are intended to be.  The Minister is taking power in the Bill to prevent articles of association being changed.  There is no suggestion at all that the Minister has any kind of power over the formation of the company, the financial arrangements that will be made or the articles of association.  I should like to ask the Minister is there any precedent for a company throwing its shadow over a Bill like this.  There is a company, but it is a ghostly thing as far as this measure is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is as I explained.  This Bill has to be considered in relation to this announced intention of the Wholesale Tea Traders' Association to establish a company which will have certain characteristics.  The characteristics we are concerned with are these, that it will have a capital of £250,000 divided into 100 shares of £2,500 each, that these shares will be available to be taken up only by tea traders registered with the Department of Industry and Commerce, and that its shares will be available to be taken up by any tea traders.  There is also the limitation, beyond those I have mentioned, that it will accept the dividend limitation condition to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company will not be concerned <Col N="752" /> with making profit other than the reasonable remuneration of the capital invested in it.  That capital will be inadequate to finance its operations and a great deal of bank credit will have to be employed.  To the extent it does utilise its own capital, it will seek to remunerate that capital and no more than that.  These are the conditions, which it is essential from my point of view that the company should not have the power to change.  That is why Section 2 appears in the Bill.  The company will engage in the business of trading in tea, shares in the business will be available to be taken up by registered tea traders and these will be the dividend limitation.</P>

      <P>One hundred is a figure which will leave a number of shares available.  On the register maintained under the existing law, there are 90 tea wholesalers.  It is generally assumed that a number of these would be in the trade in a small way and therefore would not be likely to acquire shares in this company.  The expectation is that about 50 will, so that there will always be available shares to be taken up by anybody who wants to get into the company.</P>

Deputy Mulcahy has pointed out, and quite rightly, that as far as Deputies, who are solemnly meeting here to consider this legislation, are concerned, we are legislating in a particular way, and in a particularly restrictive way as far as the general public are concerned, in favour of a company which has not yet been established, in favour of a company that ultimately will go along to the company's office with its memorandum and articles of association, will set out a long string of objects in its memorandum and articles and will give particular powers to the directors and so on, assuming it is following along the pattern of any normal company.</P>

The tea that will be imported will be unblended tea.  It is the wholesale merchant, buying different grades of tea, who blends them and sells them to secondary wholesalers.  In the main, it will be the shipping agent for the individual wholesaler who will have already made his purchases on his own behalf in India and, having made the purchases, give the task of shipping the tea and insuring it in transit to this company to be delivered to him in Dublin.  It is merely his agent.</P>

      <P>On the contrary.  I am trying to explain the whole purpose of this arrangement.  One of the main functions of this company is to ensure that the small trader will have available to him an organisation which will <Col N="758" /> act as his agent in buying tea in the country of origin and shipping that tea, an arrangement which will ensure that this change will not operate to his disadvantage.  There is a number of companies in this country&mdash;some of the multiple store organisations&mdash;which will have available to them far more finance than this company but they will have no advantage whatever.  There is a wide variety of circumstances under which some of the big firms sell their own blends in packets.  You see the advertisements all over the country for different types of tea made up in packages by the wholesaler and sold by the retailers.  Other traders prefer to make their own blends.  You have O'Rourke's tea and O'Brien's tea&mdash;tea which is blended in the individual shops.  The trend appears to be towards the package tea.  In all circumstances, the trader who wants to avail of the liberty he has now got to buy the type of tea he wants in the country of origin, will have, through this company, the same opportunity of doing so and the same advantage of doing so as the strongest company in the business.</P>

In that way they will trade at a disadvantage with those traders in a stronger financial position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Let me give a word of explanation.  I should imagine that some of those big multiple stores would possibly adopt the practice of going to the producer in India and buying his crop from him.  The term used is &ldquo;garden&rdquo;.  They buy the output of the garden and in that way get the tea of the quality they require and can ensure reliability and uniformity of quality, which is very important, particularly when they are selling package tea in large quantities. Other traders go to the auctions where the tea is put up for sale and they buy the tea required at the price at which they can get it.  I do not know if those who buy from the gardens have the advantage or if it is the other way round, but I should think that the normal practice of the big trader who sells package tea and wants to be able to guarantee the uniformity of the tea in every package is to buy in the gardens.  These big traders will continue to do that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past the smaller trader, in so far as he survived at all in the trade here before the war, had no problem in financing his tea purchases because he purchased through a wholesaler in London on a monthly, or two-monthly basis in accordance with his financial resources.  He did not have the obligation to finance a year's stock in advance.  Therefore he might be at a disadvantage in present circumstances because of inability to finance a year's purchases and one of the reasons for this is to offset that disadvantage.</P>

      <P>But take the case that the Minister referred to, the firm in a position to buy the total output of a garden and possibly a year's supply.  I am not speaking with any particular knowledge but it seems to be reasonable to suppose that the person who is fortunate enough to be in <Col N="760" /> a position to do that is able to keep up the consistency of his tea and is best able to buy at such prices that he is enabled to pass on some reduction to the consumers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not pretend to be an expert on the subject but the bigger the trader may be, the more important it is that he gets enough tea of the quality required in order to maintain the uniformity he is seeking.  But it is quite possible that other teas, better in quality or cheaper in price, would be available to him and he cannot take them because there would not be enough of them for his purposes.  These are all factors that must be taken into account.  Tea Importers each year bought some tea at auctions and some in the gardens.

The big trader going to India can buy tea from the gardens but he cannot import it; he must go to this organisation and must give this organisation their &ldquo;cut&rdquo;, commission or &ldquo;rakeoff&rdquo;, whatever you like to call it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is completely wrong when he talks about the company financing under Section 8.  Suppose I am an Irish citizen and I am qualified to become a registered tea trader, and if I start off and decide to buy £25,000 worth of tea there is nothing whatsoever in this Bill that obliges the company to finance me.  If there is and if the Minister can point that out when we resume to-morrow on this Bill he will be a much cleverer man than I am.  I would be amazed if there was anything of that kind in this measure because it must depend on the financial stability of the individual trader concerned.</P>
      <P>My objection is that the financial stability will be judged by that individual's rivals in the trade.  I think that is a very bad thing.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the company from deciding that nobody shall bring in any smaller quantity than x lb. of tea.  The big people who will be in this company will be able to lay down a minimum quantity of tea for importation in respect of which they will act as agents.  They can fix that quantity to suit themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might as well be quite honest about it; the whole thing arises <Col N="763" /> because of the Minister's spite against Mincing Lane.  There is nothing else in it.  Whatever happened in the past was, in my view, nothing that Mincing Lane did, but that does not matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister for Education, who, on public occasions, mainly in the opening of schools, reminds the young to be faithful to the ideals of this country and to be particularly protective about the truth, had to come into this House the day afterwards to tell the House and the country that the statement he had made, with his advisers at his elbow, in his closing speech on the Estimate was not in accordance with facts, was, in fact, a falsehood and untrue and the reason he had to do it was, as I said, that Aer Rianta at Shannon Airport got on to the Department of the Gaeltacht the next day and told them that such was not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He came into the House to explain that what he meant was the goods had been supplied to the Great Southern Hotel in Galway and that naturally they were supplied after having been purchased by the Central Purchasing Office of C.I.E., at Thomas Street, and alleged that that was always the practice, that that was <Col N="765" /> then the practice and would continue to be the practice.  So far is it from the truth that, within the last three months, the western areas agent has been appeased to this extent, by being given an order and by being allotted the commission on it in that very same hotel which the Minister's predecessor alleged always purchased, in accordance with practice, from the C.I.E. Central Depot in Thomas Street, and I want the Minister, when replying, if he does reply, to deny that, if he can.</P>
    <P>That was one of the reasons I gave in writing, before leaving the Department, for the dismissal of this agent, that he sold goods in other agents' areas and that he sold a commodity, namely, tweed, within the Twenty-Six Counties in respect of which he had a very solemn agreement with Gaeltarra Éireann that it was for export only.</P>
    <P>There will be a distinction made, I have no doubt, between the agent <i>qua</i> agent and the agent as the principal owner of a company that exports things, but I want to tell the House about the company.  I want to give certain little facts about this company, and this is no hearsay; these are figures extracted by me in the Companies Office in Dublin Castle from the file relating to the company of which this agent is the sole owner, because I took the view, as did the permanent head of the Department, that, being sole owner of a business of this magnitude, he could not give the time that was necessary and the time that was stipulated as necessary, namely, full time, in the performance of his duties as an agent for a State Department.</P>
    <P>There was a company of capital £9,000.  There was no information to show whether that capital had been fully subscribed or not, nor is there any information to show whether it is yet fully subscribed; but, on 10th December, 1956, one partner left and, if the inquiry such as I seek were given, it would be interesting to hear the reasons why the partner left that company. The shares were transferred on 10th December, 1956, and the agent <Col N="766" /> himself informed the management of Gaeltarra Éireann that he was as from that date the sole owner of this business. He informed me in the presence of the principal officers of the Department of the Gaeltacht that he was the sole owner.  Yet, the Minister's predecessor, the Minister for Education, who adjures us often to have respect for the truth says: &ldquo;No, he is not,&rdquo; because, as he says, an additional director was appointed in December, 1956.  Listen to this: on 19th of December, of the 4,500 shares relinquished and sold to the surviving partner by the outgoing partner, 4,499 were added to the existing 4,500 of this agent, leaving him with 8,999 shares in this company and the one share was transferred to his typist in order to comply with the Companies' Acts&mdash;one share of the £9,000 capital.</P>
    <P>The agreement between Gaeltarra Éireann and this company was that Gaeltarra Éireann would supply him with tweed for export only.  Everybody in the tweed trade or in the clothes trade in this country in any shape or form knows that that agreement was violently broken on every possible occasion by this agent, and, by subterfuge and by all kinds of secret deals with traders all over the country, he sold the tweed within the country and, in one particular case, it was proven to the hilt.  Still, they say it does not mean anything.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputies would like to know, and the country would like to know, that the warehouseman in Gaeltarra Éireann who operates during the day there is the employee by night of the company which this agent owns, and it will be interesting also to know that people who work in Gaeltarra Éireann by day and elsewhere by night, earning relatively low salaries or wages, can afford to live at a rate higher than even the senior officers of the Department.  How is it done?  You may well ask yourselves how it is done.</P>
    <P>On the 27th November of last year, I raised on the Adjournment the subject-matter of a question which I had asked the Minister at Question Time on 21st November, arising out of the reply which I then received.  As I <Col N="767" /> said that evening on the Adjournment, I framed that question deliberately in order to see how far the present Minister would use his legal knowledge to protect this agent and withhold the whole truth from the House and from the country.  I asked the Minister if he would state the amount due and owing to the Gaeltarra Éireann section of his Department by a firm (name supplied) on each accounting date in the months of June, July, August, September and October, 1957, and, further, if he would state whether goods were still being delivered to the said firm, and, if so, whether on a cash or credit basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied that, as the answer was in the form of a tabular statement, he proposed, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report. The tabular statement consisted of five lines comprising the months June, July, August, September and October, and, against each of these five months, a sum of money.  The reason the Minister's reply to my question was framed in the form of a tabular statement was that I could not raise the matter immediately afterwards by way of supplementary question.</P>
    <P>Everybody accustomed to trade practices knows that amounts of money for goods supplied are not due until the discount term has passed, but, of course, it is owing all the time.  In my question, I used the expression &ldquo;due and owing&rdquo;.  I used that phrase deliberately in order to see how far the Minister was prepared to go to protect this individual and, at the same time, to withhold vital information from the House.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure that these are the figures, from my experience of the accountancy department of this section of Gaeltarra Éireann.  My experience of it and of its head was recorded in that office in writing before I left it.  I considered him a person who operated efficiently under difficult circumstances. I deliberately left that in writing because I recognised the difficulties which confronted an honest man, however efficient he might be.  I am not at all satisfied that these were the figures supplied to the Minister to <Col N="768" /> answer my question.  I am satisfied that the figures were altered by the Minister in order to bring them into line with the phrase &ldquo;due and owing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Of course, not having then been in office and, possibly, not then having any idea that he would be given charge of this Ministry, the Minister could not&mdash;by way of interesting himself or by way of being careful&mdash;have referred himself to the speech of his predecessor at the end of the debate on the Estimate for the Gaeltacht on 25th June, 1957.  As reported at column 951 of the Official Report, Volume 164, No. 6, the Minister told us that the amount this gentleman owed to Gaeltarra Éireann on the accounting date in June was £591 6s. 9d.  Listen to what his predecessor said in this House &mdash;under pressure&mdash;on 25th June, 1957, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 162, column 1207:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The current amount due by that company to Gaeltarra Éireann is, I understand, £9,370.  I am told that credit is allowed to companies and individuals who deal with Gaeltarra Éireann on the basis of reports from trade associations and banks.  That was done in this case just as in the cases of other customers.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lindsay: The amount of credit is greater than the actual capital of the company.  The Minister, I am sure, does not know whether that capital has been fully subscribed or not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You see, this agent, having been restored by the Minister's predecessor &mdash;no doubt, on the advice of the Government and after very solemn discussion about it in Party circles&mdash;had to be protected; but the present Minister forgot, when he was giving a figure of £591 6s. 9d., that his predecessor had acknowledged for the same month and for what, I take it, is the same accounting date, a figure of £9,370.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>A week later, on the Adjournment, the Minister ran away from it.  He ran out of this House for fear he would be called upon to make any sort of reply.  I raised the matter specifically on the Adjournment and, as I have said, the Minister ran away from it.</P>
      <P>I quote from Volume 164, column 1166:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lindsay: What about the other one?</P>
      <P>Mr. Moran: The Deputy has a motion down about the other one and I shall deal with that in due course.</P>
      <P>Mr. Lindsay: What about the £9,000?  The Minister will not talk about it.  Is this gentleman worth so much to Fianna Fáil that they have to protect him to this extent by silence?</P>
      <P>Donnchadh Ó Briain: Let the Deputy take his medicine.</P>
      <P>Mr. Moran: The Deputy can have and can keep the support of the gentleman who sent him here to waste the time of the House to-night.</P>
      <P>Mr. Lindsay: When I raised this question on the Adjournment, I expected the Minister to reply to it. No wonder it is alleged outside that this gentleman has paid heavily to Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Mr. Moran: Nobody will believe these wild allegations.</P>
      <P>Mr. Lindsay: They are not wild allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> Mr. Moran: The Deputy has spent long enough on this vendetta.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lindsay: Is the Minister's predecessor wrong about the £9,000?</P>
    <P>Mr. Moran: The Deputy has a motion down...and I shall deal with the Deputy later.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We hope he will be able to reconcile the situation to-night whenever he feels obliged to disclose how the discrepancy between £591 6s. 9d. and £9,370 arose.  If the Minister refuses an inquiry, I hope he will deal with what I allege are the facts, with matters which already have been the subject of a departmental inquiry.  Any statements I have made here about discount, standard goods and substandard goods, have already been found to be facts by a departmental inquiry presided over by the permanent head of the Department.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister will feel able to relate to the House and to the country the system under which records were kept in Gaeltarra Éireann.  While I would like him to tell the House and the country how the records were kept for knitwear, and from what date they were kept and how reliable they proved to be, I want him to deny, if he can, my solemn assertion now that there was no record kept for tweed.  A State-subsidised concern, run with the taxpayers' money, had no records for the production and sales of tweed.</P>
    <P>Agents had entry into the warehouses of the Department.  Certainly one agent's night-time employee was operating freely around those stores by day and by night, and I want the Minister to say, when replying to this debate, whether or not my warning of last June to his predecessor, and subsequently to himself, when he was in a hurry with the Gaeltacht Industries Bill, not to appoint a board until such time as the Public Accounts Committee had had an opportunity of examining this situation, was justified.  In other words, I wanted not alone the taxpayers to be satisfied, but I wanted the board of what I was sure were honest men, to be handed over something over which they could stand afterwards.  I did not want a situation where a board <Col N="771" /> of presumably honest men were to be handed over, lock, stock and barrel, a business where the records admitted of irregularities.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister now to tell the House and the country whether he has any knowledge of whether in any year from 1954 to 1956, or even up to 1957, there seemed either not taken into account, or missing from the stores of Gaeltarra Éireann, thousands of yards of tweed, valued at anything from £10,000 to £20,000, of which the Minister has no record and cannot say where it is, how it went, who took it, or whether it was from wrong accounting, wrong auditing or a wrong assessment from the yields in wool.  It is for that kind of thing I ask the inquiry.</P>
    <P>There is nothing personal in that as far as the Minister is concerned.  There is nothing personal in it at all.  The Minister cannot be expected to take personal umbrage at things which happened, and at things I complained took place before either he or I occupied the Ministry for the Gaeltacht, some of which in fact took place long before the Ministry was set up.  Lest it be alleged by the Minister that this motion of mine is in any way directed towards one person, I now want to tell him that I am about to give him information generally across the floor of this House that involves possibly the most consistent, most damning, and most longstanding fraud, certainly unilateral fraud, and a fraud which has been made possible through either of two things, negligence on the part of the staff of Gaeltarra Éireann, on the one hand, or conspiracy and fraud by some member or members of the staff of Gaeltarra Éireann, on the other hand.</P>
    <P>I have two sheets of paper in my hands.  On one is the name of a Dublin wool firm which is not unconnected, apart from sales and purchases, with Gaeltarra Éireaann and its workings; and on the other sheet of paper are the names of persons associated with that firm.  I am prepared to give these to the Minister, subject to his undertaking that they will be put into the hands of the Attorney-General forthwith, and that the police will be brought in to-night so that the records, papers, books and documents cannot <Col N="772" /> be destroyed before to-morrow morning. That places upon the Minister, in my view, a very serious responsibility. The contents of these two sheets of paper are at the Minister's disposal on the conditions I have stated.</P>
    <P>How is this done?  If anybody wants to make money quickly and if he has any knowledge of the wool trade and, with the full realisation that he has careless and willing hands to help him in Gaeltarra Éireann, one can get into it straight away.  This is how it is done.  You weigh 10,000 lb. of second-rate Irish wool and, having weighted it, you fill your consignment docket or invoice and make it out, not as second-rate Irish wool but as superwhite New Zealand greasy.  In the weight column, you do not fill in 10,000 lb. but you fill in any figure up to 15,000 lb.  The wool is transferred by someone in the public haulage companies and it reaches Gaeltarra Éireann depots either in Dublin or Donegal, where it is not checked, either carelessly or deliberately.</P>
    <P>Of course, through no fault of the accountancy branch of Gaeltarra Éireann, the accounts branch pay on these fraudulent invoices the rate obtainable for the better class wool and the heigher weight.  On that alone, the Minister has a serious responsibility in respect of the criminal code in this country, but on that alone he should hold an inquiry at once and put the public mind at ease.  This is not a question of what the Minister thinks, what I think or what any Deputy thinks.  These are figures, some of which have been proved already, some of which are capable of being proved beyond any shadow of doubt.</P>
    <P>If the Minister takes the step I advise him to take to-night before the records are destroyed, he will ease the public mind considerably.  If he does not take that step to-night, this House will hold him answerable for the amount of the taxpayers' money that has gone in one divide, in two-way divides or in three-way divides over the years.  He can take it upon himself to adjust not alone his personal conscience but his conscience as head of a State Department as well.  Those <Col N="773" /> are the facts on which I am asking that a Select Committee of the Oireachtas be set up to inquire into the affairs of Gaeltarra Éireann.  Those are only some of the things which I, in a very short time, have been able to find out.  Those are the matters upon which I ask the House to be given an opportunity of judging for themselves on the finding of a Committee. I ask that the findings of such a Committee be made available within three months, so that there will be no avoidable delay about the action that should be taken.</P>
    <P>Lastly, might I pertinently ask the Minister, having regard to the anxiety he had to get the Gaeltacht Industries Bill through this House and the Seanad, what he has done about setting up the board.  I suggest that, apart from the fact that there might be differences of opinion within the Government Party as to who should compose the board, the paramount reason for the delay is that the discrepancies, the irregularities and the fraud are well known, and the Government are delaying matters, hoping against hope that everything will come right.  In those circumstances, I ask the House to order that this inquiry be set up.  I suggest that the Minister acts to-night; otherwise the records will be forever destroyed after the appearance of the morning papers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I first want to refer to the terms of this motion as set out in the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a Select Committee, consisting of 11 members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, of whom four shall be a quorum, be appointed with power to send for persons, papers and records, to inquire into and report back to the Dáil within three months on the management and conduct generally of the affairs of the Gaeltarra Éireann section of the Department of the Gaeltacht, with particular reference to the production and marketing of Gaeltarra Éireann goods over the past five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> I must say that, listening to Deputy Lindsay so far, there has been a marked absence of reference to two of the things that are specifically set out in the motion and no reference at all to the marketing of Gaeltarra Éireann goods over the past five years.</P>
    <P>Ninety-nine per cent. of what Deputy Lindsay has said has been on the basis of justifying his sacking of an agent in Gaeltarra Éireann.  The Deputy seems to resent the suggestion that there was any personal spleen between him and the agent.  This whole matter between the Deputy and the agent seems to have originated in the Great Southern Hotel in Galway at Christmas, 1956.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am accepting the reference the Deputy himself has given and I will ask the House to judge, in reference to some of these dates, because they are very significant.  I make no comment on what the Deputy alleges took place between himself and this agent on that occasion.  Apart from the version the Deputy himself has given to the House on more than one occasion, I do not know what took place.  It is quite obvious, however, that something did take place on that occasion and I will ask any fair-minded Deputy to consider the very short time that elapsed between that incident, whatever it was, and the inquiry which the Deputy started when he was Minister&mdash;an inquiry concerned solely, as far as I can see from the records, with trying to get information on which to discharge the agent concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy had this meeting with this agent at Christmas, and on the 8th January, inside ten days from this meeting, Deputy Lindsay as Minister, started this inquiry in Gaeltarra Éireann.  That is particularly significant because the Deputy has stated and put on record that, before ever he became Minister for the Gaeltacht or connected with the Department in any way, he was aware of many things that were wrong in Gaeltarra Éireann. Having that knowledge it is very <Col N="775" /> strange that he started this inquiry only on the 8th January&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Officially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that he started this inquiry only after this incident to which he has referred that occurred between himself and this agent in the Railway Hotel in Galway.  The Deputy has said that he started it officially, and he referred on the last night he was speaking to exhaustive inquiries made by him throughout the length and breadth of this country as to what was happening in Gaeltarra Éireann. Strange to say the results of these exhaustive inquiries made, he alleges, both by himself and his private secretary, do not appear on any official file in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a reference on any file in my Department to any of the results of these alleged exhaustive inquiries that the Deputy made and in fact there is no record in my Department of his private secretary being absent anywhere out of the Department on official duties with the Deputy when he was Minister except on one occasion when he went to his own home country down in Ring.  I am giving this as an example of the exaggeration of the Deputy in alleging that he and his private secretary had conducted inquiries into matters that he suggests he was already aware of before he became Minister, were radically wrong with Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy became Minister on the 24th October.  He was before that Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Gaeltacht and during all these months both as Parliamentary Secretary and as Minister until the 8th January there was no inquiry made in the Department.  There were no questions asked by the Deputy in the Department about any of the matters in Gaeltarra Éireann which the Deputy now alleges he knew of before ever he became Minister.  It does seem strange to me, being reasonable about this matter, that here was Deputy Lindsay, armed before ever he was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary or, subsequently <Col N="776" /> as Minister, armed with the information that all these things were wrong in Gaeltarra Éireann, and he never put pen to paper about them until that significant date, the 8th January.</P>

      <P>The truth evidently is bitter because some Deputies opposite are not prepared to listen to it.  I again assert that there is not on one file in my Department any record of any question being raised by the former Minister about Gaeltarra Éireann until he started this inquiry on the 8th January.  The inquiry, <Col N="778" /> rather significantly, seems to have been conducted by the Deputy, who was then Minister, and directed solely at one agent of Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There was the exhaustive inquiry made about this agent's outside interests, whether his outside interests prevented him from giving sufficient time to his work as an agent of Gaeltarra Éireann.  It is rather significant that there were no questions asked about other agents of Gaeltarra Éireann, as to what their outside interests were or as to whether their private concerns in any way interfered with their work as agents of Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
      <P>Much play has been made by Deputy Lindsay of the fact that this agent was a sole director or a joint director of another company.  There was no reference made or no questions asked of another agent who is also a director of an outside company, no reference made to the fact that another agent has a very substantial farm of over 100 acres or no questions asked as to whether any of these things interfered with these agents' work or time for Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out the fact that the inquiry conducted by Deputy Lindsay seems to have been conducted for one purpose and for one purpose only, and that was to attack a particular agent and to find reasons, if he could, for dismissing him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be as well to refer now to the reasons given by Deputy Lindsay for the dismissal of this agent.  I should say, in passing, as I think the House knows or should know by now, that this agent was dismissed without notice by Deputy Lindsay on the last day the Deputy was in office as Minister.  He <Col N="779" /> was dismissed by special letter delivered to his hotel, without, as I say, any notice.  The Minister set out in writing&mdash;and left the record after him in writing&mdash;the reasons why he was dismissing him.</P>
    <P>The first reason he gives is that because of the fact that he was sole director of a certain company, he would not be able to give the full time required of him under his terms of appointment to Gaeltarra Éireann.  On the evidence left on the Minister's file, the fact remains that he was not the sole director of that concern, but whether he was or was not is immaterial. What is material is that there was no evidence, either in Gaeltarra Éireann or elsewhere, that this agent was not, in fact, giving his full time to Gaeltarra Éireann work; that he was not in fact, one of the most successful, if not the most successful, agent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can say that again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;employed in Gaeltarra Éireann.  His record with that concern&mdash;he was there for many years &mdash;will go to show that in fact he built up a very large business for Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Or for the firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>He was asked by the then Minister whether his interest in an outside firm interfered in any way with his work.  He told the Minister that it did not.  He told the Minister of the time which he devoted to the services of Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>And there was no evidence, nor has there been any evidence, on the records of the Department that there was ever any complaint as far as giving his time to Gaeltarra Éireann was concerned.  The second reason given by the then Minister for the agent's dismissal was that he sold goods in another agent's area.  It is very strange that the Minister had to go back to 1953 to dig up that complaint. The fact was that there was a small consignment of goods sold by this agent in County Donegal.  Long <Col N="780" /> before Deputy Lindsay became Minister for the Gaeltacht, there was a complaint made about this matter and the agent had given the circumstances in which the sale was made and had undertaken not to transgress that regulation in the future.  What I want to point out to the House is that the second reason for the dismissal of this man had to be dug up by Deputy Lindsay from the year 1953.  The complaint was investigated and the facts were admitted by the agent concerned.</P>
      <P>The third ground the Minister has set out in his reasons for the dismissal of this man&mdash;on his last day in office&mdash; was that he gave special discounts without the authority of Gaeltarra Éireann.  That matter was also investigated and it is on the records of the Department that, in every case in which an extra discount was given, it was authorised by Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Lynch was Minister for the Gaeltacht, he gave his reasons why this agent should be re-instated.  He re-investigated all the allegations of Deputy Lindsay and the reasons he had given.  Deputy Lynch was satisfied, first, that this man was a satisfactory agent and that any outside interests he had were not interfering with his work in any way; secondly that he did not give any special discounts without being authorised by the proper authority in Gaeltarra Éireann; and thirdly, he found no evidence to justify the summary dismissal of this man in the way he had been dismissed by Deputy Lindsay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> These are the simple facts as far as this agent is concerned, but all the questions addressed by Deputy Lindsay on this matter since he left the Department of the Gaeltacht seemed to be particularly directed towards this agent and towards making allegations that all kinds of perquisites, shall I say, were enjoyed by this man by virtue of his office in Gaeltarra Éireann.  Deputy Lindsay went to considerable trouble to try to show that some tremendous amounts of credit were being allowed particularly to this agent, but the extraordinary thing about it is that, while Deputy Lindsay was Minister, he never, in one instance, questioned the credits allowed to this man's firm.</P>
    <P>I want to show that not alone to-day or yesterday but over the years, very substantial amounts of credit were given&mdash;I do not say it was not right to give them&mdash;to a very substantial firm of which this agent was a director.  Further, it is a firm which is one of the best customers of Gaeltarra Éireann itself.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is going back some years.  It will be sufficient for my purpose to go back to 1954. Deputy Blowick was then in charge of that Department. If I take some months in 1954, 1955 and 1956, I can give figures to show the practice which was there and which was authorised, not alone by Gaeltarra Éireann but authorised, I assume, by all those responsible and all those in charge.  In June, 1954, the amount due by this firm&mdash;which is a reputable and creditable firm&mdash;was £10,230: in July, 1954, it was £12,483; in August it was £12,687; in September, £12,849; in October, £12,960; in November, £12,888; and in December, £13,221.  It went up in February, 1955, to £14,502; in March it was £14,421; in April, £14,491, and it goes on at £14,000 for a few more months and varies in 1955 from £10,000, to £14,000 odd.  In 1956 the figures run about £11,500, generally between £11,000 and £12,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In February&mdash;and, mind you, this is when the inquiries were conducted&mdash;it was £8,947 13s. 2d.  On the 20th March it was £9,712 18s. 1d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Deputy who is complaining now about the credit which was given to this firm, when in his own last two months in office, <Col N="783" /> under his direction and control, sums respectively of £8,947 13s. 2d. and £9,712 18s. 1d. were allowed in credit to that particular firm.</P>
      <P>The reports in Gaeltarra Éireann show this firm was quite creditworthy, but Deputy Lindsay complains now about this credit, though he himself was there when these figures I have quoted were allowed to that firm.  That is the best possible answer which can be given to his alleged complaints.  I assert again that no inquiry was ever made or no question raised by him when he was Minister as to the credits allowed or the credit allowed in this particular case.  No recommendation was ever made by him as to any steps which should be taken by Gaeltarra Éireann about accounts in general or that, in any cases where large credit was being allowed, bank guarantees or similar business precautions should be taken by anybody.</P>
      <P>In Deputy Blowick's time there were these sums I have quoted allowed in credit to this firm.  The volume of business done by them with Gaeltarra Éireann was very very substantial and I do not see that, in the ordinary custom of the trade, this firm would not be allowed, in view of the substantial volume of business they were doing, to get the same terms as any other firm.  I do not accept these broad allegations made by the Deputy now, that everything was rotten in Gaeltarra Éireann, that there were all these frauds and conspiracies.  Deputy Blowick never discovered any when he was there in charge of it for many years and he has put on the records of this House his tributes to the officers in charge there.  Neither were any discovered by Deputy Mulcahy, when he had the responsibility for Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>

I do not accept for a moment the innuendo that all these things were wrong for years under Deputy Blowick's administration and that Deputy Blowick was completely blind to what was happening under him.  The suggestion here is that this extraordinary fraud and conspiracy was known throughout the whole country to be there and that it was only when Deputy Lindsay left the Department that he discovered it.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, Deputy Lindsay has been making allegations about the extraordinarily low wages paid to Gaeltarra Éireann workers.  Reference has been made to 6d. an hour.  I want to make it clear, that in the main, workers in the factories in Gaeltarra Éireann in their centres are governed by the wages negotiated by different unions with Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
      <P>The Deputy trotted out &ldquo;6d. an hour&rdquo;, which he tried to put over as being a caighdeán or standard for workers in Gaeltarra Éireann, knowing quite well that he was referring to piece work, embroidery which is done in the homes, mainly as what one might call a hobby or pastime and which had nothing whatsoever to do with the workers in the Gaeltarra Éireann centres or factories.  The Deputy alleges that Gaeltarra Éireann were paying 6d. an hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>He wants to put the 6d. per hour over as the standard paid in the factories in Gaeltarra Éireann.  That has nothing whatsoever <Col N="785" /> to do with the work done in Gaeltarra Éireann.  He has referred to piece rates for embroidery and knitting done by people in their spare time in their own homes.  Whatever about the rates paid to these women in their own homes for this homework, he was careful not to mention that there are other people in competition with Gaeltarra Éireann in this work.  There are firms in Donegal in competition with Gaeltarra Éireann, firms which get embroidery and knitting done by the people in their own homes in their spare time.  These people have a choice.  They would not do this spare time work for Gaeltarra Éireann if they had a more profitable market or could procure more profitable employment from other people who operate there.  The real point is: what did Deputy Lindsay do about all this when he was Minister?  Sweet Fanny Adams!</P>

The Deputy did say, speaking here the other night, that he was frustrated, that there was extraordinary delay in answering his questions.

      <P>On Tuesday, 8th January, 1957, he asked for the name, address, nationality, date of appointment, district, type of goods to be sold and rate of commission for five home and 15 overseas agents, and the amount paid in commission over certain periods.  He got a reply on 21st January.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, 31st January, he asked a series of five questions concerning the conditions of appointment of home and foreign agents and the wholesale trading terms, discounts to retailers, sales to agents to their personal accounts, details of supplying goods by agents to mental hospitals, etc., and details of the procedure regarding the purchase of raw materials. He got that information on Tuesday, 5th February, and Wednesday, 6th February.</P>

      <P>With Saturday, a half-day, intervening.  On Saturday, 23rd February, he asked for details of sales to agents to their personal accounts in the year 1956.  That was Saturday, a half-day.  He got an answer on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, 23rd February, he asked questions regarding the procedure re production and sale of sub-standard knitwear.  He got an answer to that on Wednesday, 27th February. On Saturday, 23rd February also, he asked questions regarding the agent and firm to which reference has been made here.  He got his answer again on the 27th February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> On Saturday, 23rd February, he asked questions regarding sales to six named Dublin firms during 1954, 1955 and 1956.  From an examination of the invoices and credit notes, he got his answer.  Now, the answer to these questions directed by Deputy Lindsay, when Minister for the Gaeltacht, involved an examination of 45,000 documents by the accountant for the years in question.  Other members of the staff had to be taken off their ordinary work to deal with these inquiries.  With the exception of his first question, it appears to me that he got every single query answered, even sooner than an answer could have been expected considering the amount of work involved.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how the Deputy can now allege that there was an effort made to frustrate him in any way. Every question that he asked was answered to the best of the officials' ability in that Department.  As I said, before he left he paid special tribute to the accounting officer, on whom devolved mainly the task of going through all these invoices and taking out the information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I would like to have that in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>He got the utmost cooperation from the officials concerned in the Department.  Mark you, these are the officials who, taking them by and large, the Deputy alleges are engaged in some extraordinary conspiracy and fraud.  What the Deputy alleges, if there is anything in it, could not have been carried on without a large number of these people being involved in the conspiracy he alleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is the evidence of the conspiracy and fraud?  The fact remains that it is clear from all the Deputy's inquiries that there is no scintilla of evidence on the records of the Department or from his inquiry that one penny was lost by Gaeltarra Éireann or that one penny went astray in Gaeltarra Éireann.  The biggest part of the Deputy's case appeared to be based on an allegation that goods were sold at a higher discount than is usually allowed.  There are good reasons in the trade for different discounts being allowed to people in the <Col N="789" /> trade.  Some of the goods are not up to standard, but not a large amount. In the year in which the Deputy was inquiring, 8 per cent. of the total was regarded as sub-standard.  Portion of the blame for some of these goods being sub-standard is due to the fact that there was not any production manager there over quite a long time, and I could find no recommendation from the Deputy to right that situation in the Department either.</P>
    <P>Beside goods being sub-standard for some technical reason, there was also the fact that if they are long in stock and if fashions change, it may be difficult to shift them.  From time to time in Gaeltarra Éireann, as in every other concern, goods are there for quite a long time and they cannot be shifted. Something must be done about them. On occasion, it became necessary for Gaeltarra Éireann, as happens in any other similar firm, to shift, at a special discount, stocks which had accrued and part of which, from a fashion or colouring point of view, was no longer saleable in view of the competition there is in the market.  I do not believe there is any concern engaged in this business that has not from time to time to give special inducements to customers to shift goods that are slow in shifting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department's records show it is true and the inquiry carried out by my predecessor shows it is true.  I can find no evidence on any file of a single instance of any special discount being given without being duly sanctioned by the proper officer in Gaeltarra Éireann.  In fact, if anybody was to gain by such a discount being given, it would be the traders concerned. It would not mean anything to the people in Gaeltarra Éireann whether 10 per cent. or 20 per cent. was given.  The majority of the people dealing with this matter, particularly those in charge, are permanent civil servants and it did not matter one jot to them personally whether 10 per cent., 15 per cent. or 30 per cent. was given.  The only people to benefit from that were the traders.  But the fact remains that Gaeltarra Éireann benefited because they had to get rid of goods that were not shifting and they were having difficulty in selling.</P>
      <P>It is true that this is a competitive business and that there are many firms engaged in it with a particular increase in the volume of their business since 1950.  It is also true that from time to time there are differences of opinion about the standards.  Some manageresses in some instances would pass garments that would not be passed by Gaeltarra Éireann when they came up here.  The result was that, on further examination, a number of these garments would have to be condemned and sold as sub-standard; but taking the picture all in all, only approximately 8 per cent. were sold as sub-standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particular significance was given by Deputy Lindsay to the suggestion that a particular agent, the Dublin agent, had a monopoly of the sale of these sub-standard goods at this special discount. But the fact remains that a far larger proportion were sold in the West of Ireland than in Dublin.  Forty seven per cent. of the total was sold in the West of Ireland; only 41 per cent. <Col N="791" /> was sold by the agent the Deputy was inquiring about.  These figures would not indicate that there was this special conspiracy and fraud by all and sundry in Gaeltarra Éireann to provide an outlet for the operations of this one agent whom the Deputy does not like&mdash;&mdash;</P>

These records are now being kept in Gaeltarra Éireann as a result of whatever suggestion the Public Accounts Committee made.  I want the House to understand that in this Department there is an accounting officer fully responsible for the accounts, an officer to whom Deputy Lindsay himself has paid tribute.  He is what would be regarded as the auditor in an outside concern.  He is fully responsible. Even Deputy Lindsay, no matter what he thinks of the rest of the people in Gaeltarra Éireann, considers that this accounting officer is a good man and an honest man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When raising this matter originally to-day, I expected the Minister would have rectified what is evidently a mistake.  In regard to barley, the Minister said that anything over 20 per cent. moisture should suffer a reduction.  He did not, however, advert to what would become of the man who sent in barley with 17 per cent. or 18 per cent. moisture.  Unfortunately, last year all that barley was paid for as if it contained 20 per cent. moisture and there was no difference in the price.</P>
      <P>I should like to call the Minister's attention to this fact.  Messrs. Arthur Guinness and Son in dealing with malting barley had a cut of 1/- per 1 per cent. in regard to barley containing over 20 per cent moisture and gave an increase of 1/6 per 1 per cent. in regard to barley with a moisture content of under 20 per cent.  In other words, Messrs. Arthur Guinness and Son, when looking for a good article, were prepared to give a bonus on it.</P>
      <P>The Minister also stated in his reply that the c.i.f. prices quoted for imported barley were from 35/6 to 40/9 a barrel.  The question of feeding barley has a pretty long history.  In 1951, the late Deputy Tom Walsh, God rest his soul, as Minister for Agriculture, fixed the price of feeding barley at 48/-.</P>

      <P>The result was that on the admission of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce there was collected from the pig feeders £1,096,000.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where the Minister got the figure of 35/6 to 40/9 as the price of imported feeding barley.  The only thing I can rely upon is the Statistical Abstract in respect of October last which tells me that 683,000 cwt. of foreign barley were imported at a cost of £840,502, which was exactly 49/2 per barrel.  I am not worrying about what is offered for something you do not want to buy. Those are the only figures I can find in relation to the price of imported feeding barley at present.  Accordingly, if the Minister was anxious to bring the feeders more into line with the price of imported barley, his headline should be 49/2.</P>
      <P>What is happening the feeder&mdash;the man who feeds the barley?  I should like to give a small instance of that. In an Order made by the Minister last month or perhaps early this month, Grain Importers are allowed to charge £28 per ton for the barley they purchased at 40/-.  I have here a circular which was sent out in that connection and it states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" />&ldquo;We have now received a direction from the Minister for Agriculture relative to the disposal of stocks of barley held by us and in accordance therewith, as from 17th February, 1958, orders for barley may be solicited on the following terms and conditions:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us follow this up a little.  I had the pleasure of meeting a barley buyer who bought barley last harvest and sold it.  He gave me this information.  He sold his barley to those people last December after reducing it to 16 per cent. moisture.  He sold it to them at 48/- per barrel with the instruction that he was to hold the barley in his stores at 3d. per ton per month storage charges.  He told me that the cost of drying 20 per cent. barley down to 16 per cent. is 3/- per barrel and the loss in weight 4 per cent., amounting to 2/- per barrel. That barley stood him at 45/- a barrel. He sold it to Grain Importers at 48/-. He got 3/- for his trouble, but Irish Grain Importers, after buying it in December, in the month of February, issued a circular charging 56/- a barrel for barley they bought at 48/-.  I should like to know a little more about why this should happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pig feeder whom this reduced price is supposed to benefit now gets the 40/- barley at 56/-, plus the ration makers' profit, for this is now bought by the gentlemen making the ration, and it would probably amount to 65/- <Col N="795" /> by the time it goes into ration.  This is the cheap barley.  I wonder what price per cwt. should we get for the pig if we have to pay 65/- a barrel for barley?  Is there any justification for this?  Is there any prices board or commission to control the price of the barley that was bought from the farmer at 40/- and is now being resold to the pig feeder at 60/- or 65/-?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to see people making fools of themselves.  That is the position as I view it.  That is an example for the Minister of what is happening.  I do not think the miserable cut of 3/-, from 40/- to 37/-, is justified.  The 3/- was for the fellow who bought the barley and who got 48/- for it when it cost him 45/-.  The other gentleman does not even handle it, but leaves it in the buyer's store, and I understand Grain Importers are a non-profit-making concern&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>You left them there. Grain Importers Limited leave the barley with the buyer and make money on it.  If I buy six tons of it, I take six tons from the buyer and they get the difference between 48/- and 56/-. To be honest about it, I think that is going a little too far.  Last year, wheat offals were imported at about £18 per ton as against the £26 paid the previous year.  Since that is the situation, I suggest to the Minister that he could revise his price and I would appeal to him to show some consideration for the man who carries out good farming. If he did, he would bring about very pleasing results.  The average moisture content of barley delivered to Messrs. Arthur Guinness last year was less than 18 per cent.  Where is the incentive for a man to have his feeding barley moisture content down to 18 per cent?  If he tests for moisture himself, he will probably have to spread it out in the rain to catch the extra 2 per cent. water because if he loses the 2 per cent. moisture, it will cost him roughly 1/- a barrel.  He loses that in any case if he is paid only on 20 per cent.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> I know of no buyer last year who took that into consideration in purchasing barley.  They carried out the instructions all right in fining for barley over 20 per cent. but they did not give a halfpenny extra to those who brought it in at 17 per cent. or 18 per cent. moisture content.  The Minister should make that revision of the prices and give at least the same. If the grower is to be fined 1/- for every 1 per cent. over 20 per cent. he should also get a 1/- more for every 1 per cent. under 20 per cent. in the barrel.  That is as fair as I can make the case.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to make a complete investigation into the activities of the gentlemen who succeeded in increasing the price from 48/- to 56/-.</P>

      <P>I would urge the Minister to consider that seriously because I believe the farmer who finds his barley price cut to 37/- a barrel will find some use for his land other than growing feeding barley next year.  It will not happen this year because unfortunately the farmers did not know about it until the land was ploughed. After the next harvest, the Minister will be able to make full use of Irish Shipping Limited to bring in feeding barley, but I promise him he will not import it at 40/9 or 35/- a barrel.</P>

      <P>I want just two minutes.  Deputy Corry mentioned a price of 35/- per barrel for barley.  I grew some barley at one time when Deputy Corry and his colleagues had a lot to do with the fixing of the price of barley.  They fixed the price of barley at 35/- a barrel notwithstanding <Col N="797" /> that the brewers were paying 72/- for imported barley.  There was nobody to come into Dáil Éireann then to raise the matter.  Now it suits Deputy Corry to come in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are counties like Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim, possibly Mayo and a few other counties who have to buy barley.  The farmers in these counties must be considered because they have to feed pigs and poultry.  When the Minister was fixing the price he had to consider these people who purchase barley.  Small farmers <Col N="798" /> in Monaghan have to buy everything that their poultry and pigs eat and the major part of that feeding stuff is barley.  The big farmers put in a lot of wheat and barley but our farmers are concerned with feeding pigs; barley is a big factor in that connection.  The Minister, being from Cavan, knows that these Northern farmers do not grow barley and that barley costs them a big price and he had consideration for them when fixing the price.  Barley is considered the most suitable feeding stuff for producing bacon.  The Minister took all these things into consideration when fixing the price.</P>

      <P>I was hoping that I would not be called upon to speak on the subject of cereals to-night because we are having a five-hour discussion to-morrow.  Part of the case which Deputy Corry made is very near my own mind and my own way of thinking.  He cited the case of barley bought in the green condition by Grain Importers at £2 per barrel being offered now at 48/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to tell the story in a simple way.  One of the reasons why I dislike the whole idea of fixing a price for barley is that, in order to make it effective, there must be some semi-State organisation to give colour and effect to any price fixed.  Then that State organisation has to rent premises at the highest cost, borrow money and pay interest on it. When all that is added up, the barley that was purchased by them in order to <Col N="799" /> put a floor on the price of barley and to give reality to the price that was fixed, if sold now to customers in Monaghan, Mayo and all the other centres where the compound is made for the type of user to which Deputy Mooney has referred would have to be charged for, not at the rate of £28 a ton but £29 5s. a ton.  Before fixing or naming a price, in my discussions with the representatives of the National Farmers' Organisation and others who have views to express on this question, I left them in no doubt as to what my general attitude was towards this matter.</P>
      <P>What is feeding barley other than a feeding crop?  What is feeding barley other than the raw material of other industries?  What is feeding barley but a little more important and a little more valuable than oats?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been decreased, with the result that the millers and the people who are grinding and providing <Col N="800" /> the very limited amount, these days, of oatenmeal used by our people could not get enough oats to make that oatenmeal without coming to me for a licence to import oats at a time when we had surplus wheat and had barley on our hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have an opportunity at another time to deal with this whole matter in a much more comprehensive fashion.  I am not in the least embarrassed by the decision I have taken nor am I in the least embarrassed when I say, in conclusion, that if I should happen to be alive this time next year, I shall revert to the line of thought which I held before I named a price at all this year for barley because, in order to give effect to any price, you must have some organisation that will come into the market for barley after the harvest time and, in order to do that, you must have some State organisation such as Grain Importers.  When you call upon a State organisation to intervene in that kind of business it means additional costs which ultimately fall on the shoulders of those who use the commodity for conversion into a finished product.  I do not agree with that policy and will make myself far more clear, I hope, on another occasion, in this House or outside it, before any audience or any jury of farmers or otherwise.</P>
