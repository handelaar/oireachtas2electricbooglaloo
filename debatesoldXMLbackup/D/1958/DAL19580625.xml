    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state (i) the total average cost of maintenance of one patient for one year at the Cherry Orchard poliomyelitis unit, (ii) the total number of children infected by polio in 1956 and the number who died, and (iii) the total estimated cost to the State for the institutional treatment of all the children who suffered from poliomyelitis in 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The unit to which the first part of the question relates is part of the Dublin Fever Hospital, Cherry Orchard, which caters for patients suffering from various types of infectious disease.  Separate costings in regard to the unit mentioned are not available.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second part of the question, I presume the information required by the Deputy is the number of children admitted to hospital, diagnosed as suffering from acute anterior poliomyelitis.  The number of such children in 1956 was 437.  The number of children whose deaths were certified as being due to the disease was nine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Treatment for patients affected by poliomyelitis is provided in a variety of hospitals, e.g, special units in fever hospitals, some of which fever hospitals are units in general hospitals (such as the Galway Regional Hospital and St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork) as well as in orthopaedic hospitals.  As in the case of the Cherry Orchard institution, separate costings are not available in relation to the special poliomyelitis <Col N="617" /> units or in relation to post-poliomyelitis patients in general units and, consequently, the information requested in the third part of the question is not available.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Polio Vaccination Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what is the estimated additional number of children who will be vaccinated free of charge following the recent change of policy by him in regard to polio vaccination; if any upper limit for expenditure by health authorities has been fixed by his Department, and, if so, what is the estimated total additional cost which is to be permitted to health authorities; and, if health authorities find that they are exceeding permitted expenditure, what category of children are to be excluded under the new free scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the assumption made in the first part of the question; there has been no change of policy in connection with the provision of free vaccination against poliomyelitis. I am adhering to the principle enunciated in my Department's circular of 17th May, to wit, that parents who cannot, without undue hardship, provide out of their own resources for the vaccination of their children are entitled to avail of the public anti-polio vaccination service free of charge.  I see no reason to change my view that it would be unjustifiable to impose additional burdens by way of rates and taxes on the lower income and middle income groups generally in order to provide anti-polio vaccination free for all comers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what percentage of the total child population at risk it is estimated will be vaccinated this year under the polio vaccination scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the value of anti-polio vaccination measures is becoming more widely appreciated and in view also of the considerable extension of the age limits of the eligible groups, it is probable that the number of children who will be presented for vaccination this year will be greatly in excess of the number presented last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> From the financial point of view, accordingly, it would not be prudent to proceed on the assumption that the number of children participating in the current year will be appreciably less than the total number of children in the eligible groups.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether, in view of the value of polio vaccination in preventing childhood infection, he will institute a national campaign, through the use of the usual propaganda methods, urging on all parents the desirability of having their children vaccinated against poliomyelitis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The value of poliomyelitis vaccination has been given widespread publicity in the national and local Press and by me.  It is moreover the practice of health authorities to give suitable publicity to their arrangements for the provision of vaccination. In the circumstances, I do not consider that further measures are necessary to bring the matter to the notice of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will give details of the proposed extension of the scheme for anti-polio vaccination of children; and if he will include in the proposed scheme provision to cover those parents who come within the scheme and who had already undertaken the expense of having children vaccinated against polio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements proposed will be administered by health authorities and will extend to children over six months and under ten years of age of parents and guardians in the classes specified in Section 15 (2) of the Health Act, 1953, which include persons in the upper range of the middle income group who would be unable, without undue hardship, to provide the service for their dependants.</P>
      <P>Charges will be made in accordance with the following scale for the full course of three injections: 15/- each, where one or two children from the same family participate; and 10/- each, where three or more children from the same family participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" /> As the charges are intended to meet substantially the cost of the service to health authorities, provision is not included in the scheme for the expenses of vaccination carried out under private arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister ease the public mind in regard to this matter?  If there is an outbreak, such as we had in the last two years, will he ensure that all children are vaccinated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy to take note of the definition of &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; in sub-section (1) of Section 27, where it says: &ldquo;...&lsquo;business premises&rsquo;, in relation to a body corporate, includes all premises occupied by that body for the purpose of any trade carried on by it.&rdquo;  There is a proviso lower down which says: &ldquo;...except where the reference is expressly to premises which include living accommodation, &lsquo;business premises&rsquo; does not include so much of any such premises as aforesaid as is used wholly or mainly as living accommodation for any of the directors of the body corporate or for any persons employed by the body corporate...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> Premises, therefore, have a wider definition in one instance and a narrower definition in another.  Let us take sub-section (2).  This sub-section does not include living accommodation and, therefore, the wider definition will apply.  Sub-section (3) does include living accommodation and, therefore, the restricted definition will apply. Whether it is in the wider sense or in the restricted sense we must have the reference to business premises and to take it out would achieve nothing except to remove the sense of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of what it would achieve I want to try and understand what the two sub-sections mean.  In sub-section (2) it is the wider definition because there is no mention of living accommodation. But in that sub-section does &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo; mean a room with an easy chair to put your legs up to the fireplace or what sort of accommodation is it if you do not have living accommodation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It really means accommodation for the employee to do his work.  &ldquo;Supplies or services&rdquo; would mean that he would be supplied with the necessary equipment to sit down, and so on.  If that sub-section was not put in it might be held&mdash;although I am very doubtful&mdash;that these were services that the managing director was getting which were not provided for and for which therefore he would have to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo; there means what one might term office accommodation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Passing on to sub-section (3), this includes living accommodation. Therefore the definition of &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; is that included in Section 27 (1) without the proviso. Is that the case the Minister is making?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the words: &ldquo;all premises occupied by that body for the purpose of any trade <Col N="638" /> carried on by it&rdquo;, let us go back to the shop with the living accommodation over it.  The premises are owned undoubtedly by the body corporate but if there is a separate valuation for the shop and the upstairs part of the premises, then it is quite clear that sub-section (1) covers the upstairs floors.  I admit that it is intended to be clear but it is far from clear on the drafting.  The &ldquo;body&rdquo; only occupies the premises for the purpose of the trade, the actual shop premises in which the trade is carried on.  Even if we went back on some of the examples we were discussing last night there would, on that definition, be a case for saying that the bank occupied the offices downstairs for the purposes of the trade and that the upstairs was not occupied by the bank for the purpose of the trade carried on in it, but it was occupied by the bank to put the bank manager into occupation of it.</P>
      <P>I shall travel this far with the Minister, that it might perhaps be a more suitable matter for discussion on sub-section (1) of Section 27 than it is here, because the Minister has persuaded me this far, that it is more on the definition of &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; than on the wording of sub-section (3) that there might be the difficulty which I envisaged.  Therefore, I can raise it again on Section 27.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be more appropriate to discuss it on Section 27, but may I say that I am assured that when we say: &ldquo;includes all premises occupied by that body for the purpose of any trade carried on by it&rdquo; this undoubtedly includes living accommodation for its employees?  There were some examples given last night.  For instance, if there was a house in the grounds of a maltster where he lived, it would be included in the business premises and, of course, the bank manager's house would, too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 28:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), page 14, to delete lines 30 to 34, inclusive.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to alter sub-section (3) as it now stands.  We have discussed sub-section (3) fairly exhaustively and it emerges clearly that an employee will be excluded from the provisions of Section 22 provided he complies with (a) or (b) of the sub-section.  I am concerned with the fact that, as the sub-section stands, a director of a company cannot come under that exemption. The purpose of the amendment is to have the same exemption available to a director under sub-section (3) as is available to an employee.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why there should be any distinction particularly as we have discussed over and over again in this debate the case of the director or manager of the business premises which is typical in this country.  There is no doubt that it is a custom, and a very desirable one, that after years of service a manager or higher executive of the type we have mentioned is made a director of the company with some small, nominal shareholding. It gives him a status and security which he would not otherwise have. It gives him an interest in the business and it is an ideal arrangement from the point of view of the parties themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious, in so far as that custom prevails, that it should not be interfered with or hampered in any way.  It is a desirable custom and one that should continue.  It applies not alone in the type of country business we have discussed but in other businesses also.  It is a trend in modern business management that where you have an executive, in some cases a young executive who shows exceptional promise, that, as an added incentive, he is taken on to the board of directors with a very small nominal <Col N="641" /> shareholding.  It is such people I am interested in and I cannot see that the general purposes of Section 22 are seriously interfered with or that the Revenue would be in any way hampered in their work if the amendment were accepted.  I would urge the Minister to accept it.  I do not want any discrimination against this very desirable practice of making good and faithful servants directors as a reward for their labours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting Deputy Haughey in this.  He and I were thinking on the same lines when putting in amendments.  I cannot see what the purpose of the proviso is.  I can understand the view, although I may not agree with it in other aspects, that there is an effort all through the Bill to make the position in relation to directors far more restrictive than in relation to employees, the theory being that the director is likely to be the owner of a substantial block of shares in the company and therefore has some control.  But this is not dealing with something that flows in any way from that control; this relates to where there is either a long-standing custom that for the type of business concerned a person of that sort resides on the trade premises or adjacent to it, or that it is necessary because of the type of business concerned.  I cannot see why, when it refers solely to the two types of exemptions given in clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (3), there is any necessity to differentiate between directors and employees.</P>
      <P>The tendency in modern times is to abandon the old idea of having no executive directors.  The tendency now is to have executive directors even though in addition to them you may have other part-time directors who come in from the point of view of giving their wider background and general knowledge in the determination of the general policy of the company. This matter does not affect them so much; it is the employee director, the executive director against whom these five lines are directed.  It is contrary to the whole trend of modern commercial life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey has given examples of the type of executive director there <Col N="642" /> may be, the young man learning the job as he should from the bottom next the works and, on the other hand, the old employee of long and faithful service who is promoted towards the end of his time to be a director from the points of view of the acknowledgment of merit that such promotion entails and possibly the additional financial reward also involved.  This proviso in these five lines strikes at the root of both practices and I think the Minister will agree that without question they are good practices and should be facilitated rather than legislated against as is done in the Bill as drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that this follows the pattern of Part IV generally in that we are treating directors in a different way from employees.  The big difference, to begin with, is that the employee comes in for consideration only under Part IV if his emoluments are more than £1,500 a year.  In the case of a director it does not matter what amount he gets; he is dealt with under this part of the Bill. We are not as kind, as it were, to directors as to employees because it is felt that a director can wield a good deal of influence with the company to get any amenity that may be going. He would be in a position to get living accommodation if it were available where a company might not go out of its way to make living accommodation available to an employee.  For that reason I feel we should be more particular about giving the same concessions to a director as we would give to an employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree with me that there is an entirely different principle at issue here.  Part IV of the Bill is framed on the premises that one should be more particular in the case of a director because of his powers of selection than one would be in the case of an employee. One may agree or disagree with that but that is not the issue at all in this section.  The sole question at issue is whether the arrangement has been prevailing over a period of ten years or whether such a practice is necessary.  That is the sole matter at <Col N="643" /> issue here.  Once the practice is there I cannot see what difference it makes whether the person is an employee or a director, once the practice is necessary I cannot see, either, what difference it makes whether the person concerned is an employee or a director.</P>
      <P>Acceptance by the Minister of the point of view put forward by Deputy Haughey and me does not involve the Minister in any weakening in his general line that the director must be treated more restrictively than the employee.  I am not suggesting that we agree with that general line but the acceptance or deletion of this proviso does not breach that general line.  This relates only to the two matters contained in clauses (a) and (b) and there is nothing in (a) or (b) that breaches the difference in the general line which the Minister has taken as between director and employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know whether Deputy Haughey has in mind a man who was a manager and became a director.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is different from a man who was a director and became a manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A case in point would be that of a country, or, indeed, a city public house, where a man was a manager for 20 years and at the end of his days became a director.  He still continues in his capacity as a manager. The very fact that he has become a director would exclude him under this section.  That is one of the cases I have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a case with which I have some sympathy because it is taking from a man a benefit which he has enjoyed for some years.  However, against that, in all probability if he were a director he would be better off and could afford to pay this small rent.  It will be very small because it will be on the poor law valuation of the part of the premises occupied by him.  I have some sympathy with the idea behind Deputy Haughey's <Col N="644" /> amendment if it applies only to a case where a man has been accustomed to this amenity for some years and then becomes a director.  I shall look into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is to be only a very small amount, it is not worth while complicating, the section from the point of view of inserting another proviso.  I do not think that it is worth complicating the whole section to provide for one type of person.  The difference is very trifling.  I accept that the Minister could argue that his acceptance of the amendment would breach his general line that there is a difference between director and employee.  I can see the Minister's point of view if acceptance of the amendment would involve such a breach but as far as I can see it does not involve such a breach at all.</P>
      <P>The position is set out quite clearly in the two clauses mentioned and I urge the Minister to look at it from the general point of view between now and the Report Stage.  I think that, if he does, the Minister will find that the acceptance of the amendment in full is not a breach of a general line of differentiation between directors and employees.  It is hardly worth while, having regard to the other things involved, to make half a bite of our cherry.</P>

      <P>It could still be a substantial matter.

We did not take it over because the price was too high.  I remember saying: &ldquo;That is the house <Col N="645" /> the manager lived in and if we take it over I am going to have it for myself.&rdquo;  It was a lovely place and if some money had been spent on it it would be a great residence.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 may be discussed together here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 29:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) Sub-section (1) of this section shall not apply to expense incurred by a body corporate in or in connection with the provision for any director or employee of the use of a motor vehicle or other transport facilities provided that it is proved to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that such facilities are availed of by such director or employee for the purposes of his employment only.</P>
      <P>I think the purpose of the amendment is quite clear.  Apart from the particular thing that the amendment tries to do, I should like the Minister to consider again the general implications of Section 22.  We have all spoken of the all embracing nature of that section and of the trouble and difficulty it will put upon business people generally and also upon the Revenue Commissioners.  The idea behind these two amendments would, to some extent, reduce that trouble and hardship. Apart from that, I think it can stand on its own legs and be justified <i>per se.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that a clear case can be made for the provision either of a motor car or transport facilities for either the director or employees of certain firms.  I have in mind a business which has a very great number of branches.  There is a type of person in a controlling capacity and it is <Col N="646" /> absolutely vital to that person that the services of a car and driver be placed at his disposal in order that he can efficiently control and supervise the activities of the different branches. That is only one instance and I am quite certain Deputies would be able to give 100 more examples of that sort.  However, in so far as it is one instance, I think it proves my point.  There is complete justification for exempting from the scope of this section the types of benefit envisaged in amendments Nos. 29 and 30.</P>
    <P>In so far as the amount which is to be allowed, which would be exempted in my particular amendment, I was relying on sub-section (6)&mdash;which deals with apportionment&mdash;to mean if the vehicle, car or service were used outside the employment then, of course, the amount which was not strictly applicable to the employment could be apportioned, and would automatically come within the ambit of the section. I would press upon the Minister the desirability of accepting, if not my amendment, then at least amendment No. 30, or failing that, accepting the principle that in so far as the director or employee used exclusively for business purposes a car, motor vehicle or transport facility of any kind, they should not be treated as the sort of benefits which are taxed under Section 22.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, I am in some difficulty in relation to the problem from the point of view of interpretation. I am not particularly clear under Deputy Haughey's amendment whether the fact&mdash;to quote the example I gave yesterday&mdash;that an employee or director drives on company business down to Nenagh and then, having finished his business in Nenagh, drives out to the golf club to play golf after his business is over in the evening, <i>per se</i> involves him in a charge for his pleasure trip which invalidates the whole user of the car for business purposes otherwise.  I think there is some doubt on the drafting on that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am all against a person who is the director of an investment company, to quote an extreme example, who can not for the purposes of his business require a motor car, getting the use of <Col N="647" /> a car free on the company's account. It seems to me that is a method of avoiding his personal director's responsibility that he should not avoid. In such circumstances if the job of this particular person with the company does not require a car for the business of the company he should not be given a car free under any circumstances.  In so far as that limited scope is covered, I am at one with the Minister.</P>
    <P>However, it seems to me it is absurd to try and bring in a basis of apportionment where a person genuinely needs a car all during working hours. Take the example of a high-grade commercial traveller, the case of an employee earning more than £1,500 a year.  It seems to me absurd to suggest that when that employee goes down the country, when he has finished his work and is marooned in a country town away from his home, the ordinary small relaxation that he will require by the usage of his car that evening, should be treated as something for which he should be assessed.  That is the purpose of the phraseology of mine in Section 30.</P>
    <P>It seems to me it is part of that man's business to keep moving around the country, and that when he is away from his home base down the country you cannot classify him in the same way as a person is classified under the Income-Tax Acts prohibiting any allowance for travelling to or from his place of business.  That person is down the country on business and requires his motor vehicle during the period he is working&mdash;during his working hours &mdash;and he should be able to utilise that vehicle after working hours without invalidating the whole procedure provided. If I have not expressed that perfectly it is merely a mistake in drafting.  It is clear that person is a person who needs his motor vehicle genuinely for the due performance of his business.</P>
    <P>I assume the Minister will say there have been cases where people have charged motor vehicles on company accounts even though they had no real business to use those cars for company business.  By all means let the Minister stop that loophole but, where a <Col N="648" /> person does, for the purposes of his business, genuinely require a motor car during his ordinary working hours I think it is silly, pernickety and finicky to tax him on the usage of the car in the evening after working hours are finished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of degree to a great extent.  First of all, the businessman, say Deputy Haughey, has a car of his own.  If he has to go down the country on business he is entitled to charge expenses and to that extent he is allowed expenses when making up his income-tax returns.  I do not see how I can put the employee in a different position.  The employee is supplied with a car by the company and there are degrees of usage.  Quite true, some of them may use the car on business 90 per cent. of the time or maybe even more, and some of them may use the car only 50 per cent. of the time on business purposes.  I think for that reason you will have to have an investigation in each case.  The practice is, of course, that if men are working with a company doing the same type of work the inspector says: &ldquo;We will take it five-sixths for the company and one-sixth for yourself.&rdquo; That is not charged as a rule unless something occurs where the inspector thinks a charge should be made.  To depart from the principle of having the power to investigate each case would not be right and would not be just between one person and another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see how the two Deputies concerned could really insist upon this amendment without some powers left to the Revenue Commissioners in the matter.  It might very well be, indeed, that if the Revenue Commissioners were to examine the case of a certain company who had travellers on the road, for one reason or another they might find that on the average they were using their cars over 90 per cent. for business purposes, and they will say: &ldquo;We shall not bother going after them for income-tax.&rdquo;  Things might very easily change after a year or two and, if we were to accept this amendment, as far as I can see, they would have no power to investigate the thing further.  In case conditions <Col N="649" /> changed, they would have no power to go back and examine again.  If we do not accept this amendment, the only difference is that they would have power to go back again.  In practice, if conditions remain much the same with that company, there will be no change made in the original agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must disagree with the Minister when he talks about power.  The amendment has nothing to do with the power of the commissioners to investigate.  As a matter of fact, Section 22 has nothing to do with the power to investigate any such benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought they had got all the possible powers to investigate anything under the sun as a result of the earlier Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment as I see it would merely give the Revenue Commissioners authority, after they had investigated any particular case, to say: &ldquo;Very well.  That motor vehicle or that facility is provided exclusively for business purposes and therefore shall be exempt from Section 22.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is one other little aspect of the matter that I should like to put to the Minister.  If a commercial traveller is supplied with a car and the inspector of taxes in any year says that the value of that car is £200 and that he will disallow one-fifth of it as being private, up to now, if that one-fifth was disallowed as being for private use in so far as the company was paying all the cost of the car, the disadvantage of the disallowance of that one-fifth fell on the company.  Now, the Minister, by Section 22, is going to ensure that any such amount disallowed as being for private use will be added on to the individual's income and taxed accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does not mean to do this but what he is doing indirectly, in so far as this disallowance for private use is concerned, is taking the disadvantage away from the company and putting it on the individual employee. That is just one little disadvantage of the section as it stands at the moment.  Surely I am right <Col N="650" /> when I say that the Revenue would still be entitled to investigate everything and see what the facts are and then come to a decision.  All I want to do is to give them the authority, when they have investigated it, to say: &ldquo;Very well.  All of that motor vehicle or all of that facility or a certain proportion of it is exclusively for business purposes and, therefore, cannot be taxable in the case of the individual.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister say that it takes away the power of investigation when Deputy Haughey's amendment says, &ldquo;provided that it is proved to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;? Does not that imply investigation?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it will be clear what I have in mind in this amendment.  It very often happens and is likely to happen much more frequently in the future that an Irish company or trading concern, particularly in the manufacturing business, brings to this country an expert or technician from abroad and keeps him here for a certain period while he is either installing machinery or training workers or doing some other work of a technical or scientific nature. Everybody will agree that practice is very desirable and that it certainly will be on the increase in the future. With the development of modern <Col N="652" /> technology, the practice is bound to increase very considerably.</P>
    <P>I also have in mind in regard to this amendment the efforts which we are making to develop industries in the undeveloped areas under An Foras Tionscal.  It is very likely that, if you were to say to some foreign expert or technician that you wanted him to go to Westport, for instance, to carry out the type of service I have in mind, the first question he would put is: &ldquo;Can you provide me with living accommodation?&rdquo; It is very likely that in a great number of these cases the provision of living accommodation will be an essential part of the contract.  My amendment seeks to exempt from taxation the provision of such living accommodation for such person from the provisions of Section 22.  It is a perfectly reasonable suggestion.</P>
    <P>It is a very desirable thing in the national interest to persuade the type of people I have in mind to come here. In persuading them we will have to offer inducements and benefits of one sort or another.  It would be no use offering them inducements if they are going to be taxed on them.  Therefore, for the limited type of person involved and in view of the importance to the national economy, I would ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 31.  Do you want me to deal with the other amendments now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This is one of the strange amendments to this Finance Bill, one of the strange pieces of the discussion on the Finance Bill, because it is the only case throughout the whole Bill in which I think there is any prospect of our being, the Minister and I, of the same mind against Deputy Haughey.  I am afraid I do not agree with Deputy Haughey in this amendment.  I can quite see his point of view that, when foreign technicians or experts come in here, they want to know where they stand. Very often living accommodation may have to be provided for them.  That <Col N="653" /> has to be done by the company employing them.  In future, it will have to be done, bearing in mind the law in relation to the fixation of terms.</P>
      <P>In spite of being blackguarded to the contrary by Fianna Fáil when I was Minister for Finance, I always took the view that it was improper to give rights to foreigners that we were not prepared to give to our own people.  Deputy Lemass, on more than one occasion, and the Fianna Fáil Party as a whole, frequently adopted propaganda tactics against me, alleging that I was giving to outsiders rights and privileges in relation to taxation that I was not prepared to give to our own people.  That was untrue then and it is, I think, a principle that should not be preached now. If the people concerned want to make it easy for foreign technicians or experts of the type to which Deputy Haughey has referred, they must do so within the terms of the employment of those experts or technicians and not through the medium of a tax remission which is not available to our own people.</P>
      <P>There may, of course, be differences in the methods of assessment in regard to the person who is resident for a time but not ordinarily resident.  But that is not the same thing at all.  I disagree with Deputy Haughey in this. For all I know, the Minister may agree with him.  That is the Minister's own business but, so far as I am concerned, it would be unwise for us to accept an amendment of the type suggested, even though I fully appreciate the need for such foreign personnel in the capacities outlined by Deputy Haughey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the principle of making a difference between one person and another.  It would be wrong for us to give privileges to foreigners which are not enjoyed by Irish citizens and, therefore, I could not agree to accept this amendment. It is quite possible, as Deputy Haughey says, that a company here, needing a foreign technical adviser, would be obliged to provide a house for him.  That can be done, but there is no reason why the Revenue Commissioners should help them to do so; they can do it in the ordinary course <Col N="654" /> of business.  They can make whatever arrangements are necessary and whatever returns are necessary afterwards in their submissions for income-tax.</P>

      <P>The Minister and framers of the Bill have to some extent accepted the principle of this amendment by providing in sub-section (4) that sub-section (1) shall not apply to the provision of meals in a canteen.  My amendment seeks only to extend that a little further.  I shall give an instance of the type of case I have in mind.  I am concerned with the case of an engineering firm which is carrying out contractual work in a remote area and where it has been necessary for them to provide accommodation for the staff in the form of hostel accommodation. It is desirable that accommodation of that sort should be excluded from the provisions of Section 22.  I can imagine an over-zealous inspector endeavouring to apportion the value of such accommodation and taxing the employee or the contractors accordingly.  I do not see any danger in the amendment.  I think it could be accepted.  I urge the Minister to accept it also on the general grounds I mentioned in relation to the other amendments&mdash;that is that it would cut down to some extent the volume of returns and administrative work arising out of Section 22 as a whole.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (6) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) Sub-section (1) of this section shall not apply to expense incurred by a body corporate in or in connection with the provision of any medical or hospital benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> The same arguments apply in relation to this amendment.  Good employers to-day have all sorts of welfare schemes for their employees.  It is very desirable that they should have such schemes.  It is a very excellent trend and one that should be encouraged. Progressive companies put into operation schemes of one kind or another to relieve their employees of the anxiety of having to look after themselves when they are injured or fall sick.</P>
    <P>I am endeavouring in this amendment to see to it that in so far as a company provides such facilities and benefits for its employees, those benefits would not be measured as income in the hands of the employees.  For instance, I could imagine an inspector of taxes taking the cost of a medical welfare scheme and apportioning it out amongst the employees in an endeavour to arrive at an amount of taxable income in their hands because of it.  I do not want to elaborate on that.  I think what I am seeking is perfectly clear and I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with the case of an incorporated body who pays the hospital or medical expenses of an employee.  The question is whether that should be regarded under this section as part of the income of that employee, the employee, of course, being above £1,500 per year; we must keep that in mind.  We cannot exclude this payment from the section. Deputies are aware that my predecessor provided for tax relief in respect of payments by an individual for insurance against medical, surgical or other expenses arising out of illness.  That provision should be a sufficient gesture for employees.  As far as I know, that section would apply also to directors if they pay a premium to the medical insurance company set up at that time and that premium would be exempt from income-tax.  Therefore the State has done sufficient in that direction and for that reason we should not accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be argumentative, but there are two entirely different things involved.  One is the case where an employee himself <Col N="657" /> pays an insurance premium to provide against medical expenses which may or may not occur, but what I have in mind in my amendment is the case where a company pays the actual medical bills&mdash; for instance, the case where it employs a doctor continually on a retainer, or employs a nurse in a factory or has a standing arrangement with a hospital that any of  employees injured in an accident will be looked after.  That is a completely different thing altogether from what the Minister has mentioned. I am aware of the provision the Minister mentioned and it is a very desirable and good thing but it has no connection whatever with the facts and circumstances with which I am concerned in my amendment.  As a matter of fact it would not apply at all, because in the case of an employee or a director who is receiving these benefits under some scheme from his employers he would not have the type of insurance to which the Minister referred because he would not need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Haughey has an absolutely incontrovertible case on this amendment where a company has a doctor to look after its employees, an employee goes to see the company's doctor, and the company pays.  As I understand the Minister, the payment made by the company to the doctor must be added back to the employee's salary for tax purposes.  If that is the case it seems quite cracked. How, for example, is the amount paid to the doctor to be apportioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like mentioning individual companies but let me take a State company which it is perfectly proper to mention here.  Bord na Móna have a regular doctor to attend Bord na Móna employees in County Kildare. Supposing one of the Bord na Móna employees who is in receipt of a salary in excess of the maximum provided here attends that doctor, what proportion of the annual retaining fee paid by Bord na Móna is to be added back to the employee's salary?  There are probably only six Bord na Móna employees in County Kildare who are over the maximum salary mentioned here and there are 500 Bord na Móna employees below that salary.  The doctor is paid a composite annual sum <Col N="658" /> for looking after the 506 Bord na Móna employees.  Is it to be 1/506th of the annual fee that is to be added back as expenses or is it 1/6th? Surely the Minister is not trying to add back expenses of that sort for tax purposes.  First of all, it would be ludicrous to do it administratively and secondly it would be utterly bad social policy.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Minister's view in saying he wants to push people into the voluntary health insurance scheme. I did, and that is why I introduced the provision in 1955 in advance of the introduction of the voluntary health insurance scheme.  Wherever an employee is to be responsible himself for medical costs, as the Minister said, what was done in the 1955 Act is enough and the State need not do any more.  However, it is a horse of a different colour when the company concerned is providing a medical service in looking after its personnel.  Let me say quite frankly that the company does not provide that medical service entirely out of its kind heart. It does it because healthy employees are of more benefit to the company than unhealthy employees, because it is better from the company's point of view to have small ailments attended to professionally and quickly rather than that they should be let drift and become fairly serious, when there would be a greater degree of absenteeism.</P>
    <P>In cases where the company does provide a doctor to attend on an employee or director concerned as part of the general service for all the employees of the company&mdash;and not singling out one or two, because I could see possibilities of abuse there&mdash; it seems to be quite outrageous to attempt to add back the cost of that service or any part of it for tax purposes. I sincerely hope therefore, even if the wording of Deputy Haughey's amendment does not get exactly what is in his mind or what is in my mind, that the Minister will introduce something into this section to ensure that that cannot be done if that was what was originally intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I know what the Revenue Commissioners will do in this <Col N="659" /> case.  They will estimate the value of the medical services or hospital services provided, estimate the probable premium that would have to be paid to obtain those services and divide that premium over all the employees and add it to the man's taxable income which comes within the appropriate category and say that so much is the premium that would be appropriate to him in a neutral health scheme.  Suppose the Revenue Commissioners adopt that device of determining administratively what is to be debited to an employee for the purpose of taxation, the result, it seems to me, is the very reverse of the general purpose of legislation in this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister himself says&mdash;and I gather with approbation&mdash;that the House sought to encourage people to join the voluntary health insurance scheme by exempting them from taxation on their premiums.  It appears to me that, in the absence of something on the lines of Deputy Haughey's amendment, we will do exactly the reverse where a firm has been providing a voluntary health scheme for its own employees.  We all know cases in the City of Dublin where people are not obliged to take out a policy under the voluntary health insurance scheme because under their conditions of employment they have, and have had for generations, all the facilities&mdash;and more&mdash;available to them under the company health scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot help thinking that the only result of failing to incorporate Deputy Haughey's proposal will be for the company to introduce a right for its employees to opt out of their health scheme whereupon the man paying the premium to the insurance company would get it allowed for income-tax. Does the Minister want to bring about that situation?  I do not think such a situation ever occurred to his mind.  I cannot imagine that he wants every existing health scheme operated by a company to be disrupted by the provisions he is making in this Bill.  I do not believe he has thought of it; I do not believe it has been provided for and I think the reason it has not been thought of, or not provided <Col N="660" /> for, is that nobody sat down to consider the implications of these provisions and they are unable to do so because nobody who is in danger of being caught by these provisions has been given the opportunity of putting his point of view.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine, if the Income Tax Commission had been considering these problems, that the points would not have arisen and that those who are administering schemes in the cases referred to by Deputy Haughey would not have been invited to come and give evidence and say what the consequences would be on their schemes if this legislation in its original form were enacted.</P>
    <P>I agree with the principle of Deputy Haughey's amendment, but I think it is only one of dozens of such amendments that will, by experience, prove to be necessary.  This is the only one that will be made.  I think this amendment only highlights the fact that we are stumbling about in the dark.  It just happens that some of us have come in contact with certain problems such as that outlined in Deputy Haughey's amendment and we are raising them.  Many others of us can see problems arising out of this Bill, but we are reluctant to put in amendments because if we do we would have to declare a personal interest in that we knew such a case.  That is an onus that I do not think should be thrust unnecessarily on individual Deputies.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why a man should feel any delicacy in going before a commission or an inquiry and pleading a cause in which he has a personal interest because everybody knows that it is because of his personal interest he is appearing there.  The circumstances are very different here.  Quite clearly Deputy Haughey has been brought in contact with something that has come to his attention in the ordinary course of his duties as a professional man studying revenue matters, but there are many others of us who know of analogous cases but we are precluded from mentioning them because it would mean declaring a personal interest.</P>
    <P>I renew my suggestion to the Minister that this part of the Bill should <Col N="661" /> be submitted to adequate inquiry and examination.  It can then be brought in here again in the light of that examination and an intelligent decision reached.  As it is, I warn the Minister that this is but one of many, many instances in which a degree of disruption, inconvenience and very possibly injustice, will be wrought by this part of the Bill of which I do not think he had any anticipation and which I do not believe he had any intention of inflicting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this part of the Bill is to put benefits in kind on the same basis as benefits in cash.  If I were to take the stand that I would allow no exceptions, I do not see that there would be anything unjust in it. Deputy Dillon, of course, may say that several other things could be raised. One thousand things probably could be raised, but that does not say that there would be a good case for raising them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be no great case to make for them.  If I were to come along with a proposition that a man would be taxed on benefits in kind no doubt Deputies could think of 1,000 exceptions that could be made in their opinion.  But if another Deputy &mdash;leaving the Minister out of it&mdash;says: &ldquo;make no exceptions&rdquo;, that is a point of view, and it is the point of view that I started with but we did make certain exceptions.</P>
      <P>Coming to the present point, if a company, as sometimes happens as we all know, has an employee working for it who is very faithful and of whom there is a high opinion and if he has to go to hospital, the hospital bill is paid for him.  Under the present law he would be taxed on that because it is cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The employer puts it into his remuneration for the year.  He would have to pay on that at present. The object of this part of the Bill is to put benefits in kind on the same basis as cash payments for expenses.  The purpose of this amendment is to say: &ldquo;Take medical expenses out.&rdquo;  I am saying: is it not logical if the employer is giving it in cash and saying: &ldquo;Here is £50 to pay medical expenses,&rdquo; the man has to pay income-tax on that?</P>
      <P>If, on the other hand, the employer says: &ldquo;We have a scheme here, we will pay them for you,&rdquo; is it not quite logical to say that they should pay on that?  The logical thing would appear to me to be that, as we are dealing with benefits in kind and bringing them into line with benefits in cash, if the employer pays the hospital bill for directors and employees in receipt of over £1,500, that benefit should come under Section 1.</P>
      <P>In spite of what Deputy Dillon has said to-day, people do think that the Minister for Finance can help them in their income-tax difficulties and we get letters every day telling us that.  I get letters very often from people complaining that they are not able to pay their income-tax bills because of medical expenses.  The complaint often is: &ldquo;I cannot pay because of medical expenses&rdquo; but that does not absolve them.  They must pay regardless of medical expenses.  Not only do they not get an allowance for medical expenses under the income-tax code but neither do they get time to pay for that reason. Medical expenses do not constitute a special reason for getting time to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the ordinary employee who has no kind employer to look after his medical expenses and pay them for him does not get an allowance for these expenses would it not be unfair that a director or an employee in receipt of over <Col N="663" /> £1,500 a year should get this concession &mdash;that his medical expenses should be paid for him and that they would not come under sub-section (1)?  The case was made of a doctor to a company. Deputy Sweetman mentioned the company but that does not matter.  In that particular case the usual thing is that a doctor treats a person practically by way of first aid but, if there is anything serious the matter with the employee, that company doctor tells him to go to his own doctor with his complaint. I have not the slightest doubt about such a case as that.  There would be no such thing as tracing that up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But there can be under this section of the Bill.  It could be brought to that and it could be charged up to the doctor's salary.  That would be nonsensical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must have some regard to common sense.  If the Revenue Commissioners know that a director of the Turf Board was down on the bog, caught his finger in a machine and got a slight bruise on it, and the doctor put a piece of elastoplast on it, there would be no question of charging that up against the director.  To do that would be absurd and no one would do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a firm in Dublin which, to the best of my knowledge, provides medical attention for its employees.  Whether it is a bruised finger or an organic disease, the employee consults the doctor who makes provision for him.  He may give him an appropriate bottle or it may call for hospitalisation.  It seems absurd to me that any employee receiving treatment from that doctor should receive an assessment for it from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is under the £1,500 figure he would not get an assessment. I am dealing with the case where there is no medical scheme but where an old and faithful employee has big <Col N="664" /> medical expenses and his employer gives him £50 to cover them.  That is in the nature of a bonus, if you like, and the employee pays income-tax on that.  We are dealing with the case of making benefits in kind the same as benefits in cash.  Therefore, if the employer has a scheme, it is only right that we should say that the value of that benefit in kind must be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

Hereafter the director or employee with over £1,500 a year will have to render an account of any illness suffered by him during the year, when he availed of the scheme and the extent to which he availed of it.  All that must be assessed by the Revenue Commissioners and on that he must pay income-tax.</P>

      <P>Are we going absolutely dotty?  Surely we cannot put on the Revenue Commissioners a duty that they cannot possibly discharge?  It will come down to this&mdash;that you will get some scrupulous individual who will make an elaborate calculation and make a return to the Revenue Commissioners that he had gastritis in January, diarrhoea in March and some other complaint in August.  He will say that on each occasion he got a bottle and on one occasion he was hospitalised for two days while they X-rayed him to find out if he had got gallstones.  He invites the assessment of the Revenue Commissioners on that.  The man sitting at the next <Col N="665" /> desk to him will say: &ldquo;Let them blooming well find out for themselves if they are fit.  I am not going to tell whether I had diarrhoea or gallstones.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Remember, it is the duty of the Revenue Commissioners to find out if he had diarrhoea or gallstones.  They have to find out what his income was, and if there are doubts about the state of his bowels they are bound to assess him and it is then for him to prove that they are wrong.  That is the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of this section, but it is obviously wrong to legislate in such a way as to create impossible conditions for an honest taxpayer and to impose impossible duties upon the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister for Finance entirely when he says that in the course of a discussion on a measure of this kind every conceivable contingency is raised.  We could raise 1,000 cases, each for separate consideration, to see in how far these proposals would impinge upon them and I agree with the Minister for Finance that that procedure for legislation is not practical. It will not do, and you cannot carry on Government if every Act of Parliament is to be examined in that way in this House.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister for Finance that an inquiry, if it is to be carried out at all, should be carried on elsewhere and by a different kind of body than by a committee of the whole of this House.  That is the reason I am putting it to the Minister that the impact of this part of the Bill should be examined by a body set up for that purpose, either by us in special committee, or by the Income-Tax Commission so that every case can be put before them and, having given every case due consideration, they may put a lump block of cases to one side and say those are the hard cases for which a Legislature cannot legislate.  There will always be hard cases for which a Legislature cannot legislate and society must carry on as best it can, avoiding in so far as it can the creation of hard cases.  Here there are well defined types of persons and services which I think ought to be excluded from this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> The Minister has conducted some kind of inquiry of that sort himself and, as a result, he has departed from what he himself said was the pure logic of this legislation.  It is only a matter of degree, and all I am asking is that there should be an informed inquiry into the circumstances of our taxpayers to determine to what degree should our discretion be exercised to exclude benefits, other than food, which have already been excluded under the Minister's proposals.  I think, perhaps, the very format that I have given for arguing the case originally made by Deputy Haughey illustrates the extreme difficulty of the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> in a matter of this kind, and further highlights the necessity for an inquiry.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister for Finance himself believes that the Revenue Commissioners can conduct the inquisition that would appear to be necessary on the employees of a firm earning more than £1,500 a year where a medical scheme is in operation. I believe his view is that it is not worth while legislating to exclude this and that, in fact, the provision requiring the Revenue Commissioners to take cognisance of it will be a dead letter from the date of its enactment. I think that is wrong, and I think Deputy Haughey's amendment is deserving of support on its merits, for its actual content, and also as illustrating the indisputable need of adequate inquiry into the full implications of this part of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are inclined to talk a good deal here in reference to the fact that this will apply only to employees whose incomes will exceed £1,500 a year.  I want to sound a note of warning there, and this also applies to the point Deputy Sweetman was making about employees of Bord na Móna.  As I read the qualifying section, that is Section 24, sub-section (3), it is the gross income that cannot exceed £1,500 a year.  That is the total amount paid before any deductions are allowed.  In other words, take the case of a commercial traveller who is getting an income of £600 a year.  If he is paid, as any commercial traveller would have to be paid to-day, £1,000 <Col N="667" /> a year to cover car and hotel expenses he comes within the section even though his income is, in fact, only £600, because sub-section (3) deliberately rules out deductions.  When, therefore, we talk about the type of people who come under Part IV let us remember that the scope will be much wider than covering people earning £1,500 a year, £1,500 a year is the gross before any deductions are made at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever that Deputy Haughey is quite right in this, and the effect of the definition bringing in Rule 9 means it is the gross amount that is concerned. I must confess I am completely flabbergasted by the attitude the Minister is adopting towards this amendment.  I could understand his view if he said he cannot accept it on the drafting as it is, that it might offer loopholes or something like that, but to suggest where a company has a scheme, under which it gives medical and surgical benefits, that automatically makes the amount of those benefits taxable, and that the Minister wants to do that, is utterly incomprehensible to me.</P>
      <P>I know one firm in the city which has a great many employees who will come within the definition of Section 24. That firm is one of the best employers in this country and it provides not merely general medical benefits but also surgical benefits, radiographer benefits and every type of medical benefit without any charge to the employees of that firm.  If the Minister's interpretation is correct then there will have to be spread over those employees in that firm the cost of all these benefits without regard to the fact whether an individual employee makes any use of the benefits in the actual year assessed or not.  The Minister may say the proportion may be small.  The proportion may be small but in the firm I have in mind it is certainly a high percentage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object violently to legislating here along a particular line and then saying that because the percentage is small the Revenue Commissioners are not <Col N="668" /> going to bother about it.  That is not the way to legislate and, in fact, that is not the way the Revenue Commissioners do their duty.  If they did operate on that basis they would not be doing their duty.  They must have regard to the law as it is laid down here, not to any expression of opinion.</P>
    <P>The whole tendency of social legislation, the social view, the social approach to industry, as well as the efficient industrial approach, is to have the widest possible scheme, often by insurance, of medical and hospital benefits for the advantage of employees in industry.  Not merely will there be in future no encouragement towards that approach but there will be deliberate discouragement.  I can see considerable objection by employees if they find themselves, without their consent, having something suddenly lumped on to their notional income in a particular year without their having had to incur any expenses.  The principle contained in the amendment by Deputy Haughey is one, in my view, to which no sane person could object and it is one that should be supported on all sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw attention to something that I think is important. When the discussion began on this section the Minister for Finance staggered me a bit by saying that his attention had been drawn to a case where firms were paying servants £600 a year salary and allowing them £800 a year expenses.  That seemed to me on the face of it to be an almost dramatic revelation but Deputy Haughey has just pointed out that, if you have a good commercial traveller and are giving him £600 a year salary, he may easily draw £1,000 a year expenses if he is a good man and covers ground well and keeps moving.  That had not occurred to me before and I very much doubt if it had occurred to anybody else.  I venture to swear that when Deputy Corish heard of a man who was being paid £600 a year salary and £800 expenses, he thought of a bedizened villain smoking a Havana cigar, floating about the country in a Bentley car.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I paid the Deputy a compliment by saying it was analogous to my own.  The first impact of that picture on my mind was of a fraudulent person who was drawing the bulk of his income under a fraudulent disguise but we are now faced with the interesting fact that the commercial traveller, whose real salary is £600 or £700 a year, could very well come within the definition of a person in receipt of £1,500 under this Bill.  I wonder would the Minister cross his heart and hope to die and say, when he was thinking of this Bill, did he think of a commercial traveller with £600 a year?  I bet my bottom dollar that he did not because he had not time to make the adequate inquiry necessary into the provisions of this part of this Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The more I listen to the debate the more it is borne in on me that those of us who have applied our mind, with as much industry as we dispose of, to this Bill know far too little about it intelligently to pass judgment upon it. If that is our condition, what are we to say of the 140 other Deputies who know sweet Fanny Adams about it, at a time when the lead in this matter is being given to an absolute majority of Dáil Éireann by a Minister who, to say the very least of it, has taken a very cavalier view of the details of this measure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am obliged, Sir, in the light of this amendment, to recall to the House something I said earlier on in our proceedings. The function of the Revenue Commissioners is to protect the revenue and from time to time they think up comprehensive schemes to protect the Exchequer.  They put those schemes into pigeon holes until they can find a Minister with a clear majority who, they hope, will not question the Bill.  Out comes the <Col N="670" /> scheme.  They clap it into a Finance Bill; push it into his hand; shoot him into Dáil Éireann and say: &ldquo;Put that through now and anyone that crosses you, cut the socks off him in the Party room, if necessary, and tell the other fellows to go to hell.&rdquo;  That is what has happened.</P>

We are not so equipped.  So, one facet of a wide problem is thrown into relief by this particular amendment: shall a man who may be in receipt of an income of £600 a year be denied the benefits of a medical scheme which he has heretofore enjoyed unless he pays income-tax on whatever the Revenue Commissioners may assess as his fair share of the total cost of the scheme or, if he cannot afford to pay that tax, will he be forced to opt out of the scheme, bearing in mind that it may be, and in certain cases is, so framed as to cater not only for himself but for his family as well?  Is there any Deputy, including the Minister, who seriously contemplates requiring a man whose income is £600 or £700 a year to surrender a benefit of that kind for himself and his family or, in the alternative, pay income-tax on the assessed value of the benefit?  I do not believe there is.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>When this section comes into operation it will involve a very radical change in the situation which has obtained up to the present. That change will not be merely a change in existing practice; it will be a change in the fundamental theory of taxation as we know it.  It is well to make this point clear to the House. Hitherto, there has been a fairly general principle applied in relation to these benefits in kind.  The principle has never been very clearly defined but, nevertheless, in the sort of complex situation which surrounds the whole matter of benefits in kind, it has served as an excellent rule of thumb for dealing with a very difficult situation.</P>
      <P>The principle is founded on the basis that a benefit in kind could be of two sorts; it could be convertible or it could be inconvertible.  An instance of an inconvertible benefit would be the case wherein an employee in a cigarette factory, for example, was given either a certain amount of the factory's product, cigarettes, free of charge or else was permitted to buy them at a reduced rate.  There you had a clear case  convertible benefit. The employee got a benefit which was readily convertible into cash.  In such cases the benefit was regarded as income in the hands of the recipient and was taxable as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have then inconvertible benefits. A very good example of such benefits is the case of the employees of C.I.E. <Col N="672" /> who are permitted to travel free on buses and trains.  The benefit has some value undoubtedly but it is not convertible into cash.  Up to now the rule of thumb has been that that type of benefit, because of the fact that it is not readily convertible into cash, is not treated as taxable income in the hands of the recipient.</P>
    <P>As I said, the situation is complex and difficult, but that was the line of demarcation and it has worked very well up to now.  There are two distinct reasons why inconvertible benefits should not be taxable.  The first reason goes to the very root of the idea of income in a modern society.  Income connotes that the recipient can exercise a choice.  He gets money or some negotiable thing and he is entitled to select the manner in which he will enjoy it.  He can apply it to different types of enjoyment.  The very fact that he has that choice as to the way in which he will use his income is a distinctive characteristic of income in a modern society as against the old feudal system where a man only got that which he needed to live.  Inconvertible benefit offends against that essential characteristic of income in a modern society and cannot be regarded as income in the modern sense and should not, therefore, be taxable.</P>
    <P>The second reason, and probably the one which may appeal most to the Minister in relation to inconvertible benefits and why they should not be taxed, is that there is no ready means of assigning a monetary value to them. No matter what administrative methods we may adopt we shall run into serious difficulty in trying to assign a set monetary value to the inconvertible benefit.  I believe that is one of the reasons why up to now we have not attempted to assess inconvertible benefits for tax purposes. Because of that difficulty I am quite seriously and genuinely alarmed at the amount of administration that Section 22 will involve.</P>
    <P>I should like to put this point to the Minister.  Take a businessman, reputable and honest, who is returning scrupulously every item of income and is not availing of any dodges in the nature of expenses or benefits in kind and you say to him: &ldquo;We know that <Col N="673" /> under the prevailing system certain individuals are getting away with a benefit and are not paying tax proportionate to the tax you pay.  In fact, the law is not equally applied and it is not fair to you.  These men get an advantage over you under the existing system.  We shall give you a choice. Would you prefer that state of affairs to continue, with these men enjoying a slight advantage over you, rather than have Section 22 foisted upon you?&rdquo; I am quite certain the answer would be: &ldquo;Do not inflict Section 22 on me no matter who is getting some slight advantage over me&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Another instance along the same lines&mdash;I hope the Minister will not object to it&mdash;is in relation to an inspector of taxes.  If one said to a hardworking inspector of taxes: &ldquo;You get nothing more than your salary.  You have no expenses or advantages of any kind.  Despite your best efforts as a conscientious inspector, we know there are some businessmen who are gaining an advantage under the law as it stands.  Would you, as a taxpayer, prefer that they should continue to get away with that than that we should put on you the burden of administering Section 22?&rdquo; I know what his answer would be.</P>
    <P>The Minister admits that the gain he will get in the form of revenue will be slight.  He is concerned mainly with ironing out discrepancies as between one taxpayer and another.  Because of the very nature of inconvertible benefits there will still be discrepancies. A monetary value cannot be placed upon them and, therefore, one cannot compare one with another.  No matter how scrupulously this section is administered the Minister will not succeed in ironing out discrepancies in relation to inconvertible benefits.</P>
    <P>I do not like this section.  It is unnecessary. It has been taken, lock, stock and barrel, from the British Act without any advertence to our situation here.  I would not feel so bad about battering against a stone wall if I were merely trying to change a concept of the Minister's which was the product of his own thinking in relation to our particular situation.  What does frustrate me is that I am trying to improve <Col N="674" /> on something which is taken wholesale from an English Act and which is not appropriate to our particular situation.  I appeal to the Minister to get rid of this section altogether. Judging by the debate so far, I do not think we shall succeed in getting him to do that but I would ask him, if he must have the section, to confine it to convertible benefits and leave out inconvertible benefits because they will only make the situation more confused and complex than it has been up to the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to mention two small points on the section from the point of view of keeping it open for me on Report Stage.  Sub-section (3) (a) provides that the period where the practice commences is a period of years before the passing of this Act. We are enacting a section I do not like and on which I shall have a few words to say in a moment.  However, regardless of that, we are enacting a section which will deal with a position not merely in 1958-59 but in future years until it is repealed.  It is clear, therefore, that having regard to the changing nature of industry and the changing nature of industrial practice in whatever period of years we fix, it should be a period ending on the particular relevant date.</P>
      <P>The Minister rather jumped me into a compromise too quickly when I accepted his offer of ten years instead of 20 years.  But whatever period it is &mdash;ten years, seven years or three years&mdash;it should be before the time of the tax year in question.  If a practice in relation to some new industry grows up and it has been in operation for ten years when an assessment for 1960-61 comes into operation it should not be denied the benefit of that sub-section because it was not there for ten years before 1958 when the Act went through.  That is so obvious that I hope the Minister will provide the necessary amendment on Report Stage without my having to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as sub-section (4) is concerned, has the Minister realised that that sub-section, which correctly provides for the exemption of meals in a canteen, means in effect a discrimination in favour of the employees of the <Col N="675" /> big firm against the employees of the small firm?  It is only the big firm with a great many employees that can run a canteen.  The small firm with a small number of employees cannot. While the big firm gets this concession the small firm which has not got enough employees to run a canteen but makes an arrangement by which its employees can obtain a meal in an adjacent premises, such as a café, fish and chip shop, or whatever you like, will be caught.  That does not seem to me to be a desirable position.  If we are to exempt&mdash;and I agree we should exempt&mdash;staff arrangements for meals near a place where people have to work, it should operate regardless of the size of the concern by which the people are employed.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the principle on which the Minister has pretended several times to stand about benefits in kind is, of course, breached by the canteen arrangements and in my view correctly so.  I mention it only to make it clear that the Minister cannot pretend, in relation to benefits such as those we discussed in the last amendment, that there is any principle from which he cannot depart without going back on his whole case.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that Section 22 has been taken holus-bolus from the British authorities without any attempt to consider if we might have different circumstances here from their industrial circumstances.  I said earlier in discussing this Bill that I thought the Bill was the product of people who, though entirely honest, entirely conscientious and scrupulous, were in the position that they could not possibly see the wood for the trees. Section 22 in its existing drafting is a complete example of that.  The wide method in which the attachment of liability to trifling benefits in kind has been incorporated in this section because it was done on the other side makes it clear to me that there has been no proper consideration of our general economic circumstances as apart from revenue circumstances.</P>
    <P>Let me be quite frank and say that the person who decides between general economic, overall circumstances <Col N="676" /> and the revenue circumstances of the country is not any official but always must be the Minister for Finance of the day.  If this Bill is a Bill which is grossly out of accord with our general Irish circumstances in relation to trade and industry generally, the blame for that must attach solely to the Minister.  It is not blame which the Minister must accept merely as the political head of the Department; it is a greater personal type of blame.  The whole purpose of having a non-technical man as the head of any Department, of having a person who is not an expert in the departmental work itself, is to ensure that he will be able to take a broader view of the particular points of view that are put to him by the experts in their own line.</P>
    <P>It is the job of the Minister under the system of democratic government as we know it to see the wood for the trees.  It is the job of the experts in their own line to put forward something that accords with their line.  It is not their task to fit them into the general picture.  This Bill and this section does not fit into the general Irish picture and it is no use people outside this House or in this House&mdash; but particularly people outside this House&mdash;saying that this is a technical Bill and it is enacted by the Dáil, not understanding the technicalities.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of having a non-technical person as head of a Department is that he may be able to put the technical point of view in its proper general perspective, and if that was done in regard to this part of the Bill, and in particular in regard to this section, we would get a Bill to deal with the small amount of what the Minister has termed &ldquo;gross tricking&rdquo; and at the same time one that would deal with Irish economic circumstances without adding to administrative costs of industry as the pernickety provisions of this part of the Bill do.</P>

We are getting through this Bill, not at the rate of a section a day, but at even a lesser <Col N="677" /> rate.  It will be a long-drawn-out affair.

If the English way of dealing with it is the best way we should not be precluded from adopting it.

    <P>I do not mind what the old principles of income-tax may be or whether inconvertible benefits in kind were not subject to income-tax.  We must deal with matters as they stand now.  When I am told that under present law a director may get a sumptuous house to live in, a gardener or two to look after the garden, paid for by the firm and not subject to income-tax, or that he can get a very fine motor car with a chauffeur or two supplied to him if he <Col N="678" /> is a man who stays out late at night, and all running expenses free of income-tax, I do not care what the old principles are.  I do not think we can stick to them if we cannot get after these people.</P>

      <P>There is no use in the Minister trying to introduce that type of tirade, or trying to make the case that Deputy Haughey or myself and those others who spoke on the Bill are endeavouring to condone the type of tax avoidance the Minister mentions.  We have made it clear without question that we do not stand for tax avoidance of that sort and equally clear that what we on this bench&mdash;Deputy Haughey can speak for himself&mdash;object to is the attempt to blackguard decent industrialists, the attempt to place on decent industrialists administrative burdens that are unnecessary and will increase production costs.  We object to having superimposed on us a scheme which may be entirely effective&mdash;perhaps the best scheme in the world&mdash;for British conditions but which may not necessarily suit us here.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a person having second thoughts.  May I make quite clear what is delaying this Bill?  It is <Col N="679" /> the fact that, from beginning to end, the House has got practically no proper explanation from the Minister of the terms of the Bill.  If the House, having asked for interpretations of the 21 sections with which we have dealt, had got clear interpretations as we went along and clear statements as to the meaning of the various sections we attempted to amend, we would have got much further than Section 22 by now.</P>
      <P>I refrained deliberately from saying anything that would be a departure from the objective viewpoint on this Bill, but the Minister, by his last statement about the progress of the Bill, has forced my hand.  The true reason we have taken so long on this Bill is that the Minister does not understand it and could not understand it because he has not read it and has failed to explain it because he has failed to read his brief.  If he had read his brief the explanations would have been forthcoming far more readily all along.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may go through the Official Report of to-day's debate when he gets it and point out if he can any single instance where anybody here did not understand what we were talking about.  We resumed to-day on a section on which we had spent a long time yesterday and we are still on it.  There is no use in the Deputy trying to get away with what he has just said, that it is because I do not understand the Bill.  I do not understand everything in the Bill; nobody could get up and explain what line 20 on page 44 means without sitting down and studying the Bill to find out what it was.  I admit the Deputy could have put me in the wrong a few times if he wanted to do so and I am not accusing him of doing that, but it is not true to say that all the delay is due to the fact that we do not understand what we are doing.  We are on this section for a long time.  I put it to the Deputy that no Deputy to-day could pretend that there was anything he did not understand in what we were talking about or that any of the general things discussed could not be understood.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) to delete lines 47 to 54 inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a different matter.  I cannot understand how the directors of a body corporate could operate legally under the direction of somebody else.  I admit that I am taking a body corporate in this context to be a company and I <Col N="682" /> think I must so take it.  For the directors of a company to take directions from anybody else is <i>ultra vires</i> the Companies Acts.  I admit that shareholders have the right to take over certain responsibilities but the directors still carry out their duties, maybe in a mandatory form, from a general meeting of the shareholders of a company.  I cannot understand the person who is interposed here.  It might be where the directors are bound under contract to do something for somebody else but they are bound under contract for the benefit of the company.  I put down this amendment because I felt that there must be some explanation for the use of the words which I could not get at because, on the face of it, they do not appear to be relevant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of this is to get at the person who, not legally, but in fact, is able to control the company. Take the case of a subsidiary company of a parent company.  The subsidiary company would be controlled by the parent company or, as may happen in this case, you may have a large shareholder who holds 60 per cent. or 70 per cent. of the shares and who may not have the time to devote to the business of the company.  He puts people in as directors and says to them: &ldquo;You carry on and come to me for directions.&rdquo;  He is able to direct the company in fact but not legally.</P>

      <P>Take another case. I act as a solicitor for a particular company.  In a certain type of business they are always accustomed to act in accordance with what I say.  They are always accustomed to act in accordance <Col N="683" /> with what I say because they have not got the specialised advice or knowledge that I may have in relation to this particular aspect of their business. They are always accustomed to act in accordance with my direction. I have no shares whatever in the company but under this section I am caught.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy is not.  If he reads the last two lines of sub-section (1) I think he will find he is not caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because it is not advice given in a solicitor's capacity. It is advice given in the knowledge of the particular business.  I do not think that is professional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think &ldquo;professional&rdquo; is used generally in that sense there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is taking it on that basis I think there will have to be a different interpretation of &ldquo;professionally&rdquo; because &ldquo;professionally&rdquo; means something particular to me.  It means business as an accountant or business as a solicitor.  I may be wrong and I would like to think over that.  I cannot see that &ldquo;accustomed to act&rdquo; is the right phraseology in the light of what the Minister has in mind.  As I understand the Minister, what he wants to do is to catch the person who really does control a company but is himself not a director of the company, the person who controls it by remote control. Fair enough; I can see what he is at in that respect and whether I agree with him or not does not enter into it.  However, I think this definition will mean that more people will be drawn into the net than the Minister intends.  I have now got an explanation of what the section means, and it is up to me to think on it between now and the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>One point occurs to me. I cannot see who exactly will give the <Col N="684" /> information to the inspector of taxes or how the inspector will discover where, in the management of a company, there is such a person who is giving instructions from the background. I do not know whether a specific question will have to be placed on one of the company's returns and an answer given stating that, in fact, a company is not controlled by its directors but by some other person.  I do not know of any company where that does occur and I do not know if the Minister has any evidence that it does, in fact, occur.</P>
      <P>It seems to me to be a rather fanciful provision which unnecessarily confuses the income-tax code in this connection. Can the Minister produce any evidence that a practice is growing up of persons controlling companies, in which they are not directors, simply because they are shareholders and can the Minister say in what way that information will be brought to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners, whether it will be a matter the Revenue Commissioners will discover on their own or whether an additional return will now have to be submitted by each body corporate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is evidence of very small companies being formed for certain purposes.  I do not know whether they might be formed for the purpose of giving a man outside the directors, a large shareholder, a free house, a free car or something like that, but there is a danger it might occur.  The second question the Deputy asked was by what means the Revenue Commissioners will get the information.  I am afraid we will have to leave that to the Revenue Commissioners. They may get it or they may not.  There is no way under this Act by which they will get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to find the section later on which provides that control means holding a certain percentage of the share capital.  There is one section in relation to that.  I know I have an amendment to change the 10 per cent. specified to a different figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the section which <Col N="685" /> the Deputy has in mind applies to part V rather than to Part IV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it does not affect Part IV at all but I suggest to the Minister that instead of having the portion here &ldquo;including a person according to the directions of whom the company is accustomed to act&rdquo; it would be far better to have &ldquo;the directors including a person who is a large shareholder.&rdquo;  The wording &ldquo;person under whose instructions he is accustomed to act&rdquo; is far too vague.  I do not know what &ldquo;accustomed to act&rdquo; means.  I expect the Minister has in mind, in relation to these sections, companies that are really formed <i>ad hoc</i> for the purpose of avoidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing there is a small company, the directors will obviously meet very seldom.  If, at their first meeting, a benefit in kind is given to a person who is not a director of that company then the person who receives the benefit is outside the scope of this Bill.  You cannot say on an initial occurrence that it is a decision in accordance with the direction of a person on whose instructions they are accustomed to act.  You must build up the custom for it.  If the Minister is trying in that case to knock the <i>ad hoc</i> company there is a way of breaching it on the wording here straightway.</P>
      <P>A much better method would be to adopt the method that is included for Part V&mdash;not the method included as Part V is drafted at present&mdash;but the method as included when Part V is drafted after the Minister has accepted my amendments to it.  I do not think there is any doubt I have got the Minister on a single meeting like that.</P>

      <P>I should like first to refer to certain changes in the format of the Forestry Estimate this year, designed to enable accounting requirements to be met with much greater expedition, efficiency and economy.</P>
      <P>Sub-head C (2), Forest Development and Maintenance, etc., formerly covered all aspects of forest work except the thinning of plantations and felling operations which, with the operation of sawmills, were covered by sub-head C (3).  Thinning and felling operations have now been transferred to sub-head C (2) which thus covers all aspects of forest management&mdash; reducing the scope of sub-head C (3) to the operation of the Department's sawmills at Dundrum and Cong.  The former sub-head division had, in practice, some unrealistic features and expenditure was troublesome to break down into its components.</P>
      <P>Sub divisions within sub-head C (2) now comprise:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Part (1) State forestry nurseries.</P>
      <P>Part (2) A new head covering all planting operations and the preparatory work involved.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> Part (3) Roads and buildings.</P>
    <P>Part (4) All maintenance work.</P>
    <P>Part (5) Thinning.</P>
    <P>Part (6) Mechanical equipment purchases and maintenance.</P>
    <P>The net total Estimate for the year is £1,904,550, a decrease of £36,450 on the net sum sought in 1957-58.  The decrease arises to the extent of £28,655 on the expenditure sub-heads, the balance of £7,795 deriving from additional Appropriations-in-Aid.

    <P>The Estimate for 1958-59 at £1.90 million allows for an increase over actual expenditure last year, the highest total expenditure of any year to date, of almost £150,000.  The overall financial picture of forestry at the moment is, therefore, one of continuing annual growth and expenditure but a slowing down in the rate at which the cost of forestry to the community is rising due to various factors to which I shall have occasion to refer in detail.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A shows an increase of £12,615 over last year due primarily to the incidence of salary changes, increments, etc.  A contributory factor is the provision included in the Estimate for the enlargement of inspectorate staff.  A definite commencement has now been made on research work.  The research projects include studies on the growth of various species of trees using different spacings, drainage methods, different combination of species.  Peat forestry is largely involved and Pinus contorta will be the species principally used. Research on fertiliser application and the later drainage of planted areas will also be undertaken.  Research projects on non-peat questions which have been launched include experiments in the chemical control of Pine Weevil, a pest which proves very troublesome following Scots Pine fellings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> Sub-heads B, C (3), E (1) and E (2) and F call for no comment.  Increases in sub-heads D and G include increases of £7,500 largely due to the private forestry campaign about which I will speak later.  Sub-head H is increased by £7,795 representing the increases in Appropriations-in-Aid.  This is small because of a reduction in the sale of nursery surplus stocks.</P>
    <P>Turning back to sub-head C (1), Grant-in-Aid for the acquisition of land, the grant included in the Estimate for 1957-58, £110,000, was added to a balance in the Grant-in-Aid Fund on the 1st April, 1957 of £92,790, thus making a total available last year of £202,790.  Net expenditure during the year amounted to £125,744, leaving a balance in the fund at the 31st March, 1958, of £77,046.  The Estimate now before the House includes a provision of £160,000 which will make a total availability of over £230,000.  This should be more than ample to meet the incidence of expenditure within the year.</P>
    <P>In 1957-58 a total of 26,346 acres was acquired in 374 transactions compared with 18,725 acres in 247 transactions in the previous year.  The ratio of transactions to total acreage indicates the continuing tendency towards a more and more tedious pattern of acquisition in comparatively small areas, the average area per acquisition in 1957-58 being only 70 acres.</P>
    <P>Excluding unproductive land, the effective total area acquired amounted to 23,371 acres compared with 16,085 acres in 1956-57.  This is in fact by far the highest individual acquisition attainment in any one year over the entire history of State forestry, the highest previous figure for a single year being 17,750 acres in 1953-54.  The plantable reserve at the commencement of 1958-59 had risen to approximately 53,500 acres compared with 49,500 acres at the 1st April, 1957.  This increase is, however, far from satisfactory since the reserve as it stands is much too limited in relation to the increasing annual planting rate.  In dealing with the question in the debate on last year's Estimate, I pointed out that the plantable reserve had only increased by 4,000 acres since 1954 when the planting rate was 12,500 <Col N="689" /> acres.  To-day's reserve position is even more unsatisfactory and is the most difficult one we have had to face for many years.  At the beginning of 1956-57 the reserve stood at 49,600 acres or just under three times the planting programme of 17,500 acres which was undertaken in that year. By the 1st April, 1957, the plantable reserve had dropped by 100 acres and was approximately two and a half times the planting programme of 20,000 acres undertaken in that year.  This year, with a planting programme of 22,500 acres, the plantable reserve of 53,500 acres is less than two and a half times the planting rate.  With such a limited reserve it is just not possible to plan individual forest planting programmes with due regard to the proper and orderly development of the forests, and growth in the number of permanently employed workers, etc. We are, in fact, dependent upon lands of which possession will be taken in the months ahead to enable us to achieve the full planting programme of 22,500 acres for the year.</P>
    <P>It is obviously a matter of top priority to secure a considerable increase in the rate of acquisition of land for at least some years.  There is a considerable total area in process of acquisition or under consideration for acquisition.  As at 31st March, 1958 there were areas totalling 2,000 acres of which possession was due to be taken and areas totalling 38,722 acres which the Department has agreed to purchase but title to which is still under investigation. There were further areas aggregating 49,389 acres which had been inspected and found suitable and which were the subject of price negotiations with the owners.  I have, during the past year, been pursuing the possibility of speeding up the handling of acquisition proceedings.  Steps to strengthen the staff are in hands.  The best we can hope for is a substantial rise in the acquisition rate in 1959-60 and for some years following, gradually bringing about a greater equilibrium between planting programme and plantable reserve.</P>
    <P>In the long term the key factor to the rate at which we will be able to continue acquiring land is the rate at which land is offered to us.  The rate <Col N="690" /> at which offers were being received in 1956-57 and 1957-58 was in fact satisfactory in relation to a contemplated annual planting programme in the future of 25,000 acres.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C (2) &ldquo;Forest Development and Management&rdquo; at a total of £1,682,650 shows a decrease of £113,000 in comparison with the relevant provisions in the 1957-58 Vote but the provision being made this year is in fact sufficient to cover expenditure higher by £32,000 than that incurred in 1957-58.</P>
    <P>On Part (1) Nurseries, there is a reduction due to modern methods of weed control and greater output.  The whole nursery organisation is now being reorganised. Economic nursery techniques and good management dictate the need for fewer and larger nurseries. We intend to have in future 50 acre nurseries situated at strategic positions. The result will be a more easily trained staff, higher quality plants and lower costs.  The first reorganised nursery is that at Clonegal.</P>
    <P>The Department is not satisfied that present arrangements are adequate to ensure that seed supplies are from sources and of strains calculated to give optimum results under Irish conditions. This is particularly important in the case of seed originating on the North American Continent where there are a wide variety of climatic and other factors affecting the range of seed supplies.  Consideration is being given to the establishment of new agency arrangements in America to afford a better guarantee of seed sources. Particular attention is being given to variation in Contorta Pine and with this species there is a growing emphasis on the desirability of securing as much as possible of our seed requirements from promising Irish plantations of seed-bearing age.  A special survey of potential stands within the country will shortly be undertaken.  We hope to co-operate closely in this work with the British Forestry Commission which has similar problems.  Steps to enlarge home production of suitable Contorta Pine seed through seed orchards are also contemplated.</P>
    <P>On head (2) &ldquo;Establishment of Plantations&rdquo; the provision of £434,150 <Col N="691" /> is less by £48,000 than the 1957-58 provision. The 1957-58 provision was in fact in excess of requirements but, due to the change in format of the Estimate, accurate comparison with the actual total expenditure of 1957-58 is not readily practicable.  A comparison of the two years on the basis of labour costs will give a fair picture.  The provision for 1958-59 includes £396,162 for labour which is higher by £40,000 than the actual expenditure in 1957-58.  Despite an increase in planting programme from 17,500 acres in 1956-57 to 20,000 acres in 1957-58, the level of labour expenditure on the establishment of plantations was approximately the same in the two years due to a general increase in output.  The allowance of an additional £40,000 in the Estimate for 1958-59, therefore, makes generous provision for the extra costs liable to arise from an increase in the planting programme by a further 2,500 acres to 22,500 acres.</P>
    <P>As the proportion of peat planting increases in the western and indeed other areas, less scrub clearance work of a costly character will be required. We will, of course, continue to look for better quality, higher-yield lands whenever they are available.  New equipment which is expected to reduce considerably the cost of ground clearance in such areas is being purchased and, if it proves as effective as is expected, it will contribute towards a further reduction in average per acre ground preparation costs.</P>
    <P>The Estimate provision under this head covers, as well as the scheduled planting programme of 22,500 acres, the replanting of over 1,000 acres of former plantations which were either destroyed by fire or have failed for one reason or another.  The replanting area is unusually high.  I have been encouraging the Forestry Division to push ahead as rapidly as possible with this work, since many of the areas in question are of more than average productive capacity.</P>
    <P>This year's new planting of 22,500 acres is in accordance with the planned acceleration of planting to which the Forestry Division has been working in <Col N="692" /> recent years.  The planting of 25,000 acres is scheduled for next year.  The annual enlargement of planting programmes by 2,500 acres has not been accomplished without imposing quite a severe strain on the Forestry Service and the resources at its disposal and I think it is highly creditable that this year's programme, at 22,500 acres, will represent an increase of 50 per cent, in three years on the planting rate of 15,000 acres in 1955-56.  I have already, in dealing with land acquisition, referred to the plantable reserve position. It is in this respect above all else that the rapid acceleration of planting has presented the greatest difficulty. The plantable reserve, as it stands today, is far too low in relation to the current rate of planting and it is depriving the service of the scope it should have for flexibility to arrange planting programmes at individual forests with an eye to sound forest work management and balance, the preservation of labour stability and the build-up of the forest at a rate and on lines which will ultimately permit of sound and economic management as a forest unit.  In touching again upon this question of land acquisition I am deliberately seeking to lay due stress on the absolute importance of a very considerable increase in the rate at which land is being offered for forestry purposes.</P>
    <P>Our capacity to acquire land upon which we will have either the certainty or at least a reasonable prospect of growing timber as part of a national investment policy is, and must remain, the key factor in determining the future progress of afforestation.  In this connection I would recall to Deputies' minds that, when speaking on the Forestry Estimate for 1957-58, I adverted particularly to the information given by my predecessors to the Dáil on numerous occasions as to the extent to which the expansion of the rate of afforestation since the last war has been due to new mechanical aids to afforestation in peat areas, including experimental work on extremely unpromising areas.</P>
    <P>During the past year I have had an opportunity of going into this question much more fully with the officers of <Col N="693" /> the Department and I think it may be of help to the House if I set out briefly what our present position is in this regard.  The planting, with the assistance of mechanical ground preparation, of peat areas which had previously been regarded as either technically or economically unsuitable for forestry purposes commenced on a small scale in 1950-51 and was much expanded in 1951-52 and subsequent years.  Mechanical preparation has been combined with application of artificial fertilisers to stimulate growth in the initial stages of competition with natural vegetation.  Results so far have been promising. Indeed, the single application of an eggcupful of phosphate possibly only once in the lifetime of the tree is like a life-giving elixir of the ancients.  In many cases drain deepening some years after planting has been necessary to counteract a check on growth when the roots penetrated to the water-table but the plants showed good response to lowering of the water-table.  The possibility of a serious check on growth at a later stage cannot be ruled out but technical evidence suggests that any check should be capable of rectification by drainage improvement and/or additional artificial manuring.  Problems still in doubt include the question of stability in conditions of fair to severe exposure, especially when the trees reach about 30 feet in height and thinning has commenced.</P>
    <P>Peat areas differ widely due to the varying conditions of exposure, drainage efficacy, fertility and depth of soil.  I should make it clear that there are very large areas of utterly unplantable peat land.  Recently we have been confining the acquisition of highly doubtful peat land to small blocks adjacent to land of better quality.</P>
    <P>Definitions of plantability are difficult to lay down but the Department classified the 1956-57 acquisitions as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Land reasonably certain to produce sawlog timber: 58 per cent. of total acquisitions.</P>
    <P>(2)  Land reasonably certain to produce pulpwood: 32 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> (3)  Land having a fair expectation of pulpwood: 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>(4)  Experimental land: 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Of this last category we have planted enough for the present.  When results can be ascertained the policy can be modified.  In the meantime current planting programmes will still include a high proportion of peat land including large areas in category (3), i.e. land the productivity of which is still unproved but which has a fair expectation of pulpwood production.</P>
    <P>Before passing from this subject of the planting of more doubtful peat types I should mention that, through the courtesy of the British Forestry Commission, I had an opportunity last autumn of making an extensive tour with officers of the Department of peat areas planted by the forestry commission in Scotland and we recently had the benefit of a return visit by senior officers of the forestry commission to our plantations on western peat types.  Exact comparisons between Irish and Scottish conditions are not feasible but the cross-check of experience has been, I think, valuable to both sides and gives some encouragement towards optimism for the future.</P>
    <P>Turning now to head (3) of sub-head C (2) &ldquo;New Roads and Buildings&rdquo;, the Estimate provision at £370,700 shows an increase of £53,900 over the corresponding provision in the 1957-58 Estimate.  Only a small part of this head relates to the construction of buildings, mainly the building of new official residences for foresters, and the increase in provision is entirely related to road construction.  The Estimate provision includes £227,476 for labour.  Actual expenditure on labour for this work in 1956-57 was £176,000 and in 1957-58 the figure was £195,000.  The 1958-59 Estimate thus allows for an increase of £32,000 or about 15 per cent. over last year's expenditure on labour for road construction; there are corresponding increases in the provisions for the purchase of materials, cartage, etc. There has been a very rapid acceleration in road construction work in <Col N="695" /> recent years.  A complete analysis of road construction work in 1957-58 is not yet available but the aggregate of provisional figures of yardage of roads on which preparatory work was carried out and yardage upon which either final surfacing or complete construction in one operation was handled comes to 250 miles as compared with corresponding figures for the preceding four years in consecutive order of 66 miles, 90 miles, 118 miles and 192 miles.  There are still arrears of work to be made up, however, and every effort is being made to push ahead with this work. The individual forest programmes for the year which have now been settled include provision for a very big increase in work over the already high 1957-58 level.  If, in fact, it should prove possible to put all this work in hands during 1958-59 expenditure may well exceed even the considerably increased provision being made in the Estimate.  If that should prove to be the case it will probably be possible to meet the additional financial requirements through savings flowing from increasing productivity on other heads.</P>
    <P>The construction of forest roads is a complete science in itself.  The shape and pattern of extraction roads can be measured to correspond with cost saving in extraction.  A shorter road mileage is less costly to construct but extraction costs grow correspondingly. The optimum mileage can be calculated on a work study basis.  Our forest road construction requirements and costs are being minutely examined. The first step taken has been to secure materials by contract where this would produce economies.  Last summer we invited a consultant who has been responsible for reducing road construction costs in Great Britain to come here.  His ideas are being put into operation on an experimental basis but we are certain that costs can be reduced by as much as 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>Head 4 of the sub-head &ldquo;General Forest Management&rdquo;, which includes all work on existing plantations other than road construction and thinning, at £535,400 shows a decrease of £41,900 as against the relevant Estimate provision in 1957-58.  Actual expenditure <Col N="696" /> in 1957-58 was lower by £46,000 than the Estimate provision for the year as a result of increasing productivity and the sum provided for the current year, therefore, represents a slight increase over the actual level of expenditure in 1957-58.</P>
    <P>General management work tends to rise annually with the extension of the total area of State plantations and no significant departure from the normal pattern is to be expected this year. On some heads on which there was an abnormally heavy incidence of expenditure last year a reduction in work in the current year is anticipated; notably in this category are the extension and deepening of drains in young plantations and weeding and low pruning preliminary to thinning.  On the other hand considerable increase in expenditure on high pruning, an operation directed towards the production of really high quality timber, and in expenditure on construction of fire-lines is anticipated.</P>
    <P>Head 5, &ldquo;Timber Conversion&rdquo;, at £128,020, is less by £40,120 than the amount provided in the Estimate for 1957-58.  There was in fact a saving of approximately that extent in 1957-58 so that the provision for 1958-59 is on the same basis as actual expenditure in 1957-58.  The provision includes £82,897 for labour compared with an actual expenditure of £84,000 in 1957-58.</P>
    <P>Approximately a quarter of the current level of expenditure on timber conversion relates to the felling of old woodland and scrub areas and the felling of standards interspersed through young plantations.  The main expenditure on the head is on the direct labour thinning of plantations.</P>
    <P>Normal thinning progress in the year 1957-58 was interrupted by the abnormal windblow in February, 1957, which accounted for 3,250,000 cubic feet&mdash;the equivalent of a full year's thinning.  7,500 acres were thinned in that year, totalling 2,000,000 cubic feet. Half the area and two-thirds of the volume of thinnings were sold standing. This policy, started in 1956, will be continued in the future as the results are beneficial to forestry economics. This will bring about a decrease <Col N="697" /> in direct labour employment but an increase in private timber merchants' employment.  Future thinnings have now been approximately forecast for three years beginning in 1958-59 at 3,000,000, 3,250,000 and 3,750,000 cubic feet respectively.</P>
    <P>Our thinning production forecasting will be further improved when the new section of the Department has completed an assessment of annual growth, a vital feature of future development. In 18 months the first assessment of all plantations older than ten years will be completed.</P>
    <P>Head 6 of the sub-head, &ldquo;Mechanical Equipment for Forest Development and Maintenance&rdquo;, shows a decrease of £26,650 compared with 1957-58.  Extensive additions have been made to mechanical equipment of all descriptions in 1957-58.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for labour expenditure over the sub-head as a whole provides for the employment of up to 5,000 men. I should make it clear that the Estimates for 1957-58 and the current year have been affected by decisions made to increase output and reduce the taxpayers' burden.  Firstly, improved analysis of costs by calculations on a man hour basis commenced in 1956; secondly a direction was given in 1957 to secure better output.  Contributory factors have included the standing sale of thinnings and the purchase of road materials under favourable contracts.</P>
    <P>The result has been a saving of £300,000 on the cost of work this year all of which operated to the taxpayers' benefit, and the necessity for reassessing labour requirements in the future becomes apparent.  I should make it clear that the increase in planting by itself does not increase employment, 50 persons being employed per 1,000 additional acres.</P>
    <P>As we have been approaching the maximum planting figure of 25,000 acres, the rise in the annual employment level has been gradually diminishing each year.  Employment rose from 2,562 men in 1950-51 to 4,055 in 1953-54 and has been increasing more slowly since to 4,835 in the past year. The apparent decrease in 1957-58 compared with 1956-57 is offset by 350 men <Col N="698" /> enjoying private employment on the felling of thinnings and provision of road materials instead of State employment, so that total employment was still rising but more slowly.  Only one-third of this year's employment relates to current planting as distinct from maintenance, road construction, etc.  The total number now employed is 4,613 and will rise as grass cleaning around young trees commences.  Increased thinnings will give more private employment.  Total employment on State forestry work will rise slowly to 6,000 by about 1968 and then more rapidly to 7,000 in 1974 and to 9,000 in 1978.  But, of course, employment on sawmilling, etc., will also be steadily increasing, as by 1974 thinnings will have risen from 3,000,000 to 10,000,000 cubic feet a year.</P>
    <P>I have now dealt with the main subheads and have described the past year's work.  I must next review the general development of our afforestation programme.  On taking office I felt it necessary to apply the test to forestry that is now the key to our future prosperity.  Will it pay?  This is a human as well as an economic approach in that merely transferring money from one group of workers to another is grossly deceptive and that is what will happen if the total receipts from forestry fall below the expenses, including interest payments.  Every year the taxpayer is going to spend a large amount of money not on employing the people who migrate to the towns for employment, who are making boots, shoes, refrigerators, beer and furniture but on planting trees.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that at least over half our people in rural districts migrate, we must ask whether there will eventually be greater prosperity through the planting of trees.  Or will our descendants say it would be better if all the money had been invested at 5 per cent. at accumulative interest by the taxpayers and that at the end they would have been able to employ more people and import more materials for Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, since we have to export more goods at lower cost, since forestry is mainly dependent in the ultimate on exports and as our pulp will be bought at world prices, it is <Col N="699" /> for this very essential large scale industry, one of the three largest in the State, to set an example of efficiency to private employers and still more essential to pay the taxpayer a dividend which he will spend on employing others directly or indirectly. So the officers were invited to assess the forestry income and expenses of the future, making reasonably optimistic assumptions in regard to growth, the price of the product and other factors.  The memorandum prepared is I think unique&mdash;being possibly the first overall projection of income and costs prepared for an entire country's forestry operations.</P>
    <P>The following are some comments on this study based on British assessments of tree growth pending our own calculations and on a planting programme of 25,000 acres from 1959 onwards.  We have 246,885 acres of land planted at this moment, of which half is planted for less than ten years. Present policy provides for the planting of 1,000,000 acres, one-seventeenth of our total land area.  At current rates of timber consumption we would need to plant 7,000 acres a year&mdash;at Danish rates 17,500 acres.  In either event we will have a large export surplus.</P>
    <P>The consumption of pulpwood is increasing yearly.  The U.S.A. is already a net importer.  Europe may cease to be a net exporter and there will always be a market available in Great Britain where the target is only planned to reach 35 per cent. of requirements. Annual consumption of industrial wood per 1,000 population varies from 1,840 cubic metres in North America to 880 cubic metres in Europe. Our trade balance for timber is £10,000,000 on the wrong side.  Our advantages are well known; fertile soil, good climate, no excessive cost inflation in rural areas.  The only obstacles would be excessive interest rates and costs of collection in certain areas.  To date we have spent £14,000,000 of which £10,000,000 was spent in the last ten years.</P>
    <P>At the 1956 rates of output it has been estimated that without extensive mechanisation and without improvement <Col N="700" /> in timber prices we would lose £526 per acre at 5¼ per cent. interest. If this industry was a marginal contribution to our economic life and if it remained at a modest level of cost we could, perhaps, be less insistent on high output.  On the contrary the wood has to be sold on the export market. The total investment of capital raised by borrowing will amount to £21,000,000 by 1974.  In the meantime, the taxpayer will also spend as much as £800,000 per year out of tax revenue on non-capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>He will also pay the taxes to repay the lenders who provide the capital until the revenue relieves the Exchequer of this annual debt.  Moreover it will not be till 1974 that total revenue will equal expenditure and not before 1990 will the net revenue of the Department exceed £3,000,000 though the lucky Minister for Finance in 2009 A.D. might expect to receive £17,000,000 from the Department if all plantations were grown on a 50-year rotation.</P>
    <P>I want to make certain that our descendants will not only have greater purchasing power but will reap a dividend from the whole vast operation so that when there are eventually some 19,000 persons employed apart from those in conversion sawmills and factories, we will not have the economists saying that more people could have been employed by other means.  The value of forestry must be brought above the controversial level and towards this end a State Department must at the same time prove to the somewhat cynical public that the business of forestry can be run as efficiently as if the promoter was a private lumber corporation.</P>
    <P>I have faith that the officers of my Department, from the highest to those beginning their careers, are adaptable, efficient and zealous and the many changes directed towards increased output carried out in a few months are proof of this.  The economic assessment study indicates that we can be optimistic provided output increases and costs are reduced by the measures taken in the last year.</P>
    <P>On the basis of reasonable assumptions, the final financial yield from Irish State forestry can be as high as <Col N="701" /> 5¼ per cent. on the capital invested. That is an encouraging picture.  It is a real contribution to the vacuum for productive enterprise which has existed since the war.  For too long we have been spending money to give employment and not increasing production, the inevitable effect of which is to increase employment.</P>
    <P>Forestry employment rising eventually to 20,000 persons and affecting the lives of an appreciable proportion of the whole population need not, therefore, reduce the purchasing power of the present taxpayers and their successors, which it was bound to do if we had not taken the step which is already known to the House and which I will now outline, namely, the institution of the incentive bonus scheme, by far the largest proposition of its kind undertaken in this country.</P>
    <P>At this point I must record the social objective underlying this scheme. Firstly, the taxpayer and the worker will share the increased rewards from greater productivity; the workers will have higher wages, will be more contented and the extra wages will give employment to other workers making goods for them; the taxpayer will keep more money in his pocket and will either invest it in some capital project that employs more people or buy more Irish products, giving more employment; the Government, if short of capital, will be relieved of a commitment and can invest elsewhere in employment-giving projects; if more trees can be planted for less cost, the management employment will be greater at a later date.  Finally, the incentive bonus scheme will set a country-wide example of great importance to other employers now that consultants can arrange incentive bonuses for an amazing variety of jobs.</P>
    <P>Now for the scheme itself.  A firm of consultants has timed every forestry operation, a most difficult undertaking because conditions vary so widely. Briefly, the scheme provides that each worker will be guaranteed a minimum time rate, but by performance levels rising above a fixed point, additional earnings, partly by way of a production bonus and partly by way of a <Col N="702" /> quality bonus to ensure work of adequate quality, will be secured.  The level of additional earnings will vary with productivity but will be so controlled as to give any reasonably competent worker who gives of his best an opportunity of earning from 32/- up to £3 a week more than the normal time rate.  To ensure a proper assessment of performance levels, work values are determined for each job in hands in accordance with the recognised principles of work study with full allowance for reasonable rest periods for the worker and so forth. The scheme was discussed in detail with representatives of the various unions active in forestry work before its application was commenced at the beginning of April.  I am very pleased to be able to say that the trade unions concerned showed a very helpful interest in the scheme and a willingness to assist in securing its successful application in the interests of both their members and the Department. I have already paid tribute publicly to the way in which the unions have received the scheme, but I think it only right that I should now take the opportunity of placing that tribute on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>As a prerequisite to the implementation of the incentive bonus scheme it was necessary to rationalise the time-rate structure for forestry work which previously varied from county to county in order to have firm basic wage rates to which incentive bonus rates could be related.  A basis of rationalisation acceptable to the men and their unions was found and brought into operation with retrospective effect to the beginning of January.  The rationalisation arrangements embodied an increase comparable to that taking place in outside employment.  The introduction of this new national wage base for forestry work is itself a signal step forward and should go far to promote and maintain good relations between management and labour in forestry work.  The new time-rate for the country as a whole is 110/- a week, with special rates in traditionally high wage areas near Dublin whereas previously in some counties rates as low as 100/- a week prevailed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it varies from county to county in the case of county councils.  The addition of incentive bonus earnings on top of these new time-rates will represent a considerable increase in the earning power of forestry labourers.  In this connection I need not stress the importance, as an antidote to emigration, of providing in rural districts not merely an adequate number of jobs but employment of a sufficiently remunerative character to encourage the best of our people to stay at home rather than to seek fortunes abroad.</P>
      <P>The incentive bonus scheme must be applied gradually, each forest being treated as a separate unit for purposes of application.  Only in that way can we be certain that the scheme will be based on sure foundations and initiated with a full understanding by all concerned of how best to use it in the joint interests of the employees and of the Department.  So far the scheme has been applied in seven forests in Counties Dublin, Wicklow, Carlow and Tipperary.  It is expected that it will take two years to complete the application of the scheme in all 176 forest units throughout the country.</P>
      <P>To ensure that application will go ahead as rapidly as possible a picked team of departmental officers have been associated with the industrial consultant engaged on the work.  These officers are receiving a thorough grounding in work study techniques and will form the nucleus of a permanent work study staff in the Department to maintain the scheme at a high standard of working efficiency. Ultimately work study will be incorporated as a standard feature of the training of forestry personnel.  I should make it clear that the foresters have been instructed to include competence and zeal as an overriding qualification in the selection of men for forestry work and they have been given virtually the same freedom of choice as a State company or a private corporation. Within this proviso they will naturally retain men with the heaviest family obligations and with longer service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> The incentive bonus scheme is expected to increase the productivity rise of 10 per cent., which has already been secured from the other measures I have mentioned, to at least 20 per cent. when it is in full operation.  There follow some further requirements in relation to the operation of the scheme if it is to be successful in the fullest sense.  Forest work will have to be planned to secure a maintenance of work in areas where productivity is rising.  This will be a complex task for under the old system we have not been able to acquire sufficient reserves-in the right places to ensure continuity of work.</P>
    <P>Our forestry economic assessment referred to already indicates an inevitable stabilisation in additional employment recruitment until about 1964 even though additional much-needed road construction will create a demand for more workers.</P>
    <P>Our object in time must be to secure more stable employment and for this an increase in the plantable reserve is essential.  In this connection we have made a study of the amount of forest land that is available for acquisition during the next few years.  We have assumed that general economic conditions remain the same in relation to demands for sheep and cattle grazings. As I indicated previously, sheep income employs our people in the towns and there can be no conflict with the sheep economy which is so important.  Even with increased staff and the necessary finance we find it difficult to forecast any more favourable acquisition prospect than a short-term rise to about 30,000 acres (plantable) falling back later to about 25,000.  This should ease the plantable reserve.  The figures indicate that the 25,000 acre target is not far short of the maximum.</P>
    <P>I next must advert to the progress in establishing timber conversion factories.  The next ten years will see an ever-increasing volume of thinnings and some mature felling.  Apart from the extension of the Bowater factory at Athy a number of other projects are in sight for the manufacture or extended manufacture of pulp and chipboard.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are showing more willingness to accept native timber <Col N="705" /> under public building contracts.  The number of firms producing properly seasoned Irish timber is not yet adequate but growing.  At my request the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards have taken up the question of establishing standards for home-grown timber.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of private forestry.  If ever there was an implied challenge to the ultimate ambitions of a nation the dearth of private forestry is the perfect example.  Our private forestry plantations in 1880 totalled 380,000 acres and to-day amount to 90,000 acres.  Not once in the last 30 years have any but the private forestry and farming societies specifically demanded a big diversion of Government funds&mdash;of the £14,000,000 already spent on State forestry&mdash;for private planting.  Only 1,966 acres have been planted in the past four years although a grant of £10 an acre is available.</P>
    <P>Yet there are thousands and thousands of parcels of land from half an acre up to much larger acreage growing nothing and suitable for planting.  The emphasis on State planting has been far too great and the whole activities of the Department have been concentrated on State forestry.  This creates apathy towards private enterprise.  The future of forestry depends to a great degree on a new conception of saving for the future through the planting of trees.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed that we can make a tremendous effort to interest our people in private forestry; apart from making grants available, not a penny piece has been spent for over 30 years on private planting promotion as a nationally desirable policy; we start from scratch.  I believe in this policy and I will go so far as to state that the success or failure of the campaign will prove whether we are likely to make really dramatic advances in our production drive during the next decade.</P>
    <P>May I state again: trees are an investment for the son and the grandson or the daughter and the grand-daughter. From one acre of poplars £600 can be secured in 20 to 30 years.  From one acre of Sitka spruce £300-£400 for the <Col N="706" /> son and £700 for the grandson.  For the man who does some of the work himself the profit is tremendous, for the man employing labour if the work is filling in time to maintain the output of good workers the profit is very great; for the man employing full-time forestry labour the profit, assuming the value of money remains the same, is satisfactory&mdash;if money declines in value, the investment has little competition in any field of investment.  Just as in the old days great landowners laid down a bin of port for the son's twenty-first birthday, so with far greater profit and wisdom a man can plant an acre of Sitka spruce to provide a dowry for his son when he marries.  In this particular matter I speak with real sincerity as my own family plant trees in large numbers.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to double the grant for private planting, raising it from £10 to £20 an acre, payable in two instalments, £10 after planting and £10 five years after the plantation has been established.  It has also been decided to launch a special scheme to foster the cultivation of poplars by farmers.  Poplar cultivation has unusual features which render the normal planting grant scheme inapplicable, but the country&mdash;and the farmers&mdash;could gain appreciably from extensive poplar cultivation.  It matures very quickly and thus gives an early return on the capital invested. Details of the poplar scheme have not yet been settled.</P>
    <P>But of far greater importance: The officers will now conduct a promotion campaign bespeaking the help of the private forestry societies and of the National Farmers' Association, Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tíre.  Leaflets will be published, technical advice supplied free and, above all, individual talks given in selected areas.  The propaganda campaign will be directed towards two-picked counties in the first instance.  The two counties will be specially picked having regard to such factors as the proportion of medium-sized farms where silvicultural conditions are suitable.</P>
    <P>There is no lack of land; where there is, a little fertiliser will release land for forestry.  Co-operative societies can plant trees and enjoy the profits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> I ask for a supreme effort from those who have been planting in the past to plant an extra large acreage in this and later years in order to reveal their belief publicly in the value of this new national investment.  I hope some fathers may give the land to their young sons now for forest planting. This is one way of assuring a grandson's dowry.  But many will wish to make their gift later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, being in charge of the Forestry Department, is the only Minister in the Government who is fortunate in having a fairly bright picture to present to the House. I wish him luck of it.  He took over in the Forestry Department a Department geared up to perfect working order; a Department staffed not alone with intelligent officials but with officials who were enthusiastic for their work.  I hope that every other colleague of the Minister will have the same to say of his staff.  If other Ministers can do so they are very lucky indeed.  That was my experience of the Department when I was there.  I think I overlooked paying that tribute to the officials last year and I hope it will not come amiss that I say it to them this year.  I always found them most capable and willing to do their work, and anxious to implement Government policy even when it disagreed with their own ideas.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke at length on the question of the acquisition of land for forestry which is really the one thorny problem he has to face.  If the land comes in there may be some further difficulties but the rest of the work is not so serious.  If the State has not got the land it cannot be planted.  I appreciate the difficulties before the Minister and the Department in regard to the acquisition of land.  The history of the land in this country has been that none of us ever seem to have enough of it and the little piece we have, we hate to part with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, in regard to the acquisition of land, the Minister will have to increase the ceiling price.  The value of the £ is dropping day by day. That means that the Minister should try to keep pace with the devaluation <Col N="708" /> of the £ by increasing the ceiling price. As the £ drops in value he is, year by year, offering a lower price for forestry land.  That is one of the big difficulties.</P>
    <P>I know quite well where the Minister's biggest problem lies but nevertheless it is one with which he should grapple.  In passing I want to compliment him on increasing the private planting grant.  For a long time I was battling with that very problem and it is about time that it should be done. The planting grant was last increased in 1948 as well as selling prices in the acquisition of lands.  At present the plantable reserve of land on hands is becoming dangerously low in view of the Minister's intention to plant 22,500 acres this year and 25,000 acres next year.  To fulfil that programme will make big inroads on the plantable reserve.</P>
    <P>There is another problem, that at present officials in State forests, in the nurseries, do not know, or are not too sure of, the proper type of young seeds to plant or the quantities necessary. To improve that position there should be a plantable reserve of land in hand for the next three years so that the quantities can be successfully determined in advance.  I have been aware of that situation for a long time.  On one occasion a difficulty arose in which the British Forestry Commission had an excess of Sitka spruce and we had an excess of young larch.  An exchange was effected at that time and the problem was resolved but the same conditions may not apply again.  If the Minister wishes to improve that position with regard to the plantable reserve, may I suggest to him the best way to do it is to increase the selling prices and to implement the provisions of the 1956 Forestry Act with regard to commonages?</P>
    <P>A vast area of quite suitable land is available in commonages and, though I do not want to go into this in detail, we all know of cases where there may be ten shareholders in a commonage, eight of whom are willing to sell their shares but two of whom refuse.  Before the passing of the 1956 Act that commonage could not be sold because there was no means of dealing with <Col N="709" /> such a situation.  The 1956 Act, however, gives the Minister power to partition the commonage, leaving out the two unwilling shareholders by giving them their fair share, and he can buy the remaining eight shares.</P>
    <P>Most of the land acquired for afforestation purposes is poor quality land. The forestry officials are straining at the leash to get good land to plant and if I were a Forestry Commission official I, too, would like to get the best land in the country in which to plant trees.  The forestry officials are not to be blamed for that.  As a whole, we are depending on the land of the country for our national economy.  Agriculture is our principal industry and the best way to use our land is to devote the arable and semi-arable portions of it to agricultural purposes and devote the non-arable land to forestry. As the position stands the Minister's field of operations is confined to the poorer quality land and he has already mentioned various figures of unplantable land that the Department already holds.  There are very few offers of land that come into the hands of the Department in which there is not a tail-end of unplantable land which must remain in the hands of the Department. That is one of the snags of the job but it is not serious enough to cause any heart burning.</P>
    <P>If the Minister increases selling prices for lands, if he implements the terms of the 1956 Act with regard to commonages, and if he accepts very small areas, that will help immensely to get over the difficulties of land acquisition.  I know quite well that the average acreage of offers of land is becoming smaller year by year and, because I believe that most of the worthless slices of land are already in the Forestry Department's hands, they will have now to accept offers of 20, 15 and ten acres.  Such offers should not be despised.  Starting as a completely unforested country, the progress of forestry here will naturally be slow and there is nothing wrong with accepting small acreages.</P>
    <P>Despite the Minister's fairly optimistic speech, I do not understand certain of the figures given in the Book of Estimates In sub-head C (2) <Col N="710" /> (Forestry Development and Management) a sum of £1,682,650 is provided this year as against £1,795,720 last year, a decrease of £113,070 and there is a note at the bottom of the page that £139,020 has been transferred from sub-head C (3) to sub-head C (2).  I think it must be a misprint because C (2) shows a decrease and, though I have looked at these figures on a number of occasions, I do not know how that has arisen.  I know the Minister will have one answer for it, that turning over the field of thinnings to private purchasers affected it, but that is merely effecting a transfer of labour.</P>
    <P>While the forestry programme was developing I do not think it was wise for the Department to go into every aspect of forestry and it was well that private individuals participated in it. Last year 5,200 men were employed on forestry but now that figure is down to 4,600.  Possibly that figure will rise during the summer months but it shows a big drop on actual employment in plantations, and I should like to get an explanation on that from the Minister when he is replying.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not give us an account of the amount of work provided by forestry operations in the congested districts, information which was given in the past.  I believe the Department will have to turn more and more to the congested districts because it is there that the poorer quality land is and they will have to depend on that land more and more.  In 1948 in the congested areas 1,600 acres were planted, or 20 per cent. of the plantable area for that year.  By 1954 the figure had risen to 5,300 acres or a total of 33 per cent. of the total planted and in 1956 5,600 acres were planted in the congested areas, or 42 per cent.  In 1948 the number of men employed there was 500 and by 1956 it had risen to 1,500 men.</P>
    <P>I should again like to repeat what I said previously in this House that the Minister in charge of Forestry has a better chance of stemming emigration and stopping the flight from the land than any other Minister in the Government. I have said before, and it will bear repetition, that we do not seem to <Col N="711" /> have a wealth of minerals.  If there are minerals underground, they have not been discovered. That forces us back to the land for our standard of living and for our income.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture has done a magnificent job of work on the arable land and have helped in that way to improve the farmer's lot.  The Board of Works in arterial drainage, is doing a magnificent job in restoring flooded land to an arable, crop-bearing condition.  The Minister has under his wing the non-arable portion of the country.  By developing forestry on that land, he will put it to much more productive use than that to which it is being put at present.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister will be faced with the argument that trees are displacing sheep on the hills.  To a certain extent they are.  Sheep did not seem to hold the population in the poorer areas.  People are deserting the mountain areas rapidly, despite the alleged profit from sheep.  The Minister can take that as clear indication that it is time to test whether trees will hold the population, at least in certain areas, where sheep have failed to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not have the figures to hand now but I should like him in replying to give the number of new centres of forests, if any, in the congested districts; the additions to existing forests in those areas; the number of men employed and the likely future development in that area.  It is alleged that the Minister said in my county that he would devote all his attention to centring afforestation in Wicklow. Wicklow deserves its fair share of afforestation. The western areas equally deserve their fair share.  I cannot vouch as to whether the Minister made such a barefaced statement or not, but I have been told on good authority that he did make such a statement.</P>

      <P>Forest fires are taking their toll, as usual.  While I was in the Department I tried to devise some means to bring home to the public the necessity for more respect for public property, such as forests.  Careless hikers, picnickers and holiday makers are the chief culprits in this matter.  They seek out a nice forest and think that it is a lovely place away from the smoke and noise of the city.  They light a fire and perhaps go away without putting out the fire.  The wind rises and anything from ten to 200 acres of a 20-year-old plantation may be burned down. Money spent on producing a striking poster to be placed in the vicinity of forests would be money well spent. The person from a country area, the farmer or the farmer's wife and children, being familiar with the danger of fires in a country district, very seldom are to blame for forest fires. In most cases forest fires are caused by townspeople who do not understand the danger arising from their carelessness. It might be possible to flash warnings on the cinema screens about the danger of forest fires during the dry weather of February, March and April.</P>

      <P>It is very seldom that there are fires in June.  Such a notice might make people more cautious and would help to reduce the danger of forest fires.  Nothing is so disheartening as to see a flourishing plantation reduced to charred and blackened stumps and a sheet of black ashes.</P>
      <P>With regard to the private planting grant, the Minister has taken a step for which he certainly deserves praise. There are approximately 283,000 farms and holdings in this country.  It often occurred to me that if one out of every four farmers planted one acre, the result would be exactly three times the best efforts of the Department in a single year.  The Minister painted a very rosy picture about the father in days gone by putting down a bin of port when his son was born.  In many cases fathers were not in a position to do that.</P>

      <P>The Minister's idea is an old idea, that has been spoken of very often in this House.  If people could be induced to see the wisdom of putting down a small plantation for a son or daughter or for themselves it would be a most valuable asset to the holding.  I know of no holding that has not a tail-end of fairly useless land which would be much better employed under timber.  There are very few holdings that could not afford one statute acre of plantation.  The Minister should take up with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, the case that if a farmer puts down a plantation he is taxed for it.  That may come as a surprise to the Minister but that is the case.  There is taxation and there are local rates.  The land is revalued.  The valuation is increased the moment a plantation is put on it.  At least, that is the case with the private individual. The fact that a farmer is liable for increased taxation, if he is paying income-tax, and to increased rates, in respect of his plantation, will detract from the benefits given by the Minister in the £20 grant.</P>

      <P>The Minister will find that there is ample foundation for what I say, both in regard to income-tax and local rates.  He should consult with his two colleagues, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance, and he may get very useful information on the subject. I warn him that while these conditions remain they will detract from the good effects of the increase in the private grant.</P>
      <P>The cost to a private farmer of fencing, planting and suitably preparing one statute acre is at least £60.  It is a wonderful investment.  I advised many farmers to do that but very few of them seem to do it.  The Minister will give £10 of the grant when the ground is planted and £10 in five years' time.  The Minister should pay the full £20 in the first instance where the official who inspects the plantation is satisfied that it is properly secured and fenced.  I know that the reason for deferring half of the grant is to ensure that a farmer will not turn cattle, sheep or a mowing machine into the plantation the day after planting.  If the plantation is fairly secure and fenced and the inspector reports that, in his opinion, the plantation is a genuine one and likely to be cared, the Minister should not defer the second £10 for five years.  That will take a great deal of good out of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad the Minister is continuing the planting programme which he found in the Forestry Division.  From time to time, here and elsewhere, a certain amount of gloomy talk is heard, on the one hand that we are not planting enough and, on the other hand, that we are planting too much.  If the Minister implements the programme under which 25,000 acres will be planted next year and then a full review is made of the position, I <Col N="715" /> think that would be a wise move.  Who knows but that 25,000 acres may be too much?  Who knows but that it may not be half enough?  A review is essential.</P>
    <P>I am very glad the Minister is proceeding step by step to implement the policy that was there.  He had it in his power to change and to go back to 7,000 acres or 10,000 acres, or any figure he liked.  With the increased planting, the disposal of thinnings will become an increasingly severe headache for the Forestry Division.  I had plans put before the inter-Party Government, and I had the full support of my colleagues in Government, for the establishment of a pulp plant of pretty large dimensions to deal with the outflow of thinnings which, by the year 1965, will amount to about 10,000,000 cubic feet, or thereabouts.  The Minister cannot hope to get sale for these thinnings; 10,000,000 cubic feet of thinnings would provide fencing posts and every other need to which they could be put for half Europe.  The amount that could be sold as pit props would be negligible.  If time is not taken by the forelock, we shall have on our hands 10,000,000 cubic feet of thinnings.  Such a quantity would keep the largest pulp mill in western Europe working uninterruptedly the whole year round.  I want the Minister to look up what I had planned in order to deal with those thinnings and to go ahead with the plan.  If he thinks it is capable of improvement, then he is at liberty to improve it.  Even if he decided to sell these thinnings for firewood at 10/- or £1 per ton the whole nation would be amply provided and there would still be thinnings left on hands.</P>
    <P>There was a plan for the establishment of a pulp mill.  Such a mill would give employment to about 700 men.  It was to be situated on a certain big river because a vast quantity of water would be essential to the working of the mill.  There is no reason why we should export thinnings and pay £3,000,000 per year for newsprint to Sweden and other countries, which buy very little from us, while we have the raw materials and the labour to meet our own needs.  If the Minister <Col N="716" /> wants to take active steps towards stopping emigration he has it in his hands to do so by the development of afforestation.  I wish him luck in his task.  I have very little criticism to offer.  I am very pleased with the way things are going except for the giving of the cold shoulder to afforestation in the congested areas.  If that is happening, then the Minister is guilty of taking retrograde steps.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should tell us, when he is replying, what has become of the proposals for dealing with the output of thinnings to which Deputy Blowick has referred and which will be coming in ever-increasing flood during the next ten years up to the point when no existing outlet will absorb what we have to offer. When the Minister comes to take a decision on that vital policy matter, he ought to bear in mind that there are powerful vested interests here which will try to manoeuvre the Government into the position of allowing them to make a substantial capital outlay on condition that the Government gives an undertaking that it will coerce the Forestry Division to sell to these monopolies the valuable thinnings from the forests at wholly uneconomic prices.  If that disastrous decision is accepted, we shall see in our time the whole forestry investment called in question and a few monopolies will grow rich at the expense of those of us who have sponsored a very substantial investment of public money in the forests of this country.</P>
      <P>I have always believed, when one is dealing with that kind of ramp, that the way to deal with it is to let the light in.  Maybe it will be no harm to let the light in here.  There are two points of view.  One is that, when this valuable raw material comes forward, the Forestry Division ought to be allowed itself to convert it into pulp, and such other commodities, for paper and textile manufacture as may be found most economic.  That involves the setting up of their own pulp mill. That means they would be enabled to get the full market value of the output of timber from the forests of this country which would redound to the credit of the investment that has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> The other proposal is that existing paper interests should be permitted, or encouraged, to make a substantial capital investment on the undertaking from the Government that the Government would direct into their mills all the thinnings from State forests.  If that disastrous pup is purchased by the Government what will happen is that, when these monopolies have their hands upon the throat of the Forestry Division, they will announce that they cannot afford to pay more than one-half the value of the timber thinnings. If they are told that, at that price, the Forestry Division are not prepared to sell and will divert the thinnings elsewhere they will immediately announce: then we will dismiss 200 men in two or three urban centres where we have been processing this pulp.  &ldquo;You pay your money and you take your choice: either you give us the thinnings at the price we want them at or we create an economic crisis in two or three centres by wholesale dismissals which we will attribute to your refusal to provide us with raw materials at prices we can afford to pay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have seen that trick played before. If anyone tried to play it on me I would tell him to go and take a running jump at himself, but I am sorry to say that that is not always the attitude adopted.  I can imagine that the Fianna Fáil Party, if they were faced with a by-election and if there had been that kind of blackmail at the same time, would say: &ldquo;Whatever it costs, give them the timber and keep the peace.&rdquo;  I do not want to put it in the power of any people to bring pressure of that kind to bear on the Department of Lands.  I desire to spare them the temptation for the good of their own souls even if I have certain ulterior desires to protect the Department of Lands.  It surprises me that when Deputy Blowick was speaking&mdash;and there are few men in Ireland who know more about this question of forestry than he does&mdash;he did not come out as plain and plump in regard to this matter as I have just done because he knows these facts as well as I know them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a good thing to forewarn the present Minister of the kind of things he will be up against, and to tell him that, if the time comes when he must join issue on that matter, he is assured of substantial support, on this side of the House in any case, against any conspiracy to blackmail him into selling the produce of the forests below its true value.</P>
      <P>I do not want to oversimplify the problem.  When one comes to consider the erection of a pulp mill here very complicated technical and financial issues arise which require careful study.  Very careful consideration will have to be given to the best method of using the output of the forests.  But the all-important thing is that in coming to a decision the Minister should be certain that he does not allow himself to be manoeuvred into a position where he has to sell this timber at half its true value to the detriment of the forestry investment we have made in the past and to which we are committed in the future.</P>
      <P>The House will remember that when we were discussing the Supplementary Estimate for Industry and Commerce I drew the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the absurd situation that the Department of Forestry was not allowed to sell timber to the highest bidder but were constrained to sell it very often for much less than it was worth to domestic purchasers although there were foreign purchasers ready and willing to pay the true value of the timber available. I noticed in the last week that the restrictions on the export of timber in the round have been removed.  Am I right in saying that restrictions have been removed except in so far as one vested interest has managed to arrange that he must be consulted in respect of timber suitable for making veneers?  Is it correct that restrictions have been removed except on timber suitable for veneers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there ever anything dafter than that?  Why should a man manufacturing veneers in this country claim that he cannot manufacture it except from domestic timber?  Why can he not go and buy his timber where he likes and let the Department of Forestry sell their timber where they like?  If he is prepared to pay the market value of the timber the Department will sell the timber to him.  If he cannot pay that price, the Department can sell it to somebody else and he can buy timber anywhere he likes.  He can buy ash, mahogany, oak or anything else from the ends of the earth and use it for manufacturing purposes here. Why should he have the right to prevent the Department from selling valuable timber to the best buyer because he wants to get it cheaply to manufacture veneers here?  That is crazy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why the machinery of this House should be used to plunder the ordinary citizen or the Department of Forestry in order to facilitate the person who is going to make veneers in Dublin is a mystery to me.  Can anyone explain?  It is a confidence trick that is played on this House by trying to keep alive by analogy a situation that did obtain during the war.  During the war there were certain raw materials which were in a state of absolute shortage, and if a domestic manufacturer could not get what supplies were available here at home he would have to close his door, if it was not available anywhere else. Then there was some justification for saying that if there was some scrap metal or some other material of that land available it would have to be used in the domestic factory so that end products would be available to consumers here before it was sent abroad in a time of absolute scarcity.  But when that time of absolute scarcity passes why should we keep that system alive if the only purpose is, in effect, to enable the domestic manufacturer to buy his raw material at a price below its true value to the detriment of whoever produced it, whether it is the taxpayer, the Department of Lands or the individual farmer who raised an acre <Col N="720" /> or two acres or ten acres?  Does anybody understand that ramp?</P>
    <P>I wish I could get somebody who would announce to me that I had the right to go round and purchase any man's pigs or sheep or bullocks at the price I choose to put on them and that a law would be there that he would not be allowed to sell until I had the refusal. It would not take me long to get rich.  But if that is not to be thought of, why should a gentleman who sets up a veneer factory have the right to go to any man who owns a tree and say: &ldquo;Sell me that tree at my price or, by the Lord Harry, you will not be let sell it at all.  You will have to let it fall down and rot on the ground&rdquo;?  Can anybody explain why that should be?  If they cannot, I hope the Minister for Lands, who is responsible for forestry and those who are engaged in the production of trees, will see that scandal is ended.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be unduly critical of the higher flights of the Minister's poetic mind but when a Minister is telling me that just as in the old days when a great landowner laid down a bin of port for the son's 21st birthday so with far greater profit and wisdom a man can plant an acre of <Col N="721" /> Sitka spruce to provide a dowry for his son when he marries, I take it that was addressed to those farmers who will be inspired to plant an acre of Sitka spruce instead of laying down a bin of port to provide for the son's dowry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thought this was to be addressed to the man who is asked to plant an acre of Sitka spruce to provide a dowry for his son when he marries.  I want the Minister to bear in mind that references to bins of port are not likely to awaken any favourable reverberations in the minds of the small farmers whom the Minister wants to plant an acre of Sitka spruce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing that in mind, I heard the grim&mdash;and to me&mdash;alarming fact that the net result of it all is that instead of increasing employment in forestry, we shall reduce it.  I should like to take counsel with Deputies.  Do they think this is a good development? I understood Fianna Fáil had asked the electorate for an opportunity to get cracking and that they exhorted the women of Ireland to vote for them in order that they might give employment to their husbands.  This dynamic development appears to me to be going to knock about 400 women's husbands, or potential husbands, out of jobs.  Is that what we want?  Do we think that is a good plan?  I do not.  I think one of the justifications for the forestry policy was the provision of employment <Col N="722" /> in the parts of the country where employment for the sons of small farmers was not readily available.  If you depart from that concept the whole forestry policy calls for review.</P>
      <P>We must bear in mind that there is not enough arable land in Ireland to give everybody living on it at present a holding of 30 acres.  There are a great many farmers living to-day on seven, eight or ten acres and it is the policy of the Department of Lands to relieve that congestion by expanding their holdings as opportunity offers to a minimum of 30 acres.  If the Minister succeeds over the years in achieving that he will overstrain the available area of arable land so that if there is any thought that we ought extend our forestry operations outside that type of land which is not considered arable, we should bear in mind that we shall be forced to the choice between men and trees.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick, when speaking, became crosser and crosser every time he spoke of sheep.  I would sympathise with him if he were talking of goats.  I would gladly see all goats swept out of the country but I think Deputy Blowick would be mistaken if he allowed his prejudice against sheep to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And on the record before us, what are the trees doing?  From 400 to 600 fewer men will be employed, against which you must set off whatever additional employment is provided by private enterprise felling and collection of thinnings but the net figure of reduction cannot be much fewer than 300 people.  If trees cannot make a better job of it than that, I think we shall have to reconsider the whole question.  Certainly a very desirable element in the whole of our forestry policy is the provision of employment for people near their own homes.</P>

I should like to direct the attention of the <Col N="724" /> House to page 9 of the Minister's statement and to dwell for the moment on the fact that, according to the Minister's statement, in the last ten years we have planted in this country 123,000 acres of forestry.  That is as much in the last ten years as was planted in all the time that went before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite Deputies to take a good look at Deputy Blowick.  He is a fine, handsome man, but he is also a man who achieved an extraordinary goal while he was Minister for Lands and Forestry in this country.  More forest acreage was planted in the ten years from 1947 to 1957 than had been planted in the previous 43 years, during 20 of which, God help us, Fianna Fáil was responsible for the Government of this country.</P>
      <P>I would direct the attention of Deputies to pages 11 and 12 of the Minister's statement in which he outlines what he describes as the incentive bonus scheme.  There is a paragraph about it on page 11 and it runs a good way down page 12, telling us that there is a new bonus scheme and a basic national wage of £5 10s. per week.  The fact is that the 10/- is the 10/- they had to give the forestry workers under the national wage agreement to compensate them for the extra cost of bread, butter and flour.</P>
      <P>It is, no doubt, tactful to hide the fact that the forestry workers had to be given the same compensation as every trade union employee in the country got to compensate them for the increased price of bread, butter and flour.  It is not expedient to describe that as an increase of wages to offset the price of bread, butter and flour when the farmers, from whose houses they come, are being told at the same time that their compensation is to take less for their milk, less for their pigs, less for their wheat and less for their barley.</P>

      <P>There is a remarkable coincidence about that 10/-.  I understand that there are now to be special teams of departmental officers to promote the incentive bonus scheme.  Is this a beautiful new poetical description of the M. and O. officer?  One would really imagine that business consultants were never brought into a Government Department before.  There are venerable old civil servants pottering about every Government Department which are known as M. and O. officers&mdash;Methods and Organisation officers.</P>
      <P>We have had various business consultants. I remember fighting a battle that 40 could join in, as to whether my M. and O officer should be graded as a principal officer or an executive officer.  He was graded as an executive officer and, as a result, he was thrown out of every principal officer's office in the Department and we might as well have not had him at all.  I imagine what is happening is that they have called in another body of consultants and they are now doing on one side of Merrion Street what we did on the other side of Merrion Street some years ago.</P>
      <P>The Minister had better make him a principal officer.  My M. and O. was made an executive officer and that was disastrous because nobody paid him the slightest notice.  Make him a principal officer, or nobody will pay the slightest heed to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> I do not know what this incentive work scheme is.  If it means that forestry workers are to be put on a piece-time basis that is not a very revolutionary concept.  Heretofore, forestry workers got £5 10s. a week for planting so many trees.  If a man was a good worker he was kept and, if he was lazy, he was sacked or ought to have been.  I gather from the smile, on the Minister's face they were never sacked and I gather this is a new yardstick introduced to determine which are lazy and which are good.  There is a good deal to be said for that but, like everything else, that can be carried too far.</P>
    <P>The incentive scheme probably means that if a fellow is pushed to it, and does half as much work as he did heretofore, he will get a certain amount of overtime.  Does it not amount to that?  If his previous day's work was deemed to be handling of 100 plants, or 1,000 plants&mdash;I do not know what the figure might be&mdash;hereafter he will continue to get £5 10s. a week for that volume of work and, if in addition to that he does an additional amount of work, he will get that much added on to his wages.  That system is as old as the song of the shirt and, humanely and wisely administered, we can take no exception to it.  However, we ought to bear in mind it can be carried to a length which could be, in my judgment, inconsistent with the overriding considerations that ought to dictate social policy in this country.</P>
    <P>However, I have been told that this matter has been fully discussed with the trade unions and the men involved in this arrangement have had the benefit of trade union advice before accepting it.  If that results in a greater volume of work and a higher rate of pay for those concerned then probably a very useful result will be achieved. But I should like to see it in practice because I believe in judging policies, not by what their proposers hope for them, but by the results they produce. If we get better work from better paid operatives then this scheme deserves commendation.</P>
    <P>I am going to give the Minister a word of advice.  He would bring down on his head a lot less criticism if he did not habitually imply that until he <Col N="727" /> arrived upon the scene nobody was doing anything.  He may not be conscious of that but, if he takes his own manuscript and counts the number of times the pronoun &ldquo;I&rdquo; appears in it, it might give him a very useful hint of a weakness which may seriously abridge his usefulness in public life in this country. The plain fact is that he succeeded a very good Minister, a man who, as those who worked with him knew, loved forestry, who devoted his energies and enthusiasm to it, and a man who managed to gather around him a body of men who responded to his manifest passion for extending the forestry area of this country.</P>
    <P>Very much work and very important work was done in the Department of Forestry over the last ten years.  I do not want to suggest for a moment that there will be any less good work done under the administration of the present Minister.  Deputy Blowick has offered him his best wishes for the success of any work to which he puts his hand in the Department.  To those good wishes I would add my own but I think it would be wrong to accept, or to appear to assent to, the implication that revolutionary changes are under way.</P>
    <P>The only really revolutionary decision that requires to be made, and was not made, during Deputy Blowick's administration, but which requires to be made in the reasonably early future, is the decision as to the best method of disposing of the output of the forests. I think ultimately it is by the nature of that decision that the Minister's success or failure in his present position will come to be judged.  I do not underestimate his difficulties there.  They are formidable but I believe the forestry programme which he inherited was a good programme. I think he will make a mistake if, in an excess of enthusiasm for new ways. simply because they are new, he operates to diminish the number of persons actually employed in the forests.  The greatest danger, however, is that he will suffer himself to be delivered into the hands of the vested interests who want to batten upon him and upon his Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> There must be some Deputies in the House with views on this matter and now is the time to express their views as to how best to use the output of the forests of this country.  There will be no use in caterwauling after the damage is done.  There will be a decision taken in the course of the next 12 or 18 months on this question of who is to process the output of the forests and now is the time to let the Minister and the Government know what Deputies' views are.  Those Deputies afraid to express their views on it ought to keep their mouths shut when it comes to the time the decision is announced.</P>
    <P>For my part I believe that the vested interests should not be allowed to get the Minister down, and batten on his Department.  Any scheme designed to avoid that disaster is assured of sympathetic consideration from this side of the House and subject to that observation, I hope the Minister will succeed in making the proper decision.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Blowick is mistaken when he says that land can be revalued after it is planted in private hands but, mind you, he is very seldom 100 per cent. wrong.  There is some nigger in the woodpile and it would be 1,000 pities if the double grant for private planting should be made abortive by a consideration of that kind.  There is no sounder mind in Ireland than that of Deputy Blowick in dealing with the countryman and his problems.  If he is worried they are worried too, and it would be advisable for the Minister to take steps in that direction if his double planting grant is to have the success he wants.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 36:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), page 16, line 9, to delete &ldquo;fifteen hundred&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two thousand&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In deference to the Minister's wish that we get a move on, I shall be very brief.  The purpose of amendments Nos. 36 and 37 is to raise the income limit of employments which are employments to which Part IV applies, from £1,500 to £2,000.  The section as it is framed at the moment envisages that the income should be calculated on a gross basis, in other words, that every penny of income that a person gets and every payment that can be added to his income under the provisions of Part IV are all added up and, if the total is more than £1,500, the employment comes within the scope of Part IV of the Bill.  I think that that is too low, that it would be desirable from the point of view of administration to raise the limit to £2,000, to exclude everything under £2,000, bearing in mind the manner in which the income is calculated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I instanced already the case of a commercial traveller.  Practically every <Col N="730" /> commercial traveller will be brought within the scope of this Bill as it is framed at the moment, because a commercial traveller could not stay on the road at less than £1,000 a year expenses, taking the cost of his car, hotel, travelling, meals and everything into consideration, so that a commercial traveller who earns £500 net income will be brought within the scope of Part IV.  There are other people in the same category.  I can imagine engineers, accountants and various other people like that whose net incomes are not large, being brought within the scope of Part IV of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to add a second argulent, that the income limit in Britain is £2,000.  I admit that their circumstances are completely different but, nevertheless, money values and incomes correspond roughly in both countries. So, from the point of view of facilitating the operation of Part IV and cutting down administration to the minimum and cutting out of the net, that Part IV will spread, various types of employment which I am sure it is not intended should be included, I would ask the Minister to accept these two amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to strike a figure that would not be objected to. I must say that one of the things I said to the Revenue Commissioners when they came to me with this proposal was that I thought £1,500 was a bit high but they put it to me that they had plenty of work to do at the moment and did not want to be bothered with more and put it deliberately fairly high so that the number of cases arising would be comparatively small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been attacked here more than once for taking provisions holus-bolus out of the British Act.  Now the Deputy wants me to follow the British Act in this particular instance where we evidently did depart from what was in the British Act.  However, I do not think the comparison as far as Britain is concerned has any bearing on us here. We have to make up our mind what we believe to be an income that, first of all, would be low enough to catch out the people we set out to deal with in this part of the Bill and, at the same time, <Col N="731" /> I have to keep in mind the view put to me by the Revenue Commissioners that they did not want to have too many cases to deal with.  On that basis, I think the £1,500 is a fair compromise although, as I said already, in my opinion, too high when I saw it first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is so. Two-fifths of £1,500 is £600.  I could understand the argument if it were £1,500 net.  Where I am rather shocked by it is that this is the gross figure, the figure before expenses that are allowable expenses under the rules of Schedule E, come into consideration. It is not a net figure.  It is a gross figure, as I understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to take a gross figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think the Minister has convinced me that you have to take a gross figure, but the fact that you must take a gross figure means that one must consider a different limit figure than one would consider if one took a net figure.  If you took a net figure then I think you would be just asking for people to pay £1 per annum less than that net figure on salary and pay the balance on expenses, to do exactly what none of us wants to do.  But you must take a gross figure, and it seems to me that the method of doing so in this respect will be against the individual who is in a smaller way of business.  Take the man who is a director of three or four different companies.  A couple of examples occur to my mind at once. He is not affected by this at all because he has less than £1,500 in respect of each company.  They are not connected <Col N="732" /> in any way.  While I am speaking I see the syllogism in my own argument because I am relating this as if it were a case of an employee and not that of a director.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a notice which, in the framework of the Act, must be given by the inspector of taxes.  Of course we all know it will not necessarily be the inspector himself who will give it.  It will go out under his name, but it will in fact be done by somebody in his office.  We must have some minimum time for such a notice.  I take the view that 99 per cent. of revenue officials are reasonable people but one does occasionally get the 1 per cent. who are the reverse of reasonable.  By the time they reach the higher posts they have usually learned sense, but one does get younger officials occasionally &mdash;not only in revenue but elsewhere as well&mdash;who do not appreciate the way in which their job should be done. There should be a minimum time here anyway.  This is more or less equivalent to an assessment.  One must appeal <Col N="733" /> within 21 days of assessment and what is sauce for the taxpayer should be sauce for the Revenue Commissioners as well.</P>

As we are all aware in our private capacity, the Revenue Commissioners give 21 days and there are dire consequences if one fails to give the information required.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 39:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 17, line 3, to delete &ldquo;or other property&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am not clear as to the meaning of the words &ldquo;or other property&rdquo;.  If, for example, there is a company which owns a farm and has not other property at all it will be assessable under Schedule A in respect of buildings, assessable, at its own option, under Schedule B or C on the valuation or the profits.  If it opts to be assessed under Schedule B on the original land purchase annuity rather than on the profits, is not the position that the people operating that farm as a company cannot be taxed for anything because the profits will already have borne full tax?  If this is intended to catch the company which is assessable, and which has no other income except the land, the effect of the inclusion of these words would mean that certain profits were taxed twice!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Schedule B assessments, the Minister made the case very strongly that the effect was merely to <Col N="734" /> take from one the income that was being taxed and allow it in another place.  If this is the type of company the words &ldquo;or other property&rdquo; are to cover, it would be taking profits and taxing them though there would be no similar liability elsewhere.  To explain the matter to the Minister, may I draw the analogy with the ordinary farmer who has no income of any kind, sort or description except what he makes out of his land?</P>
    <P>He pays Schedule A tax in respect of his building.  He decides to be assessed for Schedule B tax in respect of his valuation or the original land purchase annuity on his land, and whatever he makes from his farm he uses that for the purpose, amongst other things, of running a motor car.  As I understand this Bill there is no possibility of taxing him in respect of the running of that motor car which he pays for out of the profits of his land which have been fully taxed under Schedule B.  I hope I am right in that.  If I am not we shall have to have another story at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Assuming I am right in that, however, take the similar case in respect of a company which owns land.  The company makes its profit out of the land.  It is fully taxed in respect of its profits and it pays for a car for a director in the same way as the farmer pays for his own car.  I think the words in that section will mean that that director has to pay additional tax to what he would have to pay if the farm were not held by an incorporated company. That arises because in this case there is no Schedule B profit against which the cost can be apportioned.  In the case we were discussing yesterday the cost of the car is included in the company's accounts as an expense and therefore the company have not been paying tax in respect of it.  In this case there is no such allowance to the company but there is additional taxation on the person concerned.  This is all, of course, on the basis that I have correctly interpreted what the Minister means by &ldquo;or other property&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides that the Bill shall not apply&mdash;it is put in the negative way&mdash;in relation to any <Col N="735" /> body corporate unless it carries on a trade or its functions consist wholly or mainly in the holding of investments or other property.  The Deputy seeks to delete the words &ldquo;or other property.&rdquo; The possible effect of that would be that, let us say, an estate company, a company that deals in houses, would not come under the Act. That type of company would be in a very nice position to do a good turn for its directors by giving them a free house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if it deals in estate property it carries on a trade. &ldquo;Dealing&rdquo; is carrying on a trade.  I think the Minister will find I am right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy is right.  Take the words &ldquo;or its functions consist wholly or mainly in the holding of investments or other property.&rdquo;&ldquo;Or other property&rdquo; would apply to an estate company, a company dealing in house property.  By the exclusion of these words companies of that kind would be put outside the Act.  If such a company should give a house to its directors they would not be caught under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so because once a company deals, it is caught because it carries on a trade. Perhaps I can make the situation clearer in a different way.  What is worrying me is this.  If the functions of a body corporate consist wholly in the holding of property then the case I instanced a minute ago must arise. Take the case of a company whose sole purpose is to hold and run a farm&mdash; that is its sole asset which is taxable under Schedule A and under Schedule B.  As it is taxable under the fixed provisions of Schedule B, the inclusion of such a company in this part of the Act brings in a farmer director in a far worse position for taxation than the farmer would be if he was not a director.  I do not think the Minister intends that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is right in that, that if the farmer converts his property into a company he comes into this Bill.  If he remains a proprietary farmer he does not.</P>

    <Col N="736" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the position is that he should not if the company holds only the land, because if the company is assessable in respect of its profits, the cost of running a car&mdash;we will take a car for the moment&mdash;is deductible from the profits and the company does not pay tax on that expense of running the car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes the case that the company has not paid tax on the running of that car, that because it is getting the cost of running the car as an expense, then it is proper to charge tax on the person who is getting the benefit on the same basis.  That has been the argument the Minister has made all along.  In relation to a company holding land alone, however, the company does not get the right to deduct the cost of running the car against its assessment and therefore if the individual is going to be assessed on the cost of running the car he will be assessed on it in addition to the full taxation the company has had to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can follow the Deputy, the same argument could be used against cash expenses, I mean, the sort of cash expenses we had in mind. We mentioned already a company must have an account of the cash given by way of expenses.  I think the same. would apply from the Deputy's reasoning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would for this reason.  If you have a company which has no business at all except carrying on a farm of agricultural land, the dividends which it distributes have already been taxed under Schedule B and there is no further tax to be paid in respect of them.  The Minister is now imposing an additional tax and he has not got the offset in the company's accounts he would have otherwise.  If the Minister intended to do that then we can deal with it on another basis, but I should like to be quite clear, first of all, as to whether the Minister intended to tax something that was not being allowed as an expense to the company under Schedule D.  The company is not paying the tax <Col N="737" /> on it and the Minister's case therefore is that because the company is not paying the tax it is reasonable to tax the individual.  That does not arise in respect of a company which holds land only and I am using &ldquo;land&rdquo; in the agricultural sense as apart from the general statutory definition.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 40:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 17, to delete lines 8 to 13, inclusive.</P>
      <P>We have pretty fully discussed points on amendment No. 40 on early sections of the Bill and, as I understand the position now, the wider part of the proviso comes in where living accommodation is not provided.  I am not clear on what exactly the wider part is intended to cover by &ldquo;other than private office accommodation&rdquo; if it is intended to cover any accommodation.</P>
      <P>I gather from the Minister it is intended to cover private office accommodation only as apart from living accommodation.  This is really more on the section than on the amendment, but the two are cognate, and I would like to be quite clear that there is no difference&mdash;the Minister hinted at this already&mdash;between premises occupied by a body corporate for the purpose of any trade, and premises owned by a body corporate for the purposes of its trade. I am perturbed about the term &ldquo;occupied&rdquo;.  It seems to me that where a company owns premises and puts an employee into its premises it is the employee who occupies and the body corporate who owns.  I want to be clear that there is not any gap left on that account.  Occupancy, as I understand it, means the physical occupancy in this case; it is not the type of occupancy visualised in respect of Schedule B; if it was, then I would be quite happy because it would be equivalent to a grazing tenant not being an occupier but a lessee being an occupier, but I cannot see that it comes in at all on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is clear that the effect of this section is virtually the same as if the <Col N="740" /> body corporate owns the premises for the purposes of its trade as apart from the purposes of giving an estate in the country to somebody then I think we could probably make some progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not clear that the only other place in Part IV where &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; is used is in sub-section (2) of Section 22?  Therefore the description of &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; relates to that section only, and I think the meaning is quite clear that for the purposes of that section, sub-section (2) of Section 22, the Bill wants to restrict accommodation, supplies and services to actual business premises.</P>
      <P>When you come to the next sub-section (3), the reference is to business premises which include living accommodation and they get this meaning because of the exceptions in the proviso. I cannot see Deputy Sweetman's difficulty at all.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2) (a), page 17, line 45, before &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;unless the partnership deed shall otherwise determine&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an obvious amendment.  There may be a partnership deed involved.  I know of one partnership deed I saw some years ago in the course of my professional duties where the man who got more than half the profits had not got the control.  There was a provision that the sleeping partner had control but he drew only one-third of the profits.  The working partner drew two-thirds of the profits but in any question of voting between them the man with one-third of the profits had the control.  I want to provide if there is a special arrangement in the partnership deed like that, that it will override the section.  I think it is essential that there should be some form of words such as I have put in here&mdash;the contrary is not provided otherwise than by deed.  This section takes the line of saying control is the person who has the profits.  That is the normal way but there are cases where it need not be so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> I may have put my figures the wrong way around but what happened in the case was that A had one-third of the profits, and the partnership deed provided that even though A had one-third of the profits he had not control. Under this section&mdash;there were only two partners&mdash;B would be deemed by the Act to have control though in fact the partnership deeds showed it was A had the control.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete the words: &ldquo;but nothing in this sub-section shall be construed as requiring an individual to be treated in any circumstances as under the control of another person.&rdquo;  Surely there must be cases in which, in the analogy the Minister is taking in relation to companies, an individual is under the control of another person?  Without going into the humorous cases of certain people being under the control of their wives, might there not be cases where individuals, as part of a partnership, are under the control of <Col N="745" /> someone else?  Line 2 does not say individuals who are not in partnership, but it is an individual, whether he is in partnership or acting as an individual, who is caught by this section.</P>
    <P>My partner and I remain individuals even though we are in partnership together.  Deputy Haughey and his partners remain individuals even though they are in partnership together, and an individual who is part of a partnership must be under the control of somebody else.

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say something about Part V of the Bill.  In recent years companies have, on a fairly extensive scale, set up retirement benefit schemes for their directors and highly paid employees.  The company is entitled to charge its expenditure under this head against its profits and so reduce its tax liability, and the director or employee for whose benefit the scheme is provided is not taxed on the contribution made on his behalf, though it is equivalent to extra remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Usually the scheme is one under which an endowment assurance, maturing on death or retiring age, is effected <Col N="746" /> on the life of the director or employee concerned.  The amount of assurance is sufficient to provide a pension of, say, two-thirds of his salary.  If the person had no option but to accept a pension, income-tax would be payable on the pension.  But it is arranged that the pension may be converted into a lump sum payment which is not subject to income-tax.  When this happens no income-tax is collected at all&mdash;the contributions are deducted from the tax liability of the company, the beneficiary is not taxed on the extra remuneration represented by these payments on his behalf, and, when the benefits are received, it is arranged that they come in a non-taxable form. That is by way of a lump sum.  The pension is commuted to a lump sum. Part V of the Bill is designed to correct and regulate this position.  It does so from 6th April of next year&mdash;I want to make it plain that there is no retrospection in this.  The way in which the matter will be controlled is, very briefly, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 30 is a general blockade set up in order to regulate the traffic.  It makes the cost to the company of providing the retirement benefits taxable income of the director or employee for whose benefit the contributions are being paid.  We commence by saying: &ldquo;These are your benefits and they are taxable as far as you are concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Minister to use the word &ldquo;blockade&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;a general blockade to start with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>A very apt word in regard to another section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I continue the metaphor&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trapping of the initial payments in this way will not, however, apply to various forms of legitimate provision for directors and employees.  What lies behind all the technical provisions of this part of the Bill is the intention that retirement benefits will not get a double relief from tax&mdash;a relief when the contributions are made and a second relief when the benefits are paid out.  It is sought to tax this form of income only once; that is, not to tax <Col N="747" /> it twice but, on the other hand, not to let it off scot-free.</P>
    <P>Thus, where the company pays a premium on a life assurance policy, the director or employee will get the relief to which he would have been entitled if he had himself paid the premium.</P>
    <P>The director or employee will not have the company's payments counted as part of his taxable income where the retirement benefit provisions conform to certain conditions.  These conditions are intended to secure that more than a normal proportion of the benefits does not become payable in the non-taxable form of a lump-sum and that the benefits themselves are not excessive.  What we are aiming at here is, roughly what public servants are entitled to, that is, a retiring pension of about two-thirds of his salary and a lump-sum of not more than one-fourth of the total benefits.  If the scheme which is adopted by any company for its directors and highly paid men conforms to these requirements then, generally speaking, the contributions will be free and, of course, the pension when it becomes payable afterwards will be subject to income-tax as earned income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand why, having regard to the averaging position that is contained in the earlier part of this definition of final remuneration, directors' fees should be excluded, particularly when the word &ldquo;similar&rdquo; remuneration is added.  As I understand the position, the section as it stands means that the average annual amount of the remuneration of the director over the three years prior to his retirement is taken and that is the figure upon which the pension can be based.  That is on the lines, as the Minister has just said, of the analogy with Civil Service pensions, that you take the average over the previous three years.  Then, having taken the average over the past three years, you come down in lines 39 to 42 and you say that part of the figure that you have taken in for averaging what the man has received is not to be accounted in the annual average computation.  I cannot understand that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> We all know that executive directors are paid partly by executive remuneration, partly by directors' fees and that the £100 that they receive as part of their executive directors' employment remuneration is just the same £100 in the man's pocket as the £100 he may receive as director's fees.  Therefore, I cannot understand why directors' fees are to be excluded in arriving at the annual average computation.  As I understand the Minister, he wants to ensure that the pension that will be payable will have a relationship to the average that a man has been paid in the last three years of his working life, so to speak.  That is the Civil Service basis, as I understand it.  If that is so, why exclude part of what he has been receiving?</P>

      <P>The idea here is that this section should apply to the employees, the reason being that a pension scheme is hardly applicable unless you have constant employment, first of all, of course, and a fairly well-defined range of salary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You have that in the case of the employee and so much is paid according to his salary each year. Usually, a percentage of his earnings is paid into a fund.  A director, first of all, is only there for a term.  He may in fact be there for life but he is only voted in for a term.  He is not, as a rule at any rate. depending on that company.  He may be a director of another company.  He may have other business of his own or something like that.  On the whole, I think it would be difficult to allow directors to be taken into a scheme of this kind.  The director may, of course, look after himself under Part VI and it would be the proper place for him to make provision for his own superannuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point that I think I can make, that directors who hold a fairly substantial interest in a company are usually there for life.  They very often go beyond the normal age for pension, 65, and even beyond the age of 70 and in many ways it would be difficult to deal with a director in this particular part.  When we come to Part VI it is a different matter because <Col N="749" /> the director makes his own arrangements and it does not matter in Part VI whether he retires or not before he draws his pension.  It is not a retiring allowance exactly but he can draw it at a certain age even if he goes on working.  For many reasons.  Part VI is more appropriate for a director than Part V.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that Part VI is more appropriate for a director who is not an executive director.  I agree with the Minister's argument in relation to a person who is a director only but the type of person I am considering is a person who is both an employee and a director.  Where a person is what I term an executive director, that is to say, a person who is an employee and, perhaps, coming to the end of his period, is promoted to be a director&mdash;the case we were discussing earlier to-day&mdash;when he is an employee, why should not the total of his pay from the company be taken into account?</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that if he is a director only he should go on to Part VI, but I am not interested in that case.  I am interested in the case of an individual who is primarily, if you like, an employee and, secondly, a director.  Why should he not be able to have the same advantage as, say, the civil servant who is promoted in the last three years before he retires? That civil servant brings into his average his increased pay on promotion. Why cannot the employee, who is paid a salary and is promoted to be a director, take into his average the additional money paid to him by the company in the same way as the civil servant can take in his promotional increase in pay?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  But that is not the type of case we have in mind.  The ordinary director is paid a fee which is supposed to cover him for his services. He has no superannuation.  The employee in most big firms comes under a superannuation scheme and that superannuation is deemed to be part of his remuneration.  The director, in theory, is paid for his services and he must not expect anything more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, that theory is a little bit out of date. Directors do not operate on that basis now.  Take the precedents that we have had in this House.  I seem to remember that when directors were having their offices terminated by Act of this House compensation was voted to them for that termination.</P>

      <P>That is quite right.  Take the example of the man with £1,200&mdash; £300 of which is deemed to be director's fees.  Suppose he is put off the board obviously he will lose his £300. That may be made up to him in another way by the other directors who may conclude that it was hard luck he should be put off.  Presumably he would lose that £300.  That would upset the scheme.  When the individual keeps going up, the scheme works. When he goes down, it does not work. There would be some question, I think, of giving him a refund of his contributions to some extent.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 18, line 52, to delete &ldquo;ten&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;fifty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Why did the Minister choose 10 per cent.?  Surely a person with 90 per cent. against him cannot be deemed to be in control.  The phraseology of the Bill making a proprietary director a person with only 10 per cent., thereby implying that he is a controller of the company, is so fantastic that I feel I must have missed something.  I can understand the Minister not saying 51 per cent. because the chairman would have a casting vote as chairman and that would give him control.  How it could be suggested that a person with only 10 per cent. of the shares would be a person in control beats me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept of proprietary here is not a good one.  I would prefer the section to be drafted along the lines of the control we had in Part IV. A holding of 10 per cent. in a public company is nothing.  In fact, such a holding has no bearing on a man's status particularly when one remembers that portion of that 10 per cent. might be in trust for his children.  He might not hold the 10 per cent. at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says is correct.  A director holding 10 per cent. does not necessarily control.  In a company with a rather scattered shareholding, 10 per cent. is a very big holding. I am told that in some of these companies you seldom have more than 20 per cent. of the shareholders voting at a meeting, so a 10 per cent. shareholder might have a very substantial control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to a public company perhaps there might be some case for having a smaller percentage than 50 per cent. because 50 per cent. in a public company would never be held, but in relation to a private company does he not agree there is a very strong case for increasing the percentage to something more realistic?  We might have a difference perhaps for private and public companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be that there might be a danger that a proprietary director would be one of a family, say, whose brother would also be a proprietary director who would also be a holder of a very large proportion of the shares?   Perhaps the point might be met if you had inserted in that section another definition altogether of a proprietary company.  I am suggesting that if you had a definition saying: &ldquo;A proprietary director being the director of a proprietary company&rdquo;, and a subsequent definition of a proprietary company as one &ldquo;in which proprietary directors and proprietary employees have a controlling interest.&rdquo; That might meet the Minister's point or the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners in that the company might be controlled by proprietary directors and/or employees.  I do agree with the speakers who have said already that to define as a proprietary director one with only 10 per cent. of the ordinary share capital seems unreasonable especially when it does not refer even to the voting rights.  The ordinary share capital might be divided into A and B, A with votes and B without votes.  You could have a person with 10 per cent. of the ordinary share capital and only 1 per cent. or maybe 5 per cent. of the voting rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be a 64 dollar question but, for the purpose of understanding this, could the Minister give us his conception of the disadvantages that a proprietary director will suffer in relation to Part VI as against the person who is included in Part V; in other words, has the Minister worked out any examples&mdash;or have they been worked out for him&mdash;as to the worse terms that are available to people in Part VI as against those in Part V?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing I had forgotten.  In Part VI they are all pensions of a lump sum.  Under Part V a quarter of the pension might be a lump sum.  Apart from that, there is no advantage.  If the person goes under Part VI he is paid, let us say, £200 more and he pays towards that £200 himself but it is free of tax.  Under Part V it is put in by the company and it is also free of tax.  Therefore, there is no difference so far as that is concerned at the paying end.  At the receiving end, there is that advantage that under Part V he could have a lump sum amounting to what would be calculated as a quarter of the benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister is perfectly right to restrict the part-time director to Part VI, but a full-time director, what I called all along the executive director, who is really a director in addition to his employment, a full-time executive director who is primarily an employee and a director secondly, should get the benefit of Part V, the part-time man, who is director only, to be kept to Part VI.

It is for the taxpayer to upset the assessment and to prove to the satisfaction of the Special Commissioners that the assessment is wrong.

You cannot prove you do not control by indirect means.  It is not possible to prove a negative. The burden of proof in that respect should be on the Revenue Commissioners if we are to leave the phraseology as it is because it is the Revenue Commissioners who allege that by &ldquo;indirect means&rdquo; the company is controlled.

I do not think that, in that case, you can say on whom the onus of proof lies.

      <P>I move amendment No. 46:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 19, lines 25 to 27, to delete &ldquo;any such person or of such director or employee, shall be deemed to be owned or controlled by such director or employee&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;a person or persons being or including any such person or such director or employee, shall be deemed to be owned or controlled by such director or employee and not by any other person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important matter and it is a little intricate.  Attention has been drawn to the fact that under paragraph (a), sub-section (2) Section 29, a particular holding of shares could be treated as being owned or controlled by two directors.  If director A was a trustee for the children of director B, the shares so held would be controlled by director B.  Sub-section 2 (a) would cause the same shares to be owned or controlled by director B and it is felt that the position in regard to shares and trust for the wife or children should be made clear.  The intention of the Bill is to regard such a trust as for the benefit of the wife and children. It is a very technical point and I cannot do better than read this short description of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The only part of this that worries my mind is where the <Col N="761" /> Minister seems to bring another person into it.  Suppose there is a trust of shares for a more distant relative than a spouse or children&mdash;a spinster&mdash;and there is a provision of a trust of shares for her absolutely for her life and if she dies without marriage and without issue, the trust falls back to the spouse and/or the children.  That is a case in which the spouse or children have got no present interest and should not, therefore, be taken into account.  They only have a contingent interest on reversion expectant on the death of someone without issue.</P>
      <P>That is not the type of case&mdash;the fraudulent trust type of case&mdash;which the Minister has in mind.  The Minister wants to make sure that a person, while giving shares to his wife or children, cannot divest himself of the percentage. If the beneficiary is another person, the fact that the spouse and children merely come in on reversion, if some event happens, does not invalidate the whole trust for such a relative.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), page 19, line 28, after &ldquo;capital&rdquo; where it secondly occurs, to insert &ldquo;which carries voting rights&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole point in this is the point which has been raised already by Deputy Booth.  It seems to me that for this purpose what you want to consider is not the ownership of the company, but the control of the company.  I do not think I am misunderstanding the Minister when he said that his reason for part of this is that directors are able to arrange things suitably for themselves. Arrangements are made, not on the basis of ownership of capital, but on the basis of the voting power of the <Col N="762" /> capital.  If you are charging the ownership of capital, apart from the voting power of it, you ought to use the phrase &ldquo;fixed assets&rdquo; and not merely &ldquo;share capital&rdquo; as such.  What the Minister wants to cover is the case of the person controlling the company by means of his voting power at the annual meeting.  That is what he wants to do and, in the light of that, why not say so in the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under (b), &ldquo;ordinary share capital&rdquo; means all the issued capital of the company other than capital the owners of which have a right to a fixed rate of dividend.  That means preference capital.  Debentures would be out.  We are only following the definitions given in Section 34 of the Finance Act of 1941, that is, capital for the purpose of corporation profits tax.  It would, I think, include participating preference shares.  That would be one definition at least and I think it would be no harm to make it a bit wider than the ordinary capital. I do not think it is a terribly important point, but I would prefer that we should include participating preference shares along with ordinary stock in this connection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is more concerned with the reward the capital gets than with the power it has, and he wants to include people owing 10 per cent. of the share capital, if that share capital carries any form of reward except the first preference dividend. That is the difference between the Minister and Deputy Sweetman and I am not sure the Minister is not right in that.</P>

An employee of a business owned by a proprietary director can be a dependant for the purposes of this section. I think it must be quite clear that, if we are to have dependants, it is restricted to dependants as defined in the Income-Tax Acts.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister about the provisions for retirement or other benefit.  As defined in page 19, it reads: &ldquo;means any pension, annuity, lump sum, gratuity or other benefit to be given on retirement, or in anticipation of retirement, or, in connection with past services, after retirement.&rdquo;  Does this definition include a benefit which is given after <Col N="765" /> retirement and which is not in connection with past services?  The type of benefit I mean is fairly well known.  A man retires and subsequent to his retirement, is given an <i>ex gratia</i> payment which is not connected in any way with past services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure of the point the Deputy is making.  There is a very wide definition of retirement benefit and the endeavour is to include practically any type of retirement benefit in this section.  The Deputy asked if a person gets a lump sum at a later stage, how it would stand in connection with this part of the Bill.  All I can say is that in this part of the Bill we provide that a lump sum must not exceed a fourth of the total benefit.  There is a way of calculating that.  It is the total benefit calculated actuarially on what the pension is worth at the time he is retiring.  If it is worth so much, he can get one-fourth by way of lump sum and the remainder must be by way of pension annuity.  I do not know whether that covers the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite.  This phrase keeps recurring.  It is a very operative phrase for the whole of this Part of the Bill.  I want to get it clearly understood whether or not the type of benefit I have in mind comes under it.  It is just a question of the reading of the phraseology.  Must a benefit that is given after retirement be in connection with past services in order to come under the definition of retirement or other benefit in this sub-section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have known of payments which were made completely <i>ex gratia</i> after the retirement of the employee.  There was no connection between them and the employment.  They were not tied in in any way with the salary or the conditions of service, or anything like that.  They were completely <i>ex gratia</i> and they were not mentioned before retirement.  After retirement the director or employee was given a gratuitous lump sum.  I think we could definitely argue that such a <Col N="766" /> lump sum was not in connection with past service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

It is very often the case that where there is amalgamation of companies, or where there is a number of associated companies, an employee or director may be transferred from one company or group to another or, on acquisition of one business by another, that those in the service of the previous company are taken over into the service of the new company.  It does seem rather unreasonable that service in such a case has ceased absolutely on the amalgamation or take-over and that, even where the new company may wish to continue the benefits that would have been payable by the old company, the employee or director will have lost all his rights by reason of the termination of his previous employment which was, in fact, a theoretical rather than a real termination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister whether he would consider including in the definition of &ldquo;service&rdquo; something along the lines that service means service as an employee or director of the body corporate in question and shall include service with a predecessor or predecessors in business and associated companies.  If that could be agreed, it would mean that there would be a possibility of switching employees or directors from one company to another <Col N="767" /> associated company without damage to the individual concerned and I do not think the revenue would suffer in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be coming to a section later&mdash;I think it is Section 32&mdash; which refers to discretionary powers of the Revenue Commissioners.  The type of case mentioned by Deputy Booth would properly come to be discussed there and could be dealt with there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Did the Minister say a section dealing with discretionary powers of the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No&mdash;of the Revenue Commissioners. There is a long list of discretionary powers of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite see that, in certain cases where the drafting has become impossible in a detailed fashion, some discretion may have to be given, but when a question of taxation is involved, I am against anyone having too much discretion one way or the other.  Taxation should be definite.  One should know precisely where one stands and not be in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners whose discretion, I am afraid, is very often exercised by minor officials.  If in every case the decision rested with the Revenue Commissioners, I should feel happier, but I know from my own experience that, in 99 cases out of 100, the decision is not taken by the Revenue Commissioners at all; it is taken by some very much more junior official.  I would hope that we would not deal with this as a discretionary matter but as a matter of right, that in the case of anyone who has been employed in a company that is taken over by another, his service should be regarded as continuous service, even though it was first with one company and subsequently with the company that took over the first company and that, similarly, in a group of companies, there should be freedom to move from one company in the group to another without having incurred a final break in service.  I wonder would the Minister even give me a hint that he might consider the matter so as to <Col N="768" /> get it out of the discretionary clauses altogether?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be very difficult. The Deputy will realise when he comes to deal with Sections 31 and 32 that we may have the ideal scheme in Section 31&mdash;I think it is&mdash;where everything is fulfilled and the scheme must be sanctioned, but then it is realised that in many cases the company concerned cannot fulfil all these conditions and then we give discretion which may exempt them from this heading and that heading and so on down along. I do not see how otherwise it could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that point. Would it not be possible simply to say under that definition that service includes service with predecessors in business or associated companies, not to limit it to service as directors or employees of the body corporate in question, but simply to say &ldquo;of the body corporate in question or their predecessor or predecessors in business or any company associated with the body corporate&rdquo;?  Would that be difficult?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would have to appeal to the Deputy to wait.  We can afterwards go back and decide if it is necessary to bring in an amendment. When we come to discuss Section 31, we might say that it would be better to put the amendment in where the Deputy said rather than at that particular stage.  I think we will have to discuss it first.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister clarify one point?  Where there is a statutory discretion provided to be exercised by the Revenue Commissioners specifially in a Finance Act, could that discretion in fact be exercised by a minor officer of the Revenue Commissioners or is it not in fact exercised by the commissioners themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had experience as a Minister.  He had discretion in certain cases.  A Minister in his own Department can make a ruling at his discretion and get his officials to administer under that ruling, keeping strictly to the ruling of course.  I presume the Revenue Commissioners will do the same thing.  They will tell their inspectors that their ruling is such and such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recollect that there are a whole raft of matters which are ordinarily delegated under general rules to principal officers or assistant secretaries.  There are then certain reserved matters which must carry the Minister's signature.  Although the decision might be propounded to him by responsible officers of his Department, there are certain categories in which he himself must sign. Would I be wrong in assuming that where there is a statutory discretion vested in the Revenue Commissioners, in the ordinary course decisions on matters arising under this statutory discretion would go to the commissioners themselves for determination though with a recommendation perhaps from an official lower down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In law, of course, it is the Revenue Commissioners who exercise the discretion.  In practice, I am quite sure they do the same as a Minister does.  In this particular instance they will say: &ldquo;You will do such and such and you must not go further than that. If you have to go further you must refer it to us.&rdquo;  I am sure that is the way they operate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 50:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the general blockade section, <Col N="770" /> as the Minister described it.  Sub-section (2) of this section brings in certain types of artificial blockade. Benefits are in certain circumstances deemed to be the income of the director. I candidly find it very, very difficult to understand what this sub-section proposes to blockade.  I cannot see why benefits are to be deemed to be income.  If they are not income, they are only to come in if they are under contract to a third person.  This is another example of an even more indirect means than that which we were discussing a short time ago.</P>
    <P>In relation to both Parts V and VI of this Bill, I am travelling in seas which are quite uncharted as far as I am concerned.  I thought I knew a little about the matters we were discussing in the earlier parts of the Bill, but this is an unfamiliar line of country with which I am quite unfamiliar.  I have read the Bill and tried to understand it and it is as a result of that reading of the Bill that I know even the little I have learned.  So far as this part of the Bill is concerned, I would wish to have the benefit of either the Special Committee or the commission at present sitting to inquire into income-tax.</P>
    <P>In relation to this part of the Bill&mdash; I am sorry to have to admit it&mdash;the Minister could put anything over on me and I would not appreciate what it was he was getting me to enact.  Faced with that dilemma, the only thing I could do was to put down amendments to delete certain sections and subsections and thereby force the Minister, by a different type of blockade, to come out into the open.  That is why I have put down these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (1) of this section relates to cases where the employer during the employee's service makes payments to a third party&mdash;the third party being usually an insurance company&mdash;to secure the advantage of retirement benefits.  The section treats that premium as income to the person concerned unless there is an approved scheme; if there is an approved scheme, then everything is all right.  In the absence of an approved scheme, the amount paid on behalf of the employee <Col N="771" /> is treated as remuneration and he will, therefore, have to pay income-tax on that amount.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2) deals with the position where there is an unfunded scheme.  In other words, the employer says to the employee: &ldquo;I will give you a pension when you reach 65 years.  I will give you two-thirds of your salary.&rdquo;  He does not make any provision with another person, an insurance company or anybody else. When the time comes the company itself will pay the pension and sub-section (2) is designed to put the employer and employee in the same position as if they had acted on their own; there is a notional premium taken and that is treated as being income received by the employee.</P>

The Minister took it that the sum would be paid to a third person.  I take it that is so.  There is no possible way in which it could be paid to the individual concerned.  No matter to whom it is paid, the employee can still treat it as an insurance premium for that year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this section aimed at some existing practice which the Minister desires to control?  It seems to me <Col N="772" /> that the section is so complex and envisages so elaborate a procedure that there must be some practice in operation in commercial circles which the Minister is determined to bring under tax control.  Would I be unreasonable in suggesting that where that is the Minister's purpose&mdash;he has had an opportunity of discussing the pros and cons with the Revenue Commissioners who give him all the information as to the practices which it is thought desirable to abate&mdash;a Bill of this kind be accompanied by a White Paper setting out the type of practices which are in existence and which a section of this character is designed to abate?  The Minister sets out to explain this question and says that where a firm employs a person and says to that person: &ldquo;As from a certain date we will pay you a pension&rdquo;, the actuarial value of that pension will be determined and will be added to the person's taxable salary.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

It occurred to me, when I heard the Minister say that that if I wanted to avoid the Minister's taxation plan, I would say to my employee: &ldquo;Your salary is £500 a year till you are 65.  I shall not give you any pension but I shall employ you in perpetuity. Instead of being dismissed on your 65th birthday, you will simply continue as chief clerk emeritus. In your first quinquennium after 65, you will get £450; in your second quinquennium, you will get £400; and we shall bring it down gradually until you are 110, when you will get nothing at all, and in the meantime we shall assume one of us will die.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners may say: &ldquo;We shall not allow you to employ a centenarian,&rdquo; but my answer is, &ldquo;I elect to do so.&rdquo;  I could drive a horse and coach through that section, though it may, in fact, operate to stop the practice to which the Minister's legislation is directed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One way or the other.  I do not think the Deputy was present when I was explaining this.  Really, what we are trying to stop is this.  It very often happens in a private company that two or three wealthy directors do not want to take more salary at the present time because surtax would be too high.  They might like to put some of their money into a retirement scheme, but when it comes to retirement, they do not want to pay income-tax on the pension.  They convert it into a lump sum and we get no income-tax.  That is the practice we want to stop.</P>

    <P>As explained in my previous replies to the Deputy, figures in respect of vegetables other than potatoes, peas and onions, are not readily available. In regard to meat, the cost would depend on the cuts used which vary from day to day.  Further, much of the meat is bought in carcase form and, consequently, a retail price cannot readily be ascertained.  It is estimated, however, that in the case of adults, if all the meat of the dearer types and cuts were issued in any week, the <Col N="626" /> approximate cost at retail prices would be 4/6 and if all the meat of the cheaper types and cuts were issued the figure would be about 3/-.  The weekly cost would lie between these figures.  The cost in the case of children would be approximately within the same range.</P>
    <P>(b)  The estimated cost of weekly dietary scales of male and female nurses in Grangegorman Mental Hospital is as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Figures in respect of vegetables other than potatoes are not readily available and those in respect of meat vary according to the type and cut supplied. The costs shown for these items must, accordingly, be regarded as approximate.</P>
    <P>The average daily cost in each of the cases mentioned is one-seventh of the relevant weekly figure.</P>
