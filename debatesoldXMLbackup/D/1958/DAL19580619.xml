    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That Section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section yesterday we were discussing the question really under the amendment that had been moved by Deputy Haughey.  I wonder has the Minister <Col N="320" /> had time to consider the matter since last night?  I cannot see how under this section an employer who wishes to fulfil his proper legal obligations can avoid keeping the type of records that are not in any way necessary.  I cannot understand why it should be assumed that an employer would deliberately inflate expenses paid to his employee thereby losing 20/- when he would get back, by so doing, only 7/6 income-tax.  That proposition means that a man is budgeting all the time to lose 12/6 and I cannot conceive anybody doing that.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may, there is the other aspect of it.  In cases where vouched expenses are paid by an ordinary individual in business to someone not in partnership with him in any shape or form or by a company to someone not a director or shareholder of the company, surely the vouching of such expenses by the owner of the business is sufficient for the Minister?  It should be unnecessary to return such expenses separately.  It is not necessary from the Minister's point of view but, even if it were necessary from his point of view, the provision of a paragraph in the section by which an employer was bound to return any composite or compounded sum paid for expenses would achieve what the Minister has in mind equally well without imposing on employers the difficulty and the additional expense that this section will impose.  Employers would not mind so much the additional expense being imposed if they felt there was any point in it, but I cannot see any point in nine-tenths of the information that will be made available under this section.</P>

      <P>When we reported progress yesterday evening I was making the point&mdash;perhaps I should reiterate it in case I did not get it across very clearly&mdash;that when a trading company submits its accounts to the inspector of taxes, every heading in the profit and loss account is scrutinised by the inspector, and the expenses in relation to which Section 6 endeavours to get information must be included among those headings.  The inspector of taxes, as a matter of normal routine, looks for an analysis of any heading <Col N="321" /> which he thinks would contain the type of expenses envisaged in Section 6.  The Revenue Commissioners already have that machinery at their disposal for getting this information and it is a better type of machinery than that proposed here.  It is immediately aligned on the target.  I think that the existing system should be quite sufficient for the Revenue Commissioners, because, under it, they can get a perfectly clear picture of this whole matter.  For that reason, I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider the question, and, if he thinks that this must be included in some form, I suggest that he put in some limitation.</P>

      <P>I had an opportunity last night of studying the origin of this section.  It is, as Deputies are aware, a part of Section 105 of the Income-Tax Act of 1918, which was passed by the British Parliament. I was interested to know what became of it, as far as the British authorities were concerned, and I found that they amended it in 1939 by machinery on the same lines as we are suggesting here.  The same controversy took place in the House of Commons and the Chancellor of the Exchequer then said that he did not believe that all the terrible things forecast were going to happen.  He said on that occasion that he would give an undertaking that they could come back to him, if they found these things happening. However, they never came back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>They were interested in a much more important matter at that time&mdash;a war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been two wars since then and the section is still working in Britain, and there has been no great complaint.  In these matters, the Revenue Commissioners find from experience that they have to ask for many more powers than they intend to use.  The form which it will be proposed to serve on employers in this matter will be a prescribed form and it will be possible to exclude many of the irritating things to which employers might object, such as the inclusion of bus fares.  It would be impossible to put all these things into an Act of <Col N="322" /> Parliament, but in a prescribed form it would be easy to do it.</P>
      <P>I would ask Deputies to wait and see what the prescribed form is like. If there is any serious complaint then as to the conduct of the Revenue Commissioners in the use of this section, I shall be quite prepared to discuss the matter with Deputies.  There might be a difficulty in doing that formally, but I would be prepared to discuss it with them outside the House altogether.  I think they will find that what the Revenue Commissioners will be looking for will be perfectly reasonable.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that the number of income-tax payers here is about 120,000 or 140,000.  The Revenue Commissioners cannot possibly look for information where the major number of these employees are concerned.  They could not deal with all these matters. It is quite obvious that their intention is to get after the employers who are not straight and honest in their returns.  As far as the great majority of employers are concerned, the form will be drafted in such a way as to give them practically no trouble at all.  That is all I can say about it now.  I think there is undue anxiety about this section on the part of Deputies and that it will be found there will be no cause for complaint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct the Minister on one matter. There have been a great number of complaints in Britain about the whole abracadabra and about the trouble imposed on employers by these returns. It is said to be one of the things that is wrong with the whole code.  One of the things wrong with this Bill is that it assumes that our circumstances are exactly the same as those in Britain. Our circumstances are as different from those in Britain as chalk is from cheese.  The necessity to go into these matters in highly industrialised countries is completely different from the necessity to go into them here.  I should like to see an acceptance of the fact that we are not a highly industrialised country as Britain is and that the approach to our system of taxation &mdash;I am not referring to the taxation itself&mdash;should be different.  It is <Col N="323" /> because the approach to the machinery is exactly the same here and in Britain that I think this is one of the worst Finance Bills that has ever come before the House.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very simple section. Those who are in receipt of wound pensions and disability pensions under the Military Service Pensions Act are free from income-tax.  An increase was given to them in 1957 and that increase is dealt with in this section. We also say that in all future Acts this increase is covered so there will be no need to bring in this amendment every time there is a difference.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 8 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (5), page 9, line 11, to delete &ldquo;at any time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment for the purpose of getting it clear as to whether there is any time limitation on the notice required under sub-section (5).  I think there should be some time limit and that it is not reasonable for the Revenue Commissioners to come along a considerable number of years afterwards.  Any reasonable time limit will satisfy me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This depends to a great extent on the persons concerned.  The Revenue Commissioners are not concerned with the time in this regard. The words in the section are copied word for word from a previous Act and it is for the person concerned to make application to the Revenue Commissioners. The sooner they do so, the sooner the matter will be dealt with. The removing of the words would not make an awful lot of difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (5) gives <Col N="324" /> the Revenue Commissioners power to require returns for the purposes of this section at any time.  They may require the returns to be made at any time.  Surely the Revenue Commissioners are not entitled to come along, eight years after a husband or wife thought that the income had been dealt with satisfactorily and under separate assessments, and ask for another return&mdash;not, as I understand it, of one's own income but of that of the other spouse&mdash;in circumstances where the husband and wife are separate? This section, as I understand it, covers cases where the husband and wife are not together, where they are geographically separate, whether because they are estranged or because the employment of the husband means that he is away at sea or something like that.  Surely the Revenue Commissioners cannot come along and by notice require a return to be made without any limit of time?  There must be some limit of time on it somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the position is that they are together, as far as being a married couple is concerned, but one of them is absent.  The return here is really to give the person the reliefs, so it is up to the person to make the return as soon as he can and then the Revenue Commissioners will deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister would take the trouble to read the sub-section just once.  This is a return which the Revenue Commissioners say is to be made within &ldquo;any time&rdquo;; and if it is not made, in case of the neglect or refusal to make it, or wilful delay in making any such return, all the penalties of the Income-Tax Acts are invoked.  What is the use of this House trying to discuss this Bill if we are to be misled in relation to explanations on it?  The section on its face is perfectly clear.  The Revenue Commissioners can ask a person to make a return, by notice.  If he does not make that return, he can be put in jail under the powers in the Income-Tax Acts. I suggest that in those circumstances it is outrageous to have no limit of time on the period over which such a return can be called for.  Whether the period should be stipulated in this Bill <Col N="325" /> or whether the period is already in some other Act, I do not know, but I want to know that there is a period somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This practically repeats what was in the Finance Act of 1920. The expression &ldquo;at any time&rdquo; is used in that Act.  As far as I can see and as far as I am advised, leaving out &ldquo;at any time&rdquo; would not make very much difference.  The Revenue Commissioners would proceed in the ordinary way, whatever that may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Revenue Commissioners ask for a return ten years after the year?  I think they can, as this section is phrased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am sure that they cannot, then I am quite happy to wait for the reference afterwards, but unless I am assured that they cannot ask for the return ten years afterwards, I must say this is an outrageous section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, the return is needed only for the purpose of apportioning reliefs between husbands and wives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, if that is all the return is needed for, we will delete lines 12 to 16 on Report&mdash;the lines which provide for penalties for neglect or refusal to deliver.  One should not penalise a man for refusing to deliver something that is entirely for his own benefit.  Either the explanation that it is entirely to his own benefit is incorrect, or the penalty clause can go, without any harm to the Revenue Commissioners. I will withdraw the amendment and will take the matter up on the Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Section 9 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (1), line 45, before &ldquo;give&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not later than <Col N="326" /> the year following that in which the tax became due&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is part of the same case, that we must have a time limit somewhere. The section provides that the Special Commissioners may, by notice, require the wife to pay tax out of her own income, even though it has been assessed on her husband; or, if she is dead, it may require her executors to do likewise.  I think it is essential to have some finality somewhere.  If the Special Commissioners wish to collect separately, apart from the ordinary process of collection, it should be limited to the year following the year of assessment.  I should be quite prepared to compromise on two years, if necessary, but there should be some finality in this.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to suggest that husbands do not always know what their wives have done or have not done, but it occasionally happens, at least in story books, that husbands think their wives had paid this tax, for example, and that years afterwards they get a shock at the breakfast table one morning by a letter from the Special Commissioners. In the interests of fairness of all sorts, there should be some time limit on that period.  There may be, in another section of the Bill, but I do not see it here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I do not think there is a time limit.  This section deals with the case where it is found that the husband is not paying or not able to pay, and the assessment is made on the wife, she having the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am sorry; I switched them around.  I said it was the husband who would get the shock at the breakfast table.  I should have said that it was the wife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment would have this effect, so far as I can make out.  Suppose it were to occur now, it would have to be paid by January, 1959.  That might be a dangerous provision, even from the point of view of the income-tax payer, himself or herself.  It might prevent the Revenue Commissioners from giving time or from saying they would accept payment in instalments.  On the whole, <Col N="327" /> I think it is better to leave things as they are.  I am not sure whether there is actually a limit.  I do not think there is, but I am not sure.  I suppose that, in practice, anyway, it may be taken that the Revenue Commissioners will try to get things going as quickly as they can, because of their interest in getting the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking of a particular case I know about, which occurred when this section was not there.  The wife died.  Her assessment had been made on her husband, as was proper, in accordance with the law. They were, in fact, estranged.  The husband had literally no assets and died three months after the wife.  The husband's estate was not sufficient to pay the tax due, though it paid some of it.  The wife's estate was not liable for it, as the law stood.  Now the wife's executors have distributed the wife's estate.  If there is no time limit, in that case, the Revenue Commissioners can serve a notice now on the executors and, even though they have distributed the assets, they would still be liable. That woman died eight years ago, in 1950.  There must be some time limit; otherwise, no executor could ever safely distribute any estate.  If the Minister would look into the question, that would do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The notice must be served within a certain time.  I think that would cover the Deputy's trouble there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us where the provision is about the serving of the notice?  I wonder is any time limit fixed for serving of notice under sub-section (1)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we must take Section 11 where the husband disclaims liability.  That, I think, would cover the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is only a small point, but should there not be an &ldquo;and&rdquo; at the end of paragraph (a) of sub-section (1)?  It is not in my copy at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="328" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several cases in the course of this Bill where I thought there should be an &ldquo;and&rdquo;. Apparently it is left out all the way along and where there are several subparagraphs, only one &ldquo;and&rdquo; is put in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding subsections (3) and (4), I think this is only a matter of drafting, but it would seem to me that sub-section (3) should contain some reference to sub-section (4) (b) because sub-section (3) says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a notice is given under sub-section (1) of this section, tax up to the amount required to be paid by the notice shall cease to be recoverable under the original assessment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In fact, sub-section (4) (b) goes on to state a way in which tax will again become recoverable under the original assessment.  It would seem that sub-section (4) (b) should come into it and that in sub-section (3) there should be some such phrase as &ldquo;subject to the provisions of sub-section (4) (b) herein&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think the way it works is that the husband has already got an assessment.  Now, they go to the wife and assess her and take that amount off the husband's assessment; but if they do not succeed in getting it from the wife, they come back to the husband and say: &ldquo;We must get it from you.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (3) states clearly and without qualification that where notice is given under the sub-section tax shall cease to be recoverable under the original assessment. Sub-section (4) (b) shows quite clearly that it creates a position where tax becomes again recoverable under the original assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I understood this sub-section, but if I heard the Minister's explanation correctly, I find that either I did not understand it at all or the explanation is not correct. I understood that the effect of <Col N="329" /> sub-section (3) was that the Revenue Commissioners, if they wanted to avail of sub-section (1), had to exercise an option and the option they exercised was to collect from the wife and that the effect of sub-section (3) was that if they required £x of the assessment to be paid by the wife under sub-section (1), then, I thought as I read the sub-section, they could not go back to the husband for that £x.  But the Minister has just said that if they are unable to collect from the wife, they can go to the husband again.  I do not think that is so.  I think they can go back only in the event of a change in the actual assessment itself, in the quantum of the assessment, but if some assessment which is made on the husband is correct for income in the sum of £1,000 and if in the make-up of that income £500 is the wife's and £500 is the husband's, once the Revenue Commissioners serve notice under sub-section (1) of the section to collect tax on the wife's £500 from the wife, I do not think they can go back afterwards, if they do not get it from the wife, and collect it from the husband.  If I am wrong in that, what does sub-section (3) mean?</P>

      <P>The sub-section is dealing with the original amount being altered on appeal.  Naturally, if the original assessment is altered in the total amount, the divided amounts will be altered also, but all I am concerned with is the position regarding sub-sections (3) and (4).  I think there is a clear contradiction between them. It is only a matter of phraseology or drafting, but I feel that sub-section (3) is in clear contradiction of sub-section (4) (b).

      <P>The Minister said that in relation to the question of a time limit under Section 10, we should first discuss Section 11.  I accept that in regard to cases where the husband is the moving party because then the position is that the husband is the moving party under Section 11; but where the Revenue Commissioners are the moving party, I do not think Section 11 operates at all.</P>

      <P>I think, where the Revenue Commissioners are the moving party, they move solely under Section 10 and not with any reference to Section 11.  Therefore, I do not think it is quite correct to say that the time limit imposed in Section 11 always covers Section 10.  It does not; it covers it in only one case.  I think there should be <Col N="331" /> some time limit in relation to those cases in which the Revenue Commissioners are the moving party.  Otherwise, the position will be, as I said, in Section 10.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>Why should the husband be bound to give the names of the woman's executors if he does not know them?  As I understand this situation, it can arise that he does not know.  He must serve two months from the date of the grant. If the grant has been issued, the probability is that he will know.  If it is a grant of probate he probably will know.  If it is a grant of administration with the will annexed he probably will know.  If it is a grant of intestacy, he must know.</P>
      <P>What worries me is this.  Suppose no grant is taken out to the wife's estate. Suppose he knows he will not get any interest.  Suppose his wife told him long ago that she was leaving him nothing, that she had made a will and that it was no business of his.  They may be living together from the point of view of tax assessments, which is all that line 50 means.  What happens in that case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the husband knows or if it is reasonably possible for him to find out, I entirely agree he should give the information required by sub-section (2). <Col N="332" /> However, I think there will be cases&mdash; not many&mdash;in which he does not know. I want to provide for such a case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is more reasonable to put that onus on the husband rather than on the Revenue Commissioners. He should know more about it than they.  As sub-section (1) is drafted here, he could not proceed without first serving notice on the administrators, and so on, that he would do this.  If the Deputy feels the House would agree with his amendment, I suggest he could bring in a consequential amendment.</P>
      <P>It is reasonable to expect that the husband would know the administrators of his wife's estate.  This is a new concession.  He has not that right at the moment.  The concession now is that he may, in certain circumstances, have the amount collected from his wife's estate.  I think we are entitled to say: &ldquo;Find out, first of all, who the executors are.  Then make the necessary application to the Revenue Commissioners. Then the matter can be fixed up, probably.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I have explained my point sufficiently.  It is my fault on this occasion and not the Minister's.  In the case of an executor, the husband, shall we say, knows that the will is in existence, knows that he has no interest in it, as he was told so by her, and knows where the will is.  He still probably&mdash;even though the grant has not been taken out&mdash;could get whoever has custody of the will to give him a copy of it.  He would have no right to get it but it would be very unlikely that he would be refused a copy.</P>
      <P>Take a case where, similarly, there is a will.  An executor is appointed. The executor predeceases the testatrix. The husband has no interest under that will.  He cannot tell who will take out the grant.  It will be a legatee's grant by one of the legatees, probably.  If the grant had been taken out, certainly he would know.  I agree that, when he does know, it is right and proper that he should give that information to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case I am thinking of, he cannot serve the notice under sub-section (1) because he does not know who will <Col N="333" /> take out the grant nor can he give the information under sub-section (2) because, similarly, he does not know who is taking out the grant.  The residue may be divided between five nephews. He cannot tell who will take out administration with the will annexed. This section, therefore, is completely inoperative for him until somebody other than himself does something.</P>
    <P>This section is framed more for the type of case where, though husband and wife are together, their property will go in different directions after their death.  There should be some provision that it would be sufficient for the husband to furnish the Revenue Commissioners with a copy of the will, if there is a will, or, in the event of intestacy, with such information as he has regarding the next-of-kin and who would be entitled to take out the grant.</P>
    <P>There are certain other sections on which I think we might get more assistance from the Minister.  This is frightfully technical.  I do not expect the Minister to follow it totally.  It will be sufficient for me if the points I have raised are examined by the technicians between this and the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 13, but in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section 1 (c) of Section 35 of the Finance Act, 1941 (No. 14 of 1941) is hereby amended by the substitution of £5,000 for £2,500 wherever the latter figure occurs.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give some measure of relief from corporation profits tax to small and medium-sized business concerns.  As the Minister is aware, the exemption limit for corporation profits tax was £10,000 from 1926 to 1930 at a rate of 5 per cent. In 1931, it was reduced to £5,000 and the rate increased to 7½ per cent., and in 1941, it was reduced to the present limit of £2,500 and the rate increased to 10 per cent. I submit, with the depreciation in the value of money over the past 18 years, that a figure of £5,000 now is only barely comparable with £2,500 in 1940.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual measure of relief is a small one when the fact is taken into consideration that corporation profits tax is allowable as an expense in computing income-tax, so that the actual improvement of £250, that is 10 per cent. on the increased sum of £2,500, must be reduced by the allowance which is claimed, and is set off for income-tax purposes, of £80 or £90. Therefore, the actual increased relief <Col N="335" /> would be a net amount of £170 or £180, looked at from that point of view, but it does mean something to a small or medium-sized business.</P>
    <P>On all sides of the House, we at least pay lip service to the desire to maintain the family concern as an integral part of our commercial set-up here, and we do know that over the years there has been a tendency for the smaller business to go out, to become amalgamated, or to be taken over by the larger concern.  It is in order to offset that tendency to some small degree that I put down this amendment.  The fact that the value of money has depreciated over the years is recognised in the ordinary income-tax laws.  The exemption limit for an individual for income-tax purposes has been increased from £150 in 1946 to £240, which is the present limit, or double what it was just over 12 years ago.</P>
    <P>In computing income-tax, if a company makes a loss in one year, it can carry that loss forward to a second year, but that does not apply when computing corporation profits tax. Again, if a company does not become liable for corporation profits tax, if its profits are less than £2,500, it cannot carry forward, so to speak, the unused credit into a subsequent year when its profits may be substantially in excess of the present limit of £2,500.  Again in computing corporation profits tax, no allowance is given for the rateable valuation of premises.  If a company owns a premises, the valuation of which is £400, that is allowable for income-tax purposes but not for corporation profits tax purposes.  Yet again, directors' remuneration in excess of £1,500 is allowable for income-tax, but not for assessing corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the main type of company or concern which I am anxious to try to help by this modest measure is the small, medium-sized firm which is finding acquisition of capital and accumulation of capital for expansion purposes so difficult to-day, and it is for that reason primarily I put down this amendment, which I hope will be acceptable to the Minister. <Col N="336" /> I think everybody is agreed it is a self-evident fact that the value of money has depreciated more than the suggested increase of 100 per cent. in the exemption limit which I suggest in my amendment, and I think the increase from £2,500 to £5,000 is a very reasonable suggestion, having regard to the depreciation of money, and to the increase in all other expenses, which is recognised by the increase in various allowances given under the income-tax code.</P>
    <P>That depreciation in the value of money has also been recognised in the increases given in salaries and wages generally over the past 18 years.  That is all I wish to say on the subject, except to appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.  I had some difficulty in fitting this into the Finance Bill, but I do not know of any other measure to which it can be related.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will accept it and agree to insert it as a section following on Section 12 of Part 1 of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the difficulty with all suggestions like that which Deputy Russell is now putting forward is that they are all very advisable, but are they feasible?  The cost of this would be about £200,000 which we cannot afford to forgo at the present moment.  Anyway, I think we have been going in another direction with industries and companies in the past three or four Finance Acts.  Very big concessions have been made in other ways, like increased initial allowances, increased wear and tear allowances, industrial buildings allowances and the concessions on profits from exports. These are all costing a fair amount of money, but I suppose Deputy Russell would be inclined to answer me that these concessions are much more important to the bigger companies than to the smaller ones.  I suppose, on the whole, they are, but, on the other hand, if we take a small company which has a profit of £4,000 or £5,000, the relief of £2,500 is a big proportion of that.  It is not so very big for big companies, but it is very big for the small ones.  The Deputy has argued for relief for small companies but the big companies would get it also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> I have to come down to the same argument in the end, that we cannot afford it at this moment.  Anyway, even if we could, I should be more inclined to give benefits in the direction we have been going, namely, to give more on the expenses side of industry than to give it on this side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has pointed out, it is essentially the larger businesses that tend to benefit from the new trend in concessions, in allowances and grants, but the type of business I am interested in is the old-established family business, the small company that either does not desire to avail of these, or its type of business does not suit it to avail of them.  The strongest argument the Minister has put forward is that he cannot afford to lose £200,000, and I wonder is that a misplaced argument.  There is the question that he cannot afford to lose £200,000, but, at the same time, he is prepared to shut his eyes to a trend that has been taking place over the years, and which will continue to take place, unless something practical is done to check it.</P>
      <P>As the Minister says, the bigger companies would also enjoy this concession. That is quite true, but the concession of £250, less the set-off against income-tax, would be a very small proportion of a big company's profits, whereas £180 or £200 to a small company would be very welcome.  It is just a question of whether we want the present trend to continue, or whether we want to help the type of company I have in mind.  If the Minister says that he cannot afford £200,000, all other arguments are purely academic in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>We all genuinely contribute to the opinion that it is desirable to maintain the small business, particularly in our type of economy.  I would ask the Minister to consider the matter with the experts in his Department to see if some measure of relief can be given to this type of company other than the grants and allowances about which he talked a few minutes <Col N="338" /> ago and which he admitted are mainly availed of by the larger concerns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed the opinion here before that I should like to do anything possible to maintain these small family and private companies because they are a very important factor in our economic position.  On that occasion we were dealing with credit and I did make them eligible in that Bill for credit which, I was informed by Deputies, they found it hard to get at that time.  We did provide that, at any rate, and I would certainly always keep in mind, if any concession were being given to industry, that it is most important to maintain these small family and private industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I say that is that I can remember that only last night the Minister for Finance made the most extraordinary statement ever made by any Minister for Finance in this House.  He said last night that the trend in that direction in relation to exports, which he mentioned a minute ago particularly, had been started by me, that he did not approve of it himself and that, unfortunately, he was not able to carry his own colleagues with him in relation to the trend.  Now he is saying to-day that it is a trend of which he approves.  I wish the Minister would make up his mind which he wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>There is the other concession that the Minister has been <Col N="339" /> talking about&mdash;that they had been given the same opportunity to accumulate capital.  That is primarily to help firms to accumulate capital rather than go to the sponsored companies for loans.  I think, personally, that it is better policy to allow a company to accumulate capital out of its own resources than to say that we shall not allow them to accumulate capital by giving them concessions but that there is a semi-State body which will give them a loan at 6 per cent. or 7 per cent. It is a question as to which is the better policy, whether it is better to put the onus on the family business concerned.</P>

      <P>It is a small point but it takes some explanation.  I must go back to the Anglo-Irish trade negotiations of 1938.  There was a provision there, as Deputies will remember, that cars over £750 would be allowed in on a duty of 22 two/ninths per cent.  Cars under £750 could be taxed as far as <Col N="340" /> that is concerned higher than 22 two/ ninths per cent.  In fact, the ordinary duties on an assembled car were 33½ per cent. on chassis and 50 per cent. on the body.  In the 1948 agreement the £750 was raised to £1,300 but, although the duty was changed, the quota still remained.  There was a quota of cars allowed in between £750 and £1,300.  Paragraph (f) put on the restriction that it must not be higher than a seven-seater.  It was to exclude what one might call small buses.  In fact, I believe that in recent years there are only about 20 or 22 cars in this category coming in each year and some of them are of the small bus type. They are coming in as prototypes to assemblers here.  The assemblers asked to have this restriction removed.  The Department of Industry and Commerce say that they see no objection to it because the limit is 22 per year.  There may be a few of them which are over seven seats.  The Department of Industry and Commerce see no objection to the concession being given.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 16 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1956 (No. 22 of 1956), as from the passing of this Act the rate of entertainments duty on dances or balls shall be payable by means of an annual licence or fee based on the capacity or location of each dance hall, the amount of such licence or fee not to exceed 33? per cent. of the duty payable in any case under the said Section 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is fairly clear.  It is to provide an alternative means of securing revenue from dance halls or ballrooms to the present <Col N="341" /> assessment on patrons of dances or balls.  There is ample evidence that the revenue from this entertainment tax is declining.  In reply to a question of mine yesterday, the Minister intimated that since the Finance Act, 1956, there has been a substantial <i>pro rata</i> reduction in the entertainment tax collected by his Department. The tax was in effect for only eight months of the year ended 31st March, 1957 but taking it on the basis of 12 months the figure, which is not absolutely accurate, demonstrates my argument. The tax on that basis for 12 months would amount to £190,500.  The actual tax collected in the year ended 31st March, 1958 was £154,000, or a reduction of £36,500.  As every Deputy will affirm, there has been a considerable reduction in employment and in employment opportunities in the dance hall industry, particularly amongst musicians.  That, in turn, has affected ancillary businesses such as catering, transport, advertising, electrical business, and so on.</P>
    <P>Dancing is generally confined to the younger generation, the type of people who are emigrating to a greater extent than any other section of the population. There is the further point that when a musician becomes unemployed it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for him to find employment elsewhere in his own profession.  The outlets simply do not exist.  The instruments which these bands use are liable to heavy import duties or levies, and generally there has been an overall decline in dancing.  I am informed by proprietors of dance halls in different parts of the country that the number of days on which dances are held in their halls has been reduced, and they are now confined to week-ends and to specific days in the week.</P>
    <P>There is a further difficulty from the point of view of urban dance halls, that is, that they are asked to bear this tax when halls quite close to them, outside the urban boundary, or the borough boundary, as the case may be, are free of tax and, of course, the urban dance halls have to bear substantial rates and other charges.</P>
    <P>I asked the proprietor of a substantial ballroom in my constituency to give <Col N="342" /> me some figures regarding the decline in the admission takings over a period of some years.  Those figures are rather interesting and they do illustrate the general trend towards lower takings in dance halls.  From 1955 to 1956, there was a reduction of 12.8 per cent. and the reduction from 1955 to 1957 was 15.8 per cent.  From 1955 to date, there was a reduction of 48 per cent.  There has been an almost comparable decline in the amount of wages paid by that dance hall owner to musicians and staff. This question of entertainments tax is one that has been chopped and changed, as the Minister is aware, particularly in recent years.  The previous Fianna Fáil Government took off the tax and the inter-Party Government put it on again, and that in itself has caused a degree of uncertainty to dance hall proprietors and to anybody considering erecting a dance hall.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of the proprietors of dance halls, the musicians and others employed in the industry, there is another category which would be assisted by the Minister's acceptance of my alternative: dances held by charitable or philanthrophic organisations. As the Minister knows, at the moment there is an expenses limit of 50 per cent.  Most Deputies will be aware of the fact that in their own constituencies, charitable, or other worthy organisations, have held dances which have shown no profit, or they have just scraped through with a modest profit.  If their expenses, for one reason or another, have exceeded 50 per cent, they immediately become liable to tax.  If my amendment is accepted, that type of taxation would go.  I understand there are something like 570 or 580 dance halls and ballrooms in the Twenty-Six Counties.  If the Minister is agreeable to putting a licence, or fee on each hall, based on its size or geographical position, it will give a very useful regular income to the Exchequer.  At the same time, it would eliminate any possibility of evasion of the present entertainment tax which I think is not unknown.</P>
    <P>By and large, I would think that in present circumstances and having regard to the overall trend in the amount of entertainment tax collected by the Minister's Department, particularly <Col N="343" /> over the past four or five years, it would be more rational and sensible to collect the tax by means of a fixed levy, or licence based on the capacity of the ballroom, and its geographical position.  Or, perhaps the Minister can suggest an alternative measure rather than levying it on the admission charges, which are a declining source of revenue and which are open to certain abuses.</P>

      <P>The general idea underlying this amendment may be worth discussing, although naturally we could not make any changes for this year. Again, I must refer to the difficulty of giving this concession from the point of view of loss of revenue.  The Deputy gave a correct figure; the present yearly yield from this tax is about £150,000.  The Deputy's amendment would oblige us to arrange the tax so that there would not be more than one-third from any one dance hall. That would mean that you would cut it down to £50,000, and at the moment we could not face that.  It would be more convenient if a scheme of that type could be evolved, of taxing the hall rather than taxing the admission charges, and it would be more convenient for collecting the money.  The rates would have to vary according to location and on the basis of capacity of the dance hall.  It would be a very involved scheme to work out, but once worked out, I admit it would not be so involved in the collection of tax.  It is difficult to see how we could get £100,000 or even £50,000.  The Deputy gave a figure of about 500 dance halls&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It would not be so easy to get £100 or £200 from each of them, I am afraid, so that the scheme would not appear to be feasible.  I am attracted to a change from the present system and I give the Deputy an assurance that we will consider some flat rate rather than the present system, but it could not be done before the next Budget.</P>

      <P>From that point of view, I would have thought the idea of a fixed licence or fee, based as I suggested on location and size would yield a certain given income and the fact that we are getting £150,000 should not deter us from getting a substantial sum.  If the figure of one-third sounds rather too much, there is plenty of room for an increase.</P>

      <P>If the Minister can find a method of making a flat rate charge, I agree with him without question that it would be very much better.  I tried to see if I could find a method of getting what I wanted by a flat rate instead of by an admission tax, so to speak.  I am afraid the various suggestions for flat rate charges which came before me all had considerable objections, partly, perhaps, because if you tried to base it on capacity, you would be in the difficulty that the practice in relation to capacity for licences under the Dance Hall Acts varies tremendously all over the country.</P>
      <P>It would be very simple to operate it in certain parts of Leinster.  In certain parts of Leinster, a dance hall proprietor applies for a licence to have a dance hall for the year in which he may not have more than 500 people. It would be easy enough to have the flat rate in that case.  But in Donegal, for example, no such limiting figure is included in the licence.  I understand there is a different practice again in Cork.  It seems to me that it would be highly desirable to have the flat rate, but before one could adopt a flat rate principle, one would have to get the Department of Justice to make sure that there was some unified method of licensing rather than the individual one of different district justices. Perhaps the Minister will be able to succeed where I failed.</P>

      <P>Before Section 19 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In this section &ldquo;the Act&rdquo; means the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952 (No. 24 of 1952).</P>
      <P>(2)  The following sub-section shall be inserted immediately after sub-section (11) of Section 1 of the Act:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(11A)  In such cases and subject to such conditions as the Minister for Local Government may prescribe by regulations&mdash;</P>

    <P>(ii)  in the case of a vehicle to which, by virtue of the operation of paragraph 3 of Part II of the Schedule to this Act, subparagraph (c) of paragraph 4 of Part I of the Schedule applies&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  it is used in a condition or manner or for a purpose which, or</P>
    <P>(II)  the person who took out the licence has an occupation which</P>
    <P>would, if it had been shown at the time of the taking out of the licence that it was used in that condition or manner or for that purpose or that that person had that occupation, have rendered it chargeable with duty at a rate higher than that at which duty has been paid, and</P>
    <P>(4)  The following paragraph shall be substituted for paragraph 3 of Part II of the Schedule to the Act:&mdash;</P>
    <P>3. (1)  Where, apart from this paragraph, subparagraph (c) of paragraph 4 of Part I of this Schedule would apply to a vehicle, that subparagraph shall not apply to it (and subparagraph (d) of that paragraph shall apply to it accordingly) unless the person taking out the licence shows to the satisfaction of the licensing authority either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that his only or chief occupation is farming and that the vehicle is used only occasionally on public roads and then only&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> (i)  for the haulage of the produce of his farm and articles required for the farm, including the farmhouse and farm buildings, but excluding the haulage of fuel if being transported as a commodity for sale, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  for the haulage of similar goods for another farmer, provided that such goods are not hauled for reward, or</P>

    <P>(II)  separated milk being hauled from a creamery cream-separating station, or</P>

    <P>(iv)  for the haulage of live stock for reward, and that the live stock&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  are owned by a person resident not more than two miles from the haulier's residence,</P>
    <P>(II)  are being hauled to or from a farm from or to a live-stock auction mart or a place where a market or fair specified by Order made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Transport Act, 1958, is held,</P>
    <P>(III)  are being hauled only on the day on which such auction, market or fair takes place, and</P>
    <P>(IV)  are not being hauled in either direction on any part of a public road which is more than 20 miles by public road from the haulier's residence, or</P>
    <P>(b)  that he is a contractor engaged to do agricultural work on a farm and that the vehicle is used on public roads only for the haulage of articles required by him for the purpose of doing that work.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a farm is carried on as part of or in connection with&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a hospital, sanatorium, convalescent home or similar institution,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> (b)  a mental institution within the meaning of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945 (No. 19 of 1945),</P>
    <P>(c)  a monastery, convent or similar institution, or</P>
    <P>(d)  a college, school or similar institution,</P>
    <P>the person carrying on the farm shall be regarded for the purposes of this paragraph as being a person whose chief occupation is farming.</P>
    <P>(5)  If this Act is passed before or on the 1st day of July, 1958, sub-section (4) of this section shall come into operation on that day and, if it is passed after that day, it shall be deemed to have come into operation on that day.</P>
    <P>(6)  The appropriate repayments shall be made having regard to the provisions of sub-sections (4) and (5) of this section and the repayments shall be made in accordance with such directions as may be given by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>This section amends the excise duties on vehicles in three respects.  In the first case, sub-section (2) would enable the Minister for Local Government to repay motor vehicle duties in prescribed cases in certain conditions. The Minister for Local Government has no power to refund any part of licences paid.  There are two particular cases he would like to deal with. The section gives him power to deal with any cases he might prescribe.  He intends to prescribe two particular types of cases.  The first is in regard to special tourist buses.  C.I.E. have found that their peak demand for these buses is over a short period; but the period, however, would mean they would have to tax the buses for three months and it would not pay them on that basis.  It was thought that the best way to deal with this position would be to tax the buses for three months and then to get a refund for the time the buses were off the road.</P>
    <P>The second case is where a man taxes his car in good faith but finds that, because of serious illness which may <Col N="350" /> be prolonged or because he may have to leave the country, he will not need the taxed car for the rest of the year. Provision will be made to refund the tax in such cases.  These are the two cases the Minister has in mind.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) deals with a doubt that has arisen in regard to the £8 tractor licence taken out by a farmer on his own farm.  The idea underlying the Act is that if a man takes out a certain tax on a vehicle and uses that vehicle for a purpose that would carry a higher tax, he is ordinarily bound to pay the higher tax, but it is not too sure if the drafting of the Act dealing with agricultural tractors covers this. It is to make that right and bring it into line with legislation generally.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) relates to a clause being inserted in the Transport Bill to-day by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Deputy Cosgrave knows this intimately.  I saw his name down to a similar amendment.  The clause being inserted in the Transport Bill is not sufficient to effect the concession proposed; it must be put in the Finance Bill so that the concession can be given.  A concession is being given to farmers who carry for reward, on behalf of their neighbours in their own tractors and trailers, live stock to a fair, market or a sale and this provision gives sanction for that.</P>
    <P>Sub-sections (5) and (6) refer back to sub-section (2).  If this Bill is passed before 1st July, well and good, but if not, the concession with regard to the buses and so on could be back-dated to 1st July in anticipation of the Bill being passed.</P>

      <P>There is only one point on which I wish to have some information.  Sub-section (4), 3. (1) (a) stipulates &ldquo;that the only or chief occupation is farming and that the vehicle is used only occasionally on public roads.&rdquo;  Would that cover a case in which a farmer has land some distance away from the home farm?  He might be going every day to that second farm for a period and he might not then use the vehicle again for, say, a month or six months.

When the contract came up for renewal, it was not renewed.  This firm would have no use for that vehicle except in regard to this one contract.  Would they, on proof that their contract had been lost and they had, therefore, no use for this type of vehicle, come within the scope of this section?  Would that be an exceptional type of case to which this section would apply?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section which does a variety of things, one of which is to make the levies permanent <Col N="353" /> customs duties.  I am afraid I shall require a great deal of information in relation to this section.  First of all, I should like to say that I received yesterday the new print of the special import levies.  That print makes the situation a little easier of understanding, though I have not had as much time as I should have liked to study the print.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention, in particular, to page 9, references 566 and 567.  On the Second Stage of the Finance Bill I asked the Minister to make clear beyond question the position in relation to refund&mdash;I do not know whether it should be called a drawback in relation to levies as well as to customs duties&mdash;in the case of newspapers coming in here which had borne a special import levy and were then returned unsold.  I mentioned this on the Second Stage because the Minister had made the newsprint tax permanent and the matter appeared to be one which should receive more attention than might have been necessary if the tax were of a temporary nature.  I do not think I got any definite statement from the Minister.  Perhaps he had not sufficient time when concluding.</P>
      <P>This is a matter that we must have clear before this section goes through. I must confess that I have found considerable difficulty so far as these duties are concerned in understanding why one type of duty has been deleted and another type has not.  I do not understand why, so far as bed warmers are concerned, warming pans should bear a special import levy at a rate of 40-60 per cent. and metallic bed warmers should only bear a duty at a rate of 25-37½ per cent.  The pattern of the levy, as a result of the various amendments made by the Minister, is one very difficult of interpretation. Coffee grinders, for example, appear to have been freed from levy unless they are wanted for domestic use.  If a shop wants to buy a coffee grinder it can bring it in without levy; if any of us wish to buy a small coffee grinder for domestic use, then it is subject to levy in accordance with the pattern laid down by the Minister now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, non-domestic convector <Col N="354" /> heaters are free of levy; domestic convector heaters are subject to 25 per cent. or 37½ per cent. levy.  A commercial dishwasher is free of levy, but if one brings a dishwasher into one's home for the purpose of easing the domestic difficulties of one's wife, one has to pay a levy on it.  Domestic dryers are subject to levy but non-domestic dryers are allowed in without any levy.  A domestic fan, whatever that is, is subject to levy; a non-domestic fan is free of levy.  That is the pattern all the way through and I shall give only a few more examples, some of which are completely impossible to understand.  If a person installs an electric immersion heater in his hot water system, he has to pay a levy of 25 per cent, or 37½ per cent., because it is classed as a domestic immersion heater; if a non-domestic immersion heater is installed, there is no levy on it at all.</P>
    <P>This is not a question of protection. The levy was never intended as a protective tariff.  In fact, it was made clear beyond question that not merely was it never intended as a protective tariff, but that it was being imposed in circumstances deliberately outside that basis for the purposes of trade balance considerations.</P>
    <P>Domestic radiators are subject to levy but non-domestic radiators bear no levy.  Although commercial refrigerators are free of levy, domestic refrigerators are subject to either 40 per cent. or 60 per cent., as the case may be.  A non-domestic toaster is free of levy but a domestic toaster to ensure that the Minister can have some toast for his breakfast in the morning carries a levy of 25 per cent. or 37½ per cent.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the basis upon which the selection has been made.  In every case where the article is to be used for the home the levy has been retained, and in all the cases I have mentioned, where the article is not being used in the home, no levy is chargeable.  That is discrimination which is impossible to justify.  I am not quite clear whether some of the other customs duties are included in this, but I think all the duties that were in Order No. 92 of 1958 are included in this section and are confirmed <Col N="355" /> by this section.  I want to know whether these are intended to be protective or revenue duties.  Reference No. 12 in the First Schedule to the Imposition of Duties (No. 28) Order, S.I. No. 92, of 1958, says: &ldquo;A domestic or household article of porcelain, china or other kind of pottery which does not exceed 5/- in value and which is glazed or unglazed or is vitrified or unvitrified of any of the following descriptions...&rdquo;  The descriptions are all set out and these articles carry a duty of 1/6 full rate and 1/- preferential for each article.</P>
    <P>Is that intended to be a protective or a revenue duty?  If it is intended to be a protective duty, that is all right, but we should like to know what is being protected.  If it is intended to be a revenue duty, I want to make it clear to the Minister that the effect of that part of the section will be that he will get no revenue at all.  There used to be a levy in relation to those articles on another basis.  I tried to get from the Minister the revenue that had been obtained from it, but he was unable to give me that information because the items were not segregated.  These items were probably included in the old list on page 14 under reference No. 630 in which the previous duty was 25 per cent. or 37½ per cent., as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The duty now being imposed of 1/6 an article will not be paid.  It will have the effect of complete exclusion of the articles in question.  That may be a good thing, in the Minister's opinion, but if the duty is being imposed for the purpose of complete exclusion, let us be told so, so that the people who are concerned in that type of import business will know exactly where they stand.  It may be from the balance of payments point of view that the Minister has made up his mind he wants to exclude this type of imports, but if he is doing it from the point of view of collecting revenue, he will get no revenue on this basis and he would have got far more revenue if he had retained the old basis.</P>
    <P>I should like also to know what is the situation in respect to any of these duties confirmed in this section in relation <Col N="356" /> to goods in transit at the time the Orders were made.  Were licences given in any case for the import of any such goods free of levy, or free of duty because they were in transit at the time the Order was made, or because irrevocable letters of credit had been opened?</P>
    <P>I have already made my view crystal clear in relation to the change by the Minister of the levies from temporary impositions to permanent taxation.  I do not think it can be stressed sufficiently often that if we run into balance of payments difficulties in the future, the Minister has, by his own act, made the fiscal levy weapon no longer available to him or to any other Minister. The effect of weaving the levy procedure into the permanent customs code would mean that in future physical control would have to be utilised, if the situation arose, rather than the fiscal deterrent.  That would be highly undesirable and difficult to administer in practice and would open up a vista which I shudder to contemplate.  I think the Minister made his greatest mistake in doing what he did because he threw away the weapon and because, if he had maintained the levies in their temporary condition, in respect of the capital programme, he would have been able to reach on certain capital and desirable things that he will not be able to reach on without the capital that has now been turned into current revenue.</P>
    <P>It is undesirable that the new list of the levies was made available to Deputies only in the last couple of days.  Therefore, we have not had all the opportunity one would wish for considering how they work out before this section goes through the House. Having only received my tariff supplement in the last couple of days, I will, if I find it necessary on fuller examination of that supplement, put down amendments to the section on the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the general question as to why certain articles, if used for domestic purposes, have to pay duty and, if not, are exempt, I have already stated that when these were first imposed by my <Col N="357" /> predecessor, Deputy Sweetman, the intention was to charge the final domestic consumer but, as far as possible, not to increase the cost for hotel keepers and others who had to compete in the tourist trade.  Many of those I have left as they are and, although we have about two-thirds in the value of yield removed or changed over to the revenue or protection side, the idea still persists to some extent that the charges should remain on the consumer and that they should not be levied on the hotel keeper or trader where competition is necessary.</P>
      <P>I have been asked about foreign newspapers.  They pay a levy coming in, but if there are any copies unsold, they get a refund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about that. The question was also raised regarding goods in transit and the practice is that if goods are in transit when a levy is put on, they get the benefit of the lower levy.  As regards china ware, that is one of the cases where the heads were changed.  The duties on these were put on with the object of giving protection to the china industry. If there is no receipt from these duties, it does not matter because it is not considered a revenue duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not be aware of it, but the Department of Industry and Commerce has stated that it is not a protective but a revenue duty.  I am glad that the Minister has categorically cleared up the position in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was some mistake about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>People often like to push the responsibility on to the other fellow.  The Minister dealt with the question of bed warmers, but why are the metallic ones and the warming pans dealt with at a different rate?  I am not very happy regarding the explanation the Minister has given in regard to that matter.  It does not seem to me that he has given a complete <Col N="358" /> answer to the point I raised and I will deal with it by questions on specific duties when they come before the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to the levy on newsprint, as long as the newsprint levy was only a temporary thing, no matter how inconvenient it might be to certain people and how much it imposed a hardship on them, it could always be changed.  My anxiety in the matter was to have less newsprint used in the country.  I had to do that for the purpose of ensuring that we paid out less money for things which we could manage without.  The imposition of the newsprint levy did cause a shrinkage in the size of newspapers, but that was a shrinkage that was unavoidable in order to assist us in getting out of our difficulties.</P>
      <P>Now that is all past.  Now we have a situation in which something entirely new operates.  Now we have a permanent newsprint customs duty imposed only for revenue purposes.  There could be no question of an element of protection in relation to newsprint, as none is made in this country.  It is a revenue duty and nothing else.</P>
      <P>Side by side with that duty, there is a levy in relation to imported newspapers. The home paper, the paper that is produced here, pays its permanent revenue duty on the newsprint that comes in before the paper is made up.  The foreign paper which is imported does not have to pay that duty. It has to pay a levy when it is brought in; but if it is in the position of being able to get the levy refunded on its unsold copies, is it not by that in a position to compete unfairly with the home-produced paper which has already paid its duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would be well advised to examine that aspect of the situation and to see whether it would not be fairer to the home papers to provide, in relation to levy, that a proportion only of the levy would be returned on unsold papers.  It might not be desirable that the full levy should be charged on unsold returns of foreign newspapers, but there should be some stipulation which would make it clear that the foreign paper which was being brought in could not, on a sale and <Col N="359" /> return basis, compete on terms unfavourable to the home paper, now that he has made the newsprint duty a permanent revenue duty.  It is a matter which would require some effort to work out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not all in proportion. The duty on the foreign paper is far higher than that which the home produced paper has to pay on newsprint.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 20, but in Part III, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1956 (No. 22 of 1956) shall not apply in respect of any death which occurs after the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment I have put down for the purpose of correcting something which I did and what I now feel was a mistake.  When I introduced the Finance Act in 1956, I incorporated in it a provision that, in certain circumstances, the estates of people dying would not have to pay the full death duties, if they held part of their estate in Irish industrial investments.  The definition of Irish industrial investments was that contained in Section 7 of the Finance Act of 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 21 of the Finance Act of 1956, if a person held Irish industrial investments to which the Finance Act of 1932 applied, either from the time such investments were originally offered to the public or for a period of three years before that person's death, then those investments ranked only at two-thirds their value for <Col N="360" /> estate duty purposes.  The purpose of that section, which was included in that Finance Act, was to endeavour to give an additional fillip to Irish industrial development.  There already was a fillip there by reason of the fact that a 20 per cent. remission of the income-tax and surtax in respect of such investments was granted.  I was anxious to include a death duty remission on the same basis and, therefore, the investments to which the section applies carry only two-thirds of the normal death duties.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Finance Act of 1932 has been very much extended in its scope by the Minister during the past 15 months.  In the light of that, I think it is undesirable that the restriction in relation to estate duty, which was imposed by me in the 1956 Act, should remain. It is undesirable that it should be necessary now for a person to hold in his estate such industrial investments for a period of three years before his death or since the investments were first offered.  One of the reasons I feel it is a mistake to continue that restriction is that we have not got a sufficiently fluid market in Irish industrial shares.</P>
    <P>The cost of any such amendment as this to the revenue will be quite infinitesimal, but it would make for a certain greater fluidity and mobility of ownership of industrial shares.  If the effect of wiping out the restriction means that people would consider the purchase of these shares from the point of view of having them in their portfolio at the date of their death, then anything like that, which would create an interest and mean that the shares would be quoted more often or dealt with more often on the stock exchange, would be very desirable, indeed. It would effect an interest which would not merely improve the position of the existing shares but would go far to create a climate in which other industrial issues could be successful in the future.</P>
    <P>I know that the objection from the revenue standpoint will be that people who are coming near the end of their time will organise their affairs by holding largely this type of share. Even if they do that, it will have the <Col N="361" /> effect of creating the interest and creating the market.  The additional cost that could ever arise to the revenue would be trifling, compared with the benefit which will arise.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to relax a restriction which I myself imposed.  I think I was, at that time, in the situation that I said the Minister was in yesterday&mdash;that I could not see the wood for the trees.  Frequently that happens in regard to certain matters until one has an opportunity of standing back and looking at them.  Candidly, I feel now that if I were in 1956 in my present frame of mind, I would not have bothered with the section at all if I had to include sub-section (3).  I think it would be better if the sub-section were taken out at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I should be much more inclined to agree with the Deputy in his first attempt at this in 1956 than with his attitude now.  The object is to create, or build up, a market here for Irish securities by inducing people to invest in them so that they will get an income-tax concession which is there already.  This concession was given for death duties in 1956.  The concession for death duties is much bigger, or can be much bigger, than it is for income-tax.  Perhaps I am not altogether right in that, but it can be big, in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is right.  One is one-third and the other, one-fifth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from that, there is a sort of a cumulative effect.  When the estate is being valued, Irish securities are valued at two-thirds so that they bring the estate down to a lower category where the amount to be paid over all is less in that way, and it may be a very big concession.  The object of the concession, as I say, was to create a market for Irish securities.  I do not think we should pay here where a person comes in at the very end&mdash;an executor or whoever it may be, the person acting for the dying person, as it were&mdash;to buy up Irish securities in order to get this very big relief in death duty.  To some extent, it would be defeating the object of the section as passed in 1956 and I must say I would much prefer to leave things as <Col N="362" /> they are.  I do not know exactly what objection the Deputy has to the present position.  I could not quite grasp it from his argument.  He said he thought it preferable to remove that concession, but I do not know why.  I do not know if there is any really good argument for removing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will find if he makes inquiries that one of the real difficulties in relation to Irish industrial securities is that they are held too long.  There is no changing ownership in them.  They are always bought to hold and in consequence of that, none is being offered on the market, either for sale or purchase. The person who subscribed to Irish industrial issues in the past holds them virtually unchanged.  That is one of the reasons why there is more interest in British securities&mdash;because there are varying prices.</P>
      <P>If the Minister took up the stock exchange price list of Irish industrial securities, I venture to say that he would find at least half the quotations on any particular day are quotations a month old; in other words, there has been no dealing in 50 per cent. of the securities in the preceding month.  I am talking, of course, of industrial securities, not of gilt-edged stocks, and I think the Minister will find that is the situation.  That is bad.</P>
      <P>If there is that stagnation in regard to dealings, there will not be the atmosphere in which people will invest freely in industrial securities.  I appreciate that the effect of the deletion of sub-section (3) which my amendment proposes would mean that people would, perhaps, avail of this opportunity when very near the end of their days, but I think the loss involved by their doing so would be more than offset by the gain that would arise from an active market springing up in these securities, where the market does not exist at the moment.  If there was already an active market in industrial securities, then I would accept the Minister's argument completely, but there is not.  Anything we can do to create and foster that market is worth doing.  This is one of the ways in which it could be done and, if so, it is worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has to hand <Col N="363" /> any idea of the amount, say, in 1957-58, which this concession under the 1956 Act cost the revenue?  I imagine that the amount would be very small and, if so, we are dealing only with a trifling consideration.  I should like to know what was involved in 1957-58 both from the point of view of the straight deduction of the one-third of the duty concerned and from the effect of the 1956 Act method of valuation in putting the estate into a lower category.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 6, before &ldquo;payable&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;to the extent that it is allowable or is allowed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This section, as I understand it, deals solely with the double taxation relief for death duties.  If, under the double taxation arrangement we have with Britain, a person has some British assets, they are taxable for death duty purposes in Britain and estate duty is levied and paid in respect of them. When the estate duty is paid in Britain it is allowable here against Irish estate duty in so far as the Irish estate duty on those assets is concerned.  It may be that the estate duty chargeable and payable in Britain exceeds the Irish estate duty on the same assets. If it does, the excess is not allowable under the double taxation agreement. The effect of the Bill as it stands is that not merely is the excess not allowed under the double taxation agreement but it cannot be taken out as a foreign debt deductible from the assets in arriving at the duty payable here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can fully understand that it would be quite wrong for the law to contain a loophole by virtue of which people <Col N="364" /> would get their relief on the double, that they would, first of all, get relief set off against Irish estate duty under the double taxation agreement and secondly, that they would get the British duty not merely so allowed but also treated as a debt and therefore allowed in that way also.  It seems to me, however, that the excess is in a different category.  If a person has to pay more death duties in a foreign country than we charge here in respect of a particular asset, it is quite right that we should offset only for the amount which we would charge on that property, but should we not also allow him to deduct in the same way as he can deduct a foreign debt any excess in the duty?  Otherwise, it seems we are penalising the estate concerned and that they are having to pay double death duties on a certain portion of the assets involved.  I do not think we should aim at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Sweetman is aware, the section was brought in to deal with a certain doubt about our position at the moment.  The practice has been to assess the death duty on the total.  Let us take, for example, a man who has property worth £10,000 in England and who dies.  The British Government take whatever duty is appropriate on £10,000 and the Revenue Commissioners here also assess on the £10,000.  They do not assess on £10,000 less the £2,000 paid over to the British Government.  There was a doubt as to whether that was legal.  However, it was only a doubt. That action was taken to put the matter right.</P>
      <P>In practice, how does it come about? If the duty payable in England on that £10,000 is higher than it would be here, then no duty is charged here.  It is only where the duty charged there is lower than it would be here that the duty is collected here.  Therefore, I do not think there is any possibility of injustice being done to the estate of a dead person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman's amendment would have the effect that if the duty payable in England were higher than it would be here, we would have to forgo not only the duty here but pay the difference between what he would <Col N="365" /> pay here over to him.  We should have to subsidise him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Amendment No. 75 is entirely consequential on this amendment.  This part of the Act and, indeed, Part V also, is extremely complicated. They are parts that have caused some very considerable disquiet amongst certain sections of the business community.  It seems to those sections of the business community that they have been picked out for further <Col N="366" /> stringent taxation at a time when every one of us understood that the whole basis of income-tax was under discussion and consideration by the commission.</P>
      <P>Candidly, I am not in a sufficiently knowledgeable position to be able to judge whether some of the sections and new provisions incorporated in Part IV of the Bill are wise or unwise.  It was precisely because I felt from my own point of view and because Deputies also felt from their point of view that we were not competent to express opinions on a large amount of the highly detailed and highly technical income-tax code that the commission was set up to consider the matter.  It seems to me that this part of the Bill has been inserted as a deliberate attempt to jump the report of the Income-Tax Commission.  This whole part is framed on the basis that we are exactly the same here as they are in Britain.  Our circumstances in Ireland are entirely different from circumstances over there.</P>
      <P>These provisions that are included were originally included many years ago in Britain by a Socialist Government. Even the same Socialist Party in Britain now are prepared to agree that the provisions then incorporated do not work out at all satisfactorily in practice.  They were introduced, I think, partly in the post-war atmosphere when controls were the order of of the day, when there was a general viewpoint that regulations were inevitable and there was not the same critical examination of the regulation of people's lives as there would be to-day.</P>
      <P>All of us, I think, feel that what is needed in relation to income-tax if it is to be continued, leaving aside the wider question as to whether or not income-tax should be continued at all, is a simplification of the tax code.  Nobody could suggest under any circumstances that Part IV does anything to simplify the code.  On the contrary, it makes the code very much more complicated and will inevitably mean that there will be considerable time, trouble and difficulty in understanding exactly what is permissible and what is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume, in relation to this part of <Col N="367" /> the Bill, the Minister has been advised that a few people are getting away with evasion.  I cannot see, unless he has been so advised, that there is any reason for the introduction of this Part of the Bill.  I think that what he has been advised in that respect will be very much overborne by the general effect of the measure.</P>
    <P>I do not think the fact that two or three people get away with something justifies placing a very onerous responsibility and a very onerous burden on the business community as a whole. It seems to me that this is the very type of technical matter for which a commission, such as the Income-Tax Commission, should be utilised for examination.  No matter what experience or skill Deputies in this House may have in relation to the likely operation of Part IV, we are not competent to examine these provisions in the same way as the Income-Tax Commission would be competent to examine them. Frequently we have discussions here in relation to whether it is desirable that there should be in the tax code the easements which we think should be in it.  Several suggestions have been mentioned across the floor of the House during the past year and the Minister, in reply, said he thought it desirable that consideration of all those problems should be left over until the Income-Tax Commission had reported.  If that is so in relation to easements should it not also be so in relation to complications?</P>
    <P>In relation to complications, such as are introduced in Part IV of this Bill &mdash;complications which I venture to say very few people will be easily able to understand&mdash;should not these too be put back, just as easements may be put back, for consideration in the general setting of the commission's report as a whole?  I understand the Revenue Commissioners already have powers to investigate the expenses and perquisites charged by a body corporate for its employees and directors. I do not know why the existing powers have been deemed unsatisfactory, and I think we must get from the Minister a very much more clear picture of <Col N="368" /> what his purpose is if this part of the Bill is to be permitted to be enacted.</P>
    <P>I do not want, in relation to this first amendment, to go over the whole ambit of individual perquisites that may come into consideration.  What, for example, is to happen to the case of the ordinary shopkeeper, in a town in rural Ireland, who lives in the backroom behind his shop?  So far as I can see he is to be assessed now; he is to have an additional taxation assessment put on him in respect of the backroom living accommodation.  That assessment will be put on him even if he does not use the backroom as a residence, but keeps it for the purpose of having his lunch there with, perhaps, a couple of daughters who may be attending the vocational school up the street.  That type of assessment will now be made if Part IV of the Bill comes into operation. The large firm that is big enough to have a canteen will escape but the small firm, the small business of the type I suggested, will be involved in additional administrative costs and, I think, additional taxation.</P>
    <P>The other day I was talking to a man who is the chairman of a factory in this country and who had just returned from abroad where he had been endeavouring to get new export business. In relation to one of his lines he told me he had been promised an order if he could cut his cost by one-hundredth of a penny.  He did cut his cost by one-hundredth of a penny and he was able to get the order. I mention that to show how very vital it is, particularly in relation to export business, to keep down administrative costs at present in every way we can, but there is no doubt whatever that, as framed here, Part IV of this Bill will increase administrative costs and increase them fairly substantially.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we had a discussion, in relation to the second Financial Resolution, on the position of those abroad who wish to come in here.  We all accept it that before any foreign investor comes in to set up a factory here in Ireland one of the things at which he will look is the system of taxation, and the simpler we can make that system the easier it will be for us <Col N="369" /> to get foreign investors to come here. Part IV of this Bill instead of simplifying matters makes the whole taxation code far more complicated.  In addition, I think it will create a very real irritant in that people will not be able to know in advance the amount of income-tax for which they are liable.</P>
    <P>Most business executives these days have to incur expenses in travelling or entertaining exclusively in the interests of their companies.  In many cases that involves fairly large amounts of money and now they will not know in advance whether or not that money, that is reimbursed to them by their companies, will be taxable.  It should be possible to arrive at a simpler system in which the position would be known to those people at once, and not after a delay of some two years. I wonder how it will be dealt with in practice because it seems to me it would be virtually impossible to have any degree of harmony in the manner in which this part of the Bill will be administered by different inspectors of taxes.  There will inevitably be a degree of variation between the judgment of one man and that of another. It is highly undesirable there should be any element of discretional differentiation in the manner in which two people are assessed by different inspectors, particularly in a country as small as ours.</P>
    <P>Another class of person affected by this is the foreign technician.  We all agree that we have not got here all the technical know-how that we should have in relation to the establishment of certain industries, that we shall have to get foreign technicians to assist us in those industries.  Above all, before a person such as a foreign technician comes into another country he wants to know where he will stand and to get a very clear picture of the salary offered to him and what it means in terms of living money after payment of taxes.  I do not think it will be possible, under Part IV, to give anyone that clear picture.  It may well be that the effect will be that the more responsible and desirable technicians will refuse employment because of this.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, if a person pays expenses he is paying them out of his own pocket.  When he pays them out of <Col N="370" /> his own pocket, surely that examination of what he has to pay in that regard, particularly in relation to vouched expenses, should be sufficient check?  The people who will be examining these expenses returns under Part IV are very estimable.  In general I would say that 99 per cent. of the revenue officials are genuinely anxious to assist the taxpayer.  You get 1 per cent. who are young pups but that is inevitable anywhere and the fact that you do get that must not be allowed in any way to influence one's judgment of the overwhelming majority of the revenue officials.  Nevertheless, having said that, I want to make it clear that, with all their excellent qualities, they are not practical businessmen.  They do not know what has to be dealt with in relation to practical business and their approach to some of these problems is bound to be the same as the theoretical approach of someone to a practical problem when that person has only learned about the question from textbooks and has never had the practical experience.</P>
    <P>I agree that, perhaps over a period, it may be possible to build up that practical experience amongst revenue officials but it is a thing that will take considerable time.  I think it will mean dislocation and irritation in relation to the business community at a time when, in the national interest, we must concentrate all our efforts on production, particularly production for export, rather than be sidetracked by discussions with revenue officials on matters of this sort.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that the increase in administrative costs to the various companies and trades concerned which will arise from this will far outweigh anything that the Minister may receive by way of tax as a result of the enactment of this part of the Bill.  I should like the Minister to tell us what he estimates he will get annually in taxation under Part IV that he would not get if Part IV were not there.  I am sure that estimate must have been made in pounds, shillings and pence and we are entitled to hear what that estimate is.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister, when introducing the Bill as a whole, said that Part IV followed the British Finance <Col N="371" /> Act of 1952.  I want to stress again that our circumstances here are entirely different from the British circumstances. The British, for example, have full employment.  We, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce stressed last night, have nothing like full employment.  We are trying to create it.  They have got a vast industrial machine already operating throughout the whole country.  We have not got that.  We are trying to create new industries to develop exports and to give more employment at home and, even if there was a case for the new tax legislation, I do not think this is the proper time to add additional expenses to the administrative cost on the companies concerned. As I said, these regulations which were introduced in Britain in 1952 have already proved a failure in many respects and have had to be amended and I understand that further amendment is contemplated at the moment.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree with me that, no matter what he brings in in Part IV, there will probably still be loopholes in it through which the clever person can dodge.  I do not think that he or any Minister will ever succeed in obtaining a perfect check in that respect.  If that is so, is it not, therefore, a further argument that, before this whole new type of administrative machine is set up, there should be examination of the proposals by the Tax Commission set up for the purposes of simplifying the tax code, and an effort to provide some solution, if it is possible to provide one, to the complex nature of our difficulties and, thereby, at least satisfy everybody that the proposals have been fairly and impartially examined?  No matter what case the Minister makes in this House, I do not think anyone will ever believe that the examination has been carried out in an impartial manner.  I want to make it clear that what I mean is that it has never been examined by people who are able to sit back and see the difference between the wood and the trees.  This whole part of the Bill which we are asked to pass here is another example in this Bill of the <Col N="372" /> manner in which those who are close to the problem can only see the trees and have not any understanding, because of their closeness to the problem, of the manner in which it will affect our general business background.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true, of course, as the Deputy says, that our conditions here are different from conditions in Great Britain but I do not think it true to say that the Revenue Commissioners or I proceed on the assumption that they are the same.  Unfortunately, we are sometimes faced with the same problem.  Very often the same problem occurs here as occurred there, but our position being different, it is quite right to say that we should deal with it as we see it here and not necessarily follow their procedure.</P>
      <P>If there is a way found in Great Britain to evade income-tax and it goes on for some time, it is almost certain to appear here.  We are up against the problem that they have usually dealt with the matter before we feel it strongly here.  They dealt with this problem in 1948.  The problem appeared here and has increased over the past few years, so I feel that we should deal with it.  We are not dealing with it exactly as they did in Britain, but very often a problem of that kind has only one solution and if that solution has been adopted by the British Government, we cannot help but adopt it also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it would be reasonable to say we should postpone this until the commission has reported, because there is no doubt that the sums that are lost to revenue through directors and high employees putting down amounts for expenses which are not justifiable are on the increase.  As I said yesterday, I do not know when it is likely that the commission may report; it may not be for some time. Deputy Sweetman made some observations on the general question and I should like to say that some of his objections are not very valid.  For instance, he said that inspectors' opinions would differ.  Undoubtedly they will differ slightly.  The opinions of an inspector in Cork, say, and the opinions of an inspector in Dublin may differ, but at any rate you have the <Col N="373" /> Special Commissioners to co-ordinate, if an appeal is made to them.</P>
    <P>But what is the present position? Surely the opinions of an employer in Cork and an employer in Dublin will differ very much more than will the opinions of the inspectors?  They are decided at the moment on what should be allowed for expenses.  On that argument, I say we are certainly going to get a more general pattern of expenses under the Revenue Commissioners than we have under the individual employers at the moment.  After all, employers differ: some of them in their ideas of generosity and some of them in the degree of scrupulousness which they are capable of exercising in deciding these matters.</P>
    <P>Another matter mentioned was in regard to foreign capital coming in. All I can say is that as far as I could find out we are not going to do any more here than is being done in other countries.  If a foreigner comes in, he is almost certain to come from a country where the conditions are better than here at the moment in the matter of collection and assessment of income-tax.</P>
    <P>It is quite true, as Deputy Sweetman said, that if a man allows expenses to his employee, he is likely to be particular about the amount, or likely to see that the employee accounts for the amount allowed, that is, of course in a genuine case.  We are getting after the cases that are not genuine and I am quite prepared to agree that there is only a small proportion of employers who do not act properly in this regard.  There is, however, a small proportion that are not acting properly and they are the ones we are trying to get after in Part IV.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not the Deputy is right when he says that, whatever Act we pass, loopholes will be discovered in it.  That has been the experience and I would not be so optimistic as to suggest that no loopholes will be found.  All we can do is to deal with them as they are discovered and try to stop them developing into a very great source of leakage. We must deal with them as we go along.  As far as Part IV is concerned, therefore, I think we should go ahead <Col N="374" /> and deal with the matter as best we can.  Therefore, I would not be agreeable to accepting the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear whether this provision is an effort to make items taxable which have not been taxable previously, or whether it is an effort to enable the revenue to recover taxes which should have been recovered before, but which they have not been able to lay their hands on. Is it a fresh tax or just a means of recovering what should always have been taxable and which was not recovered?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are really two matters arising here.  The principal thing is to get returns from employers. There are many employees&mdash;and that includes directors&mdash;now getting sums for expenses which are excessive, if they could be justified at all.  To that extent, if they had been returned, the Revenue Commissioners would have collected income-tax, but they have not been returned.  Secondly, there are certain benefits in kind which are now taxable but which were not taxable before.</P>

      <P>I believe there is a good case for postponing this portion of the Bill until after the Commission on Income-Tax has reported.  On a number of occasions since that committee was established, when suggestions were made to effect changes or alterations in the tax system, the matter was always deferred on the ground that the Commission on Income-Tax was inquiring into it.  These reasons were well founded in so far as the body had been set up to consider the whole question.  Therefore, if that was the reason for refusing to make other changes, it is only right that the proposals enshrined here, and which go much further than any earlier provisions, should at least be deferred until that commission reports.</P>
      <P>It will be possible to consider the matter in the light of whatever recommendations are made, and, if it is considered appropriate, on the basis of the commission's report, changes might be made in the law.  This amendment suggests that the changes contemplated in Part IV should be deferred until the passing of that Finance Act which will be passed after the publication of the commission's report.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 18 and 19, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Order under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either House within the next subsequent 21 days on which that House has sat after the Order is laid before it, the Order shall be annulled accordingly but without <Col N="376" /> prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>This amendment is to some extent consequential on amendment No. 3. At least, the fact that provision for the amendment of Statutory Rule and Order No. 13 of 1930 is being made, makes it desirable and necessary that this procedure for tabling Orders and the possible annulment of Orders by the Dáil should be adopted.  It would not, in the ordinary course, be necessary if the Orders merely related to the alteration of level crossings and so on, but with this power being taken to amend what is in fact a statutory instrument, it is clear that the Dáil must have an opportunity of expressing an opinion on it if such an Order is made.</P>

      <P>(6)  The Minister, on the application of the board, may by Order vary (whether by addition, substitution or deletion) the terms and conditions of carriage contained in Statutory Rule and Order No. 13 of 1930, and references in this section (including this sub-section) to such terms and conditions shall be construed as references to those terms and conditions as so varied.</P>
      <P>(7)  Where an application is made under sub-section (6), the board shall, if the Minister so requires, give notice of the application to the public in such form and manner as the Minister directs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> This is the amendment I referred to on amendment No. 1.  Section 7 of the Bill provides that, unless otherwise specified in writing by C.I.E. all merchandise carried by rail shall be taken to be carried subject to the terms and conditions of Statutory Rule and Order No. 13 of 1930.  These standard conditions and terms for the carriage of goods were settled by the Railway Tribunal set up by the Act of 1924 in 1930 and were applied as standard conditions and terms of carriage by the subsequent Transport Acts we passed through the House in 1944 and 1950. The 1944 Act contained provision for the alteration of the standard terms and conditions by ministerial Order, but the 1950 Act did not contain provision for such amendment.  This Bill, as introduced by me, followed the precedent of the 1950 Act and contained no provision for amendment.  In the absence of such a provision the standard terms and conditions of carriage &mdash;there is a very long schedule of regulations relating to the packaging of goods and so forth&mdash;could only be altered by legislation, since the 1930 Order has the force of law.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. asked for provision in the Bill empowering them to alter these standard rules and conditions, many of which are now obsolete because of changing conditions affecting freight transportation, and urged that power to secure some amendment of these rules would be desirable to facilitate them in exploiting the commercial freedom which the Bill aims to give them.  I indicated during the discussion in Committee my intention to introduce this amendment and, as I said, consequent on doing so, we are making this other provision for the tabling of any of these amending Orders and for their possible annulment by the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear in my mind, and I hate passing legislation when we really do not know what we are doing.  There has been a good deal of talk about the suspension of the obligations on the transport company of a common carrier.  I do not know where the obligations of a common carrier are defined precisely, if it is not in the document to which the Minister has referred and which, I understood, laid down the terms and conditions under which the transport company was bound to accept traffic at standard rates.  If I am correct in that belief, the section which we are now about to insert in the Bill authorises the Minister on the application of the company to alter materially the conditions which have heretofore been known as the obligations of a common carrier. Am I right in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The common carrier obligation was an obligation to carry all goods offered, subject to these standard conditions, at uniform charges without discrimination.  That obligation has been removed now in the sense that they can refuse traffic or offer special terms to attract traffic.  Nevertheless, the standard conditions will apply to any goods they accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these conditions I see, for example, that the full name and address of the consignee and sender must be attached to the goods.  I see that they will not carry a milk churn over 20 imperial gallons in capacity. Another rule I see is that in the case of cans, churns and butts the consignees or their agents must assist in their loading and unloading.  There are a number of conditions of that kind, some of which are now due for revision because of altered circumstances.  The problem is to arrange a procedure for <Col N="379" /> revision that does not involve legislation. That is what I am aiming to do here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There are approximately 1,000 level crossings in the railway system in this country.  They are scattered throughout the country.  The standard width of these crossings is nine feet.  As the House will appreciate, it is a great many years since these crossings were constructed.  Now, with the advent of modern machinery, it is quite impossible for a farmer to get in his machinery under existing conditions where he owns land on both sides of a railway.  In fact, several cases have been listed in the courts in reference to this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to a section of an old Act of 1845, which is known as the Railways (Consolidation) Act, there is no need for the railways to do anything about any part of their system if it has been in existence for six years. Whereas, in times past, it might have <Col N="380" /> been the farmer's intention to save his crop with an older type of machinery, in modern conditions he has to use modern machinery, such as a combine harvester.  When he applies to C.I.E. for facilities to enable him to harvest his crop it has not been found possible to reach any measure of agreement.</P>
    <P>In the light of all the circumstances, it seems to me that the terms imposed upon the farmers are not reasonable. In the first instance, C.I.E. has demanded that the cost of any work done to enable the passage of machinery should be borne by the farmers and, secondly, that an agreement should be entered into between the board and the farmers to indemnify the board against any action, or claims, etc., arising out of the use of the crossing.  Further, it has been stipulated that a joint insurance policy must be taken out in the names of the farmers concerned and the board in the sum of £50,000 to cover the possibility of an accident at the crossing. All that does not make sense to me.</P>
    <P>There have been several instances in which farmers have found themselves in the position that they cannot get across the railway.  In two cases&mdash;one in my own constituency and the other, I think, in Offaly&mdash;farmers were constrained to remove the piers to get their machinery across the railway lines; otherwise, they would have lost their crops.  Those two cases have culminated in legal proceedings.  In one case, in the very wet harvest of 1946, they were forced to remove the piers so as to get the machinery in.  They subsequently replaced the piers.  In that particular case some minor damage was done to the piers.  Now, they simply had to go in with their machinery or lose the crop.  The only satisfaction they could get out of C.I.E., was that, according to the 1845 Act, they were not in any way responsible. Not only does the thing not make sense, but it is unrealistic in modern circumstances.  Before mechanisation, a width of 9 feet was sufficient to permit of entrance to these lands.  As the Minister is probably aware, farmers have had to reconstruct their own entrances and put up wider gates to enable modern machinery to enter their lands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> This amendment seeks to rectify the position.  There are a great many of these crossings.  Several of them are very often on the same farm and it would probably not be necessary to widen more than one on the same farm. Surely, some measure of agreement could be reached in that regard? To strengthen my argument, I should like to cite to the House one case which actually went to court.  The district justice expressed sympathy with the farmer and hoped that some agreement would be reached between the board and the farmers generally in this matter, but he gave a decree, as he was compelled to do, under this obsolete legislation of 1845.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give consideration to this position.  It has arisen in the past and it will arise again.  With regard to the indemnity of £50,000 it seems to me the board is trying to shelve its responsibilities and put the onus on the shoulders of the farmers. That is not a reasonable approach.  It is only fair to state that the indemnity of £50,000&mdash;if one could get an insurance company to accept liability; I do not know whether or not that would be possible&mdash;would cost by way of premium some four guineas per annum. That imposes an additional permanent charge on the farm and thereby depreciates the value of the farm.  It also increases the overheads in general and the cost of production as a whole.</P>
    <P>This is a matter the Minister should reasonably consider.  If he is not prepared to accept my amendment, perhaps he would bring in an amendment of his own to meet the situation.  What I want to ensure is that some reasonable agreement will be reached immediately between C.I.E., the farmers concerned and the representatives of the National Farmers' Association in general so that the matter may be put right.</P>
    <P>There has been correspondence between the National Farmers' Association and C.I.E., beginning at the end of last December.  So far, the association have had two communications saying the matter is under consideration but there are legal difficulties in the way, and so forth.  I should like to point out to the Minister that the <Col N="382" /> harvest is rapidly approaching and these difficulties to which I have referred in the cases I have cited will arise again in the very near future.  I would ask the Minister to give the matter his urgent consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the views expressed by Deputy Dr. Esmonde.  He has put the facts fully before the Minister.  It is not necessary for me to add to what he has said except to point out that the Minister, I am sure, is aware of the great changes that have taken place in farming generally as a result of mechanisation and in the general dimensions of agricultural machinery now as compared with the time when the Railway (Clauses) Consolidation Act of 1845 was passed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde showed me the correspondence to which he has referred. Undoubtedly, some quite remarkable cases have arisen.  There may be only a few, but in those few it is obvious that the farmers concerned have suffered hardship.  In one instance the farmer was, if not convicted, at least decreed in court in respect of damage done to C.I.E. property. In another case, permission would not be granted by C.I.E., when C.I.E. were approached.  Then the proposal was made that a substantial bond should be agreed and arranged between the farmers concerned and the board of C.I.E.  From looking through the correspondence and the Acts concerned, it seems to me that the board is obviously afraid of doing anything which might involve them in an action for damages.  If this amendment does not meet the position, or if there is a better way of dealing with it, perhaps the Minister will devise some solution to rectify the situation.  It is certainly a situation that requires to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that the number of level crossings or the number of entrances into farms would not be as great as the number referred to by the company; I think they mentioned 1,000. Quite a number of farmers must find it difficult to use the lands in question and cultivate them in the manner in which they would wish.  This difficulty arises mainly in connection with combine <Col N="383" /> harvesters, seed barrows, and wide machinery of that sort.  I suggest to the Minister that, in consultation with the board and the National Farmers' Association, some arrangement ought to be arrived at which would enable whatever changes are necessary to be made in order to ensure that farmers can get their machinery on to their lands and, at the same time, ensure that the company will not be liable and the farmer will not be involved in a lawsuit with the company in relation to whatever structural changes have to be made in order to widen these openings or entrances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the remarks of Deputy Dr. Esmonde and Deputy Cosgrave.  I have nothing to add except to remind the House of something that seems to be forgotten &mdash;that this problem arose from the fact that when the railways were laid out they had no regard to boundaries.  If the House wants any evidence of that, all they have to do is go down and look at the farm of the Department of Agriculture at Athenry which is bisected by the railway.  In the vicinity of my farm they will find the railway running straight across the land and dividing the holdings in two.  Most of my land is on one side of the railway and very little on the other, but my neighbour's land is evenly divided by the railway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Originally there was an obligation put upon the railway company to provide adequate level crossing accommodation for any person whose land had been bisected by the railway, and they have done it.  The level crossings are there.  They have a statutory duty to maintain them.  Although they now maintain level crossings which were considered to be adequate to convenience the farmer in 1845, it is manifest that they are not adequate for the farmer now.  All that is proposed here is that the facilities which the railway company were obliged to provide in 1845, where the railway bisected a farm, should be brought up to date so that the railway company would provide a level crossing suitable for the kind of machinery that is now in use.  If what is suggested here by Deputy Dr. <Col N="384" /> Esmonde and Deputy Cosgrave is not acceptable, doubtless some other words or device could be found, and no doubt Deputy Dr. Esmonde would be satisfied if the evil could be abated either by amendment of this Bill or any other means the Minister may suggest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put forward a suggestion which might reduce the cost to C.I.E.?  The farmer himself has got over this difficulty.  Instead of taking down the actual gate he has inserted a removable centre post with the addition of a wicket.  I have seen that working very well and I make that suggestion to the Minister as a means of reducing expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to have these level crossings widened to facilitate the use of modern machinery. The present level crossings are a hindrance to farmers especially at harvest time, and C.I.E. and the farming community should come to some amicable agreement by which machinery can have access to fields. Harvest time is not a time for bargaining. It should be done now under this heading.  I welcome Deputy Dr. Esmonde's amendment.  If the Minister can see fit to improve on it, all the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>The case made for this amendment appears to be quite a reasonable one designed to bring up to date the statutory obligation placed on C.I.E. and their predecessors in this respect.  The only objectionable feature I see in it is that it would throw the cost of widening these level crossings completely on C.I.E. Farmers already have had to widen gaps, gates and entrances at other parts of their farms at their own expense.  I do not think we should create the position where every farmer in the country whose lands are crossed by a railway could chase C.I.E. immediately in order to get the company to renovate and bring up to date these entrances at level crossings.  Something should be done to remedy the situation outlined by Deputy Dr. Esmonde, but we should not throw the whole onus on C.I.E. to meet the not inconsiderable cost of bringing all these level crossings up to date.  If the farmer needs <Col N="385" /> this renovation he should be prepared, and possibly would be prepared, to meet the cost himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The section in the Bill relates to the control of public level crossings.  Deputy Dr. Esmonde made it clear he is thinking solely about accommodation crossings, that is to say, crossing gates provided for the convenience of a local landowner who has the obligation of opening and shutting the gates himself whenever he uses the crossing.  I could perhaps raise the procedural point that this matter was not adverted to in the Committee Stage discussion and that an amendment at this stage might not be in order.  However, it is just as well it has been raised because I want to make my view in the matter clear to the House.</P>
      <P>So far as I know, C.I.E. will not refuse to effect the widening of an accommodation crossing where the local landowner requires it; indeed I think I can give an assurance that C.I.E. will facilitate local owners in that regard.  But the question is, as Deputy Casey pointed out, at whose expense is the work to be done?  I cannot agree to putting on C.I.E. a statutory obligation to do the work at their expense and it would be unreasonable to expect them to do so. The person accommodated surely is the person who is liable to meet the cost.</P>
      <P>Furthermore there is this very important consideration that the widening of these accommodation crossings to an extent that would permit the passage of combine tractors increases the danger of accidents at these crossings and, therefore, C.I.E. very properly require to be indemnified by means of an insurance policy against claims for damages due to accidents at these crossings.  That is a perfectly reasonable provision and I would have to oppose a proposal that C.I.E. should not seek indemnity against claims for damages arising from such accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position, therefore, as far as I am concerned, is that C.I.E. will seek to accommodate local farmers by increasing the width of these crossings. <Col N="386" /> I think I can give an undertaking they will do so wherever the need for it is demonstrated.  However, the cost of doing the work is a matter for the persons accommodated, not for C.I.E. and C.I.E. must be indemnified against possible claims for damages through an insurance policy.</P>
    <P>In so far as there is a desire to make some general arrangement with C.I.E. by negotiating with farmers' organisations or in some other way, that is a development I would welcome, but it is a matter for negotiation with C.I.E., not for imposing upon them through statute an obligation to do this work, C.I.E. having the assurance that the cost of the operation will be met by the person accommodated and being indemnified by way of insurance against damages.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="388" /> Deputies will remember the discussion we had on this matter on Committee Stage.  I proposed an amendment on that occasion which provided for the payment of the compensation to be granted under the Bill to workers disemployed by reason of a general reorganisation as distinct from the closing of a line or station and where that scheme of reorganisation had been agreed to by the trade union concerned. In subsequent discussions with the representatives of the Provisional United Trade Union Organisation, it was agreed that that arrangement of prior agreement by the trade unions should be deleted because it was felt that it might create a position of difficulty for unions to some extent particularly where more than one union was involved.  It was agreed that the provision of compensation for workers disemployed through such general organisation should not be made conditional upon prior agreement and that that condition should be deleted.</P>
    <P>However, it was considered desirable that I make it clear that, in my view, the practicability of successfully achieving general reorganisation measures of that kind depends very largely upon full prior consultation with the trade unions concerned and upon an attempt to secure agreement upon the character and scope of reorganisation proposals.  I told the trade union representatives that I would say that here in the Dáil, and would indicate that I was doing so at their request, and that I would emphasise that they are, on their side, exceedingly anxious to have joint consultation with C.I.E. on these matters.  They would like to have that made clear so that proposals for reorganisation of that character can be fully considered and implemented within the period stated in the Bill during which compensation will be payable.</P>
    <P>The amendment, as it now appears, is one which was agreed upon following these discussions with the trade union representatives and I am putting it forward as a better proposal than that which I moved in Committee, while making it clear that the intention is, not to avoid consultation, but to facilitate consultation and in the hope that full and effective machinery <Col N="389" /> for consultation will be worked out quickly between the parties concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made the trade unions' approach to this matter quite clear.  We appreciate that it will be possible to find agreement between the trade unions concerned and the company on the matters concerned. I am glad the Minister has availed of the opportunity to state here that, although the reference to the trade unions has been deleted from this section, he hopes and expects the management of C.I.E. to have prior consultation with the trade unions involved in the case of any anticipated reorganisation of the system.  I am glad that he has placed that on the records of this House as his desire and his expectation.</P>
      <P>Quite candidly, the board and management of C.I.E. appear to have quite contrary ideas on this matter. Recently, in this House, I had to point out that the management of C.I.E. endeavoured to carry out, in Cork, reorganisation among a certain group of employees without any prior consultation and without any prior notice to the trade unions involved.  That was at a time when this House was engaged in the process of providing compensation where redundancy occurred.  To my mind, on that occasion, C.I.E. not alone illustrated its approach to the trade unions on this matter, but displayed quite clearly its attitude to this House&mdash;that at a time when the Minister was piloting through the House a Bill dealing with these matters, they endeavoured to carry out a certain reorganisation without prior notice or consultation with the trade unions concerned.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister's speech on this occasion will have the effect of impresing on the management of C.I.E. that if they want to get the best results in the matter of these reorganisations, there is the only way out of doing it, that is, through prior consultation and co-operation with those employed, through their trade union.</P>

    <P>This is the point on which we had the long debate during the Committee Stage.  I have given the matter a great deal of consideration following upon that debate and the practical problems which were brought to light during it.</P>
    <P>The effect of the changes proposed here is, first, to extend the facility which I was proposing should be allowed in respect of the carriage of live stock by tractor-trailer by a farmer for his neighbour to live stock marts, to carriage to fairs and markets. I want to say something in that regard, however, which, I think is necessary.  I had contemplated that that facility would be allowed in respect of the main fairs of the country. A fair, according to the law, is a market and while I had intended to confine it to fairs in the ordinary understanding of the term, the term &ldquo;market&rdquo; had to be used because a &ldquo;fair&rdquo; is a &ldquo;market&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I had intended to limit it to the main fairs of the country.  That is why I put into his amendment a sub-section which would require the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make an Order specifying the fairs and markets to which the section would relate.  There is no official list of fairs and markets.  While there are lists published in various almanacs, I understand <Col N="392" /> that they are by no means accurate, that they often list fairs which have long become obsolete and sometimes do not include fairs still developing. The practical difficulty of preparing a list will be very great and, indeed, may prove to be such that the preparation of such a list and its publication by Order may be impossible.  I certainly do not want to take on myself as Minister for Industry and Commerce the obligation of defining the principal fairs and markets of the country.</P>
    <P>That is a matter which is still under examination, but I think I should mention it because it is one of the practical difficulties which have not yet been solved.  This, of course, extends quite considerably the scope of the facility which was contemplated.  There is a very large number of activities which could be described as fairs or markets. It is, of course, to be clear that the facility will be restricted to the carriage of live stock and will not extend to other commodities.  The danger of that extension of the facility leading to a widespread abuse and the carriage of goods for reward in a manner not contemplated by the section is, I think, very substantially reduced by the further provision in the amendment which makes it clear that this concession is given only in respect of tractors which are agricultural tractors in the sense that they are paying road tax only at the rate for agricultural tractors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, the £8 rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Any tractor owner who uses his tractor otherwise than in accordance with the strict provision of the Act would not merely be taking the risk of the penalties which this Bill provides but would also automatically make himself liable to the higher rate of road tax.  That fact, which had been well appreciated and known, is likely to prove such a deterrent that the risk of any widespread abuse is not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt that from the beginning it was going to be impossible to confine this concession solely to auction marts and I was, as Deputies remember, pressed from all sides of the House to extend <Col N="393" /> it to fairs and markets, during the Committee Stage discussion.  It is with some reluctance I am doing so, mainly because of the difficulty of defining what are fairs and markets.  I have not got over that difficulty yet.  I thought I could get over it by the process of specifying in an Order the fairs and markets to which the concession will apply.  I am not quite clear that that will be possible and, therefore, we have to visualise the possibility of a concession applying to live-stock fairs and markets generally.  There are quite a number of these and they are held quite frequently.  However, I believe the possibility of abuse is minimised by the further tightening up of the section which I am proposing now.</P>
    <P>On the whole, it is the best attempt I can make to meet the wishes expressed from all sides of the House during the Committee Stage of the Bill, and at the same time, to avoid the danger which I visualise, of persons seeking to get into the business of transport as a means of livelihood, through this device.  I think the tax arrangements will effectively prevent that.  On the whole, the extension of the section is not likely to cause further difficulty for the public transport operators or the licensed hauliers and indeed, the new facility will meet a transport need which is of only recent growth and a situation which was not contemplated when the original restrictions upon haulage for reward were being devised.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  As I see it, the value of this concession will be to smaller cases, in the main.  In the case of the big fairs, whether they are in county towns or in small towns or villages, the public transport company would probably supply lorries, as it would be worth while doing so.  That would not apply in the case of a small fair or market in a remote area.</P>

I do not think there will be any difficulty about this and I believe his Parliamentary Secretary will tell him there is a source of information&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is the section of the Bill in which the Minister himself does not believe and it may be no harm to reflect on the circumstances and the manner in which this section was put into the Bill.  The House will recollect that the Beddy Committee made a recommendation in their report that farmers should get special concessions for drawing farm produce and requisites for neighbours by tractor. That suggestion, no doubt, in common with other suggestions, must have received the serious consideration of the Minister but, obviously, it was rejected by him.  In his policy statement on transport in this House at the end of last year, he made no reference to it.  He did not indicate then, when he was outlining broadly what might be in this Bill now before us, that he had these concessions in mind.</P>
      <P>Probably I would be correct in saying that various interests made representations to him between the end of last year when he made his policy statement and the time the Bill was eventually introduced.  He resisted all that pressure.  He produced a Bill which contained no such concessions for the section of the community now covered and it is quite obvious that hidden hands of great strength must have forced the Minister, because, at the eleventh hour, he produced an amendment which is designed to give certain specified concessions to farmers.  On that occasion, when speaking against the amendment, I said he would be open to all sorts of pressure and in discussing the amendment in the House, we immediately had pressure on the Minister from all sides to extend the concessions which were enshrined in the amendment as it then was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I argued against that; the Minister argued against it. He said he would not contemplate doing so, but to-day we find him bringing in his amendment which shows he has changed his mind in the matter, but he has not explained to the House what has brought about that change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the best argument I could make against this highly dangerous amendment is to quote the arguments made by the Minister a few short weeks ago when he was being pressed to bring in this type of an amendment.  He referred to his interview with the National Farmers' Association, and at column 1156 of the debate of June 3rd, he is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;They asked that the Road Transport Act should be amended so as to permit a farmer to carry cattle to an auction mart on a day an auction was being held and that the concession should be confined to servicing other farmers living within a two-mile radius of the farm of the tractor owner.  Their argument was that a new type of traffic need has arisen, in consequence of the development of these auction marts, which cannot conveniently be met by any of the existing transport services, and that if that concession were allowed, a benefit would accrue to C.I.E., in the sense that the collection of cattle in these marts offers to C.I.E. the type of transport business they are seeking, that is, a large volume of <Col N="398" /> freight of a specialised kind collected at a particular centre on a particular day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to say, as reported at column 1157, onwards:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I undertook to bring an amendment to the Dáil and that is what I am doing now.  I do not think the danger I had to safeguard against is likely to arise from it&mdash;the danger of a new type of transport operator coming along who would seek to supplement what he could get from this operation by engaging in other transport operations&mdash;provided&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Minister said he was protected&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;it is limited to tractors and limited to the conveyance of live stock to auction marts on the day such marts are held.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He felt there was a grave danger of widening the scope for illegal haulage unless he confined himself to those concessions available for the carriage of live stock to auction marts on a particular day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave pressed him and asked him:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Can the Minister say if &lsquo;auction marts&rsquo; include fairs?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No.  That is one of the questions I put to the National Farmers' Association: whether I was likely to have pressure put on me to extend this facility to fairs?  They said &lsquo;No&rsquo;.  They said fairs are still held in a number of centres to cater for cattle brought in from a comparatively small radius.  The problem of the auction marts is to move cattle from a far wider range, a longer distance than the cattle could be walked.  There is a transport need there which could not be met in any other way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The case the Minister made was that this special new transport need had sprung up with the establishment of the auction marts, that he was making the concession because of that, and because of that only, and that under no circumstances would he extend it to fairs.</P>
    <P>At column 1163 the Minister is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" />&ldquo;I mentioned that the people who came to me from the National Farmers' Association wanted this arrangement for auction marts only. They may have a particular interest in confining it to auction marts.  It would be far more suitable, from my point of view, so to do.  I see no difficulty whatsoever as regards enforcing this arrangement in the limited conditions contemplated here because these auction marts are held once a fortnight or so, and clearly it would be a day on which one would expect to see this transportation taking place, whereas, on any other day, one would not expect to see it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Obviously, the Minister had in mind the difficulties that would face the Guards in the detection of illegal haulage if it were on any old day at all.  If a fair was being held anywhere within a radius of 20 miles the Guards could expect to see cattle being hauled by farmers in their tractors and trailers for reward for some of their labours.</P>
    <P>The following day, Wednesday, 4th June, 1958, the Minister said, as reported at column 1172 of the Official Report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was pointing out the danger of extending it to fairs as well as to marts.  As reported at column 1180 of the Official Report of the 4th June, 1958, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is a fair every day.  There are 30,000 or 40,000 of these tractors. Consider the problem of the Guards who will see on the roads this transport operation taking place.  I do not think it is a problem for the Guards when they know there is a mart on a particular morning.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> He was pointing out that it would be quite impossible to avoid illegal haulage if the facilities were extended to fairs as well as to marts, as they are now.</P>
    <P>In reply to a point raised by me, the Minister stated, as reported at column 1173:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would agree fully with the Deputy that is as far as we could go without creating such a danger.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I could quote from every second sentence of the Minister's contribution on that occasion.  It would be the very best argument I could use against this particular proposal.  At any rate, I think the Minister should have explained to the House what pressure was brought to bear on him, what new arguments were placed before him, which resulted in his turning completely round on everything he said on that occasion in relation to this particular section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point which I should like to make.  It concerns a comment made on the last day we discussed this matter.  The Minister expressed the view that these concessions would take little or no traffic from C.I.E.  He asked:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Does anybody in the House seriously suggest that as a result of this concession there will be six loads a year of existing traffic taken from C.I.E.?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I went to the trouble of getting some official figures on this particular aspect. I discovered that at two marts in the Midlands&mdash;Mullingar and Moate&mdash;the average number of loads brought to the marts by C.I.E. in the past six months has been six lorry loads per mart, with an average of 78 cattle to the lorry, and that picking up at points worked out at an average of three different lots.  Similarly, over the past six months at these two marts, the average numbers delivered to buyers after the marts was three loads with an aggregate of 55 cattle.</P>
    <P>At another point in the debate the opinion was expressed that C.I.E. would lose a certain sum of money per annum.  The traffic I refer to is traffic that very likely will be lost to C.I.E. <Col N="401" /> The average annual receipts which will accrue to C.I.E. on the traffic I have outlined here would be something like £1,700 for the mart at Moate and £1,500 for the mart at Mullingar.</P>
    <P>While the original amendment was, to my mind, dangerous, and one which the Minister said he introduced with reluctance, I am quite sure that the amendment as now moved will open the floodgates to illegal haulage.  The Minister said that C.I.E. had been bedevilled by the problem of illegal haulage for a long number of years. We had hoped that a serious attempt would be made in this Bill to stamp it out.  I think that was the Minister's original intention, if we refer to the sections dealing with penalties which may be imposed for illegal haulage. Now, however, any person whose only or chief occupation is farming may engage in this particular type of transport.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell me in the first place who is to decide whether or not a person is a person whose only or chief occupation is farming.</P>

I do not know but that is really only one of the parts of this amendment that will be wide open to abuse.  I am quite sure the Minister realises the dangers in this section, and I am only sorry that the pressure which was brought to bear on him must have been such that he had to relent and put in a section in this Bill which is obviously against his own principles, as he has enunciated them both here and outside the House from time to <Col N="402" /> time, on public transport.  I do think he owes it to this House to explain what this type of pressure was that succeeded in making him completely turn face about and put in a section which is absolutely contrary to his oft- expressed views on public transport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say a few words in conclusion.  I should like to say I agree, of course, that I argued against this extension to fairs and markets during the Committee Stage discussion.  However, I gave the matter a great deal of consideration in the light of views expressed here and felt it was not possible to maintain an individual judgment against many views expressed by people who are intimately acquainted with the requirements of rural districts.  I have grave anxiety about the possibility of this extension of the provision leading to an increase in illegal haulage, and the only thing I can say in that regard is that, if it does, we will have to have another look at it.  We will have to consider to what extent the concession will have to be circumscribed or reduced in order to prevent illegal haulage.</P>
      <P>I believe, however, the danger of illegal haulage is considerably reduced by the limitation of the concession to vehicles which are agricultural tractors taxed as such, and that the consequential automatic increase in road tax rate following upon any extension of operations beyond the limits fixed by the section will be a deterrent to any development of illegal haulage. That taxation concession in respect of agricultural tractors is available only for tractors which are used occasionally on the roads.  If tractors are used otherwise than occasionally on the roads, then they become liable to the full tax and that, I think, will be as big a deterrent to the abuse of the section as the penalties contemplated by the Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to one point made by Deputy Casey, I should like to make it clear that this right of haulage is confined to haulage of cattle to or from a fair.  It does not include a right of haulage to railway stations or to the premises of buyers of cattle, or anything like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 29 to 31, inclusive.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete sub-section (4) of Section 27.  Sub-section (4) of Section 27 appears to make provision for the very unlikely development that a person convicted for a second offence under this Bill shall not have available to him the benefits of the Probation of Offenders Act.  At first glance, that would appear to be a most reasonable provision, but I would ask the House to pause and reconsider this matter.  It is highly unlikely that any rational district justice would apply the Probation of Offenders Act to a person who had, in fact, been convicted once before.  All of us, however, who had any experience of the effort to provide mandatory penalties in legislation, have discovered from experience that it does not work.  If you take away from the presiding judge the discretion to deal with each case on its merits, sooner or later, you will come up against some extraordinary case where you will bitterly regret having withdrawn the discretion originally there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has had that experience himself.  I certainly had it. The number of times I have laid down an absolute rule that in no circumstances <Col N="409" /> whatever is any file to be put on my desk suggesting that a penalty in regard to a fishery offence should be remitted on compassionate grounds, is legion.  I have never given such a direction, but some case turned up subsequently in which I was prepared to revise my views and say: &ldquo;Here are circumstances I had never contemplated, never envisaged, in which I would be wrong if I allowed the natural inclination towards maintaining consistency to deter me from altering my original decision in order to see substantial justice done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can I persuade the House that sub-section (4) of this section is providing for a most unlikely contingency, but the very fact that it seeks to do that appears to me to withdraw from the district justice a most necessary discretion, because if circumstances ever arise that would bring into the district justice's mind the thought of giving a second offender the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act, then the assumption is they are circumstances of the most exceptional character.</P>
    <P>Let us not try to protect C.I.E. by grinding in the dirt some insignificant individual who, because the discretion has been taken from the district justice, has a penalty visited upon him, which in the eyes of justice, tempered by prudent mercy, should not be visited upon him.  We are all inclined in this House to take a general view that I have heard leading members of the Government express, that you cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs.  I am always thinking of the egg. If we do our duty in this House, it is with the egg we ought to be preoccupied. The strong, the organised and the vested interests can all defend themselves.  It is the insignificant person who gets caught in the machine of the law who requires our solicitude as members of the House.  All of us will agree that the institution of the Probation of Offenders Act was a great reform in the administration of the law.  I want to urge on the House that you could not find a more inappropriate place wherein to withdraw the protection of that Act from the insignificant and weak than a Transport Bill, simply because we have an idea that we want to make the law more <Col N="410" /> watertight than it has been heretofore in regard to illegal haulage.</P>
    <P>I bespeak the solicitude of Deputies on all sides of the House for the person appearing before a district justice&mdash;a person once convicted and now charged again, but whose circumstances are so exceptional and extraordinary that the district justice wants to give him the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act.  I ask Deputies to consider the circumstances in which that possibility can arise and to decide that in the rare case where such circumstances do present themselves, the district justice shall not be stripped of his discretion in this matter and forced by an Act of this House to do something he believes, as an independent judge, is not justice, but which he must do because we have made it mandatory upon him to do it, even against his better judgment as a justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Dillon, I do not think I can do better than quote the relevant paragraph of the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Internal Transport.  Paragraph 462 of that report is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Allegations have been made from time to time by the public transport undertakings that illegal haulage is both widespread and considerable but there is no means available by which its volume or nature can be properly assessed.  No doubt where it is carried on systematically and extensively it is detrimental to the public transport undertakings and is a challenge to the law.  We are of opinion that in cases of conviction the penalty should be sufficient to render illegal haulage unprofitable to the operator and so deter him from engaging in it.  We consider, therefore, that a strong case exists for statutorily prescribed minimum fines especially in cases of repeated offences.  We are aware of the objections in principle to minimum fines but we are satisfied that in the absence of effective penalties there is little likelihood of eliminating illegal haulage.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They recommended, therefore, that provision should be made on the lines set out in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="411" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a moment.  That deals with minimum fines.  You have that in sub-sections (1), (2) and (3); I am concerned only with sub-section (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The report continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We recommend, therefore, that for second and subsequent offences by persons convicted of illegal haulage, statutory provision should be made whereby the Probation of Offenders Act would not apply and minimum fines would be imposed at a level which initially would not be unduly punitive, but would increase steeply for subsequent offences.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have the same feeling as the Deputy, that it is generally undesirable to limit the discretion of justices, but we have to recognise that this is the kernel of our transport problem.  The inability to prevent breaches of the Road Transport Acts has not merely been the cause of grave loss to C.I.E., which has had to be made good by the taxpayer, but it is, in fact, undermining the whole transport policy of the State as it has developed over the past 25 years.  We have also to recognise that, for reasons which are not always easy to understand, there is a tendency in the District Court to impose very nominal fines where offences of this kind are proved.  There is often grave difficulty in detecting these offences, and still graver difficulty in securing the evidence to lead to a conviction. When that is possible and when an offence has been detected with sufficient evidence to secure a conviction, it is very discouraging to those trying to enforce the law and to those who are anxious to see the law enforced, if very nominal fines, which have no relation to the magnitude of the offence or to the profit which the individual achieved by breaking the law, are imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is much point in having the minimum fine provision without having this sub-section dealing with the Probation of Offenders Act.  The sub-section of the Probation of Offenders Act gives the <Col N="412" /> district justice the power to dismiss the case and bind the defendant over, to require him to enter into recognisances to keep the peace where he is satisfied, amongst other circumstances, that the offence was of a trivial nature and where there were extenuating circumstances.  The first thing we want to make clear is that we do not regard this offence in any circumstance as being of a trivial nature. I do not think that a district justice could seriously consider that where there was a repeated offence, it was of a trivial character.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not anxious that extenuating circumstances should be pleaded.  It is quite clear that those who break the law in this regard break it knowing well what they are doing. They do not do so by accident or inadvertence. Everybody knows it is illegal to carry goods for reward and those who do so quite consciously defy the law, in the hope of getting away with it by reason of the difficulty of enforcing the law.  Notwithstanding this theoretical objection to the provisions of the section voiced by Deputy Dillon, unless we can make that provision effective, we will be coming back to the House looking for new subsidies or, alternatively, having to revise the whole policy on which we have been working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 10, Second Schedule, to add to the Schedule a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>7.  Where a person who is in receipt of an annual sum and to whom <Col N="413" /> paragraph 4 of the Fourth Schedule to the Act of 1950 applies reaches the age of 65 years, the reduction thereafter falling to be made under subparagraph (a) of that paragraph shall itself be reduced so that the aggregate of the amount of the annual sum and an amount equal to the annual value of the superannuation or benefit to which he is also entitled is not less than that aggregate as it stood immediately before he reached that age.</P>
    <P>This is a technical amendment and it may be necessary to explain it very fully.  The amendment arises out of discussions we have had with the representatives of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association.  Indeed, it is based upon a proposal put forward by them. The effect is to ensure that redundant employees of C.I.E. in receipt of superannuation pension would, on reaching the age of 65, be entitled to apply their superannuation pension, in so far as it was sufficient, to offset the reduction in compensation pension effected at that age under the terms of paragraph 3 of the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Transport Salaried Staffs Association had other objectives in mind.  First of all, they wanted to create a situation in which, in the event of redundancy in the senior clerical staff, men who were approaching their retirement would be induced to accept redundancy.  Secondly, they wanted to ensure that these redundant officers would, so far as possible, continue to be eligible for death benefits under the existing superannuation schemes.  The association propose to negotiate with the Pension Fund Committees and with the Board of C.I.E. with a view to having the superannuation schemes amended so as to permit of the accrued pension rights of senior officers being frozen until their normal retirement age.  Under the Bill as it stood, there would be no incentive to the older men to accept redundancy because they would, on becoming redundant, lose their pension rights and the reduced compensation pensions which they would receive after 65 years of age would be less than the full retirement pension to which they would have been entitled had <Col N="414" /> they continued in the service of the company until normal retiring age.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I had better give an illustration here of how this works out: a redundant salaried employee leaving the service of the board under the terms of the Bill as it stands and entitled to, say, £8 per week as compensation pension would receive that weekly sum until he was 65 years of age when it would be reduced to £6 per week.  If the pension schemes are amended, as it is hoped, so as to enable him to qualify for an accrued superannuation pension rate of £6 per week at the age of 60, the position would be that his compensation pension would be abated by the amount of the superannuation pension.  The net compensation pension he would receive from 60 to 65 would be only £2 a week, which, with his superannuation pension, would make £8 a week and, from 65, he would receive no compensation pension, only the superannuation pension of £6 per week.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, therefore, that apart from this question of death benefits, for which he might be covered under the pension scheme, there would be no advantage to him in having his pension frozen and he would undoubtedly elect, if he became redundant, to withdraw his own contributions from the pension fund.  Under the amendment proposed, the redundant salaried employee who elected to have his superannuation pension frozen would have his compensation pension abated from 60 to 65 by £6 a week, but after 65 the reduced compensation would be abated by only £4 a week in respect of superannuation pension, so that the total weekly sum he would receive would continue to be £8 per week.</P>
    <P>The amendment would also apply to wages grade workers.  Under the wages grade pension scheme, there is already provision for payment of reduced benefits to workers retiring within ten years of the normal retiring age of 65.  Under the amendment, the position of such a worker entitled to compensation pension of, say, £6 per week and superannuation pension of, say, 15/- per week would be as follows: from retirement to 65, he <Col N="415" /> would draw 15/- per week superannuation pension, plus £5 5/- per week compensation pension, making a total of £6 per week.  After 65, he would draw a superannuation pension of 15/- per week, plus a compensation pension abated under the terms of the Schedule of £4 10/- per week making a total of £5 5/- per week.  In that case, the superannuation pension to which the worker would be entitled would not be sufficient to offset completely the statutory abatement of compensation pension on his retiring at 65 years of age.  I could give a number of other examples, but it is, perhaps, not desirable to do so.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of this change is that no extra cost will fall upon the Exchequer.  Indeed, it is possible that the Exchequer may have quite a considerable saving.  Without this amendment, there would be no incentive to amend the pension schemes to provide for the freezing of superannuation rights and there would, therefore, be no reduction at any stage of compensation pension payable by the Exchequer in respect of superannuation pension drawn by the redundant employee. If, however, because of the amendment, arrangements are made, as the Transport Salaried Staff Association contemplate, for the freezing of pension rights, the Exchequer will be relieved under the provisions of Article 4 of the Fourth Schedule of the 1950 Act as modified by the proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>In so far as redundant employees will gain from the arrangement, these gains will, of course, come out of the pension funds.  A redundant employee at present loses pension rights and merely gets his own contributions back, but the contributions made to the fund by the board stay in the pension fund. If there were a large number of redundants involved, the solvency of the pension fund would be increased far beyond any normal expectations.  The cost of increased benefit under the proposed amendment would, therefore, really be met out of this uncovenanted windfall to the pension fund.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, be for the Transport Salaried Staff Association, or any other trade union concerned, to take <Col N="416" /> up with the pension fund committees and with the Board of C.I.E. the question of amending the existing schemes in such a way as to provide for the freezing of pension rights and for enabling redundant workers to take advantage of this amendment.  To give effect to any such amendment of the pension schemes, amending pension schemes would have to be submitted by the board to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for confirmation. This was a very useful and constructive suggestion which came from the Transport Salaried Staff Association and I was very glad to accept it, because we would, I think, all agree that it is desirable that there should be an inducement to the more senior members of the staff to accept redundancy, when redundancy offers and, secondly, because the resources of the pension fund can now be made available to increase the payments which these workers will get when they are retired for redundancy reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has very fairly stated the dilemma in which the trade unions concerned found themselves arising out of this section of the Bill.  It was appreciated that, as it stood at the time, there were difficulties. In particular, the trade unions would have difficulty in endeavouring to sell the idea to senior members to opt for redundancy, should redundancy arise.  The trade unions, in common with the Minister, were anxious to ensure that if redundancy should arise, it would not be confined compulsorily to last-in-first-out.  We were concerned to include compensation provisions which would prove sufficiently attractive to entice out people who were approaching the retiring age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it stood, the section had shortcomings and did not appear to provide sufficiently attractive conditions in that connection.  The trade unions concerned made their representations and suggestions as to how that difficulty might be overcome.  There were several ways of doing it and it is difficult to say which would be the most satisfactory.  The amendment tabled by the Minister appears to cover the situation fully as far as the trade unions and the particular categories <Col N="417" /> of workers are concerned.  I hope it will do what it sets out to do.</P>
    <P>I should like to place on record my appreciation and that of my trade union of the manner in which the Minister and the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce met the trade union representations and for the attention and courtesy they extended in endeavouring to overcome this difficulty to the satisfaction of everybody concerned.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1958&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Before Section 21, but in Part IV, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>This Part of this Act shall not come into operation until the passing of the Finance Act which shall be passed next after the publication of the report of the commission now considering the income-tax code.&mdash; (Deputy Sweetman.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I was adverting to the fact that the revenue authorities already have adequate powers to investigate expenses and allowances in respect of firms assessed for taxes and that no case has been made for the extension proposed in this Bill. Part IV of the Bill widens these powers considerably.  When the various interests at different times made representations to have some alleviation in the tax code granted, the <Col N="418" /> answer given was that this matter was the subject of inquiry by a commission and that any alteration in the structure, any changes in the allowances permitted, and generally any question of granting some form of remission or alleviation in respect of businesses and firms, would have to await the publication of the commission's report.  This proposal, therefore, is a departure from what has been the generally accepted view that, until that commission reports, the law should be allowed to remain as it is.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of some surprise that, at a time when the general aim is to attract to this country foreign capital for the purpose of development, to encourage by granting allowances in respect of development projects, or by altering the law as is at present being done in the amendment of the Control of Manufactures Act and in the measure dealing with external investment, when all the emphasis and accent have been placed on liberalising the restrictions which operate, this proposal should go in the opposite direction.  Undoubtedly foreign investors will seek the place where they can get the most attractive return.  It is common knowledge that particularly American industrialists and businessmen will seek to place investments where they will make the largest profit.</P>
      <P>Already the revenue authorities have adequate powers to secure full returns on whatever expenses are claimed and full particulars of whatever allowances firms or companies seek to secure in order to cover incidentals or extra outgoings that are common in cases of this sort.  The Minister apparently is worrying because companies may be including in their accounts provision for perquisites or allowances to directors which the revenue authorities consider unjustifiable.  Foreign investors and even foreign technicians who might consider coming here will be anxious to know in advance not merely what terms are offered to them but what tax deductions will be made from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many companies, the procedure is that a certain sum is allowed for expenses for refreshment for clients or <Col N="419" /> customers, and so on.  Directors or senior officials of companies are allowed such expenses and all reputable companies vouch for a sum for these items on a basis that has been accepted over the years by the revenue authorities.  Some people criticise that and feel it could be abused, but anyone who has experience of business understands that it is the normal practice to entertain people when discussing business and frequently business is discussed when people are given a luncheon, and so forth.  In addition, provision is made for other small matters, such as meeting these people and discussing a question with them.  The provision enshrined in Part IV proposes to tighten up on that, on the basis that, as was mentioned on the Second Stage by the Minister, a similar provision was introduced some years ago in Britain.</P>
    <P>Conditions in Britain are entirely different.  They have there a very highly industrialised country, a condition of almost, if not full, employment, in contrast with conditions here where we are seeking to develop industries, where we have large numbers of unemployed and where the emphasis is on the development of industry to the maximum extent.  To equate the restrictive practices of the law here on the basis that it has been done in Britain is to refuse to recognise these facts.</P>
    <P>This is also a bad time to do it.  We should not take one item and decide to deal with it in advance of the report of the Commission on Income-Tax.  If we have deferred dealing with a variety of changes, such as P.A.Y.E., which we have deferred on the understanding that a commission will report on it, I feel that in this case we ought not impose further restrictive conditions in the income-tax code or in general taxation in advance of the report of the Commission on Income-Tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that this part is being put into the Act without the Revenue Commissioners having advised as to what the result will be assessed in terms of money?  I cannot conceive the Revenue Commissioners advising the Minister to do this or the Minister accepting that advice, without its being made clear as to whether there is a prevalent practice which it is necessary to cover in this fashion.  If there is no prevalent practice, then we may assume that the revenue to be obtained will be negligible.  If there is a prevalent pracrice I am certain that the Revenue Commissioners can and must have given the Minister an estimate.</P>
      <P>I know of no body of people in the State who are able to estimate better and more accurately what is going to arise from any piece of legislation than the people on whom the Minister is depending in this matter.  I am sure that there must have been some estimate taken before a part of an Act such as this was brought in, knowing, as everybody knows, the amount of irritation, trouble, administrative expense and detail that will be involved. I do not think this Act is being brought in simply because somebody thought that we have left out something that is in the British Finance Acts of 1948 and 1952 and that it would be bad if we did not do everything here that they do.  There must have been some attempt made to assess what is involved. If such an attempt was not made, the answer seems to be that it is not worth going to the tremendous amount of trouble that it will cause.</P>

Personally, I am more interested in the justice of the case than in the amount to be derived from this.  We should try to have justice for every taxpayer.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 13, line 40, to delete &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necessarily&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want to get some indication from the Minister as to what is &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necessarily&rdquo; in the performance of certain duties.  These words have been included since the Finance Act of 1918 but I find it impossible, in relation to Part IV of this Act, to know what is included and to know what the Minister seeks to cover. If we knew what the Minister seeks to cover we would have a better chance of ascertaining whether it is reasonable or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a wholesaler here has a visit from a prospective purchaser from England, <Col N="422" /> France or elsewhere, it is clear to all of us that if he is not going to pay him the courtesy of looking after him and entertaining him he will not get the atmosphere in which he is likely to do business.  Everybody agrees that it is necessary in modern days to entertain such a visitor.  When it comes to entertaining him, one might go to a fish and chip shop or one might go to one of the more expensive restaurants in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There would be no export business done if customers were brought into the Dáil restaurant. That is quite certain.  There must be a very great difference in ways of looking after a customer.  It might be entirely necessary and would be accepted as being entirely necessary if somebody came over here to give him lunch but I cannot see how one could say that it was necessary to give him a good lunch, to bring the discussion down to plain terms.  On that basis, it could be quite well argued by an inspector of taxes that because one had given a customer lunch in a restaurant off Grafton Street whereas one of the restaurants in O'Connell Street would have done quite well enough, the difference was not allowable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, an inspector could make the argument that the person concerned might have got the business anyway and ask how could he say that it was necessary for him to take the potential customer out to lunch in order to get it.  Once we delve down into the type of detail into which Part IV delves, we have to look at the detail from the other point of view.  I want to stress that it is the Minister by the various provisions in Part IV, who has deliberately decided to go down to that range.  Having regard thereto, it is up to him to give some general indication in this House, for the information of the people in the House and as a line to the business community outside, as to what type of expenses he has in mind should be allowed and what type of expenses should not be allowed.  There must <Col N="423" /> have been consideration given to this when Section 21 was being framed and I should like the Minister to tell us what were the examples put to him in connection with which he felt this section was desirable.</P>

      <P>These words, of course, refer to Rule 9 of Schedule E, which was enacted by the Act of 1853.  They merely have the effect of excluding, as it were, employees who are already covered by that section.  The words &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necessarily&rdquo; are used in that section and have been used, it is obvious, for over 100 years and it is not proposed to amend that rule.  It has stood there for over 100 years and I do not think it is the Deputy's intention that it should be amended.  As to taking it out of this particular place, if this section had not been drafted and Rule 9 had stood, it would have the same effect&mdash;I am not a lawyer but I am sure it would have the same effect&mdash;and we need not have put in all this stuff at all.  If, in fact, the Deputy is attempting to amend Rule 9, I do not think his intention would be effected by the amendments put in here.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(3) The reference in sub-section (1) of this section to any sum paid in respect of expenses does not include a reference to any sum paid in respect of expenses by a body corporate to any of its directors or employees where the amount so paid is equivalent to the amount which has been agreed by the Revenue Commissioners as being properly allowable with any trade union, or other recognised body or association acting on behalf of employees or directors.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to try in some way to reduce the very great volume of correspondence, claims and appeals that will arise out of the operation of Section 21 as it stands.  It seems to me quite clear that the section would throw a very great burden on the administrative machine and also on the general body of trading companies. Many payments that formerly passed unnoticed will now become the subject of investigation by the inspectors of taxes.  Correspondence will take place about them and in a great number of cases, I am quite certain, the assessments will go to appeal.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that there is a principle established at the moment that, in the case of a particular class of persons or people in a certain trade or profession, some organisation acting on their behalf will make arrangements with the Revenue Commissioners that a specific sum in respect of the particular expenses of that trade will be generally allowed.  I take, for instance, the case of a carpenter. The trade union would negotiate with the Revenue Commissioners who would agree in the case of a carpenter that a certain sum say £50 a year, would in the normal course of events be allowable to that man for the particular expenses of his trade&mdash; tools, clothing and so on.  A carpenter is not the type of person who normally would come within the scope of the section because he is not a £1,500 a year man, but I am instancing a carpenter as a handy example to support my argument.</P>
    <P>I want to have established in this <Col N="425" /> country the principle, that, first of all, the revenue, will recognise the right of other organisations acting for classes of people to enter into such negotiations.  Having established that principle of the right to negotiate on behalf of persons in their organisations, I want it laid down that in all normal assessments on persons in that class, the allowance will be exempted from the provisions of this section.  It seems to me that very considerable advantage would flow from that, in omitting from all the returns a certain amount of expense payments which otherwise would clutter up the machinery. There would be no disadvantage, I think, to the general purposes which are envisaged in the section.  I cannot see that it would make the section less effective in any way. Agreement by the Revenue Commissioners will be a condition precedent, and I think in fact it will be a considerable improvement. I ask the Minister to accept the principle enshrined in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy mentioned, he is aware that this section will apply only to employees with £1,500 or more. These agreements referred to by the Deputy have been extended so far only to trade unionists for certain uniforms, tools, and so on and there never has been an agreement with any sort of professional or higher organisation like that where earnings might reach £1,500 a year, but if it did occur then the principle would be applied.  There is no doubt about that.  Let us take the example of say engineers.  If we became highly industrialised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Doctors would never reach £1,500 a year anyway.  Say we have become highly industrialised and we have a certain class of engineers and we make an agreement that they get an allowance of £300.  That would apply but of course they would have to make returns as otherwise there would be no check on whether or not they were getting more.  The £300 would be allowed automatically.  I think to put in the amendment would operate as a restriction.  I do not think it would achieve anything and it might be a <Col N="426" /> burdensome restriction if it ever had to be applied.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 21 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take a very serious view of this Section 21 and in fact of all of Part IV of the Bill.  For <Col N="427" /> the moment I am dealing particularly with Section 21.  It is quite clear that it is causing a very great amount of public discussion and in the business community generally there is grave concern about what the section will entail.  That worry is not directed to, or arising from, the fact that people will be paying additional tax as a result of the provisions of Section 21. The concern is with the fact that a great deal of trouble, annoyance and fuss will be involved in complying with the section.  There will be a great deal of recording, analysis and administration that were not necessary before.</P>
      <P>Section 21 is taken holus-bolus from the British Income Tax Act of 1952. That Act is the latest development dealing with this subject and this section is taken from it.  I think we should endeavour to solve our own problems in our own way.  There are just a couple of points to indicate we are not thinking of our own situation and dealing with it as it arises, but rather that we are in this Bill, to some extent, just doing what the British do without comparing the situations here and in Britain.  There are two small indications &mdash;not very significant&mdash;to bear out my point of view on that.  We have been talking about Rule 9 of the rules applicable to Schedule E and that is to be continued in force.  Nothing is to be done about it.  Surely when this part of the Bill was being framed it would have been a suitable time, if Rule 90 needed cleaning up, to do it.  When you see &ldquo;the cost of keeping and maintaining a horse to enable him to perform the same&rdquo; faithfully preserved it is an indication that there is a certain approach to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not bound to keep a horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but why not change the rule?  The fact that the rule is just copied holus-bolus without any critical approach to it would seem to bear out my argument.  Earlier we had the case where a provision about hops was just carried forward because it had been there.  These things are not important, I admit, but they indicate that the type of critical thinking <Col N="428" /> about our own situation which should take place before a whole series of provisions such as we have in Part IV were brought in, has not been done.</P>
      <P>The provision in regard to expenses previously was very sensible.  The Revenue Commissioners took the view that expenses were a normal business procedure and they said there was no point in adding expenses to a man's income just for the sake of making a similar deduction later on.  The idea of round figures or global figures for expenses was fairly widely accepted. Section 21 will do away with that and the onus will now be on the taxpayer to prove the expenses were necessary. It would seem to me that the Revenue Commissioners will now be entitled to say that any expense paid at all is income unless you can prove that it is not.  That is putting a very serious burden on a hardworking businessman.</P>
      <P>I can see what the Minister is trying to do and we must all sympathise with him in his objective.  He wants to iron out the discrepancies and make the law equally applicable to everybody and see to it that nobody will use expenses to get an advantage over a fellow taxpayer.  The Minister has said he is not terribly interested in the amount the revenue will collect by virtue of these provisions and it is obvious, I think in our circumstances that the revenue will be very small. The only justification for Section 21, therefore, must be that aspect of ironing out discrepancies and making one taxpayer equal to another.  Surely the burden which will be put on the business community should not lightly be put there?  The abuse would have to be fairly serious before it would be right to think of introducing these provisions, with the consequential annoyance and burden they inflict on the business community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fairly satisfied, and it is the opinion of my colleagues, that there is no great volume of abuse in this matter.  There is some, I suppose.  I think I can honestly say from my knowledge and the knowledge of those I know and with whom I am associated, that if there is any abuse it is of very small dimensions and is not sufficient to justify the provisions of Section 21. <Col N="429" /> There is no doubt that this will lead to a very great deal of additional administrative work on the part of trading concerns.  For that reason, I feel the Minister might have second thoughts about the whole section.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the export business aspect of the matter.  In this House, we have already adopted the idea and the principle that the tax code should be adjusted in order to encourage export business.  It is a vital national necessity that we should export.  In particular, we must get increasing exports in the industrial field.  There is only one way to secure increased exports and that is by aggressive selling policies abroad.</P>
    <P>A very great deal of expense must be incurred in the modern business world&mdash;exactly the sort of expense that will come under the provisions of Section 21, namely, travelling, entertainment and other such expenses. There is nothing wrong, immoral or incorrect about that sort of expenditure. It is necessary.  It is vital to your selling policy.  In fact, it is the only way, in a great deal of cases, to get business.</P>
    <P>Whatever about applying the section to our internal situation here, the Minister should seriously consider exempting from the provisions of Section 21 the case of a person incurring this type of expense when he is pursuing export business.  A person going abroad and out in the world markets must be allowed a great deal of latitude in this regard.  That is how the situation is and we have no control over it.  To ask the type of person I am interested in to think continually of the terms of Section 21 when he is going about his business is surely not reasonable.</P>
    <P>When, in 1952, these provisions were brought into the British House of Commons there was a section&mdash;I think Section 64&mdash;which provided power to the inspector of taxes to give dispensations from the provisions.  In other words, in certain circumstances, in order to avoid unnecessary administrative inconvenience, the inspector of taxes was empowered to give dispensation <Col N="430" /> in respect of certain types of payments and that left them out of the provisions altogether.  As we adopted the bad provisions of the British Income-Tax Act, 1952, it seems extraordinary that we did not also accept the one sensible provision, to my mind, in the whole measure, namely, the dispensation section.  It is the one section which would make the Bill workable. I would ask the Minister to consider very seriously the introduction of provisions whereby inspectors of taxes, in the proper circumstances, can give dispensations such as are envisaged in the British Act.</P>
    <P>The Royal Commission which sat in Britain in relation to the matter had this to say about these dispensations: &ldquo;The power to give dispensations is a valuable instrument for lightening the burden of administering the Act.&rdquo; That seems to be true.  As that expert commission had that to say about these dispensations I find it very difficult to see why we did not adopt a similar idea here.</P>
    <P>Another matter in relation to this section which also occupied the time of the Royal Commission in Great Britain was home-saving.  That commission recommended that the idea of home-saving be abolished, be no longer practised.  Here, the Revenue Commissioners seek to establish that, if you are allowed certain expenses for travelling or for meals, and if you have a wife and home, there is a corresponding saving at home and that that amount should be disallowed and only the excess amount granted as an allowance. I fully agree with the report of the British Commission on that point.</P>
    <P>The question of home-saving is completely artificial.  It has no reality.  It leads to a great deal of trouble, annoyance and inconvenience for everybody concerned.  I think we might very wisely adopt that recommendation of the British Commission and abolish once and for all this concept of home-saving.</P>
    <P>With regard to the section itself, I should like to mention line 35, sub-section (1).  Sub-section (1) reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, any sum paid in <Col N="431" /> respect of expenses, by a body corporate to any of its directors or to any person employed by it in an employment to which this Part of this Act applies, shall, if not otherwise chargeable to income-tax as income of that director or employee, be treated for the purposes of Rule I of the Rules applicable to Schedule E as a perquisite of the office or employment of that director or employee and included in the emoluments thereof assessable to income-tax (including sur-tax) accordingly, but nothing in this sub-section shall prevent a claim for a deduction being made under Rule 9 of those Rules in respect of any money expended wholly, exclusively and necessarily in performing the duties of the office or employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;perquisite&rdquo; occurs in line 35.  My only worry is the use of that word.  In Rule 4 (3) of the Rules applicable to Schedule E, a &ldquo;perquisite&rdquo; is defined.  I am wondering if there is some confusion there.  In the 1918 Rules applicable to Schedule E, a perquisite has a very definite meaning and is very clearly defined.  If the meaning attached to &ldquo;perquisite&rdquo; by sub-section (3) of Rule 4 is still to prevail, I think this section would need amendment. That is only a drafting matter but I would ask the Minister to look into it.</P>
    <P>Generally, those are my views on this section.  As I said originally, I can see what the Minister is seeking to achieve but I think he is turning his efforts in the wrong direction.  I do not think the abuse is prevalent to any great degree. The Minister has said already he thinks it is on the increase, but I doubt that very much.  It would need to be much more serious than it is, and it would need to increase a very great deal more, before it would justify the trouble and annoyance that Section 21 will cause.  I ask the Minister, in addition to the particular points I have put to him, to have second thoughts about the section as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still at a loss to understand why there has to be a change in the present practice.  The <Col N="432" /> present practice is that inspectors of taxes allow lump sums in respect of expenses for almost anyone in the upper income group, and that does not necessarily mean people with over £1,500 a year.  There are employees in our business who are drawing less than that and who are allowed, by inspectors of taxes, sums in respect of unvouched expenses, up to £120, £130 and £150 per annum.  The inspector of taxes in each case is perfectly free, and will be able to question any such outlay for expenses. Therefore, I do not see why this very cumbersome provision is now being brought in when inspectors of taxes have powers such as Deputy Cosgrave has already pointed out they have.</P>
      <P>To my mind, it is very desirable that these lump sums should be permissible. There are certain expenses which can be readily vouched, such as travelling expenses or entertainment expenses in an hotel, restaurant and so forth, but there are cases where a businessman may bring home a customer for a meal at home.  It is not giving away any secret that when you bring a customer home for a meal, you usually have a good meal, probably a much better meal than you would have yourself on that night.  You would not have the cold meat on Monday left over from the Sunday Joint. If you entertain your customer on Monday, you would certainly want to have another joint or something rather better.  Is that businessman to incur the expense himself, or has that businessman or his wife now to submit an account vouching that she bought a joint, cooked it with her own fair hands and own ingenuity, and prepared the vegetables, sauces, sweets, the savouries, coffee, liqueurs and drinks, if necessary?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>That shows the whole laughable side of it, but, at the same time, there is the serious side.  That businessman is put to expenses which are not readily vouchable.  For that reason, up to now, inspectors of taxes who are not singled out for their generosity to taxpayers, have always allowed these sums for expenses.  If <Col N="433" /> these sums were allowable up to the present, what the Minister is now doing is making sums subject to taxation which have been found not liable to taxation previously.  That is raising additional revenue out of the business community.  At the same time, the Minister has said the people he is really trying to seek out are those who are not behaving strictly honestly. That may be his intention but he will not catch them that way.</P>
      <P>It is a complete illusion to think that, by a provision such as this, revenue will be able to get a grip on every conceivable bit of expenditure, and will be able to prove whether it is permissible or not, or whether it is wholly, exclusively and necessarily paid out. Similar legislation in England has given rise to large-scale falsification of records and accounts, and I think it is only right to mention it is now the standard practice in certain London restaurants that, instead of giving a tip to the waiter, you pay for your meal and give the receipted bill back to the waiter who is over-joyed to get it. Instead of a tip of 2/- or 5/- he now has a negotiable instrument worth up to £3 or £4.  There are people only too willing to buy that receipted bill from him.  The net result of that legislation is that those who are out to defraud the revenue will be put to slightly greater trouble, but the frauds will continue as they have done.  I hope the Minister does not take it that, following upon legislation such as this, tax evasion will immediately stop.  I canot see why the legislation cannot be left as it is.</P>
      <P>Those honestly returning expenses will continue to do it, but I am afraid a number of people at present honestly returning their expenses will be so infuriated by this legislation that they will be pushed over the edge.  They will decide honesty does not pay and in future will falsify their records, which it is quite easy to do.  The net result will be that honest people will now have much more work to do, whereas the dishonest will be able to get away as easily as they have done before this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what the Minister may say doubts are being cast on the business community as people who intend <Col N="434" /> to defraud the revenue by reason of expense accounts and expense allowances. It is, however, interesting to know that no provision is made which would affect the allowances of Deputies and Senators.  We get a certain amount to cover us for expenses.  There is an allowance in respect of expenses which we do not have to vouch, and I do not see why businessmen should have to vouch and justify their expenses, while Deputies and Senators have not to do it.  I regret having to say so, but, at the same time, I do not see the difference, except it is that the Government says the general standard of probity of Deputies and Senators is so much higher than the standards of employers and directors with salaries of over £1,500 per annum.</P>
    <P>That is an unnecessary and unjustifiable slur on the business community, and just because there are some people who fiddle their accounts, I think it is entirely unnecessary for the Minister to introduce this cumbersome and onerous legislation.  It will impose a very heavy burden on the business community and it will not go anywhere near meeting the situation the Minister has in mind. If the Minister faces up to it, he will see that falsification of accounts can go on as before.  An inspector of taxes, after accounts have been audited and a tax return has been sent in, will have to check back to expense accounts for 18 months or more.  How is an inspector of taxes to get conclusive evidence that an expense of £8 19s. 6d, 18 months before, was wholly, exclusively and necessarily paid in performing the duties of the employer?  Is it not all too obvious that for the purpose of defrauding the revenue that expense can be placed to the credit of an employee who draws less than £1,500 a year?</P>
    <P>The inspector of taxes can never know whether the theatre tickets, the dinner at the Gresham, or wherever it was, were actually enjoyed by the director or office boy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;or by the director's secretary or by the director's wife and children.  There will be nothing in the bill to show whether the director has <Col N="435" /> entertained his entire family and family connections on the expenses account, at the expense of the company. I wish the Minister would get it out of his head that it is possible by these means to stop tax evasion.  It is not, and it will not do it.  It will cast a slur on the business community and put an additional load on them.  As the Minister admits himself that he does not know whether he will get any more revenue out of it, I cannot understand why he should do it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I understand the difficulty in which Deputy Booth finds himself.  The Minister was sent in to do this and he knows &ldquo;sweet Fanny Adams&rdquo; about the proposals he has put before the House.  He has the broad general idea that he will collar the fellows who have expense accounts, but that is all he knows.  That is why one cannot get &ldquo;hum&rdquo; or &ldquo;haw&rdquo; out of him.  He does not know; he does not particularly care; and he is too lazy to learn.  I do not blame him for that, as it is a very complex business.</P>
      <P>My complaint relates to that complexity. Because it is a business of considerable complexity, we set up an Income-Tax Commission and we put certain individuals to great trouble as a result of their accepting our warrant to go on that commission.  I met one of them recently who said to me: &ldquo;If I had ever dreamed what the acceptance of membership of this commission meant, I would never have accepted it.&rdquo;  They are equipped to investigate this whole matter of expense.  If this matter had been referred to them, we would have had the minutes of evidence tendered and the conclusions of an informed commission on that evidence, before us when we came to debate these proposals.</P>
      <P>The plain fact is that there are now six of us sitting here and no one of us understands what these proposals involve.  There is nobody in Oireachtas Éireann who knows what they involve and there are very few&mdash;perhaps two or three individuals&mdash;in the Revenue Commissioners who know what they involve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know perfectly well that, if this legislation is enacted, those of us <Col N="436" /> who are concerned in trade or business will hire accountants and company lawyers to sit down and say what it means.  That is a wholly wrong procedure for legislating.  That fact, to which I now refer, of what we, the business community, will have to do on the passage of this legislation into law, leads me to the second point which Deputy Booth has made.  We all know the community is divided broadly into the tax dodgers and the fellows who do not dodge taxes.  The tax dodgers will call in their accountants and company lawyers and ask them for means of riding a coach and four through this legislation, and they will find it. Then the Revenue Commissioners, in three or four years' time, will discover some of the dodges these boys have thought up and will bring in more legislation to meet these dodges.</P>
    <P>This has been going on for generations, with the result that I have no hesitation in saying that at this moment there is no living man who understands the income-tax law of this country.  It is certain that there is no citizen of this State who can make his own income-tax return.  He has two courses open to him&mdash;one is to hire a firm of accountants to do it for him and the other is to throw himself on the mercy of the inspector of taxes and ask him to fill it out.  If the demand is not too extravagant, he can pay it, but if the demand appears to be out of the way, he must post it to a firm of accountants and try to get them to unravel the state of affairs and see what they can do.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fantastic situation that we have built up in this community in the past 30 years an income-tax code which affects the income of more than half the population, which nobody understands or could hope to understand? This complexity has grown very largely out of the <i>ad hoc</i> attempt to frustrate the tax dodger, which has been uniformly unsuccessful.  It has always forced them to drop one tax dodge, only to discover that they have evolved two or three more dodges.  In the meantime, the unfortunate taxpayer who simply wants to pay his taxes&mdash;partly because he is an honest man, a law-abiding man and partly <Col N="437" /> because he has a horror of allowing possible claims to grow against him which might come down on him like a hundredweight of bricks in five or ten years' time.  Doubtless, the honest taxpayer is not actuated by unmixed motives, but whatever his motives are, he wants to pay his taxes as they fall due.  He is reduced to the stage, as a result of this growing forest of complex law, that he is no longer able to comply with the law without expert technical advice to determine what the law is.  That is not a good thing.</P>
    <P>I understood we set up the Income-Tax Commission, first, for the purpose of determining whether this was the best method of collecting the revenue the State required and, secondly, if direct income-taxes were the best method, to find out if the existing system could be simplified and a great deal of the unnecessary red tape associated with it abolished.  That was its purpose and, as far as I know, the Minister applauded the decision to have this matter carefully investigated.</P>
    <P>We at the moment technically are discussing Section 21, but in fact Section 21 constitutes only one section of Part IV of the Bill.  What we are discusing really is Part IV of the Bill, and that part consists of eight sections. Has anybody in the House taken the trouble to sit down and read in detail these eight sections?  Perhaps six Deputies out of 147 have done it, and, of the six Deputies who may have done so, I very much doubt if three of them have understood it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that legislation must be brought before this House from time to time which, of its nature, is highly complex, but it ought not be brought before the House without a White Paper or some kind of <i>vade mecum</i> which makes it comprehensible to those Deputies who are concerned to understand it.  I do not believe that the full implications of Part IV can be made fully comprehensible to this House and its members by any White Paper prepared by the <Col N="438" /> Revenue Commissioners.  When we get a White Paper from them, objective as they seek to make it, they are stating the revenue side of the case&mdash; which, of course, must be stated, must be perfectly considered and evalued.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the purpose of our setting up the commission was that the revenue&mdash;who are the public servants who would be required to come before that body&mdash;could most trenchantly state the revenue case, but at the same time, the other parties concerned would be free to reply thereto. That would leave for us, the legislators of the State, the evidence to peruse and the conclusions of the commission to consider.  It has never been suggested that the conclusions of such a commission are binding on this House. They are nothing more than recommendations.</P>
      <P>To-day, when we were discussing the Transport Bill and I was asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce to consider restoring the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act to persons convicted under the Transport Acts, he considered it to be a complete answer to all my arguments to pick up the Report of the Transport Commission and read out one paragraph in which they said they believed the difficulties were so great that the minimum fines and the suspension of the Probation of Offenders Act were desirable, in order to give effect to new transport legislation.</P>
      <P>The next Minister rambles in and presents Part IV of this Bill and says&mdash;&ldquo;No.  I will not postpone this operation until it has been examined by the Income-Tax Commission.  If this matter is under consideration by the Income-Tax Commission&rdquo;&mdash;which he does not know&mdash;&ldquo;so far as I am concerned it is <i>res judica</i> already and they can stop their consideration as I am going to legislate now.&rdquo; I think when you press him to indicate what his views are that he has not got any, because, any more than the rest of us, he does not understand what Part IV involves.  There is nobody who understands Part IV.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly in Ballaghaderreen and in every village and town in Ireland and that is one of the things which I think is so grotesquely unbecoming in this legislation.  Deputy Sweetman has already referred to the fact that every shopkeeper in Ireland may have to consider whether the chop he gives to a customer who comes in and gets dinner in the kitchen, can legitimately be charged up, or whether he is to pay income-tax on it because he is not entitled to have his living allowance out of the profits of the shop. Of course in the old days it would be quite true for the Minister for Finance to say that that did not apply in rural Ireland because shopkeepers and traders were not incorporated companies. That has very largely changed in the last 30 to 40 years.  A surprising number of small country businesses have become incorporated for their own protection, and very wisely, in order to avoid other tax consequences, of being devastated by inheritance tax and death duties, if they are not an incorporated company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the evil; that there is already being built up a volume of case law in England to interpret the impact of this on British conditions.  What is going to happen here is that it is going to impact on Irish conditions.  The only way somebody in rural Ireland will be able to determine if this Act applies to his case is to go to court, and everybody knows if you go to court you end up in the Supreme Court.  It is like the poor fellow who fixed the law of bailement.  It was the case of the unfortunate man who had a cask of wine and it fell off his cart.  The cask was worth about £7 10s. but the chancery lawyers held that this was the ideal issue on which to determine, <Col N="440" /> once and for all, the true significance of the law of bailement and the case went to the House of Lords.  When it was finally determined the costs for both parties were £235,000, but the law of bailement has been settled for all time.</P>
    <P>Some unfortunate country publican here will proceed to get the true interpretation of this part of the Bill. Deputy Haughey understands the correct interpretation of this Bill and some unfortunate man will go to him and he will say that he understands precisely the meaning of this Bill.  That unfortunate client will go into battle with the Revenue Commissioners.  They may start litigation in the home quarters and then go to the Circuit Court, then to the Court of Appeal, and end up in the Supreme Court and have the satisfaction of demonstrating in the end that Deputy Haughey was half right and the commissioners half right, but Deputy Haughey fails and the man will be made bankrupt.</P>
    <P>Then under Section 27 of this Act the Revenue Commissioners will get a decree against them and if they do not pay promptly what the Revenue Commissioners have recovered against them they will not be brought to court to get an instalment against them. The decree will be countersigned by the superintendent and the man will be dragged out of his own drawing-room as a leading Fianna Fáil supporter was last week, and put in jail.</P>

      <P>If they do not understand it, as I believe none of us understand it, there is only one way of determining it, and that is to go to the courts for interpretation.  Is that not so?  All that could be avoided if these matters were given adequate consideration by the commission and we in Dáil Éireann knew what we intended to do.  Is that not so?  If, subsequently, some unfortunate taxpayer gets involved in litigation arising out of what we intended in Dáil Éireann he will become involved in heavy expenses, <Col N="441" /> ending up with a decision of the courts that we had not adequately expressed our intention.  There is a well-established remedy for that.  You can amend the law to make the will of Dáil Éireann prevail over the interpretation or, as we call it, the misinterpretation, and adequate provision can be made to compensate the individual who has been mulcted by heavy costs, but proceed on the assumption that we had effectively expressed our will in the first Act.  Nobody knows what we intend to do and nobody is taking steps to find out.</P>
      <P>I should like to be able to say that I believed this was due to some Machiavellian design of the Minister for Finance and that he had some dreadful, dark purpose.  I do not believe that is so.  I do not believe he has the faintest notion of what he is doing.  I believe this was thrust into his hand and that he was told it was something to prevent tax dodgers, something which would sound grand at the South Dublin by-election.  We are going to have equality amongst all taxpayers and the rich fellows are going to be made pay.  It will not take a feather out of the richer fellows.  The Revenue Commissioners will catch up with the richer fellow but they will then go back into battle and begin again, and as sure as there is an eye in a goat, the Revenue Commissioners will catch up with him and nail him again.  In the process, however, a growing number of relatively inoffensive shopkeepers, merchants and small manufacturers, who have not got the resources to go in for this kind of thing, will have their ears nailed to a variety of posts, designed to capture erring capitalists and tax dodgers and it becomes a kind of ghastly battle in which the innocent suffer a growing burden of complexity.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I am obliged to say that the only genuine beneficiary is the company lawyer and the cute accountant. I remember the day when we could transact income-tax business without any accountant.  It cost me only £8 to get an accountant to make out my income-tax returns.  With this legislation accumulating, the bill will grow.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt it is.  It is growing.  They used to do it for two at one time, but it is becoming so complicated now and it takes so long that it is eight, and will be ten by the time this is finished, so that they benefit, the lawyers benefit and the tax-dodgers benefit, while the Revenue Commissioners continue conscientiously to do their duty and the bewildered taxpayer becomes more and more bewildered with the passage of each of these Bills.</P>
      <P>I want to renew the suggestion, already made and rejected by the Minister, I understand, that Part IV of this Bill should be postponed until it has been examined by the Income-Tax Commission.  I want, and I suppose every Deputy wants, to prevent the exploitation of the tax code in order to, make money for tax-dodgers.  Every Deputy wants everybody to bear his fair share of the taxes imposed.  But our desire to achieve that end should not send us like bulls into a china shop whirling a scimitar, whether in the form of horns, hooves or knives, because that procedure hurts innocent people much more than the original evil which we seek to abate.</P>
      <P>The common purpose can be achieved in the ordinary way, can be done effectively and can be done so that justice is not only done but that everybody sees that justice is being done. That is an important consideration.  I think I would be right in saying that, in principle, we are all agreed with the Minister that if there is tax evasion, it ought to be stopped.  We are prepared to help him stop it, but we want to know what we are doing.  The way to enable us to know what we are doing is to let this matter be adequately examined by the commission we have established for that purpose.  If and when that is done, we are perfectly prepared to deal with the Finance Bill in the Autumn or any time of the year when there is adequate information before us properly to consider the substance of Part IV of the Bill now submitted.</P>

      <P>We have been discussing this Finance Bill very objectively and without politics.

      <P>It is because the Deputy cannot think of anything but politics. I should like to deal with one point raised by Deputy Booth in reference to Deputies' expenses.  I am quite certain if a director of a company could claim he had, let us say, to spend £10 or £12 a month on stamps, that he had to stay at some hotel in Dublin at least two days a week at his own expense, that he had to run a car in his own county to look after the interests of his customers&mdash;constituents, in our case&mdash;that he had to subscribe to many charities in his county as well as national charities, it would be seen that, when all these were added up, that director would be claiming very much more than the £600 per year we are getting.  It is wrong that anybody should think that Deputies are going to get off better in their expenses than any director or any employee under this Bill.  We should not allow that notion to get out, that directors will be harshly treated in that way.</P>

      <P>It is coming near closing time and I do not think I have anything else to add except this point. It was said we had power already.  The inspector has power at the moment to get information from the employer only on his liability; he is not empowered to get information on the employee's liability.  If the employer, let us say, <Col N="444" /> has allowed £500 expenses to his employee, he need not, under the present law, tell the inspector he has allowed more than £200 and the inspector has to accept the fact that the employee is getting only £200.

      <P>I sympathise with the Minister in the complexity of this matter.  Anybody who has been concerned in business appreciates the great complexity of these matters.  All I am asking is that we should be afforded an opportunity of considering proposals of this kind with some adequate information.  I do not think the Minister has it.  I do not think he is in a position to give it to us.  I do not find particular fault with the Minister's being in that position because I do not believe it is possible for him to accumulate and disseminate in this House, off his cuff, the kind of information requisite adequately to consider proposals of this character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What maddens me is that we have the machinery now functioning to give us all that information and we have the means at the Minister's disposal to bring into this House the fullest information in regard to all this matter, so that if any of us raised a question which was reasonable or necessary for the proper consideration of this matter, he could say: &ldquo;Turn to page 38 and you will find the matter dealt with fully there&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Turn to page 94 of the report and you will find two cases quoted of the conclusions of the commission <Col N="445" /> on this issue.  I am not against the conclusions of the commission; I am not accepting the conclusions of the commission. I have considered their conclusions on the evidence, but, having proved the evidence and added to it, in my own experience as Minister for Finance, I am rejecting the commission's recommendation and asking the House likewise to reject it.&rdquo;  We know then where we are are.  We know what we are doing and we know the merits of the arguments put before us.  I submit that at this moment nobody in this House knows what we are doing, not even Deputy Haughey who says he understands the meaning of the sections but admits he has no idea how they will impact upon the lives of our people.

      <P>The necessity for raising this matter arises out of the fact that up to the present the representations made by the Dublin Corporation in connection with the vacancy for the post of city manager have met with little other than contempt.  This city of ours has a population of 600,000 people.  It has had the doubtful distinction since 1930, or thereabouts, of functioning under an ill-conceived type of administration&mdash;a city manager acting not only for the Dublin Corporation but for a substantial contiguous local authority, the Dublin County Council, and a third authority which is not germane to the present discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This intolerable position has created serious difficulty over the years and has provided the City of Dublin with a most unsatisfactory type of administration. Nobody could conceive as reasonable a position in which the city manager or the Dublin Corporation desirous of getting information from the adjoining authority sits down and writes a letter to himself and, in due course, replies to that letter written by himself to himself as manager of the Dublin County Council.  That situation has rendered the administration of <Col N="446" /> the affairs of this city most difficult.</P>
    <P>One difficulty has been the failure over the last ten years to appoint a housing architect despite all the efforts made by the members of the Dublin Corporation.  The work which should appertain to a proper housing architect has been carried on by an officer not charged with that responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 8th August, 1955, a resolution was adopted by the Dublin Corporation under the provisions of the relevant statute calling for separate local government of the city and for the appointment of a city manager solely responsible for the administration of the City of Dublin.  A copy of that resolution was forwarded to the Department of Local Government.  The adjoining local authority, in accordance with statutory provisions, adopted a similar resolution calling for a manager responsible solely for the administration of the county.  No positive action was taken in that matter by the Department or the Minister concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 8th July, 1957, the matter came before the City Council again.  A resolution was adopted appointing a deputation to wait upon the Minister. That deputation was constituted of the then Lord Mayor of Dublin, Councillor Lorcan Burke, Councillor Robert Briscoe, T.D., P.C., Councillor William Coleman, P.C., Councillor Michael G. Dempsey, Councillor Denis Larkin and Councillor Thomas Stafford.  Nothing was heard as to the reception of that deputation by the Minister.  Later in the same year it was decided to enlarge the deputation.  As far as I am aware&mdash;if I am wrong I shall willingly express my regret to the Minister&mdash;no invitation was extended to the elected representatives of the City Council to <Col N="447" /> meet the Minister and explain their difficulties.  Whether correspondence passed between officials is of no immediate concern.</P>
    <P>I hold that before appointing a new city manager the Minister should meet the local representatives and hear their case for the appointment of a city manager to administer the affairs of the city alone.  I cannot read the Minister's mind, but from information available to me as a Deputy or as a member of that local authority, it seems the Minister has not given any indication of the situation and certainly has not, as far as I am aware, had any discussions with the elected public representatives.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I raise the matter on this occasion is that it appears the Minister has exercised the power which he possesses to refer the filling of the post to the Local Appointments Commissioners. Evidently he was not prepared to hear the reasoned representations even of members of his own Party representing the corporation before he took the steps he has taken. The fear of many of us in this city is that the position may be filled under conditions of which we are not aware, on which we have no opportunity of commenting.  The citizens who are supposed to rely in municipal matters on the work of the city manager, the local council and the staff will be faced with a <i>fait accompli.</i>  Consequently we may arrive at the situation of having a joint manager or a manager occupying two posts or occupying a dozen posts in the next 20 or 25 years and nobody can do anything about it.</P>
    <P>The legislation referred to by the Minister this afternoon indicates that the Minister will require the concurrence of the Ministers for Health and Social Welfare because the administration in our city is so inextricably linked up that very few people know exactly at what point the various authorities start and finish.  While the council was making its representations to the Minister we were informed that his colleague, the Minister for Health, is insistent on having a unified health authority.  Therefore, the legislation by the Minister which appears to make <Col N="448" /> it easy for him to consider favourably the representations of the local representatives may well be prejudiced to such an extent by other Ministers in the Government that he may be actually powerless.</P>
    <P>On at least two occasions since 1955, when the acting city manager of Dublin indicated his desire to retire from office, the council, because of the unsatisfactory nature of the present position, have refused to operate the machinery for the appointment of a successor.  I personally am not concerned with how the manager is appointed or who the individual is, but I am concerned that the ordinary citizens of Dublin, who will depend to a great extent on the administration by a manager, should be aware of the conditions governing the appointment and the powers and the duties of the manager.</P>
    <P>The Minister must accept the responsibility for his Department and possibly for an act of his predecessors.  I am anxious to ensure that those who represent the citizens of Dublin will be given an opportunity to meet the Minister not just as members of this House, whether of his own or of any other Party&mdash;there is no great value in that except perhaps to the members of a particular Party&mdash;but as members of the local authority, and that the Minister will consider their representations before taking action.  In this case I regret very much that it appears to be a fact that the Minister has taken action without affording the elected representatives of the citizens of Dublin an opportunity of speaking to him on the matter.</P>
    <P>That is hardly an action that would commend itself to any responsible individual and I do not think that any Minister, no matter what Government he is in, will gain any kudos by dealing with matters purely on the basis of consideration for his own political supporters. This city has a body called the Dublin Corporation which is supposed to have some authority in local affairs, but if local Government is to continue on any satisfactory basis some effort should be made to deal with this matter in a spirit of harmony.  On this occasion, perhaps we do not want harmony because we have all kinds of <Col N="449" /> statements being made and possibly only because in the City of Dublin a by-election is pending.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister, if he has not taken final action in the matter, to defer a definite decision pending the reception by him of the appointed representatives of the City of Dublin and consideration by him of their representations on the question of a separate manager for the City of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Larkin is in some way confusing the issue when he fears that the action of filling a vacant post will preclude degrouping in the future.  In fact, written into our legislation is the procedure whereby, at any time, whether the post of city manager is vacant or filled, degrouping can take place.  It was in the full knowledge of that legislation and its availability to support degrouping in the future, if it were so decided, allied to the fact that three years have passed since this vacancy first came to hand, that I had the statutory request made to the Appointments Commission for the filling of the post.  I want to reiterate that that in no way prejudges the issue which Deputy Larkin appears to be most concerned about, the whole question of degrouping Dublin City and County.  This will not and does not in any way prejudge or prejudice what may be done in the future about that aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Larkin also gave it as his considered opinion that there is much wrong with the methods by which Dublin has been governed locally since 1930, that an amount of confusion can exist and that it is a rather intricate problem tied up between the three Departments, Local Government, Health and Social Welfare.  From my slight knowledge of the problem, I am inclined to agree with his statement that it is a difficult problem to see in all its details and in full perspective. It is for that reason that, in the few short months I have been in Local <Col N="450" /> Government, I could not at this stage reach a decision, with my limited knowledge, as to whether or not degrouping of Dublin City and Country would be in the best interests of the city and of the county ultimately. Because of its very difficulties, I must keep away from it until I know more about it&mdash;and the Deputy will admit that there is a lot one should know about this whole problem.</P>
    <P>On top of that, I cannot go along willy-nilly at any stage&mdash;even if I had a mind on this matter, which at this stage I have not&mdash;to make up my own mind, when the agreement of two other Ministers is necessary.  That is something which we will have to deal with.  Whatever is the outcome, the three Ministers and their various administrations must have some co-operation, so that the best system may be evolved.  The Deputy will agree that this matter is an important and a difficult one.  I do not feel myself in a position to decide&mdash;and I make no apologies to anybody for not being in possession of the full knowledge I would need&mdash;about this degrouping problem.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also has a complaint that the deputation requested to be met by the Minister was not received. I may be wrong.  Did I gather from him that this request was made some time ago?  Is this a deputation which was to be met by the Minister some time ago?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering about that, as I have been trying to find out where I had fallen down.  In the normal course of events, in a case where there is discretion left with the Minister in regard to a particular decision which a local authority disputes, I would be most anxious to meet local representatives, coming as a deputation from a local authority.  That goes in particular for Dublin, of which I feel I know less than I do of the workings of local authorities throughout the country, which are not so complex and of which I have some experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three years have gone by since this vacancy first arose.  Three months was allowed to the two councils, during <Col N="451" /> which either one of them the city or the county, could make a statutory request direct to the Appointments Commission for the filling of the post. Why was it not done?  Why was the baby let go by default to Local Government and to the Ministers who have since been there?  Having allowed the baby to get across to Local Government, if the child has been mistreated since then, I think the responsibility must to a large extent rest on those who allowed the child to go, by their own voluntary lack of effort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going into that, but that was something the council could do under the law.  As to what is in the files, that is a completely different matter.  The council had three months to do the job in its own way. Now, because it is being done at all, or is proposed to be done, there is exception being taken to it, on the ground that the terms of the appointment should have been discussed with the corporation.  Actually, had I been made as fully aware of their desire to discuss the terms, before the announcement that the appointment was about to be filled, as I have been since, I can assure Deputies I would have met them, although what conclusion might have been reached I really do not know.  Suffice it to say that the conditions which apply to the filling of this post differ in no way whatever from the conditions which have applied generally for a number of years to the filling of all similar posts of county and city manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It may well be that the Deputy is afraid of it.  He will agree with me that seeing what was done there, what had been allowed to operate, what had not been changed, and on which I had not got any direct recent intimation from anybody, it is <Col N="452" /> rather difficult for me to find that everybody else was out of step over these years in Local Government and that I should change the step in order to put it right.  I was not aware that that was so; I am not sure even yet that it is so.  Again, let me say that it does not affect the degrouping position in any respect that I can visualise. The law is still there.  Whatever effort the corporation would wish to make in the future can still be pursued without any prejudice because of the action taken in filling this post.</P>
      <P>It has been said, as a finish up and possibly it was accidental&mdash;I do not know&mdash;that dealing with matters purely on the basis of Party interests in regard to local administration is a bad thing.  I wonder what Deputy Larkin is trying to get at.  No action I have taken and no action I may not have taken, has been dictated by the views of any Party, not to talk of my own&mdash;none whatever&mdash;and I want him to understand that clearly.  I want him to understand that my apparent reluctance to deal with the degrouping problem is due to its being a matter which was before two previous Ministers for a long period, a much longer period than I have had in Local Government. My reluctance is not due to any ill-will I bear the corporation or its members&mdash;far from it&mdash;but due to my lack of complete knowledge of the entire case, which, on his own admission, is most difficult.</P>
      <P>All I can say to Deputy Larkin and to the corporation is that, on this degrouping question&mdash;this is the main trouble&mdash;anything they have to put forward, any views they wish to express, will be considered.  Indeed, if they wish to have a deputation sent in order to let me see their way of looking at things, I should certainly be only too glad to receive those people and get from them the knowledge I have not got and could not be expected to have in such a short time.</P>
