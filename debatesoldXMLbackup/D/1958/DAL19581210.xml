      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that, for the purposes of the National Farm Survey, 1957-58, page 3, &ldquo;household consumption&rdquo; of farm butter, eggs, poultry and pigs is valued at national average agricultural prices, and milk and other items are valued at local prices, but payment in kind to farm employees, such as meals (page 4) is charged at the excessive values fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board (which are substantially in excess of local retail or average prices), and that the &ldquo;hired labour expenses&rdquo; are thereby inflated; and if he will state why the farm workers' diet is given a much higher value than the farmers' diet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the methods of valuation used in respect of &ldquo;household consumption&rdquo; in the National Farm Survey 1957-58 and that they are generally as stated at (1) and (2) of the Deputy's question.  I am also aware that, in the survey, remuneration in kind of employees was valued at Agricultural Wages Board rates in the computation of &ldquo;hired labour expenses.&rdquo;  I consider that the procedure as adopted by the Central Statistics Office in this case was the most appropriate one to use in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agricultural Wages Board is, under sub-section (3) of Section 17 of the Agricultural Wages Board Act, <Col N="1724" /> 1936, empowered to define the benefits or advantages which may be reckoned as payment of wages in lieu of payment in cash, and the value at which these may be reckoned.  These benefits include other items as well as the value of meals supplied to farm workers by their employers.  I cannot accept the Deputy's assumption that, in the Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) Order, 1956, meals and other benefits are charged for at excessive values.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to say that in the National Farm Survey farm workers' diet was given a higher value than farmers' diet since no valuation of the farmers' diet was necessary for the purpose of the survey.</P>
    <P>Question No. 2 postponed.</P>

      <P>I am empowered by the Act to make Records Orders in regard to any workers or classes of workers to whose employment the Act applies.  The need for making any such Order has not arisen.</P>
      <P>The Act does not, however, apply to agricultural workers; and horticultural workers are classifiable under the Act as agricultural workers, with the exception indicated in Section 2 of the Act.</P>
      <P>Whether any particular person comes within the scope of these exceptions could be determined only in the light of all the circumstances of that person's employment.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the Islands of Owey and Lower Cruit are included in the Rosses Rural Area, to which supply was extended under the Rural Electrification Scheme in 1955.  During the development of the Rosses area the householders on these islands were given an opportunity of taking supply but they declined to accept supply on the terms offered.  The board also state that the rates upon which supply can be extended to these householders under a post-development scheme are at present being worked out.  When these rates have been determined and if it appears that acceptable terms can be quoted the board will have a re-canvass of the islands carried out, when each householder will be given a further opportunity of taking supply.</P>

      <P>Testamentary gifts for charitable purposes (including gifts for the advancement of education) are already exempt from Legacy Duty or Succession Duty under Section 32 of the Finance Act, 1934, in cases where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the gifts have been or will be applied to such purposes in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Estate Duty is not a charge on testamentary gifts as such, unless the gift is one of real estate.  In the absence of a direction to the contrary in the will, Estate Duty on personal estate is a testamentary expense and accordingly a general or specific legacy is not diminished by it.  As regards real estate it must be remembered that it is always competent for a testator to direct that a benefit under his will shall be received free of all duties.</P>

      <P>This country has stagiaire agreements with Sweden, Switzerland and France and negotiations are in progress with other European Governments.  Under these agreements persons from either country may take up employment in the other country, normally for 12 months, for the purpose of learning the language and of being trained or gaining experience in industrial, commercial, professional or agricultural practices.</P>
      <P>Under the technical assistance and other projects of the O.E.E.C. and the European Productivity Agency, the various fellowship schemes administered by the Council of Europe, and the technical assistance programme financed from Counterpart funds, opportunities exist for Irishmen to study aspects of their profession or occupation in the industrial, agricultural, scientific and commercial fields in various Western European countries.</P>
      <P>If full use is made of the facilities already available and if, within the necessary budgetary and administrative limits, these facilities continue to be developed, then we will achieve what the Deputy has in mind.  I am not convinced that, in all the circumstances, bilateral agreements for exchange scholarships are required to achieve those objectives.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 37 to 39 together.</P>
      <P>The four murders, referred to by the Deputy as recent, go back to 1946. Beginning with that year, I am glad to be able to inform the House that in the 12 years ended 31st December last, 52 out of 54 murders have been cleared up by the Garda Siochana.</P>
      <P>Three of the four murders referred to by the Deputy occurred within the last two years and one of them occurred only a matter of a few weeks ago.  All three are still the subject of active police inquiry and none of them is regarded as closed.</P>
      <P>The officers in charge of investigations of particular murders or other serious crimes are, of course, the chief superintendent and superintendent for the area concerned, assisted in appropriate cases in the technical aspects by the technical bureau attached to Garda Headquarters.  Since this system has achieved, in relation to murders, a degree of success of over 96 per cent.  I see no justification for the suggestion that it ought to be changed.</P>

However I do not know of any way in which the Department could know how many people had asked for the Department's direct intervention in the execution of their work, since the form they fill does not contain any of that information.  If the form on which they apply does not contain that information, the only way which that information could be obtained is as a result of a visit by one of the supervisors attached to the local office.

      <P>Is it not a fact that the return issued by the Minister shows that there are plans prepared in 423 cases in County Kildare and in 364 cases the work is completed or in course of completion.

      <P>Apart from bog, mountain and waste land, the Land Commission have on hands in County <Col N="1752" /> Galway some 4,000 acres of arable land.  This area does not include remnants of estates of the former Congested Districts Board the comparatively small arable content of which will be utilised mainly in connection with rearrangement schemes. The Land Commission hope to allocate the bulk of the 4,000 arable acres mentioned during the next two years.  It would not be possible to say what additional lands may become available for allotment during this period.  At present, however, proceedings are in progress for the acquisition or resumption of 2,700 acres in the county.</P>
      <P>I might add that during the two year period ended 31st March, 1958, a total area of 11,300 acres was distributed in County Galway amongst 500 allottees and, already this year, a further area of 4,800 acres has been disposed of in 90 allotments.</P>

      <P>Tillage and grazing lettings for the 1958 season, made by public auction, expired on 1st November and 1st December last.  Should it be found impracticable to have a scheme of division ready for operation early in the New Year, the lands will be advertised for letting by public auction for next season.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, since the Dáil last meet, we have had to mourn the death of the Apostolic Nuncio to Ireland, The Most Reverned Dr. Alberto Levame.</P>
      <P>It would, I know, be in accord with the wish of every member that the Dáil should, through you, Sir, officially convey to The Holy Father an expression of our profound regret.</P>
      <P>The late Dr. Levame had a most varied and successful career as a diplomatic representative of the Holy See. He severed in several European capitals and, later, as Nuncio to states in Latin America.  Prior to his appointment here, he held the delicate post of Internuncio at Cairo.</P>
      <P>On his coming amongst us, some four years ago, he made it known that he regarded his appointment to Ireland as the fulfiment of his dearest wish and the climax of his career.  His final desire was that his body should rest here, and remain with us.  Dr. Levame travelled estensively throughout our country, attended many ecclesiastical and civil functions, and everywhere endeared himself to our people by his genial and warm-hearted personality.</P>
      <P>He was made an Honorary Freeman of a number of our cities and, only a few days ago, had conferred upon him an Honorary Doctorate of the national university.</P>
      <P>In conveying to The Holy Father an expression of our regret, we would wish, a Cheann Comhairle, that you would tender also our deepest sympathy with His Holiness on the loss of so distinguished and lovable a representative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main purpose of the Bill is to obtain an extension of up a year in the period for which the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, and the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, apply to members of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  When the 1956 Civil Service legislation was introduced it was intended that it should be followed at an early date by a Bill dealing comprehensively with the staffing of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Accordingly the 1956 legislation provides that it will apply to members of the staff of the Houses for not more than two years.  It has, unfortunately, taken longer than was anticipated to get the proposed Bill ready but it is expected that it will be introduced within the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opportunity of amending legislation is being taken to remove two minor difficulties of interpretation which have come to light in the administration of the 1956 Acts.  The first amendment is designed to remove certain doubts as to the scope of the section dealing with tghe discharge of established civil servants serving on probation.  The second is intended to meet certain queries which have been raised as to the tenure of office of certain temporary civil servants who recruited to what are known as &ldquo;excluded positions&rdquo;.  Positions of this kind are covered by order made by the Civil Service Commissioners the effect of which is to permit recruitment to <Col N="1778" /> the positions otherwise than through competition conducted by the commissioners.</P>
    <P>I could, perhaps, take these matters in more detail when we reach the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain at this stage, because if we wait for the Committee Stage there is no means of moving an amendment. What exactly is meant by this &ldquo;excluded&rdquo; person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows, perhaps, that in the case of certain appointments where it is considered by the Minister or the appointing authority concerned that it would be impossible to get a person who would be suitable by competition, the authority may apply to the Civil Service Commission to have the post scheduled or excluded from the Civil Service Commission procedure and as soon as the Civil Service Commission agrees, it is done in that way.</P>
      <P>The difficulty has arisen that he may apply for an unlimited period or for a stated limited period but, as the clause was drafted, there is doubt whether the person can be removed even at the end of the period and whether the person may not have a claim to remain on in the service.  It is now intended to make it clear that at the end of the period, when the job is, as it were, closed, the person must go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to give us a little more information as to how far the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Bill has progressed? That Bill was to be drafted by the officials here in Leinster House. Has it been so drafted?  Has the draft been submitted, by what I might globally describe as Leinster House, to the Minister for Finance and is the Minister satisfied with the principles on which the Bill has been drawn up? When the Bill is ready for introduction who will introduce it in the House?  Is it the Minister for Finance? I understand the terms and the purpose of the Bill are to put the control of the staffs of the Oireachtas away from the Minister for Finance and it would be an usual position <Col N="1779" /> if the Ceann Comhairle had to get up to introduce the Bill as such.  Is the piloting of the Bill&mdash;because it is a House measure&mdash;to be deputed to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle?  I think it would be well if we had some idea as to what exactly is visualised in regard to this.  It is highly desirable that a Bill would reach the Statute Book at the earliest possible opportunity because the existing situation has anomalies which should be cleared up as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I should like to follow the question raised by Deputy Norton.  Do the provisions of Section 2 mean that if a Minister declares or certifies that it is not possible to obtain a suitable appointee for a post through the ordinary Civil Service Commission procedure he is then entitled, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and, I think, the consent of the Civil Service Commission, in certain circumstances, to have an Exclusion Order made for a period and to appoint a person to that position then, without going through competition procedure?  Does this provision only cover the case where the original Exclusion Order was for a fixed period?  If the Exclusion Order is made without any reference to period does Section 2 come into operation at all or how does it come into operation?</P>
      <P>So far as Section 3 is concerned, am I correct in thinking that if it were not for Section 3 a case might be made that a probationer who is unsatisfactory should be retained until the end of his probation to see whether he us finally unsatisfactory or not?  If that is so, and it is clear half way through the probation period that the probationer will not succeed, it is obviously in his own interest as well as in the public interest that there should be power so to state at that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the Deputy that it is highly desirable that we should deal with the Oireachtas staff because the position is anomalous. From the very begining I think it was contemplated that the staff here would be regarded as in the <Col N="1780" /> service of the State and not in the service of the Government as the ordinary Civil Service departments are said to be.  There has been some delay and perhaps it is my fault.  I did not pursue this matter after coming into office until some few months ago but I have had some conversations with the authorities in this House who discussed the principles and headings and I think we have almost reached the stage where the heads of a Bill can be drawn up by the draftsman.  I had assumed&mdash;perhaps wrongly&mdash;that I would introduce the Bill when it would come to the Dáil, the point being, perhaps, that I would be, as it were, acting on behalf of the Government in handling over authority to the House, authority that was exercised by the Minister for Finance and the Government up to this.  For that reason it would be appropriate that I should bring in the Bill to make that change.  I have already said that I hope we shall be able to bring in that Bill before long, certainly in the new year I hope that we may see the Bill before the summer holidays.  Of course it must go through before the end of next year in any case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have noticed that I was very careful not to allocate any blame to the Minister or his Department.  I have my own views as to where the blame lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 deals with the exclusion.  The difficulty only arises where there is stated period; it does not appear to arise where the period is unlimited.  It has actually been contended in one case when the period ended that the officer should remain and that it was doubtful whether there was power to remove that officer.  It is intended now to make that position perfectly clear.  If the authority as referred to, that is the Minister of the Department, gets permission from the Civil Service Commission to exclude a post for say two years, then at the <Col N="1781" /> end of two years the person in that post must go, unless he gets an extension from the Civil Service Commission.</P>
      <P>On the other point&mdash;where a person comes in on probation&mdash;I think it was always understood that the appointing auhority, that is the Minister of the Department, had the right to get rid of that person if he were unsuitable for any reason.  But there appears to be some doubt about that because the wording here is: &ldquo;at the conclusion of his probationary period.&rdquo;  We are bringing in this provision to make that position perfectly clear.  Actually, we had a case where a post was abandoned by a person on probation and there was no way of getting rid of the person except by bringing the case before the Government and going through the whole procedure as if an established civil servant were being dismissed.  I think it was always intended that the appointing authority would have power to get rid of a person at any time during his probation. In fact, even the Civil Service organisations hold the opinion that if the person is obviously unsuitable, for his own sake the sooner he goes the better because he would then have a better chance of getting alternative employment than he would have after two years.  These are the three point in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like very briefly to &ldquo;recap&rdquo; on some of the things I said in the few moments at my disposal last week.  I began by saying it was a pity the level of the debate from the point of view of the Opposition had been so deplorably low.  I instanced some of the remarks of Deputy Costello, almost the whole of Deputy Dillon's diatribe and the remarks of Deputy Dr. Browne whose speech was merely an example of his obsessive hatred of the Taoiseach.  I might have added Deputy Norton's remarks about governing by jackboot and put them into that category.  I did mention, however, that at the end of Dr. Browne's speech he asked the question: If Fianna Fáil Deputies would vote in favour of this Bill had they the opportunity of a straight vote?  I said I certainly would vote in favour of the Bill if I were given the opportunity of a free vote of the House.  I went on then to give some of the reasons which would prompt me to be very much in favour of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things which must be very important to every Deputy, particularly members of a Party who put forward more than one candidate in a constituency, is the feeling of tension, sometimes amounting to bitterness, which prevails between the candidates themselves in the course of an election campaign.  It is deplorable and undignified but those of us who wish to be honest with the House and with the people will admit it exists where more than one candidate goes forward in a constituency under P.R. In that connection I thought it significant that the exact wording of the amendment put down by Deputy Blowick and two other Deputies on behalf of the Clann na Talmhan Party obviously approved of the change from the multiple member constituency to the single member constituency and barely suggested that in the single member constituency the system of voting should be by single non-transferable vote instead of single <Col N="1785" /> transferable vote.  I feel sure it will be of considerable interest to the people in my county that the Clann na Talmhan Party are in favour of a change from the present system to a system of single member constituencies. May I say that in that they are wise and I wholeheartedly agree with them?  They, too, have experience of the bitterness and tension that develop between candidates who are going forward on the same ticket canvassing for the same votes.</P>
    <P>I also mentioned that for a person representing a very large rural area the present system is unsatisfactory inasmuch as we are asked to represent a stretch of territory which we cannot physically represent in a satisfactory way.  I have always felt frustrated about this state of affairs since I believe that a Deputy should be a leader and not merely a reflector of public opinion in his area, which he cannot be if he is not sufficiently in contact with his constituents and if his constituency is of the vast size of the one which I have the honour to represent.</P>
    <P>One of the big objections put forward by those who oppose this measure is that we are trying to substitute a fair system of election for an unfair one.  I do not think any system of election under parliamentary democracy in any country in Europe could be described as absolutely fair.  I do not suppose those who followed the results of the recent elections in France could disagree with that view.  It is, of course, highly desirable that it could take 230,000 voters to elect a communist to the French National Assembly but obviously it is not a fair reflection of the voting strength of that Party.  In the same way if you go on to Austria, Germany, or to any country which operates what is known as &ldquo;The list,&rdquo; it is plain that that again is not fair inasmuch as people are presented not with a list of individual candidates from whom they may choose but a list of Party candidates, and they have merely the choice of voting for one Party or another.</P>
    <P>There is then the system of the single <Col N="1786" /> transferable vote which again may not be fair to the person who commands the highest individual support in his constituency.  Therefore, we should cast from our minds the suggestion that there is any such thing as an absolutely fair method of election and realise that when people like Deputy Dr. Browne and others refer to the reflection of every shade of opinion in this House, they are talking absolute nonsense.  The only possible way to have every shade of opinion represented in this House is by sending everybody in the country up here as a member.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been put forward that we are trying to push minorities and minority groups out of Parliament and out of public life.  That is not so.  I believe that under the system which operates in Great Britain and operates very well there, minority parties if they are to have any hope of growing to the size where they can be an effective opposition, must reflect not just the opinions and feelings of a minority group but national interest, and national policies are what they should put forward.  I believe that under the new system if it is adopted by the people, while they will remain small Parties in this House they will be forced to reflect in their policy national rather than sectional interests.</P>
    <P>The individuals who will be returned here under a single member constituency system will each represent approximately 25,000 people in a physical unit of the country.  Those of us who have taken any trouble to study the results of elections in this country will find extraordinary results particularly in rural areas; one of them indeed is my own constituency where there are two members, both of them in the House at the present time who are living in the same town and another, Deputy Blowick, who lives a matter of a few miles away.  It is a curious fact but it is true that three people who live within nine miles of one another have been elected in my own constituency.  I am not suggesting there is anything wrong with that but some of the people in other parts of the county have during the years felt dissatisfied that they have never <Col N="1787" /> been able to elect or, alternatively, have never been able to keep elected, a member from their area.</P>
    <P>In this instance it might be well to point out that, again, the fact that a candidate is going forward from a certain area for which he has no reasonable chance of being elected leads to the bitterness and frustration which I have already mentioned.  I feel quite certain that the people of my county who, down the years, have not had sufficient contact with members of this House but who realise that this is not their fault, will support the system under which they will always have their own representative for their own area.  They will not have the representation of four people, none of whom is personally fully alive to their particular needs.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, I should like to turn to what I think is the most deplorable element in this debate.  I refer to the repeated statements from the Opposition Benches about jackboot government and to the attempt that is being made, so it is said, by my Party to perpetuate itself at the expense of the Irish people and to establish itself as a dictatorship.  The people who put forward that view would do well to remember that it is much easier to change a Government under the single member constituency system than under P.R.  It takes a very small percentage swing in England to change a strong Tory Government and to put in a strong Labour Government.</P>
    <P>For that reason I believe you would have more stable and more solid Government and a Government more readily changeable by the people if you had the system put forward to the people under this Bill for their consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy ever consider the number of safe seats there are in England?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question but that under any system you will have a number of safe seats but there are far too many safe seats under P.R. in this country.  There is far too much deadwood in this House, people coming in on the third or fourth count <Col N="1788" /> in a five-member constituency and doing nothing.  That is one of the reasons why I hope that P.R. will be abolished and one of the reasons why I am sure that the new system will lead to a better Parliament, a Parliament with less deadwood.  It is not satisfactory that there should be safe seats such as there are in England but the fact remains that it takes a much smaller swing in the percentage of votes to effect a satisfactory change of Government in Britain than it does in this country under P.R.</P>
      <P>That, Sir, leads me to the references made by Opposition speakers to the unjustified cost of the referendum and to the upset it is going to be to the people and to the industrial life of the nation.  That is the greatest nonsense I have ever heard in this House.  The referendum is going to cost some money.  I have heard the figures of £60,000 or £80,000 mentioned.  I do not know what the figure is but I do know that the average life of the Governments in this country since the foundation of the State is about two and a half years.  I know that from my own experience because I have fought three general elections since 1951 and the average last year came to an election every two years.</P>
      <P>It is precisely to put an end to that situation that this measure is justified because the people will then be able to look forward to a stable Government which can, with a small swing of votes, be put out and another Government put in if they so desire. Such a Government will have a satisfactory and stable majority.  I believe that under the new system the average span of life of a Government will go from two and a half years to about four years with a consequent saving of an enormous amount of money.  You will not have to have double elections every time you want a stable Government. We had double elections in 1932 and 1933, in 1937 and 1938 and in 1943 and 1944.  Each time it was necessary to go to the people twice in order to get a decisive answer from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with one statement made by the Taoiseach in opening the debate when he said that he felt that <Col N="1789" /> if a second election had been held in 1948 Fianna Fáil would have been returned with the overall majority for which they asked.  I do not believe they would have been and I think it is a good thing that they were not.  I think it is a good thing to put out any Party, however good it may be, after three or four terms in office. It is a good thing to put them out and give them a rest.  In England the people decided, when the war was over, that however good a man Winston Churchill was&mdash;and at that stage his prestige was higher than of any other man in the world&mdash;they would give him a rest and put in another Party. That did not mean that they rejected him because they brought him back again into Government a few years afterwards.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is nonsense to say that the cost of the referendum is unjustified. I believe it is entirely justified because if the people accept the proposal to change the Constitution they will have more stable Government either from Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.  They will have a Government which they will know will be able to plan for four or five years ahead and the people will then be able to settle down to put the policy of that Government into effect and the members of the Dáil will be satisfied to get down to business instead of wondering whether it is next year or the year after they will have to go to the polls.</P>
    <P>After all, Sir, the suggestion that this is a jackboot measure shows something like contempt for the Irish people.  Do the Opposition speakers seriously suggest that a country like ours would be prepared to put up with any sort of jackboot measures?  Do the Opposition speakers think that Fianna Fáil back benchers are just so many people who are prepared to lie down under what their own Government will do?  I think that is absolute nonsense and the proof of it is, not in the years ahead, but in what has happened in years gone by.</P>

      <P>The Irish people will see this propaganda for what it really is.  They will clearly see it is nothing but an insult to their intelligence and, to that extent, perhaps Fine Gael have done a service to us, and not to themselves, by taking the line which they have adopted throughout this whole debate.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, in supporting this measure I want to say that I am not speaking out of self-interest.  Anyone who studies the figures of the voting in my constituency will know that a Fianna Fáil candidate will have considerably less chance of being returned under the new system than under the old one.  There is a very heavy majority of voting strength against Fianna Fáil in my constituency and, therefore, I cannot be accused of speaking in my own interest when I support this Bill, as I honestly and sincerely do.</P>
      <P>Of course, it will be suggested that we shall try to gerrymander the constituencies in such a way that the relative voting strengths of the Parties will be, in some way, nullified.  I believe that is a reflection on the probity and integrity of the people who will serve on the commission which will define the constituencies and, again, I believe in putting forward that deplorable suggestion, Fine Gael and those who support them are not doing any service to themselves or to the Irish people. I believe that the people will see through such contemptible propaganda. All of us, however, are aware that when this Bill goes through, and if the referendum is successful, it will involve very great changes in the membership of this House.  We should all be prepared to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some of us this may be in the nature of a swan song.  For many of us it will be a swan song, but the question should be not what happens to some of us but what is best for the country.  I was very much impressed by what Deputy Booth said when speaking of the experiences of other countries under the P.R. system, but I would prefer to consider what is best for our own country rather than what is best for other countries.  I am quite satisfied that the present system <Col N="1791" /> has outlived its usefulness and that we should adopt the system which we have suggested as an alternative, a system which has operated so well in Britain.</P>
    <P>I may say that the atmosphere in which this debate has taken place is suggestive of the atmosphere connected with people who feel the ground shaking underneath them, and who feel we are about to make irrevocable changes and irrevocable decisions. There is nothing irrevocable about decisions of this House.  It is quite possible that should Fine Gael come in here to govern, and if they feel the new system has failed, they can then ask the people to revert once more to the system of P.R.  It is silly to regard this decision as irrevocable and as something which can never be undone. My personal belief is, however, that the Irish people will never want to undo the good work which I believe they will do next year but, should they ever want to do so, they will have the opportunity.  Therefore, this can be regarded essentially as an experiment and as an attempt, after 35 years of relatively unsuccessful experience of the P.R. system, to try a system which will operate better for the peculiar needs of this country than the system which we have had up to the present time.</P>
    <P>Whether, through the operation of the new system, some of us would be out of Parliament would not, in my view, be entirely relevant.  We should be prepared to face whatever the future may bring in that regard.  We should interest ourselves in having a better electoral system, and from that system will stem a better and more stable form of government and a better and more representative form of assembly. These are the aims of this Bill, that is why I support this Bill, and I hope the people will give the measure a full measure of support when they get the opportunity of doing so next year.</P>

      <P>I felt rather frightened a little while ago because I thought my hearing was slightly affected when I heard a Fianna Fáil Deputy stating that he disagreed <Col N="1792" /> with some statement made by the Taoiseach.  That is a phenomenon, something which would startle anyone but, of course, when we found out the nature of the statement it was discovered to be a very minor one indeed; but it is that type of tripe which we have been listening to from the Fianna Fáil Benches during this debate.  I would like to ask Deputy Seán Flanagan when did he first fall in love with the direct system of voting?  The answer, of course, is that he did so when the Taoiseach said that we must do away with P.R. Did Deputy Seán Flanagan, during the seven years he has been in this House, ever comment adversely on that system?  Did any of the Fianna Fáil back benchers do so?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not do so to-day were it not for the fact that the Leader of their Party said they must get rid of the system.  However, leaving that point aside, I should like to know what is the reason for the indecent haste in trying to push this measure through the House.  We have been informed by the Taoiseach that unless the Second Reading passes this week we shall have to sit next week and then, if the Committee and other stages are not taken, we shall have to reassemble on the 8th January or 15th January to do so.  What is the need for this urgency?  There are three or four years ahead in which it can be dealt with, and there are many other measures of more importance than it.  In my view, the reason is that this is an endeavour on the part of the Taoiseach to keep himself in office until he goes further afield, and I feel sure that the House would not be discussing this Bill were it not for the fright which Fianna Fáil suffered in 1948 and 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time as a result of the proportional system an alternative Government was provided.  At that time Fianna Fáil were convinced that the people had no alternative choice and that, to use a common term, they were there for good.  They were taken very much aback when they found, as a result of the 1948 election, that the country got an alternative Government, <Col N="1793" /> a Government much more effective than Fianna Fáil ever was or ever will be.  We had the ideal type of representation under that Government &mdash;a composition of the various Parties with the exception of Fianna Fáil&mdash; and we had a similar type of Government in 1954 which introduced somewhat similar beneficial legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to waste time recounting the achievements of the Governments of 1948 and 1951, but the Taoiseach has said that from 1948 to 1951, and from 1954 to 1957, in whatever part of the country he travelled he heard nothing but a demand to abolish P.R.  These demands were made on him at times which coincided with his absence from office during inter-Party reign here but, despite that fact, he did not put such demands forward as part of his campaign during the 1957 General Election. Did the Taoiseach or any member of Fianna Fáil ask for the people's views on it?  Did they mention in 1957 that if they were elected they would do away with this system of election which did give us stable government?</P>
    <P>With regard to this term &ldquo;stable government&rdquo;, what exactly does Fianna Fáil want?  Have they not a stable Government at the moment? Were they not elected with a handsome majority in 1957, after 36 years of P.R.?  Were they not elected with a majority of nine over every combination of Parties in this House?  Is not an overall majority of nine stable enough for anyone?  Is it a majority of 29, 39 or 49 they require?</P>
    <P>This proposal is being advocated by Fianna Fáil speakers on the grounds of instability of Government.  We all know that Governments here since the establishment of the State have been just as stable as Governments anywhere else in the world.  But we are told now that we must revise the system and whittle down the so-called multiplicity of Parties and that we would do much better with a different system of election which would do away with all Parties, with the exception of perhaps two Parties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1794" /> I had occasion once to listen to a speaker from the Yugo-Slavian Parliament. He described the fair system of election they have to the Parliament of Yugo-Slavia.  If the Minister for the Gaeltacht informs the Taoiseach of the content of my remarks now, in case the Taoiseach is not aware of the position in Yugo-Slavia, he may before this measure is finalised introduce the Yugo-Slavian method of election.  It may suit him better.  This representative from the Yugo-Slavian Parliament told us that the members of that House were elected on a Party system.  There is, of course, only one Party permitted, or tolerated, in Yugo-Slavia&mdash;the Communist Party.  Each branch of the Communist Party in the various localities nominates whoever that branch believes to be a suitable representative in Parliament.  On their nomination a vote is taken between the 20 or 25 branches in the locality and the individual who is appointed as a result of that vote by the various branches of the Party is then nominated for Parliament; and, whether the people like him or not, they must come along and vote for him.  He is duly elected to Parliament with between a 99 and 100 per cent. vote.  That is the system in Yugo-Slavia.  There is no difficulty about instability of government there.  That system of election is bound to give stable government. They have 100 per cent. representation. Is it at something like that Fianna Fáil is aiming?  I am sure if they could get away with it they would adopt the same type of dictatorial attitude and do away with every other Party here.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made that this is a matter to be decided by the people.  Why all the talk here?  The ultimate decision rests with the people. If the people approve, this will become law.  If the people disapprove, it will not become law.  Arguing on that basis, Fianna Fáil speakers have been very annoyed at the lengthy nature of the discussion here.  But this is exactly the place in which a lengthy discussion should take place on a measure which proposes to change the entire electoral system.  We, as representatives of the people from one end <Col N="1795" /> of the country to the other, are obliged to express our viewpoints and give to the people, through this House, our views on this measure, pointing out the advantages or disadvantages inherent in the proposed change.</P>
    <P>Now, I see little or no advantage accruing from the direct system of voting. I do not wish to repeat the various submissions made by previous speakers in support of that contention. The last Fianna Fáil speaker commented that they had this system in England and that it works satisfactorily there.  It is a bit of a change to find Fianna Fáil anxious to borrow something from England.  They pretend they do not want to have anything to do with England, but they are prepared to borrow this idea from England.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows the position that obtains in England.  It is entirely different from the position obtaining here.  In England the average electorate is in the neighbourhood of 60,000 to 65,000 people.  The personality of the candidate counts very little.  The people vote mainly on a Party system. The system that has grown up in England suits a heavily populated, industrialised country like England.  As had to be admitted by Deputy S. Flanagan, there has grown up with that system a system of safe seats.  There is talk at the moment of a general election in England.  As far as a general election goes, out of the 635 seats in the British Parliament there are at least 400 which are quite safe.  They are the same as if there was no contest at all. The differences between the Parties in the safe constituencies are such that that is the position that will obtain there.</P>
    <P>Look at it now from another angle. If a prominent politician is defeated in his own constituency, which may happen to be a marginal one, he is automatically removed to one of the safe seat constituencies and subsequently returned once more to the British House of Commons.  If this Bill becomes law, will Fianna Fáil adopt that practice, assuming a few Ministers are defeated, as they undoubtedly will be, if this measure is accepted?  Take the Minister for <Col N="1796" /> Lands, the Minister for Health, or any other Minister.  If he is defeated in his constituency will he be transported to one of the safe seat constituencies, let it be down in Cork or up in Donegal? Will the local Party members then be asked to accept him as a candidate? Will the local people then be told they must elect him?  That is what happens in England.  That is what is likely to happen in any country where you have the direct vote.</P>
    <P>Such a situation could not arise under P.R. because it is not the practice to transport a defeated candidate to another area to improve his chances of election.  That has never happened here in our 36 years' experience of P.R.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has continued for so long there is bound to be a good deal of repetition.  Has anyone ever asserted during the 36 years in which it has been in operation here that the P.R. system is an unfair system?  The Minister for Defence said the system gave unfair results. Other Fianna Fáil speakers made the same statement.  I never heard any Minister or any Deputy in any Party before this complain that the system gave unfair results.  I never heard a defeated candidate complain that the system was unfair to him; he might say his defeat was hard luck.  I know that Fianna Fáil supporters do not believe that P.R. is unfair.  I know that their hearts are not in this particular measure but, due to the peculiar set up of their Party, they are compelled to support whatever the Taoiseach proposes whether they like it or not.  If the Taoiseach had never commented adversely on P.R. we would never hear any adverse comment on the part of Fianna Fáil Ministers or back benchers on the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, the formation of the inter-Party Government is the root cause of all this hubbub about abolishing P.R.  What system of government are we likely to have after the next general election if P.R. is not abolished? Fianna Fáil knows very well that the carrot of £100,000,000 to provide 100,000 jobs which they dangled <Col N="1797" /> before the electors on the last occasion will not do on the next occasion, despite the £220,000,000 carrot being dragged around the country at the moment.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil expect that, possibly having passed this Bill through the House in a hasty fashion, the referendum will be taken about the month of February when the days are short and the nights are long and, possibly, they hope that what they deem to be their own effective organisation will bring out the rural voters to support the measure and that others will not take the trouble of going to the polls. That is one of the things they have in mind in deciding not to have any other type of election on the same day.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why there should be a special referendum on the question of the abolition of P.R.  Everyone knows that there will be a Presidential election in June next.  The Irish people are sufficiently intelligent to be able to determine both questions on the same day and there is no need for duplication of elections.</P>
    <P>What are the results likely to accrue from the establishment of the direct system of voting, if it should be established, and there is a very big &ldquo;if&rdquo; in that?  Personally, I believe it is doomed.  Fianna Fáil, as a Party commanding a solid vote, expect that they will be able to get almost all the seats.  They assume that all the other Parties will go forward individually and thereby break up their votes and by doing so ensure the election of Fianna Fáil candidates.  Some of them will get a rude awakening.  They may not get the safe seat that they expect. That is the assumption that the Taoiseach is going on, that the various Parties will so break up their votes as to secure the election of Fianna Fáil candidates.  From a personal point of view, I should not like to see the Minister for the Gaeltacht removed from this House but he will have a fairly difficult little job if the Bill becomes law.</P>

      <P>I was emphasising that it would remove some of these people from office.  I believe I am expressing the point of view of the people who put me here when I say that they are quite satisfied with the present system of election.  This change is due to the combination of Parties for the purpose of forming Governments recently.  The demand for this change has come entirely from the Taoiseach, not from the Fianna Fáil Party.  He wants to die in office. I hope it will be a long time before that happens.  He wants to hold on to office for the remainder of his life.  He knows very well that it is impossible for him to do so under the present system because it is most likely that a Government other than Fianna Fáil would be elected.</P>
      <P>I conclude by condemning this proposal to abolish the P.R. system and I recommend the retention of that system.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to have this opportunity to ease Deputy Corish's anxiety&mdash;I am sorry he is not here&mdash;that every back bencher of Fianna Fáil is gagged or stifled in giving his views on this Bill.  One of the most remarkable features of this debate was the extraordinary haste with which the Opposition rushed to condemn the Bill.  The Taoiseach moved that leave be granted to introduce the Bill.  No sooner had he done so when all sections of the Opposition fell over one another in almost indecent <Col N="1799" /> haste to hammer and condemn the Bill. There seemed to me to be an element of panic in this rush to criticise a Bill, the text of which had not even then been circulated.  Why there should have been that panic, why they rushed to give expression to it, only Deputies opposite can say.  In hastening to discuss the Bill, at a time when, according to the rules of parliamentary procedure they should not have done so, they showed a disrespect and even contempt for the institution which they now presume to cherish.  The Government have been accused of bringing parliamentary democracy into disrepute by abolishing P.R.  It is, in fact, the Opposition who have done so by deliberately flaunting the rules laid down for the proper ordering of business.</P>
      <P>It has been said that the purpose of this Bill is to rivet Fianna Fáil in power.  Surely Deputy Norton should know that this allegation cuts both ways.  Could not election to Dáil Éireann by the single non-transferable vote just as well rivet the Labour Party into power?  That may come, if and when that Party formulates a policy and programme acceptable to a majority of the people.</P>
      <P>The same applies to Fine Gael.  Cannot Fine Gael cement or rivet themselves into power in a similar way?  The fact is, that no one Party can deliberately vote itself into power.  Only the people can do that.  It is the people who will still be the ones to choose who shall govern and who shall be in opposition.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that Deputies opposite would not discuss the merits of the Bill in and out of the House more dispassionately than they have been doing. Could we not give the lie to those abroad who say we are politically immature and will always be so, by arguing this Bill without appeal to unworthy passions?  I wonder is Deputy Norton voicing the opinion of his Labour followers when he suggests that the passing of this Bill will drive dangerous minorities underground?  I am quoting from the Official Debates of the 12th November, Volume 171, column 626.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent any citizen seeking election to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1800" /> Deputy T. O'Higgins at a meeting of a Fine Gael branch a couple of weeks ago in Ballyroan, Laois, and reported in the daily papers of 22nd November, 1958, spoke of men who will not accept a Government elected by the people.  Is Deputy O'Higgins voicing the views of his supporters?</P>
    <P>Is Fine Gael in favour of antidemocratic means to combat this Bill? I am quite sure they are not.  In my opinion, speeches like those I have mentioned serve only to arouse harmful and unworthy passions.  I believe we should make an effort to conduct the debate with&mdash;in the words of the Preamble to the Constitution&mdash;due observance of prudence, justice and charity.  Deputy O. Flanagan's speech on the measure last week certainly erred on this score.  His remarks were the very opposite of prudent, just, or charitable.</P>
    <P>I am a newcomer to this House but I have heard many speeches here and, before my election, I listened from a seat in the Public Gallery, but I have never heard anything so scurrilous and detestable.  Deputy O. Flanagan spoke of the Bill as stinking in the nostrils of decent people, but surely if anything stank here last week it was his speech.  He even sank so low as to look forward with a sort of ghoulish glee to the death of the Taoiseach.  I would assure the Deputy that the Taoiseach will live in the memory, the hearts and affection of the Irish people long after he and his scurrilities have passed into oblivion.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have often been accused of living in the past but, listening to the speeches from the opposite benches, it appears to me that it is Fine Gael who are doing just that.  Fianna Fáil is the Party of to-day and the Party which looks to the future.  It is the purpose of this Bill to provide for the future.  The single-member constituency, from the individual Deputy's point of view, makes for the easier handling of his constituency.  The area he is elected to represent would be more precisely defined, and a more compact area.  I should imagine that the conscientious Deputy would welcome the Bill on that score.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that <Col N="1801" /> with the single-seat constituency a candidate could be elected by a bare majority leaving a large minority in that constituency without representation in Parliament.  But, surely, if democracy means anything, it means simply that &ldquo;most votes carry&rdquo;.  And in any case a Deputy does not represent purely and simply the people who voted for him.  He sits in Dáil Éireann as the representative of the whole area.  He will, as far as he is able, work to safeguard the rights and air the grievances of every voter in his constituency irrespective of his or her political affiliations.</P>
    <P>In the early days of the State, P.R. may have been the correct and safest method of election.  At that stage in our history we were perhaps anxious to ensure that all sections of our people&mdash;all minorities, however small &mdash;should be given the opportunity to enter Parliament.  But time has proved that this system, in fact, gives rise to a multiplicity of small Parties.</P>
    <P>There is the possibility that in the future there could be more Parties here; so many indeed, that bickerings between them would become inevitable and stable government impossible. Under those conditions a strong extremist minority could well play havoc with the democratic nature of our institutions. I can visualise a state of affairs here when Deputies would long for the abolition of P.R. only to find that it was too late.</P>
    <P>I sometimes wonder if the two Coalition Governments we had here would have lasted even as long as they did without the presence opposite of a strong, single Party, committed never to take part in any Coalition. Now is the time to make the change while we still have it in our power to ask the people to elect a strong, single-Party Government and a strong Opposition.  Some day in the future we may want to make the change and, finding ourselves unable to do it, look back on these days and regret a lost opportunity.</P>
    <P>There has been talk of dictatorship. I do not believe the critics who accuse Fianna Fáil of trying to inflict a dictatorship on the people can be serious. <Col N="1802" /> The people will be asked to decide this issue.  Dictators do not ask people what they would like.  They tell them what to do and how to do it.  If the people decide to abolish P.R. there will still be the same freedom to vote under the new system and the same freedom to go forward for election. The democracy which we all cherish is still being safeguarded, so, unless we can visualise a democratic dictatorship, I cannot see the sense in that particular line of argument.  This Bill, as I see it, is an effort to ensure that the dignity and freedom of the individual will be assured so that no combination of minorities will be enabled to take this freedom from us.  Deliberately to blind ourselves to this danger is gravely to dishonour the memories of some great men who have gone before us.</P>

      <P>Apparently it is to be accepted that there are much more catching things than influenza about the city at the present time.  I have not listened to such smugness in speeches for many years.  I suspect the expressions of righteous self-belief of the Taoiseach when he begins to talk about any subject in which he may be interested have been spread and spread deliberately through some process of infection even to the remotest back benchers, even to the Deputy who has just sat down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told in regard to this Bill that it is not in the Party interest; that this is a national piece of legislation; that this legislation is required for the good of the State. The Taoiseach has, in fact, told us that it would be dangerous if the present system were allowed to go on and that in the public interest it should be discontinued.  From remarks of his at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis in October this year we find that he talked about a number of objections he has to small Parties coming into the House.  He said that they present themselves to the electorate and can make all sorts of promises.  They can promise the sun, moon and stars.  If anybody wants to get a good idea of what promising the sun, moon and stars means they should go back and see what the <Col N="1803" /> Fianna Fáil sheet said that was issued in 1932, the year in which they made their first entrance to this House as a serious Party.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that it was of fundamental importance to the country that this matter should be put to the people and that the Party would be failing in its national duty, failing in its duty to the nation, if it did not do it.  There was a statement that he scorned to the effect that people had suggested Fianna Fáil was doing this in the interests of Fianna Fáil.  That was not so, he said; they were not doing this for Party interests.  Nobody could predict what would happen in the next election. If they were to do it simply because of narrow Party interests they would probably say: &ldquo;Leave things as they are.  It is because I think we would not be doing our duty in our time that we have decided to go ahead with this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There you have it.  This is not a Party measure; it is in the national interest, and, of course, the Fianna Fáil Party were unanimous with regard to that.  The Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis, with all its delegates from the country, was also unanimous.  Presumably the Fianna Fáil supporters all through the country are equally unanimous with the delegates to the Árd Fheis and equally unanimous with the Party here.  They all think the same thing and I suppose I could add into that, the people who were previously politicians and have since been elevated to the Bench.  They know now, and they will remember their old Fianna Fáil affiliations and think exactly what the Taoiseach thinks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they must, let it not be a mumble but something we can understand.  Deputy Lemass at least has the nerve to interrupt in a particular matter of preferment although he owes his position here to a certain extent to a type of preferment which has been castigated throughout the country.  As I said, we are told it is in the interests of the country, not in the interests of the Party, that P.R. should be abolished.  Disregarding all the previous statement he made in praise of P.R. and even trying to forget that he praised it to such an extent as to put it in his Constitution in 1937, the Taoiseach, with that air of selfrighteousness, now says he wants to abolish it and asks the people to accept this not as a Party measure but <Col N="1806" /> something which it would be disastrous not to promote.</P>
      <P>When one seeks for the reason for the introduction of this legislation we discover it is purely a Party reason, and that cannot be hidden by the made-up speeches of the people on the other side.  Political life changed pattern just after the war finished. Fianna Fáil strength was breaking up and did in fact break up in 1948. People voted in favour of certain groups who in those days had not made it clear to the public they were going to amalgamate if the chance came their way afterwards.  The break-up of Fianna Fáil&mdash;this was referred to by Deputy Dillon the other day&mdash;was helped by the Eindiguer and Maximoe scandal and the Monaghan bacon scandal of those days which gave certainty to people who previously had suspicion about those matters.  In 1948 we had what is called the multiplicity of Parties. These Parties got the approval of the people at an election and combined together from 1948 to 1951 and again in 1954.</P>
      <P>If anybody quibbled about what happened in 1951 there is not the slightest doubt than in 1954 the electorate voted for a Coalition Government as against a Fianna Fáil Government and by a solid majority they returned those who had indicated their view that they would cohere in order to give a representative Govenment. In 1951 certain people ran as Independents but when they were elected they proceeded to forget their election promises and betrayed the people who had reposed their trust in them.  The people took their revenge on them in 1954 and got rid of every one of that group of five whose support gave Fianna Fáil three uneasy and disastrous years of power between 1951 and 1954.  The election of 1954 showed clearly that what happened in 1948 was approved and what happened in 1951 was thoroughly disapproved.  The Parties which amalgamated in 1948 got another chance in 1954 and amalgamated with good results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, can speak at his Árd Fheis in terms <Col N="1807" /> of national interest.  I do believe he fools even the delegates to the Árd Fheis or those who surround him in his Party.  What he is afraid of is that his past performances have been so often exposed here by argument, but his past performances and their lamentable effect never got such a setback as when a different Government replaced Fianna Fáil in 1948 and again in 1954 when it was brought home to him that the people were aware that there were other energetic people capable of taking over Government with new policies and a capacity for great achievements.  The Taoiseach does not like such a comparison which makes him realise that a cohesion of other Parties is still possible.  The Taoiseach's motive for this Bill is to enable him to remain in office for a number of years without any chance of his policy being challenged or any chance of people coming together to do a better job of government than he has ever attempted.</P>
    <P>Recently the Government after almost two years of stagnation, two years of laziness and of complacent acceptance of their inferiority in the face of the difficulties of the country, have produced a pamphlet called &ldquo;Economic Development&rdquo;.  How was it produced?  A civil servant was sent around to Departments to collect any schemes that were there, any schemes that had even got to the stage of being suggested.  This civil servant was able to find from his excursions in other Departments what had been proposed in the Coalition time and these were then put into a pamphlet for the edification of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a time to discuss that economic paper.  Surely this is not the occasion to discuss the economic programme of the Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to discuss it.  I am referring to it.  As I have said, the origin of it was that a civil servant was sent to scout around the Departments and the result of his excursions was that there were gathered and put into pamphlet form all the schemes that had been proposed in 1948 to 1951 and again from <Col N="1808" /> 1954 onwards.  With the exception of one or two blots, and they were blots, most of the things contained in that White Paper are proposals of the Coalition days.</P>

      <P>That is so, Sir.  I shall not be long but I expect my contribution will be too long for the Minister. A statement has been made that, even with startling changes along the lines of economic development, this country will still lag many years behind countries in the rest of Europe that are undeveloped.  Why should that be?  The reason for it does not lie in the efforts to increase production made from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957, but rather does it lie in the stagnation and slackness that lasted from 1932 to 1947 and from 1951 to 1954.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that in a moment.  Here is what the people were told in 1957.  After the election was over the Taoiseach addressed a message of thanks to those who had worked for his Party and said: &ldquo;The battle of the polls is over. I am glad the results have been decisive. We can again look forward to stable government.&rdquo;  A few paragraphs down the Taoiseach went on: &ldquo;The battle with unemployment and the other ills from which the country is suffering has now to begin and we hope the result will be no less decisive. To achieve that we shall need the combined effort of every section of the community.  We shall need the effort of everyone who produces more &mdash;every farmer who gets more from his soil, every manufacturer who produces more goods, every worker who does a better job and everyone else who can contribute his share to the winning of that final victory.  We need one great, combined, sustained national effort and tha task will be done.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1809" /> And what is the great sustained national effort going to be?  The abolition of P.R. and the wiping out of the representation of small Parties! Is that to be the reward of everyone who takes part in the great national effort?  What of the farmers who got more out of their soil?  If they got more out of it, they got less for it. Where is the great combined, sustained national effort and what has come from it?  Where is the failure?  Are the people not able to give any further great national effort?  The reason is that the members of the present Government have retained the slackness and have carried on the stagnation which they put on this country in 1957.</P>
    <P>The only hope that Fianna Fáil have in connection with this matter is that there will be a small poll and that they will scrape through as they have done with some of the other institutions. It has been said that Fianna Fáil got a majorityy of the votes in the last election.  They did not.  They failed to do that.  What happened was that over 190,000 who had previously voted for the Party to which I belong, the Labour Party, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta and Independents, did not vote as before.  They stood sullenly around.  We had got into certain difficulties of a world-wide nature and these difficulties were attributed to us.  Fianna Fáil got the advantage of that feeling against us but they got no additional votes. We lost.  There was no  percentage of voting as there was in previous elections.</P>
    <P>The only hope Fianna Fáil have is that voters will not come out and that a small poll will result in Fianna Fáil getting a certain result to which they are not entitled on the figures.  I made a calculation with regard to the strength of the voting that carried two institutions in this country.  Less than 40 per cent. voted for the Constitution and about 31 per cent. voted for the present President.  There are two great institutions of this country and the voters did not show much enthusiasm about them.  The Constitution was carried by 39 per <Col N="1810" /> cent. of the electorate and the present President got into office with the aid of 31 per cent. of the voters.  Again I repeat that is the only hope Fianna Fáil have&mdash;that with a small poll and with the people not sufficiently interested in the matter their organised strength will give them a 31 per cent. poll which they hope will be sufficient.</P>
    <P>Voting has gone down since the general election.  Deputy Sherwin was returned to this House on a poll which did not amount to 45 per cent. of the electorate.  Voting has dropped in general elections through the country due to the apathy, disillusionment and despair of the people. There was that apathy in 1957 despite all the promises made by the Taoiseach.  Despite those promises nothing has been done by the Government since 1957.  Their efforts to beat down the great problem of unemployment and other economic ills have not given much encouragement to the people to come out and vote for them.  All they can hope for is that the hard core of their votes will be sufficient to enable them to struggle this proposal across the line and then they will be ensconced here, if not for ever, certainly for a long time.</P>
    <P>I want to find out what has happened to the problem of unemployment and to the other economic ills about which the Taoiseach was so vocal after he had won the electoral battle in 1957. It has been said that the situation now is that two out of every three people born into this country will die abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Lands was allowed to speak of economic matters and he spoke at great length on them.  I am making only a reference to it but the Minister was allowed to discuss it for columns.  I shall counter him in a few sentences. The emigration situation, as I said, is that two out of every three people born at the moment in this country will die abroad.  This situation with regard to unemployment has been, for I suppose ten years since Fianna Fáil's first period of Government in this <Col N="1811" /> country, that the figures were never below 100,000 and, at one time, they were as high as 146,000.</P>
      <P>The situation with regard to the economic position of those who remain here at the moment is that certain people are entitled to get free medical aid, because their own industry or other lawful means do not permit them to provide anything for the medical attention of their families or themselves.  The figures of those who, at the moment, through their own natural industry and legal means cannot provide anything in that nature for themselves or their families, are one out of every three people&mdash; 1,000,000 out of the less than 3,000,000 population we have&mdash;and that is the situation which exists since Fianna Fáil came back into office in 1957.</P>
      <P>Take the towns of Cork and Limerick, one with 90,000 of a population and the other with around 64,000.  Take the combined population of those two towns.  What would be the feelings of the people if it were suddenly found that everyone in those cities had suddenly left the country? Emigration is running at an average of 60,000 persons a year, half the combined population of the towns of Limerick and Cork.  Supposing Limerick was denuded of population, what public consternation would be caused if it were found that everybody in Cork was unemployed at the same time?  As I have said, emigration is running at the rate of 60,000 persons per annum and the unemployment rate is about the same.  Two cities, one entirely emptied, and one given over to unemployment and idleness&mdash; that is the result of the economic battles which have been fought in this country and that is the effect of the &ldquo;successful&rdquo; conclusion of those battles.</P>
      <P>The Bishop of Limerick has referred to that city as being &ldquo;a Cinderella amongst cities.&rdquo;  A statement came from Waterford the other day that there are 300 people hungry in that town.  In Dundalk priests and people have got together in order to get some aid for the stricken town of Dundalk.</P>

You stated you did not believe in that sort of thing and then the old restriction policies came along, cutting down wages, cutting down money that went out to farmers, cutting down everything, bringing stagnation and despair into industry.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been reference to small Parties, and to the multiplicity of Parties.  That situation was accepted definitely in 1954 by the people, and accepted by them on the Government's performance between 1948 and 1951.  The vote given to small Parties was strengthened in 1954 but certain people who, in 1951, had been elected to support the small Parties and the inter-Party Government, turned traitor and dishonestly supported Fianna Fáil, and the electorate, in 1954, rooted those people out of the House and none of them has since made an appearance in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated that P.R. was supposed to lead to bad policies and to bad government.  It was stated that these small Parties had not expressed their promises to the people and, therefore, having got votes, got into <Col N="1815" /> office in some underhand way.  I should like Deputies opposite to remember what the people got when they did vote those people into office.  To meet the increased cost of living the people were given help.  Help was given to old age pensioners, Civil Service pensioners and State personnel.  There were no Standstill Orders in those days.  We encouraged people to look to Labour Courts and arbitration boards for increases in their emoluments in order to meet the increased cost of living which had risen during our predecessors' term of office.  We entered on a programme of agricultural expansion, which is still to be found in an economic development pamphlet. One of our colleagues pushed forestsry across the Shannon into an area where it had been supposed that that was impossible.</P>
    <P>In addition to that there were the Welfare Acts, although they were modified, modified in accordance with the Christian principles of the Church to which I belong.  It was that achievement, got between 1948 and 1951, that made the people rally to our aid again in 1957.  They experience now the complacent way in which Ministers accept that they are unequal to the task that faces them, Ministers who see in this panic measure, which they hope to get by a narrow majority, a situation subsequently in which they will be free from criticism of the type that has been heard, in a glancing way because it has not been fully exposed, over the last two or three years.</P>
    <P>I want to speak now about this commission and about the judges.  I want definitely to speak about the judges.  I shall not criticise any judge or say that he will do a wrong thing, but judges are open to our criticism here when they are put into this commission. Anyone put into this commission is open to criticism.  I am entitled to say of any of these new proposals that I do not think the proposal is a good one, and I want to give my reasons for saying it.</P>
    <P>First of all, the President is brought into this.  Let no one pretend here that the President is not a political figure.  Before the Constitution was <Col N="1816" /> passed the Rev. Dr. O'Rahilly brought out a booklet called <i>Thoughts on the Constitution.</i>  He said he &ldquo;rejected as incredible the notion that the President will be above politics.  Only a prominent political personality has a chance of election.  We know that that is what happened, and it is complete nonsense to try to pretend now that the President has not had a certain  tion in his past life.  We are entitled to take that into consideration at the present moment.  There may be no proper and honest criticism of this unless it is that the President is asked to do a political job.  And the President was a politician.</P>
    <P>As I said before, I find it is a test of faith to be asked to regard this piece of legislation as a matter of national interest, something that it would be a dangerous thing not to do, something people whould be failing in their duty if they did not attempt. Am I supposed to believe that the old faith that ran through President O'Kelly is no longer there and that he will not accept, and accept honestly, the view so honestly held by all the people opposite that, in the interests of the country, small Parties must be got rid of and the system that leads to small Parties must be got rid of?  Am I to take it that the President, brought up in the way he was, and associated still with his political friends, and with those who are not his friends, will not feel the shaking of this faith going through him?  In any event, whether or not he will be a politician, if he honestly accepts the view that small Parties are not bad &mdash;and one can, I suppose, on Fianna Fáil arguments accept that&mdash;will that sway his conduct?  How will he segregate himself from all these feelings when he sees them so universally and so strongly held by the people to whom he used to belong?</P>
    <P>The President, in fact, has not much to do in this matter.  The President at least will act on his own.  It is said in this Bill that he is to act on the advice of the Council of State.  He is to act after consultation with the Council of State, and anybody who knows the Constitution of this country knows what that means.  The <Col N="1817" /> Minister for External Affairs was frank enough to say that the mere putting in of this phrase&mdash;&ldquo;acting after consultation with the Council of State&rdquo;&mdash;was only a way of indicating that he would not act on the advice of the Government.  Even that is not a full statement of the truth.  In the Constitution the President is occas-all told to act on his own discretion. But that is very rare.</P>
    <P>In the Constitution the President is sometimes told he must consult the Council of State before he does something. That does not mean much. On the majority of occasions he acts on the advice of the Government.  In this instance he is to act after consultation with the Council of State. What does that mean?</P>
    <P>Article 32 states clearly what it does mean:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The President shall not exercise or perform any of the powers or functions which are by this Constitution expressed to be exercisable or performable by him after consultation with the Council of State unless, and on every occasion before so doing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and here is what he has to do.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;he shall have convened a meeting of the Council of State and the members present at such meeting shall have been heard by him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the beginning and end of it.</P>
    <P>He gets this body of 14 or 15 people into a room and more or less throws in the ball of conversation and, when they have done their talk, he dismisses them.  They have no power to advise. If the whole council advised in one way he could go exactly the opposite, and he is doing nothing unconstitutional when he does so.  He is, in fact, acting constitutionally.  The Council of State, according to the Minister for External Affairs, is put in here to show that the President is not acting on the advice of the Government. That is not shown at all.  It only means that he is at least not bound to act on the advice of the Government.  he is asked to consult the Council of State, <Col N="1818" /> bring them into a room where they can be heard by him, and, after that, he can repudiate the whole lot of them. They have no influence.  And that is what Deputy Costello pointed out at the beginning of this debate.</P>
    <P>The commission then is to consist of seven people appointed by the President, one of whom is to be appointed after consultation by the President with the Council of State, three appointed from amongst the members of Dáil Éireann on the nomination of the Taoiseach, and three appointed by the Chairman of Dáil Éireann.  one of these members, the chairman, is to be a judge.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The member of a Constituency Commission appointed after consultation by the President with the Council of State shall be appointed from the judges of the Supreme Court and High Court and shall be the Chairman of the Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education brought forth one member of the judiciary for comment here.  He named the judge. I do not propose to name anybody.  All I propose to do is to examine the group from whom the chairman is to be appointed.  There is one member of the Supreme Court who was a Deputy in this House and Attorney General for a number of years.  There is another member of the Supreme Court who was selected as a candidate for Fianna Fáil in an election, but did not make the grade.  He was also Attorney General at a later stage.  Another member of the Supreme Court was a member of the Seanad for quite a while; and another member of the Supreme Court was a State prosecutor and was given the conduct of State prosecutions by a Fiann Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Of the High Court, one member ran for election as a Fianna Fáil T.D., but failed to make the grade.  Another member of the High Court was in the Seanad for a little while.  Of the others, all were either public prosecutors, appointed to such prosecutions by Fianna Fáil, or else Attorney General under Fianna Fáil.  That is their background.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of these is to be appointed by the President after the Council of State advises.  I want now to ask a test question.  Would anybody think it would satisfy the Northern Nationalists if a proposal were made by the Governor General of Northern Ireland that constituencies there would be re-distributed&mdash;the Governor General picking for that purpose a judge from the Northern Ireland Bench?  Does anybody think that would be acceptable to our people up there?  Where is the difference in asking us to accept the President, who has been a politician, picking from our group of judges, part of whose history I have disclosed?  I understand there was a judicial person amongst the group which distributed the constituencies in Northern Ireland in their present guise.  His judicial mind did not apparently operate, certainly not in the way in which one would expect it to have operated if constituencies were marked out with any degree of fair-play.</P>
      <P>What is to happen when this commission meets?  I mentioned the President, who may easily accept the view that is held by Fianna Fáil at the moment, that it is a matter of the national interest to get rid of a system that allows small Parties to grow.  May a judge have that view honestly? Surely he may.  At least, Fianna Fáil are belying all their own statements if they think that to allege against a judge that he may have the view that multiplicity of small Parties is a dangerous thing is wrong.  He could hold that, I believe it will be accepted, honestly and if he holds it strongly may he not feel: &ldquo;Now P.R. is gone all right but when it comes to have constituencies, would not it be better still to carve these along the honest lines of my belief?&rdquo;</P>

Is not there plenty of room in them for a person who strongly believes that constituencies should be so drawn as to get rid of such multiplicity of Parties as may be possible even after P.R. is abolished?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do want again to make my position clear in this.  Without alleging anything in the way of dishonesty against any judge, or anything in the way of Party bias, but only taking it that a man may be suffused with the same enthusiasm as motivates all Fianna Fáil at the moment, he may decide, honestly, that it was a good thing to get constituencies drawn in a particular way even inside these terms of reference.  I wonder has the Minister seen the excuses put up for the terrific gerrymandering that has been done in the North.  An attempt has been made to justify the cutting up of the constituencies there on the basis of the number of people of the same kind in homogeneous areas.  That is only because the person there did not like to have orange and green mixing and he saw that they did not mix and saw that even a small bit of orange could give a certain colouring to a constituency even though the prevailing colour, on <Col N="1821" /> any basis of geographical or other administration, was going to leave the colour mainly green.  All these things can happen on that commission and, if they cannot, let us see what else can happen.</P>
      <P>The President may remove, for reason which to him seem sufficient, any member of the commission.  If he is to remove those who have been nominated by the Taoiseach, he must consult the Taoiseach.  If he is to remove those nominated by the Chairman of Dáil Éireann, he must consult the Chairman of Dáil Éireann and &ldquo;consult&rdquo; there has the same meaning as it has in the section of the Bill dealing with the Council of State.  He is not bound by what the Taoiseach or the Chairman of Dáil Éireann may say to him.  He can get rid of the three people appointed from the Opposition because the commission can still carry on.  The commission can carry on with a quorum of four and there will be a quorum of four if the Chairman and the three nominated by the Taoiseach are there and in this draft we have had there is no provision with regard to the replacing of anybody who has been disposed of by the President after consultation with&mdash;but not on the advice of&mdash;the Chairman of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer an honest or a dishonest but a clear distsribution of the constituencies by a member of the Government.  This is a sham.  Deputy Costello called it is smokescreen. Behind that many things can be done, just the same as they can be done by the Minister for Local Government in carving out the constituencies according to his vies, and the Minister for Local Government at the moment and the President and certain of the judges have all been brought up in the same political atmosphere.  Personally, I would prefer to have somebody who could be challenged in this House to divide the constituencies even though it would be badly done and done, as I believe it would be done if done by the Minister for Local Government, with the greatest possible partiality towards his own people.  It would be far better to have it done in that way than to have this sham put up and <Col N="1822" /> within the protection that one cannot go into a court and nothing may be questioned before a court even though it is that the commission have not adequately bound themselves by their terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The whole thing is precluded from examination by a court and one knows what chance will be given here of discussing what a judge has done after he has done something, it is so difficult to get talking at the moment about what a judge may do.  I am leaving out political partiality but simply taking it that you may have a person who honestly believes that the sooner one gets rid of small Parties the better, and that the tendency towards getting one big Party with a small splinter Party is the tendency that should be favoured.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth, unfortunately, is not here.  Deputy Booth was very critical of Deputy Costello and Deputy Booth considered that he had been insulted by a reference as to his position, say, as a member of the minority.  I do not think Deputy Booth was insulted.  I think there was a good deal of straight talk about Deputy Booth but not of the religious minority to which he belongs. As far as I am concerned, Deputy Booth represents what I thought had long since departed from this country. I used to hear people arguing as to whether Dublin Castle was a reality or whether its walls were not now irrelevant, historic dust.  Up to recently they have been.  I thought we could regard it that all that emanated from Dublin Castle had gone and that the ruins of that place were irrelevant and historic dust.  But, Deputy Booth made proposals through letters to the <i>Irish Times.</i></P>
    <P>I am not sure if he did not speak of this at a Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis, but he certainly put himself on record in the <i>Irish Times</i> as to what he wanted done in respect of difficulties that arose when people were crossing the Border.  He wrote a letter to the paper dated 30th October, 1954.  I believe it was published somewhere around 2nd November.  He referred to a debate that had taken place in this House on Partition, and he wanted to know would there be an extadition agreement between the two <Col N="1823" /> Governments.  An extradition agreement. Possibly, the Deputy, although I believe at one time he was a lawyer, does not know what &ldquo;extradition&rdquo; means.  Extradition treaties are made between Governments for the purpose of handing over to each other each other's criminals.  I wonder does Deputy Booth make the assertion that the people to whom he is referring, the people who cross the Border either way, are criminals.  He does in the next line go on to refer to them as &ldquo;politicial offenders&rdquo;.  He asked as an alternative to extradition, that the political offenders who escaped across the Border might be treated simply as &ldquo;rather naughty but forgivable, impulsive, children even in the case of armed assault&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Not since the days of the British Government here has there been any suggestion that our courts were not capable of dealing with our own criminals if they were found in any criminal activity.  Deputy Booth wants to hark back to the days of Dublin Castle administration and throw the people he wants called criminals into the hands of the Northern Government, even though possibly they are only under suspicion.  There is a little bit of the informer about that. That was the Deputy's idea in posing these questions about whether there would be extradition or whether we would simply treat these political offenders as if they were naughty children, naughty but forgivable, impulsive children even in cases of armed assault.</P>
    <P>We know Deputy Booth's view on the North.  The best praise he could give the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste was given here in the Dáil on July 17th of this year when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a matter of great pride to me, as a member of this Party, that the two leading members of our Government are both people who are acceptable in the North.  Anyone who goes there knows that the Taoiseach is welcome in Belfast at any time and that the Tánaiste has been invited there and is welcome there.  You only have to ask any member of the Government of <Col N="1824" /> Stormont as to whether they would prefer a visit from anyone in the present Opposition to have it made quite clear that any member of the Opposition is <i>persona non grata.</i>&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He continued in the speech of July 17th:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would advise the members of the Fine Gael Party to go North and ask whether any of their ex-Ministers would be welcome to go to Belfast and speak at a public meeting.  They will find that they are not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth's idea of a compliment is to say of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste that unlike the Pope at Portadown they are thought well of in Belfast.  It is probably in that mood that Deputy Booth would have people who cross the Border even in armed raids treated as if they were criminals and handed over if we could get extradition agreements made between the Government here and in the North.</P>
    <P>I wonder will Deputy Booth promote those ideas of his now that he has become such a leading light in the Fianna Fáil Party and whether he will see if it is possible to have some agreement made with the North about treating people who cross the Border as criminals?  Will he advocate making agreements for extraditing them, for getting about any question of whether or not they are political offenders?  If he does think about that, I would ask him to think about what the Minister for Justice said here on the 26th March last year when there was a debate on the Adjournment about the release of prisoners, a debate originated by Deputy McQuillan.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice on that occasion said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Deputy is challenging members of the House &mdash; it seems to me almost like felon setting &mdash; to call these young men criminals.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am going to point out that if certain small Parties, people who may congregate in small Parties, are not allowed to get parliamentary <Col N="1825" /> representation in this House they may take other measures, measures for which Deputy Booth will demand extradition and the handing-over of these people to the forces of the North.</P>
      <P>Many years ago there was talk in this House of people who were taking up arms against the country and there was legislation in those days not nearly so severe as the Offences Against the State Act.  Deputy de Valera as he then was brought in a resolution to get rid of that and in a speech on the Second Reading of his own proposed legislation &mdash; I am quoting from the Official Debates, Volume 40, column 53 &mdash; speaking of the then Government, the Cosgrave Government, he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Ministers opposite know only one way in which to solve them.  Anyone who gets in your path, &lsquo;squelch him, by God, squelch him,&rsquo; as Carlyle said of Ireland. That is the only policy apparently that the Executive Council knows how to put into operation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At column 56 he continued &mdash; this is where I shall come back to the Bill:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If you deny people who are animated with honest motives, peaceful ways of doing it, you are throwing them back upon violent ways of doing it.  Once they are denied the peaceful way they will get support for the violent way that they would never get otherwise. There is no use in my preaching that doctrine to the Executive Council. The Executive Council only know one way &mdash; the way of force, the way of the big stick.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The then de Valera then said it was no use preaching that doctrine to the Executive Council which knew only the way of force and the big stick which never ultimately succeeded.</P>
      <P>May I repeat the then Deputy de Valera's phrases:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If you deny people who are animated with honest motives, peaceful ways of doing it, you are throwing them back upon violent ways of doing it.  Once they are <Col N="1826" /> denied the peaceful way they will get support for the violent way that they would never get otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera in those days was pleading that members of the Executive Council should allow some of the irregular forces to get into consultation with them and have conferences. President Cosgrave thought that a better way would be to bring all these people at that time with any belief into this House and give them an opportunity of making representations here explaining their policy and having it tested in public debate and we got rid, even without inter-Party Government, we got rid of the remnants of the gun people who were around.</P>
    <P>Let there be no misunderstanding; I make no defence of anybody who goes out with a gun against any established Government here.  That is not the history of the Party to which I belong.  I am thinking now of people who are not operating guns, the people who voted for Sinn Féin in the last election and who at the first attempt became the fourth largest Party so far as support was concerned in the country.  I have no doubt that many people, particularly young people have since joined Sinn Féin.  Now we are going to abolish P.R. and we are not going to allow those people &ldquo;the peaceful way&rdquo;.  I am not speaking of the gunmen, the people who have despaired of progress here under the Fianna Fáil Government and have not been too pleased with what we did. We are to deny them representation in this House even though we are driving them into &ldquo;the violent way&rdquo; of trying to achieve their objectives and giving them &ldquo;support for the violent way that they would never get otherwise&rdquo;.  That is what we are doing.</P>
    <P>No doubt this country is very tired of the political Parties they know; no doubt there are many young people who are avoiding the polls and no doubt there is any number of people who would be glad to flock round any new leader if he showed any policy or programme with which they could be associated &mdash; and sooner or later Sinn Féin will throw up a leader.  Is it right, at this point, that we should <Col N="1827" /> come out with our objections to small Parties?  Is it right that we should not think of the possibility of growth and should not give room to people who may have good intentions and who may have no association whatever with the other people?  Yet we will not allow those people to get &ldquo;the peaceful way&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not object to people saying in this House that this debate is prolonged. It is necessary to have a prolonged debate; it is our way of exposing to the people what we think about it even if we have to argue about it afterwards in the country again.  It is one way of educating public opinion and I hope the debate will go on for many days so that all points of view will be put forward and so that it cannot be said afterwards that we omitted to recognise any possible danger that exists.  Seeing the way in which the votes went at the last election, and particularly after the revelation of the dishonest tactics used and the speeches made about the future of the country, I should not be surprised to find that whatever support Fianna Fáil had will have waned and waned considerably.</P>
    <P>I am glad there is one issue being put to the country which must unite all the people who were previously in the inter-Party Government.  The referendum will not succeed in abolishing P.R. This is an effort to embalm corruption but decomposition has set in so far that it will be impossible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been many quotations of statements made by the Taoiseach during the debate on this Bill but there is one quotation which this House has missed very badly and when you consider it is a quotation from a member of the Fianna Fáil Party that will surprise you.  At column 30, Volume 110, of the Official Debates of the 18th February, 1948, a member of the Fianna Fáil Party said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Just as King Herod sought to destroy an Infant rival so Eamon de Valera sought to destroy a new Party...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a quotation from a member of Dáil Éireann who was, and I presume <Col N="1828" /> is to-day, a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He compared the present Taoiseach to Herod.  Far would it be from me to do so.  However, if that comparison applied on the 18th February, 1948, it applies more so to-day. The then Taoiseach was being compared to Herod for wiping out one small Party, but here to-day we have a Bill brought in by that one individual, not by the Fianna Fáil Party, by which he seeks to wipe out all.</P>
    <P>I suppose I can boast of being the founder of the first small Party that ever came into Dáil Éireann.  I well remember fighting a by-election in a certain constituency in North Galway in 1940 when the then Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, went into that area with the big black coat on him as usual and told the people there that it was treason for the Clann na Talmhan Party to put forward a candidate. That was in the present Parliamentary Secretary's constituency of West Galway.  Neither Labour nor Cumann na nGaedheal, as they were known at that time, took any part; still the people of that area decided that the seat should be contested.  The Taoiseach said it was treason for another candidate to go forward and I suppose the day will come soon &mdash; I know it is not the Fianna Fáil Party who are responsible; they have no say in it &mdash; when a list of candidates will be submitted to the people and they will have to vote for them whether they like it or not.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health asks; why are you afraid to go before the people?  Thank goodness, I as a member of a small Party can say here I am not afraid to go before the people for the simple reason that at the General Elections of 1943, of 1944, of 1948, 1951, 1954 and 1957, I received more votes in my area than all the Fianna Fáil candidates received together. Therefore, it is not from any personal fear that I speak on this matter, no matter how Fianna Fáil may carve up North Galway.  The reason I speak here is to support the principle that any Party or set of people who come together are entitled to come into this House if they get the <Col N="1829" /> decision of the majority of the electors of a particular area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick of my Party has an amendment before the House for which a good case has been made to a certain extent.  I agree there should be one member in a constituency but let us have him elected by P. R.  Very often it is hard for a man elected to this House to represent people who live perhaps 60 miles away from him. Therefore if the Taoiseach wants to have single member constituencies, let us have those members elected on the system of P.R.</P>
    <P>Just imagine the present Taoiseach going through the country in the near future asking the people to vote against his Constitution.  I wonder how many of you remember him as I do in 1937 in relation to the Constitution against Which he is asking the people to vote now.  Of course, that does not surprise me very much when I read at column 31 of the same Volume I have quoted that a member of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In his political career the Taoiseach has eaten enough of his own words to choke an elephant and it would not do him any harm if he were to eat a few more of them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is from a man who was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and I presume he still is.  I would ask the Taoiseach even now&mdash;I would not ask the Fianna Fáil Party because they have no say in it; they were not considered; quite a lot of them will lose their seats and they know it&mdash; to swallow his words.  To swallow a few more of them would not choke him when they did not choke the elephant.</P>
    <P>Again, the very self-same member of the Fianna Fáil Party speaking on the same date as reported in the same volume referred to &ldquo;... the desire of the Taoiseach to concentrate all power in his own hands and his refusal to share with other Parties the task of building up this country.&rdquo;  He added: &ldquo;We all know that no democratic nation depends for its existence or its <Col N="1830" /> future on the whims of any one man.&rdquo; That is what this Bill is.  This Bill is the whim of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Further on, that same man who was a Senator of the Fianna Fáil Party and is still a member of it used the words: &ldquo;I believe that under the system of P.R. which is enshrined in our Constitution and which the Taoiseach is unable to uproot from that Constitution...&rdquo;  Mark the words &ldquo;which the Taoiseach is unable to uproot&rdquo;.  But to-day he is trying to uproot it from the Constitution.  These are not my words.  They are words of a man who was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every section of the people has a right to send its representatives to this House and the system of P.R. provides that every section shall be represented which gets the votes of the people&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In this House we have had, on two occasions, a Government composed of small Parties.  I listened to Deputy McGilligan and in passing may I pay him a special tribute.  This country never produced a greater Minister than he.  That is the tribute from a man who was never a Fine Gael supporter at any time.  On two occasions we had inter-Party Governments here.  For one reason or another, they may not have lasted the full time but, in proportion, they lasted longer than any Fianna Fáil Government that came in since 1932 and they came in in a rough time also.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy McGilligan, the Minister for Finance in the first inter-Party Government, referring to the achievements of that Government.  One thing he forgot and that is a thing for which he deserves more credit than anybody else, because he was the Minister for Finance he, and he alone, was the Minister responsible for the implementation of the Arterial Drainage Acts in this country.  I know what happened in 1943 when Clann na Talmhan came in here to Dáil Éireann with ten members.  Number one on our programme was arterial drainage.  At that time we could have put Fianna Fáil into the wilderness but we did not do it.  Some people may say: &ldquo;God forgive you for not doing it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1831" /> Before 1943 was out, the then Herod, as he was referred to by ex-Deputy Cogan, saw the danger and rushed through this House the 1943 Arterial Drainage Act.  He then rushed to the country and did Herod on it again.  That was in 1944 and until 1948 what was done to implement that Drainage Act?</P>

      <P>I know that the Bill will be passed by the Dáil.  I am looking across at so many Deputies who will have to vote for it, and I am worrying that it will be passed by <Col N="1832" /> the people also when a referendum is held.  I shall tell you why.  The Taoiseach, referred to as Herod by ex-Deputy Cogan, told his supporters at the Árd-Fheis that they must take their coats off and, if they do that, the Fianna Fáil Party will bring every supporter that they can to vote in favour of the Bill.  I do not believe that more than 20 per cent. of the people will vote on a referendum and, if that is the case, there is a danger that it may be carried.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan spoke of the danger of driving Parties underground, and I believe that is the greatest danger of all.  Of course, the Minister for Defence is a very young man and he may not remember what happened in South Roscommon at the last general election, when Senator Lenihan did not win a seat, and rightly so, as I think Deputy Gerry Boland was entitled to the seat.  Deputy Gerry Boland, however, was accused of &ldquo;spiking&rdquo; them and he was not allowed to become a Minister again.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that it may bring back the scurrilous business carried on, on political platforms, from 1923 to 1943, when the bones of many of our patriots were shaken in the faces of the people in order to get votes.  I remember Fianna Fáil saying: &ldquo;We have 77 in Dáil Éireann commemorating the 77 that Fine Gael executed.&rdquo; It did not suit Fianna Fáil when small Parties arose to abolish that type of business on public platforms, when public platforms were taken up with economic issues.  It was the benefit of the people that was then under discussion but that did not suit Fianna Fáil, and they have now introduced this Bill to abolish small Parties.  They want to resurrect the old, weary, hard things that were done, and probably <Col N="1833" /> had to be done.  They want these issues resurrected and the big chief, with the black coat, will appear once again as the greatest survivor of all, to work these issues once more saying that a Party such as Fine Gael&mdash;which, of course, it is not&mdash;is somehow representing the British Commonwealth.</P>
      <P>They will play that stupid game again and the poor amadán down the country may be led on, as he was led on from 1923 to 1943.  Recently in South Roscommon I overheard two very innocent people talk about this measure at a fair.  One of them asked the other what he would do and what did he think about the Bill to abolish P.R.  The answer was: &ldquo;Musha, I do not know much about it but I will vote for it.  Dev. said it&rdquo;.  That is the mentality and with that mentality the Party over there believe they will last forever.</P>
      <P>I despise Deputies who start talking about graft, trickery, and double dealing. I want to be honest on this.  I believe that any member of this House, no matter to what Party he belongs, is a worthy representative.  Otherwise he would not be here because the Irish people would not have him.  But it is a very bad thing that it should go forth from this House that any graft, trickery and double dealing is carried on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry spoke on this, as reported at column 1619, Volume 170, of the Dáil Debates, but of course, everybody knows that Deputy Corry is not responsible for what he says.  I happened to be at a by-election in West Cork, listening to Deputy Corry speaking from a public platform and saying an awful lot, but a man standing next to me told me not to mind what he said as no one ever took any notice of him.  As reported at column 1619 he stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am giving examples of what happens under this mixum-gatherum and the price paid.  There were seven or eight votes there belonging to the unfortunate farmers of this country.  The price was, one a Minister and another a Parliamentary Secretary.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those were Deputy Corry's words and as far as Deputy Blowick, who was <Col N="1834" /> Minister for Lands for five or six years is concerned, he did his work and did it well.  He proved it to the people and the people, in their gratitude, have approved him at every general election since.  It was not talking about fish he was, and Brown Windsor soup.  He likes fish, but he does not like Brown Windsor soup.  That is the kind of nonsense we have from the present Minister when he is travelling around the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick did his part, honourably and well.  As Parliamentary Secretary I was thanked publicly in Dáil Éireann by Deputy Corry for work I did for him in his area.</P>

I was one of those who, in the last general election, stood upon a public platform and told the people they should not vote for Sinn Féin, that I believed Sinn Féin were wrong. I told them Sinn Féin deserved no support. I was present at a public meeting in Tuam.  The Taoiseach was there, the Taoiseach who is known as Herod to ex-Deputy Cogan.</P>

The Taoiseach was at a public meeting in Tuam and two of his candidates appealed to the people at that meeting to give them No. 2, if they were voting No. 1 Sinn Féin.  There were, of course, a few &ldquo;fooleens&rdquo; amongst them.  They did transfer a few of their votes.  I suppose that happened in other constituencies too.  The result was Fianna Fáil were returned to power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here a copy of the amendment which has been moved by Fine Gael.  I propose to take the sub-titles and deal with them.  Paragraph (5) of the amendment says that there has been no demand by the public.  Must this House wait until there is a public clamour before introducing any measure which a Government, no matter what Government it is, think is for the benefit of the country?  We cannot wait, no matter what the Bill is, until there is a clamour for it.  Any Government must use their judgment and decide on a proper course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no clamour for a change. We are about to ask the people to give their verdict on a certain matter: whether the present method of election to Dáil Éireann is good or whether the straight vote in a single-seat constituency is a better method.  It is a matter about which nobody in this country will bring down the house.  Suppose that during the lifetime of the Coalition Governments there had been a <Col N="1838" /> clamour for the abolition of P.R. Of course, public demand amounting to the proportions envisaged by the Opposition would indicate something radically wrong in the system of election which would create a Government of that kind.  Suppose there had been such a demand in any of those years. Would it have been possible to meet that demand?  Definitely not.  Deputy Corish, speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, said that, no matter what anybody might say, he and his Party were totally opposed to the straight vote and a single-seat constituency. That is and that was the Labour policy.  Therefore, what would have been the good of an outcry from the people or any effort on behalf of the population in any of the years of Coalition Government to change the method of election?</P>
    <P>We have heard it stated in this House that the Labour Party do not consider the Bill worth amending, that they do not believe in it, that they will not have it, and will not even seek to have it amended.  Therefore, any public demand in any of their years of office would have created a major crisis in the inter-Party Government. A Bill of this kind would not have had the support of Labour; it would not have had the support of the Independents. Therefore, as far as a Coalition Government was concerned, such a Bill would not go through the House and, even if there had been a demand from the public, no matter how strong or how insistent, that demand would not have been met and if there had been an attempt to meet it, instead of a referendum, there would have been a general election.  Therefore, I think paragraph 5 of the Fine Gael amendment is very weak indeed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish, whose speech I admired &mdash; he said he was against the proposed change, that the present method was the one that Labour favoured and would stick to &mdash; said that all the Fianna Fáil Deputies were activated by a misguided loyalty to the Taoiseach, that the Taoiseach told them what to say, that the Taoiseach appointed those who were to speak. Various other speakers said that briefs were handed out to back-benchers. That is not so.  I have been told to speak by nobody.  My brief has been <Col N="1839" /> handed to me by nobody and I am free to say what I like.  If I wish or believe, I can say that P.R. is a better system. Personally, I know the P.R. system. I know how it operates.  I know the results it has given.  I have studied the system and it is an involved system. Any booklet on P.R. will take quite a time to read and a very long time to digest.  I am against that system.  I do not quarrel with Deputy Corish because he is in favour of the present system but we have not been muzzled; we have freedom of speech, both within the Party and here.</P>
    <P>Surely it is not misguided loyalty to anyone which gives a unanimous decision at our Árd-Fheis, which was referred to here.  If 100 per cent. in favour shows a misguided loyalty to anyone, what does 99 per cent. against this Bill show?  Does it show 99 per cent. misguided loyalty to anyone or to something?  I do not believe it does. Apart from one Independent, all the Independents and 100 per cent. of the Opposition Parties are totally opposed to the Bill.  That is also 100 per cent. loyalty to somebody or to something. They are quite entitled to it but we here are entitled to our opinion and to give our views on something that we believe in.  I am giving my views on something that I personally believe in. I believe that the single seat constituency is the ideal arrangement for rural Ireland.  I am not so sure about the cities.</P>
    <P>As far as rural Ireland is concerned, I do believe that, in present times, the small, single seat constituency is the better because, as all Deputies and the public generally know, very much extra work falls on the shoulders of a Deputy at the present time.  The many measures of legislation are explained to the constituents.  Representations are made.  A Deputy is familiar with the intricate workings of the various Acts passed by the House and the various regulations laid down under the Acts.  Therefore, it will be more advantageous to the Deputy to have a smaller constituency and more advantageous to his constituency that he should be responsible for a reduced area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1840" /> Deputy Blowick made the case, and Clann na Talmhan have more or less stuck to it since, that it was a variation of the public demand issue.  He asked why did the Taoiseach not consult the local authorities and find their views on this issue?  Why should this matter be treated at local authority level?  Deputy Blowick gave the impression that if the Taoiseach went round and canvassed every local authority and got their views on this matter and if the majority were in favour of a change he, Deputy Blowick, would agree to such a change.  Whether or not such a canvass would show a demand for a change I do not agree that such an action should be taken.</P>
    <P>Local authorities as a rule do not represent a majority of public opinion. If Deputy Blowick's idea were carried out at some stage I think he would arrive at the idea of a canvass of the people in general.  That is what will be done under this Bill.  The proper people to ask when we want their views are the people themselves. That is what this Bill proposes to do and nothing more.  That was one of the main arguments of Deputy Blowick on the First Reading when only the leaders of Parties were allowed to speak at limited length. That is the method proposed by the leader of Clann na Talmhan to test the need for a change.  I think the Taoiseach and the Government in bringing this Bill to the House have gone further and in a better direction than that, in proposing to get the views of the people directly, and both Government and Opposition must abide by their decision.</P>
    <P>I was amused by the Deputy Leader of the Party&mdash;if he is the Deputy Leader.  His speech was full of inaccuracies.  Imagine the picture he painted of the Taoiseach at a fair in a Galway town with two Fianna Fáil candidates seeking election and one of those Fianna Fáil candidates in the presence of the Taoiseach attempting to canvass No. 2 votes for Sinn Féin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in public. That just shows the value of Deputy Donnellan's statement.</P>
      <P>Interference with the legitimate rights of minorities is another point in the Fine Gael amendment.  What do they mean by legitimate rights and what do they mean by minorities?  Or how far to cater for minorities should our system of election go?  Should we cater for minorities of, say, 1,000 in each country?  Or for religious minorities?  Or for political minorities? Or for professional minorities? That has not been explained; it is just the bald mention of &ldquo;minorities&rdquo;. But minorities may have, and can have, access to this House through the representatives, through Deputies in various Parties, including Independents. Minority spokesmen are not to be found solely or, in fact, in the main, in small Parties.  For instance, does Clann na Talmhan claim to represent a minority and if so, what minority?  If they claim to represent the farmers, the farmers are very well represented in various other Parties, more so, I think, than in Clann na Talmhan.  What minorities do the various other small Parties that we have had here through the years represent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point in the amendment suggests that it will become more difficult to end Partition.  If this House introduced a Bill which would make the ending of Partition more difficult I think the first thing that would happen is that our Nationalist brethren in the North would make very strong representations to the Government through the various Parties and through individual Deputies to vote against the Bill.  This Bill has been debated and discussed now for the last <Col N="1842" /> six or eight weeks and so far as I know and so far as I have seen in the public Press and heard in discussions with Northern Nationalists, there has been no criticism of the Bill from that quarter.  There has been no demand from the Six County area that the Bill should not be passed.  There has been no canvass of opposition to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Surely, then, it ill becomes any Party especially Fine Gael, to say that it will interfere with the reunion of our country.  They know perfectly well the proposed system of public representation will not do that.  They know that in the Six County area, where a change has taken place, the results thrown up by both systems are almost identical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy really believe that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures under the present system and under P.R. are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have them, and the Deputy will hear them in a few moments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard them before.  That reminds me that straight voting in the North has thrown up a bigger percentage of Labour in Belfast than P.R. has thrown up here Labour representation in the Six County Parliament&mdash;and Labour is a small Party&mdash;under the very difficult circumstances there, is bigger than Labour representation in Dáil Éireann under P.R.  That is one argument which shows that the abolition of P.R. may not do away with the smaller Parties, and as far as I can judge and as far as the Nationalists in the North are concerned, who have not yet protested against the abolition of P.R., it will not in any way interfere with the ending of Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke, as he always has spoken over the last few years, in glowing terms of Coalitions, what they have done for this country and the great spirit that exists when a Coalition is thrown up by the P.R. system of Government, which can of course happen under the system proposed in this Bill.  Deputy Corish when speaking here had the same idea.  He said he and his Labour colleague were elected <Col N="1843" /> for Wexford in 1948.  He said they came here, got together and formed a Coalition.  He said he felt his supporters down there understood what he had done and thoroughly approved of it and that they would not have thanked him had he come here in 1948 and voted for Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach.  He did not tell us of course that at the next available opportunity, only one Labour T.D. came back from Wexford, that his colleague was kicked out.  That was possibly the result of the action he took and which he led his colleague to take on that occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>At that election he got the seat.  His physical condition was bad; we know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>And at the second one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  Anyhow the action taken by Deputy Corish at that time resulted in Labour having one Deputy in the House from Wexford instead of two.  That is my reading of it, but the other was his. We on this side of the House have given our views on this, both here and elsewhere.  The Government have brought in this Bill which proposes to make a change in the electoral system. As the Opposition speakers have said, it will go before the people for final decision and they will make up their minds whether the present system or the one proposed is the better one.</P>
      <P>Naturally all Deputies and supporters of all Parties will discuss the merits and demerits of both systems.  I must say that P.R. has very many good points, and that the system we propose has its bad points.  There is no perfect electoral system which will exactly mirror the views of the general public.  We know that each of the two systems has its good and bad points. We think the direct vote in a single member constituency is a system which has the least number of bad points and the most good points.  The Opposition think differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1844" /> We and the Opposition will put both cases to the people and the public Press will do the same.  It should be done in a logical, reasoned, unimpassioned manner.  There will be a decision and the Government, all the Parties of the House and the people in general will have to abide by it.  When the decision has been taken, whatever it is, we should without bitterness settle down to the ordinary everyday work of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if in the past 36 years a measure of such importance has been launched upon the people without any demand whatever for it from the people.  It came as a profound shock to the country at large when a political correspondent of a daily newspaper rather intelligently seemed to interpret the mind of the Taoiseach.  We had a follow-up to that when there was an invitation by the Taoiseach for members of the Press to meet him and when he suggested to them that he was going to submit this proposal to the House and later to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach implied up to that moment that this question was to be treated in the objective, dispassionate way for which Deputies on the opposite side are now appealing.  The country was waiting with considerable interest for the precise terms of the suggested amendment of the Constitution. What did he select as the forum?  He selected the annual Árd-Fheis of his own Party.  He asked the delegates in the Round Room at the Mansion House to take their coats off, to get out and get to work, and he followed that up by coming into this House and suggesting, in one of the poorest speeches I have ever heard him make, that the benefits of this measure would redound to Fine Gael. He was asking the members of the Fianna Fáil Party from every part of the Republic to take off their coats and work to the advantage of the Fine Gael Party.  He appeared and has appeared in recent weeks in the role of a rather premature Daddy Christmas who is not quite sure in what direction his sleigh is facing.  He says himself it is directed towards Hume Street.  The Tánaiste says it is directed <Col N="1845" /> towards Liberty Hall, and, of course, neither one nor the other is thinking in terms of Upper Mount Street.</P>
    <P>This measure has shocked the country by its surprise effect.  All down along the years from 1922 to 1948 the Taoiseach had absolutely nothing to say against P.R.  One Deputy alleged on the opposite side that when Arthur Griffith first advanced the cause of P.R. in this country he was an immature politician. It cannot be said that in 1937 the present Taoiseach was an immature politician.  He said at that time that it was a good system, that people understood it, that it worked well.  If they understood it in 1937 surely they have a better knowledge of it to-day.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the people in the country do not understand it.  I claim that what is worrying Fianna Fáil is that they understand it too well.  I can provide definite proof that the people generally understand P.R.  If you take them into the intricacies of the system they may not understand those too well but, generally speaking, they have shown, in the results of elections down through the years, that they have become progressively better informed in relation to P.R.</P>
    <P>I support P.R.  I think it is a fair system.  I do consider, as Deputy Costello did in opening the debate, that it has defects but those defects could possibly be remedied without the operation now suggested.  The Minister for Defence also spoke along that line but if we were to adopt any method for dealing with possible defects surely it would be better than condemning the whole system to political euthanesia.  I am sure there may be defects in the present system but this is my own view.</P>
    <P>I would refer to the filling of vacancies in by-elections.  Opposition Parties have availed of by-elections to disturb the Government in office and I believe that what is disturbing the Government is the results of the by-elections in Dublin and Galway.  A Government that gained 12,000 votes in 40 constituencies in the last general election <Col N="1846" /> lost 9,000 of them between the two by-elections in Dublin and Galway.  It is no wonder that they do not now feel so confident and that the Tánaiste said: &ldquo;This is the last time.&rdquo;  We cannot infer any other meaning from that than that the Tánaiste and the Minister for External Affairs, who also used the expression, feel that this is the last time in their opinion that Fianna Fáil will have the majority to steam-roll this Bill through the House.  That points to the worry which agitates the mind which produced this Bill&mdash;the problem of the succession, the problem of the last will and testament.  But will the people take out probate on that will?  That remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>I concede that we have used P.R. with effect against Fianna Fáil when that Party was pursuing unpopular policies.  The reason the last general election took place was because of the success which attended the campaign on wheat in Deputy Maher's constituency of Laois-Offaly and the by-election in Carlow-Kilkenny which brought Deputy Medlar into the House.  Part of the general unpopularity of the Government at that time was because of measures which it took, and with which the Party opposite did not disagree, but which left this Government with a balance of international payments which this country had never known before outside of the war years.</P>
    <P>The majority which the inter-Party Government had was whittled away in those two by-elections.  We, in our time, whittled away the majority of a Fianna Fáil Government in the same way.  I think that a more just system of filling vacancies could be found.  We know that the ballot papers are kept in the custody of the Minister for Local Government and, when a vacancy occurs, it is my idea&mdash;I am not now speaking for my Party&mdash;that we could save the people the trouble and the country the expense by filling the vacancy caused by taking cognisance of the second preferences on the voting papers of the deceased or retiring member.  The people had already expressed the view that if they could not have A they wanted B.</P>
    <P>That is one of the defects that possibly could be resolved.  It has been <Col N="1847" /> stated here by the Leader of the Government that the new system will encourage the development of two large Parties.  Other Ministers and Deputies have been strong on the point that it is their opinion that P.R. leads to a multiplicity of Parties.  When we are looking to some country which operates the system of election that Fianna Fáil would like us to introduce here we need not go to the Continent to find out how it operates.  Where else would we look except within our own shores? It operates in the North of Ireland. They are our own people, with our own outlook, and surely we should not pass that area to seek an example of the operation of P.R.</P>
    <P>Has it lead to the information of two Parties?  If conditions exist anywhere in the world that would bind everybody together against an overbearing junta such as the present Northern Government, surely they exist in the North of Ireland.  Yet there are now more Parties in the North of Ireland than when they had P.R. in 1925.  To-day there are nine Parties in that House.  Where is the unity of the eight?  Where is the representation of the minority?  It has been whittled away amongst the various non-effective elements under the system of the single non-transferable vote.</P>
    <P>People say that P.R. has certain advantages.  At least under P.R., as we have known it, we have not had that awful experience which is to be found in some other countries of seats being left uncontested.  We have not had that system of election where the sitting member was placed so securely&mdash;it had nothing to do with his qualities,&mdash;had been put in such a safe seat and had such a majority that all others had despaired of ever unseating him.  He is left in there year after year after year.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland in 1921 P.R. operated and every single seat in that area was contested in the election that year, without a solitary exception. In 1925 they still had P.R. and there were eight seats uncontested.  Then they decided to change the system of election.  In 1929, in the first election which was held there, under the system that this Government would <Col N="1848" /> like the country to adopt, there were 22 seats uncontested.  In 1933 there were 33 seats uncontested.  In 1938 21 seats were uncontested.  In 1945 20 seats were uncontested and in 1949 20 seats again were uncontested.</P>
    <P>There you have a pattern of an extraordinary swelling of the list of uncontested seats because a system of election was brought in by the majority Party, which had such an effect to entrench their key men in such a position that, notwithstanding the extreme policies and extreme treatment they were meting out there, it was impossible for any Party to develop to the point where they could put forward a candidate to contest an election.  Is that what we are proposing to do?  Is that the intention of the Government?</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from a work of Professor A.J. Allaway.  Deputy Carty spoke of the simplicity of the proposed system.  I could go into this in detail but I shall confine myself to a conclusion he draws from certain arguments.  He remarks:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Simplicity can at times, however, be purchased at too heavy a price, and Northern Ireland is a good example of this fact.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are many men and women with progressive views on both sides of Northern Ireland's great divide who, because of the electoral arrangements now in operation, are alike condemned to impotence. If they try to found progressive Parties, Unionist, Nationalist or Border-neutral, they find that the votes their candidates poll, however considerable in the aggregate over the constituencies as a whole, are insufficient to return more than perhaps one or two members. This in time disheartens them, and in due course, they descend to oblivion.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1849" /> I wish to quote another authority on the Government of Northern Ireland, Nicholas Mansergh, and he comments in a conclusion that he draws up after very weighty arguments:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The minority, embittered by the partition of the country and resentful of Government by their traditional opponents, were naturally sensitive to the smallest infringement of their rights.  In such circumstances the Government displayed a frankly aggressive attitude in abolishing P.R. for local Government elections in 1922 and for parliamentary elections in 1929. Even if there had been no accompanying injustices of any kind, this action revealed a complete lack of sympathy with the minority outlook. At the worst it was Party manoeuvre; at the best a psychological mistake.  A comparison between the electoral returns before and after 1929 reveals that the change has affected neither the accuracy of representation nor the number of the small Parties to the extent that was anticipated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister for Education might take a look at that, having expressed his abhorrence of the system of multiplicity of small Parties.</P>
    <P>The quotation continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has, however, drawn attention, and added to, the frozen condition of Ulster's political life.  This is most clearly indicated by the very large proportion of uncontested seats in local, parliamentary and Imperial elections.  When 70 per cent. of the members of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland&mdash; admittedly the most important legislative body in the province&mdash;are returned, as in 1933, without a contest, then indeed there is just occasion for the democrat to fear for the future of representative government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We contend that the consequences of the enactment of the proposals the Government now presents to the House <Col N="1850" /> would bring about a situation in this country which could intensify many of the troubles that affect us at the moment.  We could cite many examples in history of where the ill-treatment of minorities has led to the ill-conduct of minorities, and the Irish people are not a people who are any better by being prevented from getting what they have got to say off their chests.  It is a good safety valve and, in the early days of the State, had the Cosgrave Government attempted to do what this Government is now trying to do, we know what the consequences would have been.  They enacted a system, following on the writings of Griffith, that made it possible for the Party which is now in office to become as strong as it did.</P>
    <P>From 1927, when the present Taoiseach decided to abandon the obstruction of the Cosgrave Government by assassinations, with the instruction which was issued to his followers to dump their arms&mdash;that they might want to use them again&mdash;when he decided to become constitutional again, could he have succeeded in getting the dissident wing of his organisation to agree that there was a future in this House for the Fianna Fáil Party were it not for P.R.?  Were it not for P.R. would he have been in the position, as he was a few years later having obtained Government, to make an appeal to that wing to surrender the arms they had in their dumps?  Is that not an example of what P.R. succeeded in doing in the early days of the State?</P>
    <P>We submit that the Party which did so well under P.R. should not forget the system under which they were nourished.  They should not now completely disregard the fact that there may be other minorities, other Parties, growing up in the country, who feel they may have something to offer to future generations of the Irish people. Why should we here enact anything which would place obstacles in their way, which would create conditions in which they may feel there was nothing constitutional they could do to advance their ideas?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence drew an analogy in which I was very interested. He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1851" />&ldquo;I would, for example, arrange in future that the shooting competitions in the Army should be conducted on the basis that the soldier who could not hit the bull's eye at the first attempt would be allowed to keep firing away until such time as he did hit it so as to give him a chance of having as good a score as the marksman who could hit it at the first attempt.  That is what we do under P.R.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Did any marksman ever score a bull's eye at the first attempt?</P>

      <P>A marksman only gets into the championships after very lengthy and intensive training.  He only got into the championships as a marksman.  Perhaps if he started with an outer, or perhaps a wash-out, by practice, by deligence and by training he would then possibly succeed in becoming a marksman and find his way into the national championships.  If the Minister for Defence had his way, unless he secured a bull's eye the first time he aimed his rifle at the target, he would be eliminated.  The Minister presented me with a nice little example and, if he interprets it in one way, I am entitled to interpret it in another way.  I am making the point that in order to arrive at the marksman standard he had to be trained and he had to practise.</P>

There may be other sections of the community open to reason and argument if they are afforded an opportunity of coming into this House.  The most extraordinary statement made so far in this debate was that made by the Taoiseach when he said that the first time he felt doubts about P.R. was in 1948.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

      <P>Pressed to disclose the identity of the people who asked him to abolish P.R., he said they were Fine Gael supporters.  In 1948 the Taoiseach was trying to repair his punctured ego in a modern version of Marco Polo.  He was travelling the world with the present Minister for External Affairs.  Apparently in the course of his voyages he met Fine Gael supporters abroad who appealed to him to do away with the P.R. system of election here.  Could anything be more rediculous than saying that Fine Gael supporters approached the present Taoiseach in 1948 and urged him to get rid of the P.R. system?  No Fine Gael supporters wrote letters to the Press advocating that course.  It was never brought up at any Fine Gael Árd-Fheis.  If his reason for introducing this Bill rests on the alleged approach made to him by Fine Gael supporters in 1948, he had better come again&mdash;or get someone else to come for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1853" /> We have made the point that this Bill will make the ending of Partition more difficult.  Deputy Cunningham does not seem to agree with that. Surely he can see the situation which may result.  The Government of Northern Ireland have employed certain methods down through the years, methods with which none of us agree, in their treatment of the minority there.  Were they the minority, the method of election would be very different. But the important point is that they know themselves how minorities can be treated unless there is a fair system giving them certain rights and certain protection.  The majority in the North to-day would be the minority to-morrow had we an all-Irish Parliament. We should ensure that they will have no reason for refusing any effort at the reunification of our country and, from that point of view, we should do nothing which might give them the impression that their rights would not be safeguarded were they to throw their lot in with us.  We have in times past tried to bring home to these people that here they would have certain guarantees.  If this Bill becomes law those guarantees will have no efficacy and there will be yet another obstacle placed in the way of the unification of our country.</P>
    <P>The statements by Government Deputies that the future of their Party is in no way bound up with this Bill takes some swallowing.  We know how faithfully in the past they have used every opportunity that presented itself to consolidate and strengthen their Party.  That is the legitimate aim of every Party.  We know how constituencies were gerrymandered in the past and the Party opposite cannot wrap itself in a white sheet now and claim to be the &ldquo;Lily Whites&rdquo; in that respect.</P>
    <P>I can give examples.  I represent a constituency where, as a result of gerrymandering, a sitting member of this House found that his house in the middle of a village had become the corner stone of his constituency and a passage at the end of the house was deemed to be the border line between North Cork and West Cork.  What hope had he of ever again securing <Col N="1854" /> membership to this House?  That was done to Danny Arthur O'Leary. Deputy Broderick lived in the town of Youghal.  He represented East Cork. Suddenly Youghal was lifted across Deputy Corry's bridge to become part of Waterford.  Part of Limerick City was transferred to Clare.  Part of the electorate of Cork City found themselves voting in rural constituencies. That had nothing to do, of course, with the fact that the Taoiseach represented Clare and W.T. Cosgrave represented Cork City.  That was purely accidental. Accidental, my foot.  It was gerrymandering as good as anything that might be thought up in Derry.  That is why we are so doubtful of the Taoiseach's intentions in the setting up of this commission to decide the new constituencies.</P>
    <P>I may as well dispose of one point now.  I object to any Ceann Comhairle being asked to select three members from the Opposition to represent the Opposition on this commission.  The Ceann Comhairle should be kept above all that.  We are legislating for posterity.  What guarantee have we should some powerful Party&mdash;it may not be Fianna Fáil&mdash;be elected to Office?  The first thing any Government does is to elect a Ceann Comhairle.  What is to prevent such a Party electing one of their own.  Will he then be asked to select three representatives from the Opposition on a commission such as this?  Have we not the example of what happened in 1932 when Senator Michael Hayes was put out of that Chair.</P>

While I and my Party are quite confident that justice will be done while the present Ceann Comhairle occupies the Chair, I am pointing out that in the years to come some Party may select from their own ranks a Ceann Comhairle.  He will be in a position to use his office to pick out three Opposition Deputies and he may pick three who will not be competent <Col N="1855" /> to represent their interests on such a commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence went on to talk about having to bargain with other Parties.  He was outraged at the idea that, on some occasion, some Party would be obliged to bargain with other Parties or individuals in order to obtain office. Of course, the Minister for Defence was not here in 1951.  He was not here at the time of the busted flush when five Deputies, no longer with us, voted a Government into office and gave them a majority of two, against the expressed wishes of the people who had elected them.  All tribute to the people who elected them because, in the succeeding general election, they did not return one of them to this House.  It was the most remarkable treatment meted out to people for having done something the electorate did not want them to do.  We know that after that had happened a particular Senator was elected, proposed and seconded by the Fianna Fáil Party, and secured a big vote.  He always had to sit in that Lobby and control the forces under his influence.  Fianna Fáil only pay once.  In the following Seanad election he was not sponsored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant to the point the Minister for Defence made in relation to bargaining with Parties.  It was all right then because Fianna Fáil were not strong enough to form a Government on their own.  They were quite prepared&mdash;and we listened for three long years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Other people and other prominent statesmen in their time looked with covetous eyes on the system of election that it is now proposed to introduce, people who were great men, great names.  They will never be forgotten. I will quote just one: 13th March, 1946.  &ldquo;Had the German elections been held on the British or American system, the Nazi Party would have won every seat in the Reichstag&rdquo;&mdash; Herman Goering.  Herman Goering was very fond of the system which it is now proposed to introduce.</P>

He would like to have the British or American system so that his Party could have every seat in the Reichstag.  They were not strong enough.</P>
      <P>What was the reaction among the public when this Bill was circulated? We find that in every local authority where there was a Fianna Fáil chairman he very effectively carried out the instructions from headquarters and ruled out of order any discussion on P.R.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  The local authorities, where Fianna Fáil have complete control, are not being permitted to discuss the merits or demerits of this Bill.  Where they have the opportunity of discussing it, we note with interest the way in which they are registering their opinions. We know the debates that have taken place in educational circles.  The Fianna Fáil Party are usually quick off the mark in putting up good people to speak for them, particularly on Radio Éireann.  But we know the disgust expressed in the columns of the <i>Sunday Press</i> and the <i>Irish Press</i> in relation to the poor effort that was made by whoever was speaking on behalf of the Fianna Fáil point of view when it came to discussing P.R.  It shows the reaction in the country and that is perturbing them because there is a firm belief that on this occasion they have bitten off more than they can chew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that in P.R., the lower preference vote, which has been rediculed by some people, is quite valuable because there were occasions when a great deal was to be learned from the recording of a lower preference vote. It has been asserted that, when the first inter-Party Government came together, they got absolutely no authority <Col N="1858" /> to do it.  Shortly before that there was a Presidential election and the way in which Labour and Clann na Talmhan supported Dr. MacCartan and how their votes were transferred to General MacEoin, who was the Fine Gael candidate, was an indication because, even though it was a Presidential election, it was made political. We know, again, by whom.  In Dublin County there was a by-election and the vast majority of the Fine Gael votes were transferred to elect Deputy MacBride and thereby bring about the general election at the time. There was an indication there again. In one of the first by-elections, which was in Deputy Brennan's constituency, there was the most remarkable transfer of votes from Clann na Poblachta to the Fine Gael candidate, endorsing the action of their Party in the formation of the inter-Party Government.</P>

Do they not know in pocket boroughs, where there is a large majority, how neglectful many of them are of their constituencies?  Is it not strange to think&mdash;this is a point that may well be noted by rural Deputies&mdash; that more than 50 per cent. of the members of the House of Commons live outside their constituencies?  Yet, we are told that the single member constituency means closer contact between the member and the electorate.

Does the Deputy contend in those circumstances that the candidate who secures 6,000 out of 20,000 votes is entitled to the seat notwithstanding the wishes of the other 14,000 voters in that constituency? Does he not know of circumstances that exist where the single non-transferable vote operates, where there are comfortable seats, &ldquo;safe seats&rdquo;, such as the 20 odd seats that are uncontested in Northern Ireland, for example?

Surely the people in the North would be as alive to their responsibilities as the people down here and surely the treatment being meted out to them should be enough to actuate them in their own behalf if they had the opportunities?  But P.R. and the fact that the elector has the right to record lower preference votes is not solely confined to the use to which I have adverted.</P>
      <P>In my constituency we have all watched counts on numerous occasions and we can tell by the way the votes are going past, how the people are recording their views even though these votes may not be transferred on surpluses or eliminations.  I was interested in getting a record of the opinion of Fine Gael supporters in North Cork in the last election.  I found that out of 1,005 surplus votes that I had, 801 went to Deputy McAuliffe, the Labour candidate.  That was 80 per cent. of a transfer. Approximately 80 per cent. had carried on their preference for another inter-Party candidate.  Was that not an indication of an opinion that they will never again have a chance to record if the Government succeeds in its present proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely we all take cognisance of what the electorate records when they use their votes down along the line? One must give credit to Fianna Fáil for being the first Party in the country really to appreciate P.R. and to use it to full advantage because their people were better tutored and their candidates better trained.  The consequence was that Fianna Fáil supporters may have had some opportunity to decide between two or three Fianna Fáil candidates but at least they voted for the team and they were not to vote for any unfavourable candidate. But as the years went by, and because of the policy they pursued the time came when Fianna Fáil found it impossible to get continued voting for the team.  They suffered from frustration on seeing the votes going past with the voting stopping exactly short the moment the Fianna Fáil team had been dealt with.  They <Col N="1861" /> were not giving anything to anybody else, not having any other friend in the field.  They were not receiving transfers from anybody else and consequently P.R. had boomeranged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell in his innocence said that the inter-Party Government when they came into office in 1948 neglected to restore the five-or seven-member constituencies.  Does Deputy Russell appreciate there was never a Party in office at the time of the revision of the constituencies under constitutional requirements except the Fianna Fáil Party?  The inter-Party Government in 1948, 1949 or 1950 could not touch the constituency boundaries P.R. had been used by the Party opposite to whittle away many of the merits of P.R. by increasing the number of three-member constituencies.  That has led to some of the disrespect which there is for the system of election because we have heard repeatedly criticisms of the creation of three-member constituencies where a Party gaining 51 per cent. of the votes could secure two seats.</P>
    <P>Again, in the countries where the non-transferable voting system operates we know there are many issues on which people would like to express views but are given no opportunity. What has happened to the &ldquo;Suez rebels&rdquo;?  Has anybody read of Mr. Nicholson's decision and heard, how having failed to toe the Party line in supporting the Suez episode, his Party met and decided they would select another candidate for the next general election?  They now recognise a man not yet presented to the people: they fail to recognise the man who was last elected by the people.  If they had P.R. would it not be a good idea to let both go forward and let the electorate decide who was right and who was wrong?  The people will not get that opportunity because the Party caucus will decide who will be the candidate.</P>

      <P>I would not advert to them only that Deputy Corry and one or two others said that one of the iniquities of P.R. was that it led to that happening.  I submit that is no argument for the complete abolition of P.R. even if these embarrassments occur where a Party has a number of seats in a constituency.</P>
      <P>The Government is being very coy in regard to elections other than Dáil elections.  Fianna Fáil now and in times gone by has shown a peculiar facility for resorting to commissions set up to examine certain problems and report on them.  We even had a commission to find out the cost of producing one gallon of milk.  Eventually the Minister informs us there was such a demand for the report he was not going to print it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate we have had commissions of many kinds.  We have had a commission sitting in relation to the system of election to the Seanad, but this is a matter that the Government <Col N="1863" /> deem to be less important than the election of the Seanad and does not merit the establishment of a commission where people could sit down and work out the pros and cons, where there would be an examination of all that was involved instead of giving the country the shock treatment to which Deputy Russell refers.</P>
    <P>The Government have not had a very clean sheet in relation to their consistency regarding the Legislature. There was a time when the Taoiseach favoured two Houses but when one of the Houses decided it was going to take certain independent lines and was not prepared to toe the line, the Taoiseach changed his mind and became an advocate of the single House Legislature and so the Seanad was abolished. He admitted he made a mistake and restored the Seanad.  The Taoiseach who is responsible for the method of election to the Seanad, because of the dissatisfaction of the people and the criticism in regard to election to it, was compelled to set up a commission to examine the whole system, with the exception of course of the Taoiseach's 11.  That was not to be examined or commented on.  It was sacrosanct.  If a commission had to be created in order to examine the system of election to the Seanad, why was a commission not set up to examine the system of election to the Dáil?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  The Taoiseach, having made a mistake as between one chamber and two chambers before, having come back to his original idea, he changed his mind.  In 1937, as a mature politician, he wrote P.R. into his new Constitution.  He now changes his mind and says: &ldquo;I was wrong.  I made a mistake.&rdquo;  Maybe he is wrong again.  Would it be a strange coincidence that his change of mind coincided with the exact time the Irish people relieved him of Government and sent him over to this side of the House?  The Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, said: &ldquo;I changed my mind&rdquo;, but did not explain how this miracle occurred.  He just said: &ldquo;I was <Col N="1864" /> a profound believer in P.R. for many years but now I have changed my mind about it.&rdquo;  Can the country afford to have its normal day-to-day working thrown completely into chaos by this kind of thing, that whenever the Fianna Fáil Front Bench think it is time to change something it must be changed irrespective of what views they held in the past, irrespective of what stability the country has known under P.R., irrespective of the fact that only three men have occupied the position of Taoiseach in this House in the last 36 years?</P>
      <P>There have been more changes of Government in Britain and more dramatic changes of Government under the new system than we have known here.  How can anybody make the case that we have experienced instability under P.R.&mdash;and that is the only fault people seem to find against it?  Is it not surprising that we find even in Britain, a country where they are so apt to hand on to their traditions, there is a growing volume in favour of changing the system to P.R., and among the converts is an individual who can surely be said to know his own mind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and what he said is worth reading.  I am quoting from a speech made in the House of Commons on the 7th of March by the Rt. Hon. Winston S. Churchill, who said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whatever view we may take of particularist manoeuvres to frustrate the will of democracy as expressed through majorities...we must not be blind to the anomaly which has brought to this House of Commons 186 representatives who are returned only by a minority of those who voted in their constituencies. Nor can we, to whatever Party we belong, overlook the constitutional injustice done to 2,600,000 voters&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>greater than the entire electorate of this country, I may remark</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;who voting upon a strong tradition, have been able to return <Col N="1865" /> only nine members to Parliament. My experience of life, becoming a long one, has led me to the belief that ill-conduct often results from ill-treatment.  I do not think that this is a matter which we can brush aside or allow to lie unheeded.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was dealing with the fact that the Government Party have been making it a point to prevent any discussion in the local authorities in relation to P.R.  Apart from the present embarrassment in that sphere there is another reason why it would not be well if the members of local authorities discussed P.R. at any length.</P>

      <P>Of course, the orders the local authorities will get once this Bill is passed are flattening orders, not Standing Orders.  It is to make them recumbent.  If the referendum goes through the introduction of P.R. to the local authorities will be a very simple matter.  Having heard all the arguments from across the floor surely no member opposite could stand for having the local authorities elected under P.R.?  They cannot blow hot and cold.  There is an opportunity for any Minister in the course of this debate to say if it is the intention of the Government to introduce the single non-transferable vote into local authority elections if the referendum is passed.</P>

If the younger Deputies on the opposite read a little more of what the Hogans said and did in their time they would be better off.  We have the system of election to the Dáil and the system of election to the local authorities, but there is another election in the offing, the Presidential election.</P>

We have a Presidential election in the offing and the Government were asked under what system they proposed to embark upon the Presidential election.  To the amazement of everybody they immediately conceded: &ldquo;We are going to have the President elected under P.R.&rdquo;  Of course, they are dead right for once. It would be outrageous if we had a President elected by a minority of the votes cast.  But is it right for a President to be elected under that system and wrong for a Government?

We feel that they will be creating for themselves and their successors many grave difficulties if they persist in preventing the minorities from expressing their opinions.  In the difficulties of the last Government, and in the difficulties of the present Government to a greater extent, I feel that we are faced with the situation in which we should be careful and circumspect.  I feel that this is not the time to make it impossible for the minorities among our people to get representation in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have spoken of intrigues and spoken as if the introduction of the <Col N="1867" /> single member constituency would eliminate all intrigues.  We all know that to secure nomination, even under P.R., causes intrigue, but what would it be like in the single member constituency where nomination would mean election?  I have the experience of opening my election campaign on the same day as the local Fianna Fáil candidate. We spoke from the one platform and his convention had been held the day before.  He got up and asked for votes for the other Fianna Fáil candidate and for himself.  When he got down the chairman asked him: &ldquo;Did you not read the papers?  You have got colleagues, not a colleague.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The convention in Mallow had nominated two candidates and the Taoiseach had nominated another who had been turned down by the convention. I must say that on that occasion the Fianna Fáil electors insisted on giving preference to the local view as against the Taoiseach's view when they were marking their ballot papers but they are not to be given that opportunity any more.  Under the proposed system the principal people can be allocated to safe constituencies where they may expect to have an uncontested seat for many years to come.</P>
    <P>They have another think coming. We feel that this proposal strikes at the very heart of all we stand for and we will fight them in this House and continue to fight them in the country having regard to the fact that Fianna Fáil have not got a majority of the votes cast in any general election since 1943.  Out of the 12,000 votes which they gained in 40 constituencies in the last general election they lost 9,000 in the last by-election in Galway and Dublin.  Knowing the number of their own supporters who oppose them on this we are quite confident that the referendum will not be passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>We will not let it go.  We will say everything we have to say on it.  There will be no short discussion on this.  It is very well for the Government that we have this discussion. We came back here after three months to find that the Government <Col N="1868" /> had no programme and the time of the House was taken up by two motions, one from Fianna Fáil and one from the Labour Party.  It is well that we have something to occupy the Deputies' attention.</P>
      <P>Some analogy has been drawn from the fact that the Government have launched this measure without any demand for it.  They have tried to defend themselves on that score by referring to the fact that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, made a statement in Ottawa in relation to the External Relations Act without having referred to the electorate.  No doubt the Minister for External Affairs, if he could get time to look back into his files, would find out the many embarrassing incidents that occurred when Fianna Fáil were in office, prior to the repeal of the External Relations Act and of the many situations that the public knew nothing about in 1948 and that only came to the notice of the new Government when it took over office.</P>
      <P>They found records of incidents far from creditable to this country and they resolved that that situation would be put right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Taoiseach did then was approved in this House without a division, without a single dissentient voice, without a vote being cast against his action.  Why should Ministers get up now and cite the repeal of the External Relations Act as something comparable with what this Government is doing now?  The people know all about P.R.  There is nothing in it that is secret or confidential to the Government.  Why do the people who are trying to make capital out of the declaration of the Republic not come out and say that it is their policy to go back in the British Commonwealth or else shut their mouths?  Why did they not have the courage to vote against it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They did not vote against it because they dared not vote against it but now they are quite capable of coming in here and using the repeal of that Act as if it gave them some advantage. <Col N="1869" /> There is no comparison between what happened on that occasion and the way in which this Government is presenting to a non-suspecting people something that they do not want.  The people do not want to be plunged into all the disturbance and expense that is involved in this.  We say that the Government in office have failed to implement the policy on which they were elected and they are now introducing this measure to throw a smoke screen over their pitiable record for the past two years in office.</P>
    <P>Having led the people to believe that a strong Government, with no strings attached, and not having to depend on anyone to keep them in office, could solve their problems, they have failed miserably.  If what they are doing now is any indication of what a strong Government can be may God protect this country from any further experience of strong Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the type of argument presented by the last speaker is indicative of the arguments being used to prevent the referendum being put through our task is going to be an easy one.  One intervening at this stage of the debate finds it difficult to have anything original to say because most points have been covered since the debate began, but at times it is very difficult to remain seated quietly and listen to the type of case that is being made, a case very often based on absolute misrepresentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity, during the few minutes left to me to-night, to refute one silly allegation that has been made, and which was repeated by the last speaker, with reference to Deputy O'Malley.  I have been present at every meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party since we resumed after the recess, and if any of the members on the other side of the House are trying to make themselves believe that there was any dissension, or suggestion of such, I can only tell them that they are very simple people and, if the rest of their arguments are not stronger than that, or are not based on something more substantial <Col N="1870" /> then, indeed, they have a very poor case to make.</P>
    <P>There was a vague reference made to maps being torn up but it is a pure fabrication.  Nothing happened which would even suggest such a thing did take place, and I presided at those meetings.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker has said that the action we are taking has shocked the country.  I agree that there is a certain amount of shock being experienced throughout the country at the moment and, if there is one thing which has shocked the people more than anything else, particularly the supporters of Fine Gael, it is the valedictory tone of the speeches being made, in which the entire Opposition seem to assume that they have no future.</P>
    <P>There are certain principles established with regard to one or the other system of voting.  It is a well-known fact that under the straight vote, the single non-transferable vote in the single seat constituency, Governments can change much more easily than they can under P.R.  It has been proven in every place, in every country in which the system is in operation.  Why then do the Opposition assume that if the system is changed now Fianna Fáil will remain in office in perpetuity? Have they given up all hope of being able to present a programme and a policy to the people that will capture the majority of the votes?</P>
    <P>In this debate nobody has tried to establish, for one moment, that anybody other than the people will decide who will be the Government of the country.  The people shall decide, and what we are asking them to do in this Bill is to decide whether they want P.R. to continue or not.  If they decide P.R. has to be abolished it is still the people who decide who will be the Government of the country.</P>
    <P>The people of the country can adduce from the tone of the speeches made by members of the Opposition during this debate that they have lost all hope of ever being able to regain a majority in this country except by the slick method they have used on a few occasions in the past.  Deputy Kyne was speaking the other day, and I pay more attention to him than any <Col N="1871" /> other Deputies do.  He stated, as reported in column 1362 of the Official Report: &ldquo;Once they get in, they are there for all time.&rdquo;  There is one thing definitely established about the straight vote; that is if a Party is not loyal to the programme and policy which they put before the people in a general election, they will be thrown out whenever the next election takes place. Can those Deputies, who say that Fianna Fáil are in office for all time, believe that?  If they do then they are paying the greatest tribute they could pay to this Party.</P>
    <P>They are telling the people that this is one Party in Government that is capable of retaining the confidence of the people, time after time; that this is the only Partly capable of putting before the people a programme, and putting that programme into effect after an election to ensure a return again to office.  By no other means can a Party ensure its coming back to power unless they prove themselves loyal in the carrying out of the programme which they put before the people.  Governments can change overnight under the majority system and that is an established fact.</P>
    <P>What of the P.R. system which we are told has worked reasonably well? A number of Parties can go forward, each little Party playing its own little game, one Party appealing to the electorate in the voice of extreme republicanism&mdash;we had Clann na Poblachta in the past&mdash;another Party appealing on the strength of a strong policy of socialism, another Party going completely to the right, all accumulating a certain number of votes in the same constituency, all succeeding in tailing on and getting elected as a result of transfers.  Each can have diametrically opposing policies appealing to different sections of the people and, when they are elected, each of them puts its policy in the fridge for the duration of the Government and they come together to form what they call an inter-Party Government.  When the next elections comes along they proceed to take out their policies and air them again.  What would be the position of Fianna Fáil, under those circumstances in the past, had our Party also been prepared to coalesce?</P>

      <P>Do not get too sore.  It would not be so bad if they came together before an election, as they would be compelled to do now, and tell the people what their policy was going to be.  Nobody could blame any of them if they secured a majority on that basis, and under the straight vote system they must do that.  The previous speaker talked about target practice and he gave an illustration of a marksman who does not hit the target at the first attempt, meaning that the man who tries for the Dáil at first may not succeed but he has a right to try, and his Party may somehow grow to be a large Party.  As the Minister rightly pointed out no marksman goes to the target until he has ample practice first before he goes on the range.  He wants to be sure he is a marksman before he competes and that is the one thing that is certain about the majority system.</P>
      <P>Groups of people who call themselves anything for the time being in order to become a Party must first of all have a definite programme and policy, established and organised, before they present their case to the country.  We had examples in the past of Deputies coming in here and overnight calling themselves anything at all, ratepayers association, monetary reform, anything at all, being simply part and parcel of the Fine Gael organisation that had become frustrated.  That was the type of thing which was picked up under P.R.  Somebody said P.R. casts its net on the electorate and brings in all kinds of fish, even cods.

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That, in view of the national importance of the dairying industry, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the price of milk supplied to creameries should be increased to cover the increased cost of production.&mdash; (Deputy Wycherley.) </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commented last week on the terms of this motion. They are moderate.  They are of a nature which could very well be met by the Government in view of the commitments entered into, but not honoured, in relation to the price of milk during the course of the last general election and in by-elections, by the present Government.  Since that time other factors have contributed to a situation which makes the case to be made to-day even better than it was when those commitments were entered into.  I was impressed by the fact that one Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches, Deputy Moloney, spoke here last week on this motion.  That is quite contrary to the attitude of his colleagues who had not the courage to speak when the wheat price situation was under discussion. Indeed, one redoubtable warrior where wheat is concerned was known to have decamped hurriedly from the House when the Vote was about to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with the points made by Deputy Moloney.  Since the general election the dairying farmers have experienced a very heavy increase in their costs of production. The cost of living everywhere has risen alarmingly.  Efforts have been made to alleviate partially that situation for certain sections of the community.  One of the most important sections in agriculture, the dairying farmers, has received no compensation of any kind despite the fact that costs have risen substantially <Col N="1874" /> and that they too must meet the rising cost of living.</P>
    <P>This Government seem to have gone completely haywire on the question of surpluses.  We know what they did in relation to wheat.  They have adopted a similar policy in relation to milk. The recent White Paper&mdash;a commendable one&mdash;emphasises the advantage to our economy of the beef trade.  The dairying industry is the foundation of our beef trade.  It is the dairying industry which provides the valuable cattle exports, exports which make it possible for people far removed from agriculture to enjoy the standard of living they have.  We know the measures that would have to be introduced to save our economy if we had no cattle exports.</P>
    <P>We are grateful for the conversion of the present Government to the view that our greatest asset is our cattle population.  But they must not ignore the fact that the people who are the foundation of that industry need assistance and encouragement to induce them to continue in the industry.  They need assistance and encouragement to increase the number of milch cows. The last Government did much in that direction by way of the ground limestone scheme, the land project and the reduction in calf mortality from 80,000 down to 9,000 per annum.  Those calves are to-day providing the beef exports from this country.  The last Government are responsible for the fact that farmers now have earlier grass, better housing, improved facilities.  It is in that situation that we have to-day an increased gallonage per cow.</P>
    <P>Instead of help and encouragement, the present Government have imposed a levy on the dairying industry just as they imposed a levy on the wheat.  Milk production is subject to extreme variation. Wheat has a certain stability. Deputy Moloney said he was sympathetic to the remarks made by both the proposer and seconder of this motion. It is somewhat odd that a daily newspaper which conducted a campaign in relation to milk during the time Fianna Fáil were in Opposition did not see fit last week to report as much as one word of what was said in this debate by Deputy Finucane and Deputy <Col N="1875" /> Wycherley.  That is the kind of thing that casts grave reflections on us.  It is something that ought not to be done.</P>
    <P>The terms of this motion are moderate and we are not indulging in any extreme demand of the type to which we were subjected when we were in office.  There is no demand to-day for 3d per gallon for milk.  We were told that was the minimum producers should expect from the then Government.  There has been an astonishing anaemia in the campaign in relation to the price of milk since the Fianna Fáil Government came into office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon earlier this year asked the Government to meet a fresh challenge.  He asked them to assist the dairy farmers in meeting what is required of them to combat bovine T.B.  Between 40 and 50 per cent. of the milch cows in the dairying areas are reactors.  We appreciate the difficulties but, before steps are taken to reduce the problem to manageable proportions, we suggest encouragement should be given to voluntary participants in the scheme.  We have the experience of what has been achieved in England as a result of such a scheme of voluntary participation.</P>
    <P>We support the motion because it incorporates in it our argument that the Government should give an incentive of at least 1d or 2d per gallon to the dairy farmers who voluntarily participate in the eradication of bovine T.B.  We believe that would assist the Government's objective&mdash; a laudable one&mdash;of eradicating bovine T.B.  Ours is a positive suggestion. The disease is detrimental to future exports.  The day the Government made it necessary for the Irish housewife to pay 4/4 for creamery butter was a black day indeed.  That has contributed to a contraction in the home market.  The Government will have to explain their provision of money to make it possible for the British consumer to eat Irish butter at 2/- a 1b.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the difficulty dairy farmers have to contend <Col N="1876" /> with is the fact that the Government claim they are embarrassed by the provision of subsidies for surplus milk products.  The point I am making is that they themselves have contributed to that situation by making it impossible for the Irish consumer to buy butter at a price he can afford and in that way they have depressed the home market for Irish creamery milk.</P>
      <P>There was a challenge presented to the dairy industry in the developments that took place in the manufacture of margarine.  The increase in the price of butter to the Irish consumer has meant that very many people have gone away from consumption of good Irish creamery butter and are now availing of substitutes because they cannot afford to pay Fianna Fáil's price for a 1b. of butter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moloney was perturbed as to where the Government could meet the requirements of this motion.  Is it not a fact that the country has experienced, in the last 12 months, a year such as was practically unknown in recorded history and that the consequences are that no class of farmers have been hit so badly, not even the wheat farmers, and they were hit badly, as the dairy farmers have been?  In the South of Ireland to-day&mdash;my constituency of North Cork is predominantly dairying &mdash;the cattle have to be housed this winter with less fodder and with a poorer type of fodder than farmers have ever had to depend on before. The consequences of that will be that cattle will come out in a semi-starved condition and already the mortality is serious in consequence of the weather experienced over the last 12 months. The result will be that there will be a considerable reduction in the output of milk next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government know that the commitment to met the subsidisation of an exportable surplus of butter will now not have to be met and the Minister has at least £2,000,000 that he will save because of the weather conditions, in the same way as he has already been relieved to the extent of some millions in consequence of the cheaper imported wheat.  If the Government are not careful, they may find that the citizens of Dublin may again have to <Col N="1877" /> eat the yellow imported butter.  Unless the industry in Munster is cushioned in some way against the impact of the awful conditions which they have experienced over the last 12 months, the results of which will continue this winter and into next year, the farmers' incomes will be depleted, at a time when their herds will also be depleted because of the reduction due to activities under the bovine T.B. scheme.  If we never had a bad year, there would be that reduction in the output of creamery milk.</P>
    <P>We think the situation can be in some way alleviated if the Government will meet the terms of this motion.  We suggest to them that they could not meet it in a better way than by applying at least 1d. per gallon increase to the creamery dairy farmers who will voluntarily participate in the bovine T.B. scheme.</P>

      <P>I have had the advantage of reading the debate that took place on the first occasion that this motion was under discussion and of hearing Deputy O'Sullivan's speech just now.  I suppose that practically any member of this Party would have great sympathy with the dairy producers but, being a Government Party, we must exercise a little bit of responsibility, unlike the Deputy who has just spoken.  We must not only think of the benefits that might go to a certain section of the community for whom Deputy Wycherley has made a case, but must weigh against that the burden that would be placed on other members of the community in finding the money to do it.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that Deputies could make a case for many sections of the community that require more.  There are many classes, for instance, living on social assistance, there are many classes like, even Deputies themselves, whose allowances have not been increased for many, many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>One could make quite a good case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Against that, we always have to ask ourselves where the money is to come from.  The great difficulty <Col N="1878" /> about milk is that it is a costly business. A penny a gallon on creamery milk, on present-day production or present-day deliveries to creameries, would cost about £1,200,000.  Suppose we were to agree to that, it would mean that, if the consumer had to pay for the home-consumed butter, that would be increased by 2½d. per 1b. and it would make home-consumed butter even dearer than it is at the moment. I do not think any Deputy here would say that we should increase the home butter price.  If we pass that over, we would then have to find the £1,200,000 from taxation in order to pay the subsidy, that is, the subsidy both on butter consumed at home and on butter that is exported.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan talked about the very steep reduction in the production of milk for creameries.  Deputy Wycherley gave a figure.  At least, he was more particular about the statement he made and gave the figure of the reduction in production for the present year.  It is a small percentage. It is not very big.  I would not like to say at this stage but there might be other explanations besides an absolute reduction in the production of milk in this country.</P>
      <P>However, instead of saving money on exports this year, as Deputy O'Sullivan has said we may, I will in fact be bringing a Supplementary Estimate before the Dáil some time before the 31st March.  I do not know what the amount may be yet but I think it will be more than £500,000 for an export subsidy on butter, more than we asked for at Budget time.</P>
      <P>Again, Deputy O'Sullivan talked about the decrease in consumption of creamery butter.  There is a decrease in consumption of creamery butter. There is an increase in consumption of liquid milk.  Taking them all round, it is not a very big figure.  The fact is that there has been a very, very big increase in the delivery of milk to creameries in both 1957 and 1958, very much higher than it was in previous years, and the product is largely exported in the form of butter and the export subsidy is fairly high.  I am merely telling Deputies what the consequences would be if we were to accept this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1879" /> If we had to find this money we would have to put extra taxes on the people if we were to pursue the policy of balancing the Budget that every Government here professes to follow. If the money were to be found through income-tax it would mean 6d. in the £ of an increase; if we got it on cigarettes it would mean 3d. on the packet of 20; if we put it on beer it would mean 2d. on the pint.  On petrol it would mean another 6d. on the gallon. These are fairly heavy taxes and I am quite sure if I came before the Dáil with the next Budget and proposed these taxes I would get very strenuous opposition from the Party opposite.</P>
    <P>We must keep in mind another point which we must watch, the world markets.  On the British market the amount of butter available has brought down the price and for the most part this year&mdash;luckily during the past few weeks it has improved&mdash;we got very poor prices indeed for our butter.  That meant we had to pay a higher subsidy in order to compensate the creameries for the butter sent out. I want to make it plain that, at the same time, as far as the Government is concerned, they want to see increased production.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to recognise all these factors&mdash;that our production has been high for the last two years, our exports have been high and the export subsidy high, in fact, as much as we can get in the ordinary way.  Still, I want to emphasise that we want increased production. As we said in the White Paper we hope the increased production will take the form of milk produced for some purpose other than butter.  There has been a movement here for some time back, generally known as the single suckling system, and I believe it is developing rapidly and fairly extensively. Personally, I have come across quite a number of farmers who have gone into that system and it is possible that this fact is to some extent responsible for the reduction in milk delivered to creameries towards the end of this year.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that up to the end of August or around that date the amount of milk going to creameries <Col N="1880" /> was higher than last year.  In September it came down a bit lower and since then it has been lower than last year.  That may have been due, I admit, to the very bad weather and the fact that there was not the same nourishment in the grass as we had last year.  Or it may be due to the fact that farmers are going into this system of single suckling of heifers and calves.  I am sure Deputies generally would agree with the Government on this: we want to see the number of cows increased, but at the same time we want the production from these cows used in a more economic way than in producing butter which is sold at such terribly low prices on the world market.</P>
    <P>If I am right in what I say regarding single suckling it would be a great mistake to tempt farmers back from that system by giving them increased prices for milk.  We must keep that in mind also.  Milk production this year was practically as high as last year.  Up to a certain point in the fall of the year it was higher; then it became lower.  If that is due to the weather we would naturally expect production to go up again next year and that it would start next year at least as high as this year and that it would go on to August as high as this year, perhaps finishing higher than this year if we are blessed with better weather than in 1958.</P>
    <P>The trend, I am afraid, so far as can be seen at present is towards higher production rather than lower. Production in 1956 was slightly higher than in the previous year; in 1957 a good deal higher.  In 1958 it was in or about the same.  Let us say that increased production has been achieved on the present prices and we can then say that the prices in operation in the last two or three years have not depressed production.</P>
    <P>We must look at this objectively. Most of us come from the land and we are naturally inclined to be sympathetic to the farmer's case.  Our friends and relatives are farmers and we are inclined that way, but in considering a case like this, we must do it as objectively as we can.  Compare dairying with any other industry.  Take <Col N="1881" /> an industry set up for the last 20 or 25 years and let us say it is doing well, increasing production and growing in volume and getting a certain price for its products.  If a motion came before the House seeking an increased price for that industry's products I am sure no Deputy would agree it should get it.  Would it not be said: &ldquo;Are they not doing very well as they are?  Are they not increasing production?&rdquo; Taking an objective view, I feel the House would say there would be no justification for an increased price.</P>
    <P>From another point of view, let us take the price of milk before May 1st last, before this levy was imposed for export purposes.  The price was 18.2 pence, 1/6½.  That was the average price at every creamery in the country. The average price for 1939, that is pre-war, was 5.93 pence, say 6d. per gallon, or a little under.  Comparing the increase there, with the increase given to wage-earners, for instance, I do not think that wage-earners generally have got more than three times what they had in 1939.  Professional men have not got more; as already mentioned the poor T.D.s have not got anything like that.  I do not believe that the goods turned out by any industry are selling now for three times the 1939 price.</P>
    <P>Looking at this objectively, as we are bound to do here where we must consider every member of the community, I do not think that argument could be made the basis for an increased price of milk.  I do not want to refer to the Milk Costings Tribunal except in passing because we have not debated its Report here and it might be unfair to take figures from that, as perhaps Deputies are not familiar with it.  But I would say this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It served its purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking it to serve any purpose.  I am not quoting it at all but the figures are there in the Library and I say that no Deputy will find anything in that Report to give him reason for asking for an increase in the price of milk now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to go back to the 1/6½ because it was the price in 1957. <Col N="1882" /> When I brought in the Budget last year I quoted figures&mdash;I am not going back over them again as time is limited and other Deputies may want to speak&mdash;to show that the total income that creamery farmers were getting had considerably increased in 1957 over the previous year.  On that basis I thought it could bear some part of the levy toward payment of the export subsidy.  For the year 1958 that will cost them 8d. per gallon so if we take that from the price as already quoted of 18.52d. it means that the price received for milk in 1958, provided of course the butter fat remains more or less the same as it was last year, would be slightly under 1/6 a gallon.  Therefore it does give a margin over the years back to the year that was taken by this Milk Costings Tribunal, 1952-3, of about 4d. per gallon.</P>
    <P>I wonder if Deputies have seen this Irish farmers' journal.  I do not quote them very often and I do not say it is any more reliable than any other paper but their views are interesting on this question.  In a leading Article of December 6th last they are criticising the White Paper and saying we are placing too much emphasis on beef and not enough on dairy products.  They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We repeat at present export prices of beef and dairy products&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to deceive any Deputy. That means the price we are getting at the moment including the subsidy.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;an acre of grass used for milk production will give a cash return per acre that is 50 per cent. higher than a similar acre of grass used for beef production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not saying that is not subject to criticism but it is the opinion of the Editor in <i>The Farmers' Journal</i> and I suppose he has based it on some sort of data.  I would like to quote the last paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With the prices that could be obtained for high quality Irish butter and cheese marketed by a progressive selling organisation, in Britain, and with a reasonable share of the world market for dried milk and condensed milk, it would be possible <Col N="1883" /> to sell, in the form of milk products, much of the increased output of Irish grasslands, with higher profit to the farmer and greater benefit to the State and without the burden of that excessive subsidy that appears to have scared the architects of the White Paper.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Editor of that paper suggests that by better marketing dairy products could be put on the world market and would give a profit to the farmer even without a subsidy.  He may be going too far but he says this export subsidy has scared the architects of the White Paper.  It did scare the architects of the White Paper.  Deputy Wycherley in his speech quoted the White Paper and said we may reach the stage of having to pay £10,000,000 or £20,000,000 a year on export subsidies for butter if we kept on increasing the cows in the country and increasing the production of milk for creameries and if the creameries stuck to the production of butter.  It is not likely that position would be allowed to be reached but it could be if we went on without thinking.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan spoke of the great increase in costs to the dairy farmer in the last few years.  There has undoubtedly been an increase in the cost of living but that does not hit the farmer in many cases as it hits the person living in the town.  I know farmers from my native county who usually supply themselves with bread and butter and therefore the cost-of-living increase does not hit them so much.  In some places it may hit the farmers who do not produce their own bread and butter.  On the other hand as far as farming costs are concerned I do not think there has been a very big increase in the last few years.  Rent remains the same on the farms, and rates have not increased in the last couple of years.  If the Deputies would like to look at the Estimates for Public Services they will find the agricultural grant has been practically the same which means rates remain the same. In fact there was a reduction in the year before last in the agricultural grant and they went up slightly last year but not higher than they were two <Col N="1884" /> years ago.  The cost of labour has not gone up very much in the last two years and taken all round it cannot be claimed there has been a very big increase in the cost of farming.</P>
    <P>I do not want to keep the House too long because I know other Deputies want to voice their views on this, but I want to say to Deputy Wycherley that while we may have our sympathy with the dairy farmer we must keep all these other matters in mind.  I have no doubt Deputy Wycherley is perfectly sincere in his endeavours to get better treatment for the milk producers, and I only ask him to realise that even though he may not like our attitude or may be disappointed, we are sincere also in our approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to warn him also that, in assessing the sincerity of the Fine Gael Party, he should keep in mind that about four years ago or perhaps more, they were in favour of reducing the price of milk from 1/4½ to 1/- per gallon and, as a Party who when they were in power made that proposition to the creameries, they have some courage, let us say, standing up here and asking us to forget all those things and expecting us to think they are honest in expressing the opinion now that the price of milk should be increased. In conclusion, may I say that I agreed on rather short notice to take the place of the Minister for Agriculture who is regrettably unable to be present to-night.</P>

It is a very moderate motion which only asks for an increase in the price to cover the increased cost of production.  If I had anything to <Col N="1885" /> do with the wording of that motion I would be inclined to advocate that the farmer should get not only the cost of production but also a small margin of profit to which any person engaged in business is entitled.  I was more than surprised the Minister did not go some of the way to meet the Deputies who put down the motion, particularly in view of his pronouncements in the past.  It astonished me so much that I asked myself if this was the same Minister who now is all in favour of calves as against milk.  I could not help throwing my mind back to the time the same Minister was busily engaged with the knife on the throats of the calves of this country.</P>

      <P>The moment we got back Deputy O'Malley took up the cudgels in asking question after question about the price of milk.  In that he was helped out by Deputy Corry, supported by a Deputy who is no longer a member of this House. Why does Deputy O'Malley or Deputy Corry not raise their voices in the House on this matter now?  When our Government was in office they were raising questions all the time about the price of milk but I should like to hear something from them on the matter to-night.  As I said, Sir, I shall be brief and I should like to give these Deputies a chance to get in and explain their attitude now.</P>
      <P>Is it not time to take off the levy of 17/- per cwt. on the milk producers of this country and give it back to them? That is practically 2d. per lb. on butter if it takes three gallons of milk to produce one lb. of butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must have very bad cows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case of a small farmer who keeps eight cows. About 500 gallons per cow is the average.  He sends approximately 4,000 gallons of milk to the creamery in any lactation period.  That is 1,333 lb. of butter and at the rate of 2d. a lb. that farmer is savaged to the tune of £11 2s., if not more.  The price of butter has increased in the British market <Col N="1887" /> by about 100/- per cwt. since that levy was put on so it is more than time that that levy should be abolished.  In fact, the Government should go further and refund to the farmers the amount that he has taken from them.</P>
      <P>The Minister went back to 1939 and said that the farmers are now getting three times the price for their milk that they got then.  Why did he not go back to 1839 and say what was happening then?  The price of milk has increased from the 5d. or 6d. a gallon it was then to the present price but why did the Minister not refer to the fact that everything the farmer has to buy, the cost of living and the cost of labour has also increased?  The price of farm tools has gone up by from four to six times what it was.</P>
      <P>I should also like to ask about the replacement of cows.  We all know how much the cost of replacement has gone up.  It is all very fine to say that the price of milk has gone up to three times what it was but the farmer's expenses have gone up at least four times and, in some cases, by six times as much as they were in 1939.  As long as the Minister pulled that stick to help himself out in the attitude he is taking with regard to this motion it is only fair to state the other side of the case and the other side of the case is that the farmer's cost have gone up much more than his prices.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister what is going to happen about the farmer who has to replace reactor cows.  The Minister kept away from that question. The dairying industry is one of the foundation industries of this State. Without it you would have no cows or store cattle.  Reactor cows will have to be replaced.  The Government is telling the people, in a much talked-about White Paper, that they want 1,000,000 more cows.  They are setting about getting them in a very strange way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister slid over the reduction his Government has brought about in the price of milk.  In March, 1957, the price was 18.52d. per gallon, something over 1/6 a gallon.  The price to-day is only about 1/2 per gallon.  The farmer is getting 1/4 for his milk in the creamery but out of that he has to pay 2d. a gallon cartage.  The average <Col N="1888" /> farmer has lost at least 2½d. per gallon on his milk price over the last 18 months.</P>

      <P>The figures are there. The Parliamentary Secretary's figures are contradicting his own Minister. Unless that is the case I do not know what it is.  Apparently members over on that side speak just as it suits themselves. I remember an election campaign in North Kerry where posters, dealing with the price of milk, were displayed on the walls of polling booths, stating that Fianna Fáil would give an increase in the price.  Those posters were displayed for the man who is now Deputy Moloney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency it was the price of wheat that was in question during the elections.  When Fianna Fáil are out of office they think anything is good enough in order to fool the people and to catch their votes.  If there is one broad fact staring everyone in the face about this question it is the fact that the price of milk is insufficient.  The proof of that is that we have the highest percentage <Col N="1889" /> flight from the land of any country in the world.  That is clear proof that the agricultural industry is not being fairly treated.  Milk is only one facet of that industry but it is a most important facet.  Our land is rapidly being absorbed into big ranches for the simple reason that fathers and mothers, after rearing their families, cannot get one son to stay on the land because the sons refuse to be tied to slavery as their parents were.</P>
    <P>In all sincerity I say to the Government that the treatment of the farmers has produced nothing but a flight from the land.  Is it not time that we changed our outlook and, instead of cutting down on the farmer, on the farmer's workers and on their wages we should help them?  Since the State was founded all our policy has produced is a dying countryside about which people write books such as <i>The Vanishing Irish.</i>  Is it not time that an opposite course was taken?  I believe it would produce something good.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister taxation will be raised if the price goes up.  We never grumble when the working man gets an increase in his wages when it is due, nor when the professional man gets a just increase in his salary, and I do not know why our farmers should always be regarded as hewers of wood and drawers of water.  People in the cities do not want to see their parents, brothers and sisters in the country converted into hewers of wood, drawers of water, or slaves, not alone for our own country but for England as well.  The present system has produced nothing but a flight from the land, and it is about time a change was made and that the farmer was paid for his work.  Such a change would stop the bleeding curse of emigration.</P>

      <P>Everyone agrees that the production of milk is a very important part of our agricultural industry, and it is a surprise to me that such an important matter should be under discussion here to-night without the presence of a Minister. I say this with all respect to the Parliamentary Secretary who is <Col N="1890" /> present.  However, I received some consolation from the concluding statement of the Minister for Finance when he made an apology for the absence of the Minister for Agriculture as, up to that, I felt that the Minister was wilfully absent.</P>

      <P>A reasonable price for milk has been the subject matter of various discussions in this House since I became a member.  So much was that the case that a number of years ago the late Deputy Walsh, God rest his soul, then Minister for Agriculture, established what was then known, and is now known, as the Milk Costings Commission&mdash;the greatest fraud ever set up by any Government in this country.  At that time the milk producers were dissatisfied with the price of milk, and the late Deputy Walsh said they would set up a commission which would make an impartial observation of the farms throughout the country, taking into account the different types of farms, and the commission would report on what in their opinion was a reasonable and fair price for milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some farmers were satisfied that the Government were sincere in setting up this Milk Costings Commission, and anticipated a report stating that the price of milk should be so much.  They expected that report within a reasonable time and, after six years' deliberation, the commission submitted a report.  I am not criticising the members of the commission.  I said the Milk Costings Commission was the greatest fraud but I think I was wrong to say that.  It was the people who set up the commission with fraudulent intent who were the guilty party.  The commission produced its report and I must say, in fairness to the members <Col N="1891" /> of that commission, that it was to some extent reasonable in so far as the cost of production of milk varies so much in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>In any part of the country, in West Cork, it is much more costly to produce a gallon of milk than say the area which the Parliamentary Secretary represents.</P>

      <P>The commission reported that in their opinion the cost of producing a gallon of milk in the Republic of Ireland varied from 5d. per gallon to 2/9 per gallon.  On that assumption it would seem that farmers in the more favoured places are getting a very good price for their milk. It also shows that many farmers&mdash;and these are the farmers in the congested districts&mdash;are getting what can only be described as a miserable pittance for their milk.</P>
      <P>If the commission states, as it has stated, that it costs farmers 2/9 to produce a gallon of milk in some parts of the country, how can responsible Government, having set up that commission, ask these self-same farmers to sell this milk at an average price of 1/4 a gallon?  It is impossible for them to do so.  I am here as a representative of West Cork where dairy farming is of such importance but, due to the nature of the land, the farmers are at a great disadvantage and, were it not for their own industry, and their smallholdings, they could scarcely exist at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1892" /> I know this is a national question.  I doubt if you have in this country a more industrious body of farmers than those in West Cork.  I see them every morning jogging along with their pony and car, their donkey and cart, or their horse and cart to the creamery.  Many of them have only a small quantity of milk because their farms are not capable of producing large quantities. Milk production is their main source of livelihood.  I was brought up on a small farm myself and I know that the price is completely uneconomic.</P>
    <P>I disagree <i>in toto</i> with the Fianna Fáil approach to this question of milk prices.  While Fianna Fáil were in opposition, as everyone knows, they haunted the Minister for Agriculture in the inter-Party Government in connection with the price of milk.  Quesion after question was asked here in the House; it was said then that it was uneconomic for farmers to try to produce milk at the prevailing price. Fianna Fáil are back in office now. They are fortified by the report of the commission they themselves set up That commission makes it clear that it some parts of the country it takes up to 2/9 to produce a gallon of milk.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy Moher may ask what we did when we were in office from 1954 to 1957?  How did the Leader of the Labour Party address himself to this question of the price of milk?  Deputy Norton then Minister for Industry and Commerce, realising the importance of the agricultural industry and the importance of milk and butter as food for our people, and appreciating the difficulties inherent in the production of milk, took a straightforward course.  He said that in these commodities we had a staple food produced at home: &ldquo;We would like to have butter consumption as high as possible because we appreciate that butter is a sound, solvent food.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conjunction with the other members of the inter-Party Government a subsidy was put on butter to help the producer and to help the <Col N="1893" /> consumer.  The price was reduced. That was a marked advantage to both the producer and the consumer. Fianna Fáil on their return to office removed that subsidy.  What has happened? The consumption of butter has gone down substantially with the result that we have more butter on our hands for export.  The extraordinary situation then occurs in which the Government subsidises the export of butter to enable the British housewife to consume it.  The more we export the bigger the subsidy.  The inter-Party Government gave a subsidy of 5d. per lb. to enable Irish families to consume Irish butter rather than pay 1/3 per lb. to enable British families to consume it.</P>
    <P>The price of milk in my constituency is wholly uneconomic.  I am quite positive of that.  The Costings Commission has told the Government that. What is their reaction?  The Minister for Finance tells us that if we give a penny per gallon that will cost £1,200,000.  That, he says, cannot be done.  The milk producers have enough.  As the Minister mentioned, every section of the community has received some increase to offset the increase in the cost of living.  We are as much concerned with the self-employed as we are with ordinary wage earners.  We put all in the same category.  Even this morning we learned of another section being compensated for the increased cost of living.  Over the past six or seven months we have granted concessions to all classes.  Local authorities and public bodies unanimously granted these concessions.  But when it comes to the milk producer and the small farmer the question of compensation will not even be considered.  The only reply is: &ldquo;Are we going to increase the packet of cigarettes by three-pence? Are we going to increase income-tax by 6d. in the £?&rdquo; That was the Minister's contribution to-night. Why does he not ask the same question when other sections of the community are being compensated?</P>
    <P>There is the strongest possible case for supporting this motion.  I am indeed disappointed with the Ministers' contribution here this evening.  I had <Col N="1894" /> hoped that he would at least hold out a promise that something would be done, even if it were only one penny. That would help to compensate to some extent.  It is not my wish to introduce extraneous matters, but I must mention the difficulties in which many farmers in West Cork find themselves due to the variation in the system operated by the Dairy Disposals Board.  The Chair may rule that that is not relevant, but it is relevant to the extent that the proposed changes will impose extra costs on the producers in many areas.</P>

      <P>It was specifically written into the undeveloped Areas Act that no help could be given to the agricultural industry under that Act.  I have questioned that on a few occasions.  It is recognised by all that agriculture is the premier industry. The Parliamentary Secretary, as the only representative of the Government here, could usefully enlist his good offices on behalf of the undeveloped areas.  He knows the West of Ireland and the congested areas generally.  He knows the conditions that obtain.  If he can get some help for the small farmers in these areas under that Act he will be doing a very good day's work.</P>
      <P>The Minister's statement will be a source of disappointment to the milk producers.  They will be sorry to learn that there will be no compensation for them.  It will be a shock to many farmers when they discover the changed attitude on the part of Fianna Fáil as compared with the time when they were in opposition.  In those days we heard a good deal about stable Government.  That is what they were looking for in 1957.  They have it now.  They can do what they like. We have had a clear indication to-night that so far as milk producers are concerned they will get nothing from Fianna Fáil.  The only consolation they will have is just another broken promise.</P>

      <P>I wish to support this motion.  It is a very reasonable motion. <Col N="1895" /> It requests that the price of milk supplied to creameries should be increased to cover the increased cost of production.  The Minister for Finance has told us that it is not possible to give any increase in the price of milk. He said that a 1d. a gallon would cost over £1,000,000 and asked how was that to be found, that he had to maintain some balance, that other people would have to be taxed to meet that increase and that that was unfair.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Murphy has said, other sections of the community are able to obtain increases.  It is not necessary for the Minister to ask the House how the money is to be found.  It seems now to be the policy of the Government that, if the farmers increase production, the price will go down.  There was the example of wheat and now there is the example of milk.</P>
      <P>There is one matter that has come out in the statement of the Minister, namely, that we are turning away from milk production.  Now, the Minister, in his own words, is looking forward to increased calf production.  I thought the Minister would at least blush when he told us about increased calf production and the single suck calf.  It is not so many years since he was advocating the cutting of the calves' throats.</P>

      <P>The Minister told us that the Government did not look for increased milk production.  They were anxious to get increased production but it is the policy of the Government not to pay for that production.  Every section of the community that demanded their rights got them but the farmer is not entitled to his increased cost of production.  It has been proved beyond doubt in this House to-night that there has been a definite increase in the cost of milk production.</P>
      <P>There has been a substantial increase in the cost of living and most sections of the people have got some compensation for that.  Although the Minister tried to prove that his cost of living did not increase considerably, the cost of food to the farmer is the same as it is to any other section of the community.</P>
      <P>There is another very important factor in the present situation.  I refer to the bovine T.B. clearance areas.  The farmers who are affected will lose a tremendous amount of money if they are to clear their herds of T.B. Compensation will have to be given. The Minister did not mention that matter, but merely told us that there was no hope whatever of increasing the price of milk.</P>
      <P>We know what happened in 1952, when the Milk Costings Commission was set up.  That was done when there was pressure on the then Minister for Agriculture to increase the price.</P>

      <P>And by others as well as Deputy Blowick.  The farmers, apparently, are not entitled to the price they had two years ago but must suffer a substantial reduction.  Every other section is entitled to an increase but the farmer has to bear a loss.  The Government have issued a White Paper asking for increased production. Do they expect to get increased production from the principal producers, the creamery milk suppliers, by this method?  If they do, I am afraid they will not get very far.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things I always regret is that when it comes to a discussion on the question of milk prices in this House the discussion always proceeds in a kind of political climate.  I do not know why that should be.  I listened to Deputy Blowick deny that the former Minister for Agriculture was in trouble in relation to the price of milk.  There are all kinds of allegations made from the opposite benches of extravagant promises made by speakers here, there and everywhere, during elections.  Representing <Col N="1898" /> a dairy constituency, I can say that in the many speeches I made in that constituency I never made a speech on prices.  I have made many speeches in other constituencies in by-elections and I challenge any Deputy to say that I ever made a speech on prices.</P>
      <P>Milk prices can hardly be divorced from cattle prices.  The two branches are interdependent.  There is another factor, a very important factor.  If any Deputy were to examine the steep variations in the production of herds in a branch creamery area he would realise the enormous differences in income between producers who are low on the scale and those who do the job as it should be done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy made a particular case for the constituency he represents. I think we could describe Deputy Murphy, as far as the constituency of West Cork is concerned, as pleading for his own.  He can always plead that a special price should be paid as far as West Cork is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>If you fix the price at the average price you may be certain you will put a high proportion of low producers out of business and I feel that costings at a price-fixing medium constitute a very dangerous medium.  I think we must try to maintain a price that will keep all the producers in business and, having done that, if you are to use costings as a price-fixing medium you must certainly go far down the scale to keep the low producers in business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister intervened he made the point very effectively about the capacity of the Exchequer to carry the subsidy.  The same point was made by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister <Col N="1899" /> for Agriculture and Deputy Blowick vehemently denied there was ever a question of 1/- a gallon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have a document here, and when I have finished quoting it the Deputy may be convinced.  It may refresh his memory.  I recall a meeting of the Federated Creameries held in Limerick to discuss a certain document issued by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon.  I sat and listened to the farmers trying to frame a reply to that document which was issued from the Minister's office on the 22nd March, 1950.  When the discussion had continued for hours I finally intervened and suggested that a resolution be sent which would not state a price but which would guarantee the farmer the cost of production with a reasonable profit.  That was the resolution finally adopted and sent up.</P>
      <P>I shall quote the document to convince Deputy Rooney.  It was an extract from a speech made by the Minister for Agriculture in Dungarvan and it was circulated to a number of creameries, I think to 193 co-operative creameries.  As far as we know 93 creameries did not reply, 95 others refused to accept the proposal and three creameries agreed to the proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>It was issued from the Minister's office under his signature on the 22nd March, 1950.  It ran:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I would like to direct your attention especially to the fact that there is no reference to a fixed price for milk.  The reason for this is that I am anxious to ensure, if possible, that the co-operative creameries will have restored to them full freedom <Col N="1900" /> of action in their own business, without dependence on any production allowance; that there will be no fixed price for milk to which reference can be made where milk is used for purposes other than manufacture of butter.  Therefore, I have proposed the formula of a guaranteed price for butter which leaves it open to individual creameries to pay their suppliers whatever that price for butter permits, and, in many cases, this may be materially greater than 1/- per gallon for milk.  I will be grateful if you would submit this matter to your committee and let me have the benefit of your advice thereon, at your convenience.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if your committees would bear in mind one vital consideration, i.e., the milk supply shows a marked tendency to expand very greatly, and it is not impossible that before the end of October we shall have manufactured all the butter which the domestic market (assuming all rationing is abolished) is capable of consuming.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is the vital paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From then on until the 1st April, 1951, we would be faced with the situation that all butter produced would have to be exported on terms involving the payment of £4 per cwt. to our foreign customers to take it away, and grave consideration would have to be given to the restriction of production.  It is, therefore, impossible to forecast with any degree of confidence what price would be paid for butter in 1951, not to speak of the ensuing four years.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On the motion for the Adjournment Deputy McQuillan gave notice that he would raise the subject matter of two questions on to-day's Order Paper.  I want to make the position clear in respect of raising two matters on the Adjournment. I have refused to allow two before, but in this instance they are two incidents arising from the one source.  That is the reason I am allowing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Ceann Comhairle has pointed out, the subject matters of both questions are interrelated. I want to make it clear at the outset that the public mind is deeply disturbed as a result of two events which were the subject matter of questions in the Dáil to-day.  In raising these two questions, I want to make it clear that although the majority of the people in this country do not subscribe to the political views of the individuals who are at present in the internment camp, at the same time the general public feel deeply disturbed at the manner in which the events which took place on last Tuesday week were handled.</P>
      <P>The fact that the people do not agree with the political views of these young men gives no excuse to any Government to act in the callous manner in which they have acted in connection with the events of last Tuesday week.  I intend to deal with the two questions separately at this stage.</P>
      <P>In the first question the Minister for Defence was asked whether he would state (a) number and names of detainees injured at the Curragh on Tuesday, 2nd December, (b) the nature and extent of their injuries, and (c) when their next-of-kin were notified. The answer given to that question was:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Five detaines received minor injuries caused by tear gas grenades. Their names are Brian Boylan, Patrick O'Sullivan, James Columb, Liam Fagan and Patrick McGuirl. <Col N="1904" /> They were advised to notify their next-of-kin, this being the normal practice in the case of detainces who are not seriously ill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We all know that on Tuesday week there was a break out from the Curragh Camp.  That night the Government Information Bureau issued a statement in connection with the break out.  That statement was published on Wednesday, 3rd December and I propose to give just a short extract from that statement with reference to this question.  The Government Information Bureau stated that tear gas grenades were also used as a result of which two detainees received minor injuries in the leg.</P>
    <P>That statement was made on behalf of the Government on Tuesday night after the occurrence.  One would expect that a statement from a Government Department would be a realistic and true one and would be accurate especially in view of the serious nature of the occurrence earlier in the evening but we find that the statement by the Government on Tuesday was completely inaccurate and misleading because on December 5th, three days afterwards, a further Government Information Bureau statement was issued which stated that a total of five detainees were treated for minor injuries caused by gas grenades which were used to check the break out.  Here we have a Department giving on two different occasions two different reports in connection with this event.  Can we rely upon the Government Information Bureau or, shall I say, the Department of Defence and the Minister who gave the information to the Bureau, for accuracy and can we rely on the Minister and on the Department for an honest statement in connection with the matter?  I say we cannot because the two statements are in complete conflict.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday night after the occurrence the evening papers had it, the wireless had it.  The relations of the young man who are interned, naturally enough, were frantic with anxiety as to the welfare of their relations. Relations of those young men tried all possible sources of information at their <Col N="1905" /> disposal.  The mothers of a number of the internees contacted various Government Departments.  They contacted high political officials and public representatives and in one particular, specific instance a mother rang the President of Ireland to find out whether her son was injured or not in the break out from the Curragh that evening. Believe it or not in this civilised or so-called civilised Christian State we have a Government that refused point blank to make known to the relatives of these young men whether or not they were injured in the escape.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister to-day if he would state when the next-of-kin were notified that these five men were injured and the Minister, Deputy Kevin Boland, said he understood that four of the detainees concerned notified their next-of-kin.  That is the reply given by a Minister of State in connection with the injuries received by detainees in the camp and that was the sole means of allaying the anxiety of the relations, mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters.  The Minister understood that four of the detainees had notified their relations.  I know of no civilised country where an individual who was under restraint and where that individual was injured that his relations were not notified officially afterwards by the responsible authority as to the nature and extent of the injuries received by the individual.</P>
    <P>Here we have the case where, although the relations of the people concerned tried every possible means at their disposal, they were met with a point blank refusal and no information could be made available to them as to whether their son had been injured or not.  Imagine a Minister coming into this House and telling the Dáil seriously, that the detainees were told in the Curragh Hospital by a military policeman: &ldquo;You can notify your relatives that you were injured.&rdquo; That is how this Department of Defence treats people who are injured.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can rely on the accuracy of the statements issued by the Minister and his Department.  That is one of the reasons why the public are perturbed, because rumours are flying around the Curragh and elsewhere <Col N="1906" /> at the moment that some of these internees received more than minor injuries.  But we have no way of finding that out.  No Deputy will be allowed down to satisfy himself as to whether or not the internees were seriously injured.  All we get is a statement from the Government Information Bureau&mdash;a Bureau which has proved itself completely inaccurate, even as far as giving the numbers injured.</P>
    <P>I can challenge the Minister now as to whether 11 other internees received treatment for minor injuries as a result of the fracas that occurred on Tuesday, 2nd December.  Will he deny that 11 other individual in the camp were treated for injuries, apart from the five who are still in hospital with alleged minor injuries?  Some of the injuries, we are told, were received because tear gas grenades exploded. Anybody who knows what these grenades are like will realise that they could blind a man for life and that it is a dastardly thing to throw a grenade among a group of unarmed men.  It was luck which saved them from more serious injuries, if they have not received more serious injury.</P>
    <P>I raised that matter because the Irish people, irrespective of whether or not they approve the policy of these men, consider that these men should not be treated like animals and that their relatives should be notified as to whether or not they were injured.  We have not reached the stage yet where a man can disappear as he can behind the Iron Curtain.</P>
    <P>The second question I want to raise is in connection with an event that took place on the following evening, Wednesday evening.  I asked the Minister if his attention had been drawn to the fact that a military patrol had opened fire on an E.S.B. truck at Ballymanny, on December 3rd, and if so, what instructions were issued to the military on this occasion and if he would make a statement on the matter to allay public uneasiness and to ensure a similar incident did not occur in the future.  The Minister went on to tell me that the report on this incident showed that on being <Col N="1907" /> signalled to halt, by means of a red lamp, the truck slowed down, then swerved towards one of the soldiers and accelerated.  He said that the soldier had to jump out of the way to avoid being run down.  His life was thus in danger and he and a companion soldier reacted to this highly dangerous and suspicious manoeuvre by firing at the tyres of the truck in an effort to halt it.  The Minister went on to say that the soldiers had not acted improperly in the circumstances and, therefore, as far as the troops were concerned there was no question of ensuring that a similar incident did not occur in the future.</P>
    <P>In other words, it is left to the judgment of a private soldier, perhaps an untrained private soldier, to decide, if he thinks his life is in danger, whether or not he can fire on a vehicle that passes and refuses to halt. There is no state of emergency declared in this country and it is a disgraceful situation as has happened, that soldiers with only three weeks' training, raw recruits, were brought out on duty with bandoleers and put searching for escaped internees.  These soldiers, according to the Minister's reply, had no instructions as to whether they could or could not fire at vehicles.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose that a car load of people left Dublin to go to Shannon Airport and that it was speeding along that road to get down to the airport in time.  Suppose that on the road they saw a man waving a red light in front of him and if those people decided that it was somebody looking for a lift and swerved past that man then, according to the Minister, if it was soldiers who were there with the red lamp they would be entitled to fire on that car.  That could mean that a tragedy could occur and a number of peoples' lives could be lost.  It was only by the grace of God that the driver of that E.S.B. truck was not killed.  Let us look at it this way.  As we know the driver of and E.S.B. truck is not entitled to carry passengers.  On the road between here and Naas and Kildare from six o'clock in the evening onwards you will meet private soldiers <Col N="1908" /> along the road signalling with their hands for a lift.  Has it come to the stage now that the general public cannot travel on the road in safety, that if they pass a man with a red lamp on the road without halting they can be fired on?  We will have to get this matter clarified, because, as I said, only a miracle prevented a tragedy that Wednesday evening.  We know that young, raw recruits were brought out and put on this job.</P>
    <P>Let me make quite clear that I am not in any sense criticising the military in this matter.  I could not criticise the military in a matter concerning which they have no strict instructions issued to them as to what action they are to take.  There is grave dissatisfaction among military personnel, from the top to the bottom, at the moment, about their instructions. The Minister and his Department have failed to issue proper instructions because they cannot give instructions to fire at individuals as there is no state of emergency declared and consequently the military may, in the eyes of the public, be blamed for something for which the Government and the Minister must be blamed.  I want to make it clear that the Minister will have to let the public know now whether they are to be safe on the roads; whether, as he said, the position exists that if a soldier or a group of soldiers, wants to halt an individual whether he is driving a truck, a car or a bus&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If a group of private soldiers are entitled to call on a truck, or a car, or a bus to halt and if that vehicle fails to halt, the soldiers are entitled to fire on it because allegedly it is endangering the lives of the soldiers.  To bring it down to brass tacks the Minister's statement means, that if a person is at a pedestrian crossing here in Dublin <Col N="1909" /> and a motorist comes along, and if in the opinion of that pedestrian the motorist is going to run him down, he is entitled, if he has a permit to carry a gun, to fire on him.  The military should not have permission, unless an emergency exists, to fire on a single civilian in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I had better deal with these two questions in the order in which the Deputy has dealt with them.  He dealt first with Question No. 81, the question in connection with the injuries received by some of the detainees in this affair.  The main point about that is that they were very minor injuries indeed, and therefore, there was no need to depart from the normal procedure in the case of detainees suffering from any minor illness.  That procedure is that the detainees notify their next-of-kin to that effect.  That is the procedure adopted here.  The injuries were very slight and so the normal procedure was adopted.</P>
      <P>As to the announcements made, I am sure Deputies will understand, that in the early stages of this occurrence, conditions were somewhat confused, and the injuries received were of such a minor nature that only two were discovered immediately.  As a matter of fact two of those who were subsequently found to have been slightly injured, had succeeded in making their escape and were subsequently recaptured, so that there was no great cause for surprise in the fact that the injuries to three others were not discovered immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to his allegation that 11 others were treated, Deputy McQuillan announced in advance that he would not accept any denial of mine of that statement of his.  However, for what it may be worth to other people, I can say there is no truth whatever in Deputy McQuillan's allegation.  Five people received injuries and five were treated.  I cannot help it if certain newspapers appear to employ correspondents, more because of their abilities in the field of fiction, rather than for their qualities as accurate reporters of actual occurrences.  If <Col N="1910" /> people like Deputy McQuillan prefer to believe the false report that appear in those newspapers rather than the official version of the facts, there is nothing I can do to convince them that they are wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister let us go down to see?  Would he allow us to see for ourselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>So that question, I think, was adequately dealt with by the reply I gave in the House and any other points the Deputy has raised have now been covered.</P>
      <P>To the other question the Deputy raised the reply I gave was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The reports on this incident show that on being signalled to halt by means of a red lamp, the truck slowed down, then swerved towards one of the soldiers and accelerated.  The soldier had to jump out of the way to avoid being run down.  His life was thus endangered and he had a companion soldier reacted to this highly dangerous and suspicious manoeuvre by firing at the tyres of the truck in an effort to halt it.  I cannot find that the soldiers acted improperly in the circumstances and, therefore, as far as the troops are concerned, there is no question of ensuring that a similar incident does not occur in future.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's statement that public uneasiness has been caused by this incident.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a comprehensive reply to the question, and I cannot see that there is anything more I can add to it.  As I said in reply to a supplementary question by Deputy McQuillan, far from public uneasiness being caused by any action of the military personnel who were involved in this affair, the public have, in fact, been impressed by the discipline and restraint exercised by every unit of the Army engaged in the affair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan, of course, never loses an opportunity of pursuing his private vendetta against the Army, and the mere fact that at the conclusion of his speech he disavows any <Col N="1911" /> such intention, after devoting the main part of his speech to an attack on the military personnel, does not change that fact.  As I say, the whole incident does nothing whatever to lessen my confidence in the officers and men of the Army.  In fact, as I say, it showed that they realise their duties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>

There is nothing I can do to ensure that an attempt will not be made to run down a soldier in the performance of his duty so there is nothing I can do to provide against such an incident taking place again.  I am quite satisfied that the officers and men of the Army knew their duty.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan alleges that the Army have no instructions as to whether or not to fire on vehicles. Nobody knows better than he that that is not so.  The firing of ammunition is covered by Defence Force regulations and I am quite satisfied&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The following statement sets out the particulars requested by the Deputy.  The figures are derived from Table 2 of the Interim Report on the 1957-58 National Farm Survey, issued as a supplement to the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin</i> for September 1958.  As stated in the report much of the increase in family farm income between 1956 and 1957 was due to the increase in inventories <Col N="1766" /> between the two years partly due to price changes.  Further analysis has now been carried out and the statement includes particulars of the changes between the two years in family farm income adjusted to exclude the effect of the price element in cattle inventory changes.  Particulars are also included of the changes in family cash income, in which all inventory changes are eliminated from the accounts.</P>
      <P>Changes between 1956 and 1957 in family income per family labour unit and current hired labour expenses per hired labour unit.</P>
