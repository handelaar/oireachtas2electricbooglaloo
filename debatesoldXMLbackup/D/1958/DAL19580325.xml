      <P>My recent visit to London was in response to an invitation to be present at a St. Patrick's Day function at which the golden jubilee of the establishment of the National University of Ireland was being commemorated. My call on the British Prime Minister was a courtesy call and was not arranged for the purpose of intergovernmental discussions.  The question of a public statement does not, therefore, properly arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the main constituents of the figures for &ldquo;other service trades&rdquo; and, if possible, their order of magnitude in respect of gross domestic fixed capital formation for the years 1949 to 1956.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>The item &ldquo;other service trades&rdquo; includes wholesale and retail trade, banks and other financial institutions, real estate agents, recreation and personal services, and any activities which cannot be assigned to a more specific heading. Since the figure for gross domestic fixed capital formation in other service trades is derived as a residual (i.e. by deducting the sum of the other items from the total gross domestic fixed capital formation) it is not possible to give figures for the main constituents of the item.  As has already been stated, the amount of gross domestic fixed capital formation allocated to this heading is inflated by the short fall in the figures for other items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state gross fixed capital formation in 1956 by (a) State and semi-State <Col N="765" /> boards and companies, (b) other companies, (c) unincorporated businesses, (d) State and local authorities and (e) others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimate of gross domestic fixed capital formation is based on the value of the home production of capital goods and of imports of producers' capital goods ready for use.  As a result, while incomplete information is available in respect of certain sectors mentioned by the Deputy, it is not, in general, possible to give complete data covering the value of capital formation under the categories mentioned by him since this would demand a knowledge of the actual sector purchasing the capital goods in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state how gross fixed capital formation in 1956 was financed, giving separate details for (a) statutory depreciation allowances, (b) company reserves, (c) public issues by companies and (d) Exchequer advances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that gross domestic fixed capital formation in 1956 was financed to the extent of £32,000,000 by current savings, £20,000,000 by provision for depreciation and £14,000,000 by net foreign disinvestment.</P>
      <P>As regards the items mentioned by the Deputy, (a) income-tax wear and tear allowances on plant and machinery amounted to about £11,000,000, (b) it is estimated that undistributed company profits after tax were about £14,000,000, (c) receipts from public issues by companies were £0.5 million, (d) total expenditure financed from the State capital budget for 1956-57 was £37.5 million.  Details of this expenditure are shown in the reply to a parliamentary question by Deputy Sweetman on 12 February, 1958.</P>
      <P>It must, however, be understood that these items are not additive since, for instance, company reserves may be invested in Government securities, the proceeds of which may be used by the Exchequer to finance capital expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that certain employees of the former Grand Canal Company are excluded from participation in the C.I.E. pensions scheme by reason of their age; and whether he will request the board to prepare an amending scheme to enable such persons to qualify for admission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that under the terms of the Order made by my predecessor on March 5th, 1955, former Grand Canal Company employees who were transferred to C.I.E. under the Transport Act, 1950, were admitted to the pensions scheme for regular wages staff on certain conditions, one of which was that applicants had not reached 50 years of age on 1st June, 1950.  I assume that the former employees of the Grand Canal Company to whom the Deputy refers are those who were over that age limit.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Transport Act, 1950, the initiative for any amendment of their pension schemes is placed on the board of C.I.E.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if the category of children to be eligible for free vaccination against anterior poliomyelitis in the new up to ten years age group has been confined <Col N="768" /> to children of necessitous parents only; and, if so, why the original provisions allowing vaccination free to all children, irrespective of parents' means, have been so amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in my reply to the Deputy on the 5th instant, vaccination against poliomyelitis will be provided by health authorities in the coming year for children in the lower income group who are over six months and under ten years of age. By reason of the fact that the supply of vaccine last year was restricted, the scheme then operated by health authorities was necessarily confined to children over one and under five years of age and because the vaccine was not available to the public generally, the scheme covered all children irrespective of their parents' means.  In view, however, of the fact that adequate supplies of poliomyelitis vaccine are expected to be available this year to meet all demands and having regard to the continuing need for economy, the extension of the upper age limit for the coming year will be associated with a restriction of vaccination to children in the lower income group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that patients holding medical cards have been accepted into hospitals that have no public wards without being made aware that acceptance makes them or those responsible for them liable for the balance of weekly maintenance charges, all charges for drugs, etc., specialists' fees and operating charges; and whether he will take steps to have the position rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that any appreciable number of persons holding a medical card have incurred liabilities in respect of maintenance and treatment in a private hospital.</P>
      <P>Hospitals without public ward accommodation are not approved for the purposes of Section 15 of the Health Act, 1953, under which patients are sent, or deemed to have been sent, by health authorities for maintenance and treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain private hospitals have been approved for the purposes of Section 25 of the Act under which an eligible person may elect to enter a hospital of his own choice, in lieu of accepting the services made available by the appropriate health authority. The liability of a health authority in respect of a patient who obtains services in private or semi-private hospital accommodation in pursuance of the provisions of that section is limited to a daily subvention which is at present at the rate of 8/- a day, together with contributions towards <Col N="770" /> the cost of certain specified drugs and appliances.  Any further charges by the hospital and any medical fees are the liability of the patient.</P>
    <P>As I explained in reply to a question by Deputy Brennan on 26th February, 1958, these provisions have been explained in communications from my Department to local authorities, hospital authorities and other interested parties and considerable publicity has been given to the provisions of the Health Acts by means of statements in the Press and explanatory leaflets on the subject issued by health authorities.</P>
    <P>In their own interests, people should, before accepting private or semi-private accommodation, make inquiries as to their liability for additional charges, and I do not see what further action I could usefully take in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Labour Court suggested that the investigation by the court of the dispute referred to in the question should be deferred pending consideration by my Department of &ldquo;this and related matters&rdquo;.  The matters referred to concerned the reclassification of a number of posts held by local authority employees who had hitherto been classified as officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Health Officers (Reclassification) Order, 1958, made by me on the 15th February last, persons appointed as hospital attendants will as from 1st April next no longer be classified as officers.  My sanction to their employment will consequently not be <Col N="771" /> required and the matter is now one for settlement between the local authority and the trade unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On last Thursday week, the 20th March, in column 558 of the Official Report when the Minister for Agriculture and I were discussing milk deliveries to creameries the Minister stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At the same time the former Minister was nervy enough to repudiate in this House an approval which he gave only a few months before he went out of office.  The Deputy has a good memory for this matter while he did not have a good memory for a deliberate action which he took in another regard.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The report continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Sweetman: I have a clear recollection.</P>
      <P>Mr. Smith: The Deputy is always clear when he wants to be but he is very dull when it suits him.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister and I went on somewhat in that vein.  I had already at that time asked my successor in the Department of Finance for an opportunity of examining the file in relation to this matter, so far as the period when I was in office was concerned, I understood that I had a right under the Constitution or by convention to do so but, whether I had that right or not does not matter, because my successor afforded me an opportunity of inspecting the file in the Department of Finance.  I want, in the first place, therefore, gratefully to acknowledge his courtesy for enabling me to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The examination that I made proves conclusively and beyond question that no minute from the Department of Agriculture for the <Col N="783" /> termination of the double-byre grant was submitted to me for my personal approval.  The file in this matter never came to me at all at any time after the 31st January, which is the date that was mentioned by the present Minister for Agriculture.  I could not, therefore, have any recollection of this minute and the allegation made by the present Minister for Agriculture that I was dishonestly omitting something from my recollections is proven to be untrue.</P>
      <P>I wish, however, to make it clear that I do not propose to shelter behind the anonymity of any civil servant, or to repudiate any civil servant for action taken in the Department when I was there.  The officials of my Department knew that it was my policy to assist, so far as I could, the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, in his efforts to speed up the scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  If this minute from the Department of Agriculture, and it was a minute from an official of that Department, not from the Minister himself, had come to me personally, I would have approved of it because the whole tenor and purport of that minute is not as the present Minister for Agriculture outlined, but is to stress the necessity to speed up the scheme.  The minute stressed that across the water they had moved on in excess of anticipations and that we must push ahead faster than we had anticipated, and that there were difficulties in regard to the availability of technical staff.</P>
      <P>It went on to propose that payment of the supplementary byre grants would not be allocated after the 1st April, 1958, and it specifically stated that one of the advantages of giving long notice of that would be to act as a spur to as many as possible to come into the attested herd scheme at once, because they would know if they did not come into the scheme at once they would not get the benefit of the supplementary grant.  That, of course, is entirely different from what the present Minister for Agriculture alleged had my approval.</P>

    <P>Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) (Woven Woollen and Synthetic and <Col N="785" /> Artificial Fabrics) (Amendment) Order, 1958.</P>
    <P>Quota Order No. 13 is the Order which restricts the importation of woven piece goods or synthetic materials. There is exemption in that Order for brocade or tapestry cloth.  That exemption was designed to exclude from the scope of the Order furnishing fabrics of a kind not produced by Irish mills. It was reported that bedspread material of synthetic composition was being imported under that exemption. The effect of the amending Order is to bring within the scope of Quota Order No. 13 brocade and tapestry cloths which exceed 56 inches in width.  Bedspread material similar to the type which has been imported is manufactured by a couple of firms in this country.  There is a customs duty of 50 per cent. on made-up bedspreads and bedspread material exceeding 60 per cent. weight of cotton is subject to import restriction under Quota Order No. 45.</P>
    <P>That protection was rendered ineffective by this importation to which I have referred of synthetic brocade material up to 90 inches in width which was documented as material for making into bedspreads and quilts.  Furnishing brocades and tapestry cloths do not normally exceed 56 inches in width and <i>bona fide</i> importations of materials of that kind will not be affected by the withdrawal of the exemption for brocades and tapestry limited to cloths exceeding 56 inches in width.</P>

    <P>The first sub-head in this Supplementary Estimate relates to losses on the sale of wheat.

The amount specified is required to meet the losses which will be incurred in the disposal of surplus native wheat up to 31st March.  The original Estimates for the Department contained provision for an expenditure of £150,000 on the disposal of surplus native wheat from the 1956 harvest as animal feed.  A market was found for about 12,000 tons of that wheat at a cost to the Exchequer of £136,000.  The balance of the Estimate will be absorbed by supplying surplus wheat at the animal feed price for the manufacture of biscuit flour since 1st December, 1957.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I shall refer to that later.  In July last, the Government considered wheat-growing policy and all the problems likely to arise in regard to surplus wheat from the 1957 harvest.  It came to certain decisions which were subject to the result of the investigations which were proceeding at that time into the maximum extent to which native wheat could be used in the production of bread of reasonable quality.  It decided that, subject to the outcome of these investigations, the aim should be to produce 300,000 tons of dried wheat for milling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Industry and Commerce, I was authorised by the Government to enter into consultations with the flour millers regarding the disposal of the 1957 crop, on the basis that the millers would purchase the whole of the wheat crop, whatever <Col N="787" /> dimensions it took, but that their obligation would be to utilise in the production of flour 300,000 tons of dried wheat.  That obligation was expressed as a percentage of their milling quotas, which were also adjusted to allow a margin for competition between the millers.  In respect of wheat purchased by the millers at the guaranteed price, in excess of the 300,000 tons required by their quotas to be utilised in the production of flour, it was decided there would be carried forward into this year such quantity as the Government might decide, the cost of storing that carried forward wheat to be defrayed by the Exchequer; that as much as possible would be sold for animal feed and the balance would be exported, the loss on either operation to be defrayed by the Exchequer; or, alternatively, that wheat in excess of their quotas could be sold to individual millers at the animal feed price.</P>
    <P>As, I think, the House has already been informed by the Minister for Agriculture, the millers held a stock of 75,000 tons of native wheat at the end of the 1956 season.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not follow what the Minister said about selling wheat in excess of their quota to millers at the animal feed price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The millers were under obligation to acquire 300,000 tons at the guaranteed price and use it in the production of flour.  Wheat in excess of that would be sold for animal feed or at the same price to a miller who wanted to buy more than he was obliged to buy under his quota. A miller is free to utilise more native wheat than his quota requires him to utilise, if he chooses to do so.  I have pointed out that the millers held a stock of 75,000 tons as a result of the 1956 harvest.  The mill intake of wheat, the quantity purchased by the millers under the arrangement made with them last year, from the 1957 harvest, was 370,000 tons dried.  There was, therefore, available a total quantity of native wheat of 445,000 tons, or 145,000 tons in excess of the 300,000 tons which <Col N="788" /> the millers were required to use for the manufacture of flour.</P>
      <P>The Government considered that position again at the end of December. It was decided to confirm the assurance given to the millers in the previous July and the assurance was extended to home-grown wheat of both harvests, whether produced in 1956 or 1957.  We then decided that the carry-over, to which I have already referred, should be 50,000 tons of wheat and we are negotiating with the millers with a view to making the best possible bargain with them as to the amount of the carry-over upon which storage charges will be defrayed by the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That 50,000 tons should be deducted from the 145,000 tons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We decided also to effect the immediate disposal of surplus wheat so far as possible for animal feed, the quantity to be disposed of to be decided by the Minister for Agriculture, but the aim being to dispose of as much as possible in that way and to export the balance to the best advantage from the economic point of view.</P>
      <P>The flour millers agreed to be responsible for the cost of the carry over of 50,000 tons of native wheat as at 31st August next, on the understanding that their obligations in regard to surplus wheat would be limited to that amount.  As the House knows, the millers decided later to purchase additional wheat over and above the 300,000 tons and use the additional wheat&mdash;23,000 tons&mdash;in order to bring about a reduction in the extraction rate from 80 per cent. to 72 per cent.</P>
      <P>Therefore, as far as it can be determined at present, the proposals for the disposal of the 145,000 tons which I have mentioned are as follows: the carry forward on 31st August next of 50,000 tons; 23,000 tons which have been purchased by the millers in excess of their quota obligations to effect a reduction in the extraction rate; 40,000 tons which will be sold for animal feeding and the balance of 32,000 tons is to be disposed of by exporting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that was taken care of.  It is the quantity of wheat to be purchased by the millers we are now concerned with.  The price of maize to animal feed importers is about £26 per ton delivered and it is proposed that the wheat should also be available at that price.  After deduction of transport charges and other expenses incidental to the disposal of the wheat, the net return will be about £24 per ton.  That will show a loss of £13 12s. per ton because this year wheat cost on the average 94/- per barrel dry or £37 12s. per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>94/- per barrel dry, where?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the mill floor. With regard to wheat for export, it seems likely that the best price available will be about £20 per ton c.i.f. That would represent about £18 per ton ex mill, involving a loss of about £20 per ton in the sale of wheat for export.</P>
      <P>In the current financial year, to which the Supplementary Estimate relates, Grain Importers Limited had been authorised to purchase from the millers 43,000 tons of the surplus wheat, with a view to its disposal for animal feed, to millers in excess of their quota, and for export.  It is unlikely that Grain Importers Limited will be in a position to furnish details of the total losses which will be incurred before the end of the financial year.  Where that is the position, it is proposed to make payments on account.  It is estimated that the total amount to be spent in this financial year will be £500,000. That is the amount stated in the Estimate.  There have been savings under other sub-heads in the Department of Industry and Commerce Estimate amounting to £270,000, so that the net sum required will be £230,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maximum prices payable to farmers for green wheat of the 1956 crop varied according to bushel weight from 65/- to 77/6 per barrel.  The average cost of the green wheat to the millers in that year was 66/11 per <Col N="790" /> barrel.  The average estimated cost of the dried wheat in store was 89/- per barrel.  As the House is aware, revised prices were fixed for wheat of the 1957 crop.  These prices were designed to give farmers a bonus of up to 5/- per barrel for wheat of low moisture content. As it happened, the majority of the crop in 1957 qualified for the maximum bonus payable, with the result that the wheat costs to the millers averaged 72/6 per barrel as compared with 66/11 the previous year.</P>
    <P>The average cost of the 1957 crop dried or in store was estimated at about 94/- per barrel.  That higher cost of drying and storing takes account of some increased expenses and higher interest charges operating in 1957 which offset the savings in drying the wheat arising from the low moisture content of the 1957 crop.</P>
    <P>In 1956-57 the grist used by the flour millers for the production of 80 per cent. extraction flour was 66? per cent. native and 33? per cent. imported wheat.  Towards the end of 1956, the consumption in flour declined and there has been no reversion yet to the previous level.  In view of the better quality of the 1957 crop and in order to enable the millers to use the 300,000 tons of native wheat, the percentage of native wheat in the grist had to be increased, and was increased in September, 1957, from 66? per cent. to 79 per cent.  That increase in the proportion of native wheat in the grist would normally result in an increase in the price of flour because of the difference in the price of native and imported wheat.  It is estimated that each additional 5 per cent. increase in the use of native wheat should increase the price of bakers' flour by about 1/- per sack and the price of retail flour by about 1/6 per sack.</P>
    <P>During 1957, there was a considerable drop in ocean freight rates and a resulting reduction in the costs of imported wheat to Grain Importers Limited.  That reduction was not at the time passed on to the millers by Grain Importers Limited.  A surplus of £82,000 stood to the credit of the imported wheat account.  In September last, Grain Importers Limited were authorised to apply some £14,000 of <Col N="791" /> that amount to a reduction in the price of imported wheat to the millers, with a view to stabilising the cost of the grist.</P>
    <P>In January last, the flour millers indicated that they had assembled their costs for the past 36 weeks.  They found on preliminary examination that increases of the order of 6/3 per sack in the price of bakers' flour and 7/10 in the price of retail flour would be justified. These figures were discussed and reviewed, and, in the final analysis, the millers agreed that the increase in the prices of both types of flour could be held at 4/9 per sack, provided the price of imported wheat was stabilised at the existing level.</P>
    <P>It was at that stage that the millers produced the proposal to produce flour at the 72 per cent. extraction, without any increase in the price beyond what was already necessary because of the higher price of the native wheat, provided that they got the 23,000 tons of native wheat at the animal feed price.  That proposal was accepted, subject to the condition that all flour produced would be 72 per cent. extraction and that there would be no alteration in the flour price by reason of the higher extraction and that the maximum increase would be held at 4/7 per sack which was held to be justified, due to the higher cost of native wheat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought you said that 4/7 was due to the high cost of manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  It is entirely due to the higher cost of native wheat. It was also agreed that the balance of the funds in the imported wheat account would be applied by them to maintaining at the existing level the price of imported wheat for the balance of the 1958-59 period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these conditions were accepted by the millers and it was decided that the price of the 72 per cent. extraction flour would not be increased by more than 4/6 per sack for both bakers' and retail flour.  The millers' costings showed that an increase of 4/9 would be justified, of which 3d. <Col N="792" /> would be attributable to the recent increase in wages.  However, the millers decided that this would not be included in the price of flour.</P>
    <P>The matter then went on to the Master Bakers' Association.  An increase of 4/6 per sack of flour would represent something more than a farthing per two pound loaf and the minimum increase which could be charged to the consumer would be a halfpenny per two pound loaf.  The Master Bakers took the line that the increase would not be sufficient to meet an increase in wages and the inevitable reduction in the number of loaves which could be got from a sack of flour at the lower extraction.  They agreed not to increase the price of the loaf by more than a halfpenny per two pound loaf.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the extraction of flour has resulted in the absorption of about 23,000 tons of surplus wheat.  Its utilisation in that way rather than by exporting it means a saving to the Exchequer of about £7 per ton.  The increase in the amount of offals which will be produced will also mean a reduction in offal imports by about £450,000.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the question of biscuit flour and the difficulties which were brought about by the withdrawal of the flour subsidy.  The House is aware that Irish manufacturers of biscuits are, at the moment, at a severe disadvantage, particularly with regard to the price of flour, and also that the protection which is given them cannot be increased owing to the conditions of the British Trade Agreement.  If they are to be maintained in business and put in a position to compete with other suppliers of biscuits, they must have flour available to them at or about the price at which their competitors can get it.</P>
    <P>We have tried to meet that situation in a number of ways.  Firstly, we gave them licences to import flour; secondly, we gave them licences to import wheat and to mill the wheat into flour; and, finally, it was considered more desirable to utilise part of the surplus wheat available at the animal feed price to make into biscuit flour.  The amount <Col N="793" /> is comparatively small compared with the total quantity of wheat available, but it does solve a problem which had to be met anyway and which can better be solved in that way to our advantage rather than by allowing the importation of flour or wheat for that purpose at the world price.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the question of investigations being carried out under the auspices of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards into the question of increasing the use of native wheat in the grist.  Reports of these investigations have been furnished from time to time.  Last year, there was an experimental baking carried out at the Curragh Military Camp under the auspices of the institute.  The object was to ascertain whether good commercial bread could be produced by flour derived solely from native wheat.  Ten sacks of flour were ordered from the miller who holds the Army contract for flour, but one of the sacks was rejected as being below the average for the group.</P>
    <P>That decision, unfortunately, invalidated to some extent, the outcome of the investigation.  Various doughs were made from the flour and the quality of the bread produced was compared.  The report of the institute which, I must emphasise, is only a preliminary one, was that bread of good commercial quality could have been baked from the 1956 crop of wheat, without the addition of imported wheat, provided that there was adequate scientific control of the materials used.  The institute pointed out that, in the 200- or 300-odd bakeries scattered throughout the country, the scientific control of the materials used, the addition of certain chemicals, would not be possible.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive report from the institute is to be submitted later, but there is one feature of the preliminary report which is worth noting.  There appears to be a very wide variation in certain characteristics of the same type of wheat received from different parts of the country.  That is one of the considerations to be taken into account and much attention will have to be given to it, if there be any change of policy later decided upon in that regard. <Col N="794" /> It is apparently a matter of difficulty for millers to handle grist which contains a high percentage of native wheat, without having some means of dealing with these varying characteristics of the wheat.</P>
    <P>There is one other sub-head in this Supplementary Estimate to which reference has also to be made.  The House will have been aware from announcements which have been made that a special representative has been sent, with my approval, by the Industrial Development Authority to the United States of America for the purpose of interesting American manufacturers in the possibility of setting up industries in this country.</P>
    <P>It is thought that American manufacturers are at this time giving consideration to the possibility or desirability of establishing plants in Europe in the light of the discussions that have been proceeding about a European Free Trade Area and that now is the appropriate stage at which to endeavour to interest them in establishing such plants in this country.  That is why this time, rather than some other time, was selected for this campaign. If we are to succeed in it, we must have a full-time representative there to explain to American manufacturers who may be interested in the facilities which this country has to offer.  The appointment of this special representative is intended to be for one year only unless, of course, the outcome of his mission should be such as to make it appear desirable to continue it for a further period.</P>
    <P>It will be his function to bring to the notice of individual American manufacturers the many advantages which Ireland offers as a location for manufacturing industry and particularly for industries which would export all or the greater part of their output.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if the person appointed is a civil servant and what is his rank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He is Count Cyril McCormack.  He is not a civil servant and he has been specially appointed for this purpose.  Simultaneously, an advertising campaign in suitable <Col N="795" /> American newspapers and magazines has been carried out by the Industrial Development Authority.  The first advertisement appeared on the 16th December last and further advertisements were inserted in papers to coincide with Count McCormack's arrival in the United States of America.  It is planned to continue that advertising campaign for the purpose of setting out briefly and in an attractive manner the main advantages which Ireland holds for American industrialists.</P>
      <P>Any manufacturer in America who shows interest in this possibility will be contacted by the representative on the spot who will explain the position to him in more detail.  The representative will also have the duty of approaching other manufacturers who are known to be interested in the European Market or whose interest can be aroused in the possibilities there.  He will also have to seek contacts with manufacturers through such bodies as chambers of commerce, industrial associations, banks and so forth or, indeed, any other suitable means that presents itself to him.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority have also, at my request, arranged for the publication of a new brochure setting out in attractive form the advantages and facilities to which I have already referred.  There was a somewhat similar booklet prepared some years ago which is now rather out of date.  I think copies of the new brochure have been distributed to Members of the Dáil, so that they will be familiar with it.  I am sure everybody will appreciate the importance of having an attractive booklet of that type available for interested parties abroad and also the value of the publication as a source of general information on conditions in this country affecting industrialists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a full year the cost of all these operations&mdash;the sending of the representative to the United States of America, the advertising campaign to which I have referred and other promotional expenses in that connection &mdash;is estimated to be £24,500 and the necessary provision has been made in the Book of Estimates for 1958-59 on <Col N="796" /> that scale.  In regard to this year, the cost is estimated at £7,000, £2,000 of which will fall under sub-heads P.2 and P.3 and which can be met out of savings on other sub-heads.  £5,000 will, however, fall under sub-head P.1 as a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>That expenditure, of course, was not anticipated when the original Estimate was being framed and it is necessary, therefore, to seek the Dáil's approval for that estimated additional expenditure, £5,000 under sub-head P.1, in connection with that campaign to interest American manufacturers in Ireland under the auspices of the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the last matter first, as the Minister was speaking, there was circulated to us another list of amendments to the Industrial Development (Encouragement of External Investment) Bill.  Is not it plain daft to be sending Count McCormack to the United States of America to interest industrialists in investment here while at the same time we are legislating in the House to provide only a very restricted access for foreign capital to come here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are legislating for the opposite purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You are legislating to relax the present formidable restrictions which have existed for 20 years instead of sweeping them all away and simply saying, &ldquo;We want foreign capital now into this country&rdquo; and making some kind of dramatic gesture while at the same time saying, &ldquo;That will give rise to problems, perhaps, for existing industries here and we shall deal with them in another way.&rdquo; We want to make it manifest to the whole world that the policy of deterring foreign capital from coming into this country is now reversed, that we seek to encourage it.  In fact, what we are doing is, we are pursuing a very devious and cautious legislative procedure here which may or may not be understood by the Deputies and Senators who participate in it but which certainly is not calculated <Col N="797" /> to make any dramatic impact on people abroad who are not all that interested in coming in here.</P>
      <P>One would imagine sometimes, by the way we go on in Dáil Éireann, that there was a queue of eager industrialists clamouring at the door to get in.  The fact is that we cannot find a manufacturer for rat traps who will come in, despite our best effort all over the world.</P>
      <P>I want to make a suggestion to the Minister.  If this is really serious, why does not he make the dramatic gesture of repealing the Control of Manufactures Act, arming Count McCormack, as the envoy of the Industrial Development Authority with that evidence of a genuine desire on the part of the Government and people of this country to welcome foreign capital here and then prevail upon his colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, to approach the American Government and say to them, &ldquo;You have been pouring out immense assistance of a financial character all over the world, to everybody, in fact, handing out huge sums of dollars.  We do not want any dollars in that form at all but would you collaborate with us, in consideration of our having wiped out all restrictions on foreign capital, in an effort to install in Ireland ten or 20 industrial units designed ultimately to employ 1,000 persons apiece?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the United States Government earnestly desire to maintain suitable institutions and growing prosperity in democratic countries, as opposed to the kind of assistance that is available to those countries which are prepared to withdraw behind the Iron Curtain, would not it be good business from their point of view, instead of handing away their money in millions, to approach their own technologists and invite them to collaborate with the United States Government in setting up plants in Ireland and other similarly circumstanced countries, now that it has dawned on them that what people want in free democracies much more than loans or grants is the opportunity of employment in their own country which derives from the availability of capital but quite equally <Col N="798" /> from the availability of technology, plus marketing?  The Minister himself must recollect a firm in this country that was on the verge of dissolution, but the moment it was brought into contact with an international firm in the same business which had technocracy at its disposal, plus a great international marketing organisation, the whole outlook of that firm was metamorphosed overnight and it is now a very prosperous concern.</P>
    <P>Surely if we mean business here&mdash; and I cannot forget Deputy Kyne on the Vote on Account when he spoke of unemployment and men feeling the apprehension of working themselves out of jobs&mdash;I think that is the challenge to democratic institutions and free society&mdash;to find means of providing employment under a system directed by individual liberty and free institutions.  Here is a means, as I see it, by the provision of capital techniques and marketing equipment, effectively to provide employment here through industrial development.</P>
    <P>If it is not done that way, I want to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce this simple and pragmatic question: if there is a firm in Canada or the United States which is concerned to penetrate the free trade market in Europe and so contemplates the establishment of an industrial plant inside the surrounding barricade of the Free Trade Area, and it is presented with the alternative of establishing that plant in Dublin or Cork or Hamburg or Rotterdam, what economic argument can we advance for establishing the plant in Dublin or Cork?  If the raw materials have to be brought to the point of manufacture and the articles distributed mainly in the European market&mdash;for that is the reason they come here&mdash;what is the economic advantage of bringing the raw materials to Cork or Dublin and transshipping the products to Rotterdam or Hamburg for distribution in Europe?</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister would indicate what argument he proposes to advance to that.  I do not think there is a valid argument based exclusively on economic considerations for foreign firms aiming at the European market choosing a site here in preference to a site <Col N="799" /> on the Continent, bearing in mind the immense advantages of the universal availability of continental transport to a plant established at Hamburg or Rotterdam.  On the other hand, if the United States or any other friendly nation really wants to help and we are prepared to reciprocate wholeheartedly, I do not think it is outside the bounds of possibility that we might get substantial industrial plants established here on somewhat the same lines as we sought to implement under the Undeveloped Areas Act when we tried to divert plants from Dublin and Cork to the undeveloped areas in the West.</P>
    <P>If, in the same spirit, the United States Government attempted to establish plants here at, I believe, no formidable cost to themselves, they could confer an inestimable benefit on this country, and, from that initial departure, there might evolve quite a number of secondary developments which would not require Government assistance at all.  But if we are to get something of that kind, I suggest we ought to make it known emphatically and dramatically to the world outside that the epoch in which we were afraid of foreign capital is gone and that we are now opening the doors in no halfhearted manner.  It cannot be too strongly emphasised that if that is done, it is probable that parallel steps may have to be taken to shore up some existing enterprises which would view the unrestricted arrival of foreign capital with apprehension, but we have shored up so many in the past that if we have to shore up a few more in the future, we should be able to do it.</P>
    <P>Turning to this Vote, which proposes that £500,000 be provided to sell Irish wheat to millers for manufacture into biscuit flour or into animal feeding or into anything they like, I do not believe this provision is necessary at all.  It is a most astonishing situation in which to find ourselves.  One would imagine that nothing could be simpler than to indicate the total wheat crop, how it is to be disposed of and the consequent gain or loss, but the Minister went to great trouble to try to give every detail of the whole business, and I think when Deputies come to read the <Col N="800" /> Official Report&mdash;much less the Deputies who sat here to listen&mdash;they will agree with me that it is a regular jig-saw puzzle.  Why it should become so vastly complicated, I do not know.  The total wheat crop is produced on about 3 per cent. of our arable land.  That is all that is involved.</P>
    <P>My experience when I was responsible for wheat was that there was pressure all the time to demonstrate that millers could not mill the wheat into flour at all and the view was very strongly pressed that the grist would have to be 50 per cent. Irish and 50 per cent. imported, to make a bakeable flour.  Every year, I was told that a large percentage of the Irish crop was not convertible into flour and should be rejected; every year, I told them it was convertible into flour and if they would filter it into the grist in the course of the ensuing year, they would have no difficulty, and every year we succeeded in making them do it.  There was always a fight and assurances were always given, with the most circumstantial evidence to support them, that if they were to mill this stuff, they could not bake it into bread at all; but they always did, and we never introduced an Estimate, so far as I remember, to enable us to dispose of any of the wheat crop, except for the purpose of conversion into flour.</P>
    <P>Last year was the first year it has ever been conceded that a great part of the Irish wheat crop must be converted into animal feeding and I think I am right in saying that the wheat crop of last year was one of the best gathered in this country in regard to quality.  Those of us who were present will have heard the Minister make a series of protracted calculations.  I heard no reference whatever to the annual requirements of seed wheat. That is a very substantial annual charge upon the wheat crop because for some time we have found it unnecessary to import seed.  Most of our own seed wheat is labelled and certified by the Department of Agriculture and I am informed by those who sow it that the quality of Irish certified seed wheat is superior to any imported seed wheat.  In all his reference to the disposal <Col N="801" /> of 370,000 tons of the 1957 harvest I heard him make no indent upon that in respect of seed but he went on to speak of 155,000 tons of a surplus which he reduced to 95,000 tons net surplus as a result of the millers being required to give an undertaking to carry 50,000 tons as the normal annual carry-over.</P>
    <P>Would it not be a very much better way to handle this wheat&mdash;which the Minister says is a surplus 95,000 tons, but which I very much doubt is surplus&mdash;if, instead of grinding it all up and selling it as wheat feed at murderous prices on the foreign market, the Minister arranged for an extraction of say, 50 per cent., and to have that fed into the general bulk of flour manufactured and let the other 50 per cent. be sold as what we used to call before the 1939 war, &ldquo;sharps,&rdquo; which is one grade higher than pollard?  It is a grade of animal feed that has not been available since the war but which used to be pretty widely available and I think it derives from a 60 per cent. extraction of flour which apparently obtains nowhere since the 1939 war.</P>
    <P>I am wholly unable to understand how it is that in 1956 we had an average price of 66/11 for green wheat with a relatively high moisture content which worked out at 89/- per barrel dried on the mill floor, and yet in 1957 72/6 related to flour with 21 per cent. moisture or less works out at 94/- dried on the mill floor.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do, and much better than most Deputies in the House, that an absolutely accurate appraisal of the situation without all the figures before one, is well nigh impossible.  However, I suggest to him that it ought to be possible to find the means of using all this wheat in the manufacture of biscuit and bread flour in the coming year, that it ought not to be necessary to appropriate £650,000 wherewith to dispose of surplus Irish wheat and that that money could be very much better used.</P>
    <P>We heard my courteous successor sneer across the House to-day that he would not let us see certain papers we wanted to see.  They related to double byres.</P>

      <P>This £650,000 would enable him to do this year what I proposed to do last year, that is, to give the farmers 12 months' notice.  If he would do that, a great deal of the harm of his present proposal would be removed and he would be helping agriculture, but it seems to me that under this dispensation we are helping the bigger manufacturer of flour.  To put it at its best, if this is helping the farmers it is helping farmers who are farming 3 per cent. of the total arable area of Ireland whereas it could be made of very material use to all the farmers who are engaged in the dairying and livestock industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe it is necessary to appropriate £650,000 in order to use the Irish wheat crop.  I direct the attention of the House to the fact that it never was necessary before although it was always pressed upon me when I was Minister for Agriculture that it was.  I was always able to persuade them to use it&mdash;and I believe that could be done now.  It is right to warn the House that, if they adopt this procedure this season, this is only the first step in a campaign which will turn up year after year to justify the new departure in regard to wheat prices.  This is meant to create the surplus atmosphere.  Heretofore the policy was to fix a price and the merit of that was supposed to be that the farmer knew when he sowed his crop what he might expect to receive for it but, in this surplus atmosphere, the new sliding scale is introduced and no farmer in Ireland to-day knows what he is likely to get for his wheat crop when he saves it next autumn.  You may call that a married price or anything else you like to call it but, whatever about the marriage of the price, it divorces the farmers of this country <Col N="803" /> from the certainty that they enjoyed heretofore of a fixed price which was communicated to them before they sowed the crop.</P>
    <P>I very much doubt that this £500,000 will be spent and I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce will find that it will be possible to arrange for the use of this grain without that expenditure of public money.  However, I believe that all this campaign about surpluses, too much wheat and so forth, is for the purpose of softening up the farmers of this country to a new situation in which they will be told: &ldquo;There is a surplus of wheat.  There is a surplus of butter.  There is a surplus of eggs.&rdquo;  In respect of everything they produce they will be told there is an unwieldy surplus.  We have to take effective measures to relieve the Exchequer of these intolerable burdens. In one speech, we will marry the price.  That has a nicer sound about it than reducing the price.  None of us will know the end result of that unholy travesty of matrimony until the Autumn comes, but we have a pretty shrewd suspicion of what it will be.</P>
    <P>In the course of his introduction of this Supplementary Estimate, I heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce pay his respects occasionally to the Minister for Agriculture who would administer this and who would have regard to that.  It is most eloquent of the atmosphere into which we are moving that, for accounting reasons, this Supplementary Estimate is being presented by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>I have only a few words to say by way of comment on this Supplementary Estimate which includes two separate and distinct items &mdash;(1) losses on the sale of wheat and (2) the Industrial Development Authority. I wonder whether or not the advent of wheat in this country was a blessing or a disaster.  We are now confronted with a Supplementary Estimate amounting to £500,000, even money, to provide for losses on the sale of wheat.  It seems that the taxpayer is being asked to pay £500,000 for the losses on the sale of wheat and, at the same time, the Irish farmer is asked to suffer a reduction in the price paid to him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon said he did not know whether or not there was necessity for this Estimate, or the major portion of it.  I must confess that I do not know. We must take the Minister's word that there is a surplus of wheat and that it must be disposed of by some method. The Minister gave us in detail the method by which it is proposed to disposes of the wheat.  Bearing in mind all the circumstances, I suppose the method of disposal is about the only method to dispose of what is now being described as &ldquo;a surplus of wheat.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I was very interested in the Minister's comments on the all-Irish loaf.  He gave a certain amount of information. We should be interested to know the final outcome of the experiment carried out at the Curragh with nine sacks of flour made from Irish wheat.  I do not quite follow some of the details the Minister gave.  I presume the report he received is but a preliminary report and that, as soon as ever may be, the final report will be submitted to the Government, and subsequently to the House or the country.  Apart from the experiment on the scientific side, I should be interested to know whether or not any member of the Government has eaten bread made from all-Irish wheat.  I should prefer their opinion on an all-Irish loaf than that of any scientist or master baker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in subhead P (1)&mdash;<Col N="805" /> Remuneration and Expenses.  The Minister says this money is for the expenses of a representative from this country to the United States in an endeavour to interest American industrialists in the establishment of factories and industries here.  In present circumstances and having regard to the fact that we may be on the brink of entering into a free trade area, I hold that £24,000 is a puny sum to spend in competition with, as Deputy Dillon says, a lot of the countries in Europe.</P>
    <P>The booklet, <i>Industry in Ireland,</i> published recently, was excellent.  It described the social, economic and other advantages in the establishment of industry in this country.  I should be interested to know what advantages other countries have to offer in this connection.  I should be interested to know what inducements are being offered by other countries in Europe to industrialists and manufacturers in the United States in an attempt to get them to establish factories in Holland, Belgium, Germany or France, because we shall have to compete with them.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dillon said, I do not think there is a queue of Americans waiting to come to this country nor are people in the United States receiving Cyril Count McCormack with open arms, wondering when they can start industries in this country.  This is a time of serious competition and, in the light of that competition, I do not believe a sum of £24,000 will provide one-hundredth part of the sum required to advertise sufficiently the undoubted advantages this country has for the establishment of industry here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the advantages in what are described wrongly, in many cases, as the developed areas of this country.  I was never enthusiastic about the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I think it was unfair and I was beginning to think it was unconstitutional, inasmuch as certain advantages were provided for a part of the country which were not provided for the rest of the country.  The tradition of industry in this country, in my opinion&mdash;and it is fairly well accepted&mdash;lies in the eastern and <Col N="806" /> southern coastal areas and in the Midlands. Without wanting to be unjust to the people in the West of Ireland or to the people now included in the undeveloped areas, I think it is right to say that there is not the same tradition of industry or the same tradition of the skilled industrial worker in those areas as there is in the East and, in saying so, let me make it clear that I do not say it against any person in the West.</P>
    <P>If there is to be encouragement for the establishment of industry, that encouragement would be of more avail in the eastern portion of the country or the South or the Midlands, where there is the tradition and from which the English market is more accessible than in Connemara or the western shores of Mayo.  It would be a tremendous advantage, as an advantage, to this country for the establishment of industry here by Americans if the terms of the Undeveloped Areas Act were widened to include the country as a whole.  This must be said as well. While the Undeveloped Areas Act has undoubtedly provided some industry in the West, I am sure it has not achieved what the Minister for Industry and Commerce believed it would achieve when he introduced that Act in 1952.</P>
    <P>We have made many efforts&mdash;various people have made efforts&mdash;to attract industrialists and manufacturers from the United States of America over the past five years.  Can anybody say that either Minister or individual met with any success?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was there on one occasion, possibly not for the specific purpose of attracting industrialists or manufacturers.  The previous Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton, was over there.  Deputy Briscoe was there some time last year. He is there again this year.  We had the present Lord Mayor of Dublin over there for his second spell in 1958.</P>
    <P>Many of us hoped&mdash;we were not too presumptuous or too optimistic&mdash;that at least one industry would come from the United States of America.  I think it true to say that not even one has come back.  If one has come, it certainly has not come to my knowledge <Col N="807" /> through any efforts made by any of the type of people I have mentioned, through the people who are in America at the present time whether Deputy Briscoe, the Lord Mayor of Dublin or Count McCormack.  We all hope their efforts will be successful, but in my opinion Count McCormack's mission has not much chance of success.  It will be a tremendous personal feat for him if he succeeds even in a small way.  He has not a chance if the country can provide him with only £24,000.</P>
    <P>The sum of £24,000, as the Minister is probably aware, will be only a flea bite in the great advertising world in America.  When one takes into account his travelling expenses to the United States, his out-of-pocket expenses and his hotel expenses, the meagre entertainment that he can do on the small allowance made to him, what then is left for advertising?</P>
    <P>This booklet to which I referred is a very good publication but it is not sufficient.  It does not go into the details that American businessmen want in order to make up their minds as to whether they will establish their industry or factory in Ireland, Belgium, Germany or any part of Europe.  So far as the Labour Party is concerned we would certainly support the Minister in any drive in which he engages or proposes to engage for the purpose of encouraging foreign capital into this country, especially capital from the United States of America for the purpose of establishing industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon is somewhat innocent if he thinks that the simple approach he suggested would convince the American Government that this country is worthy of investment.  I think his words were to the effect that the United States of America at the present are pumping dollars into establishing industries in certain countries in Europe in order to try to re-establish the democratic institutions, or maintain the existing ones.  I do not think that is sufficient. I do not think it would be sufficient for us to go to America and say that if you take dollars into this country, you will help to maintain the democratic <Col N="808" /> institutions or the democratic way of life.</P>
    <P>The Americans still adore the mighty dollar.  If they have a particular interest in the countries to which Deputy Dillon referred in maintaining the democratic way of life and democratic institutions, they have no interest in that respect in this country because they are absolutely confident that so far as the democratic way of life and the democratic institutions are concerned they are intact and will always be intact, as far as this country is concerned.  For the purpose of getting help from abroad and especially from the United States of America, I do not think we have much of a chance because strategically we are badly placed.  If we found ourselves in the Mediterranean, the Middle East or some place situated near the Iron Curtain, the Americans would pump not only millions of dollars into the country but billions and trillions to maintain the democratic way of life and democratic institutions as Deputy Dillon says.</P>
    <P>It has to be a hard-headed businesslike appeal and I suggest that we cannot make that on a meagre £24,000 per year.  May I conclude by saying that it would be better if the Minister had any proposals to jack up that sum and provide for more publicity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my tribute to what has already been said in support of the Industrial Development Authority.  The issue of the brochure will tend to interest industrialists to set up industries here.  I think it is magnificently thought out. It is also extremely well presented.  It sets out a number of special advantages which have resulted already in the setting up of new industries here. It sets out in detail the particulars of cash grants for new industries, tax reliefs, trade agreements and other special opportunities for development.</P>
      <P>There is only one thing which disappoints me and I suppose the Industrial Development Authority are not to be held responsible for that. Under the heading &ldquo;Opportunities for Development&rdquo; occurs the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" />&ldquo;Under Irish law non-nationals may participate in industrial enterprise in Ireland in either of two ways:</P>
    <P>(a)  by obtaining a New Manufacture Licence where the foreign promoter wants to provide all or the major part of the share capital, or</P>
    <P>(b)  by taking an active but minority interest in an enterprise the major part of whose share capital is obtained from Irish sources.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That appears to me to undo a tremendous amount of good which was done in the earlier part of the brochure.  I know from my own experience and from those who have much more experience than myself, that the mention of a licence, however irrevocable it may be, frightens off and has frightened off any new industries which otherwise could have been established here.  I do not feel it is any attraction to any industrialists to offer them an active but minority interest in a firm.  That, to my mind, is most discouraging to the setting up of new industries.  However, I think the Industrial Development Authority have done an extremely good job, so far as they are able.  I should like to add my congratulations to those already expressed in respect to this brochure, which I hope will have an excellent reception overseas.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what we were told about the work of the Institute for Industrial Research on the question of the use of Irish wheat exclusively for baking an Irish loaf.  I was reminded of a speech which I heard last September from the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Mr. Spaak He was speaking to a small group of members of Parliaments of Western Europe.  He told us that we should never hand over to any alleged technical experts our responsibilities for making decisions.  His advice was never to ask an expert whether such and such a thing could be done.  He said it was our responsibility as politicians to give our decisions, to summon our experts and to tell them the decision and let them have the responsibility to carry it out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> I feel that in this particular connection some such attitude should be adopted in regard to both the milling industry and the Institute for Industrial Research.  I grant that they are working towards the desired goal.  At the same time, I cannot see any sign of undue pressure being exerted on them. If a decision were reached here and now that no foreign wheat whatever would be imported next season, I believe that the experts would be able to produce the all-Irish loaf next season without any trouble; but if we keep on asking them can it really be done, while I do not want to be disrespectful to the technical experts, I believe their attitude always will be: &ldquo;Well, it might, but there are certain difficulties and we do not want to commit ourselves at this stage.&rdquo;  I feel this is where we must commit ourselves and say the import of foreign wheat is too expensive, as it is sending money out of the country which could be much better used in the country.  Let us, if necessary, take a deep breath and say: &ldquo;That shall cease&rdquo;&mdash;so that we will not in future need another Supplementary Estimate such as this.</P>
    <P>I do not see a way round it at the moment.  I think the Supplementary Estimate is inevitable, but I do not want another one next year.  I would urge on the Minister and the Government to take this decision as rapidly as possible, in the sure confidence that our own industrialists and our own technical experts will produce the answer to the problem.  Unless that decision is taken at Government level, this experiment will go on and on, and we do not know when it will finish.</P>
    <P>I support this Supplementary Estimate, but I sincerely hope we will not have so much expenditure in respect of wheat next year.  I hope that, if anything, we will spend a little bit more on boosting the Industrial Development Authority, making funds available for them and taking every possible obstacle out of the way of anyone who wishes to set up an industry in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Supplementary Estimate, the Minister has dealt with the manner in which it is proposed to <Col N="811" /> deal with surplus wheat.  I have the same opinion as Deputy Booth in regard to that.  This whole question of a percentage hinges on our percentage of native wheat; and I think the Government are not interested enough in native wheat&mdash;and especially the Minister.  He has told us here this evening that an experiment carried out by experts at the Curragh has proved that it is possible to produce an all-Irish loaf and that it has been successful there&mdash;but the experts went on to say that there were certain technicalities which the ordinary baker in the country could not get over and the possibility was that that was the trouble, and a further report would be issued.  That is the part to which I object very much.  These experiments took place last June and the Minister is still waiting for a further report from these people on a matter that is very serious for the country.</P>
      <P>We find ourselves this year with a surplus of native wheat and at the same time, we are to import, in this financial year, over 100,000 tons of foreign wheat for use here.  I believe there is a certain section here in this country who do not want to see an all-Irish loaf or a high percentage of Irish wheat used.  I think the millers and some of the bigger bakeries in the country are the people who are completely against it.  One thing which makes me think that more than anything else is the advertisements appearing in all the daily papers for the last week or two by the millers' organisations. They are going out to defend their point of view.  Why should they have to defend it, if they are honest in their point of view?  This is a matter on which a decision should be taken by the Government and not by the millers. They claim in their statements that it is the housewife who decides.  I have never heard a housewife objecting to the flour or the bread we have at the present time.  The millers state in that statement that they use 87 per cent. of native wheat.  The Minister told us this evening it is 79.  I wonder who is telling the truth?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are using 87 per cent., we should have very little, as far as surplus wheat goes.  A month or two back, when the extraction was reduced by 6 per cent., the percentage of Irish wheat could have been increased immediately without any noticeable effect.  It should be up to the Government to stage increases until we got to the stage where there was objection.  So far, there has not been any objection.  The public are not objecting to it.</P>
      <P>As the wheat growers are fixed at the moment, it is a very serious problem. They do not know what price they are to get, for one thing, but they definitely assume there is to be a reduction.  It is all a matter of its being handled properly by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister told us this evening that this experiment on the Curragh was successful, that they can produce an all-Irish loaf successfully.  Then he says he is waiting for a further reply.  The farmers are going to feel that &ldquo;waiting for a further reply&rdquo;.  They will get less for wheat in the meantime.  They are entitled to be paid what they got for it last year.  Their costs have increased&mdash;they have not become less &mdash;and the thanks they are to get for producing a big quantity of wheat is to have the price reduced.</P>
      <P>If the Minister tackled this question seriously and if he were really interested, it would be different.  I do not believe he is interested.  He is interested in the millers and in some of the other people, but not in the farmers. That is a disgrace.  I appeal to him here this evening to take this matter up seriously immediately and see what is the maximum amount of Irish wheat we can use.  I believe we can use more than we are using at present; and the people generally in the country, the people concerned in this whole issue, which has become very important, are also of the same opinion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

      <P>The fact that we are asked here to provide a supplementary sum of £500,000 to get rid of <Col N="813" /> surplus wheat is only one more proof of the muddled thinking and planning of various Governments here over the past few years in connection with this wheat problem.  I recollect that, here in this House, less than two years ago, figures were given showing that over 140,000 acres of land were taken on conacre, by exploiters, to grow wheat. Some of the people who took this land took it in the names of limited liability companies.  Others who exploited the wheat situation had nothing whatever to do with farming in their lifetime up to the taking of this conacre.  The result to-day is that lands in the midlands which, up to three or four years ago, had been used solely for the ranching of cattle, were immediately ploughed up and turned over to the production of wheat, to satisfy a group of what I can only describe as exploiters of the worst sort.  If the Governments in the past had taken the necessary steps to control the growing of wheat and the acreage involved, this sum would not have to be sought in this House to-day.</P>
      <P>I asked a number of questions here over recent years as to what steps were being taken by the Government to deal with the land being exploited by the conacre men in different parts of the midlands, what steps were being taken to acquire that land and have it redistributed amongst decent farmers in the community.  All we got here was an evasive answer from various Ministers.  The result is that to-day the small farmer, the worker and the members of the community as a whole, are being asked to pay further penal taxes, in order to soften the blow for those gentlemen who have exploited the wheat situation so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has told the House that only 3 per cent. of the arable land in Ireland is being used for the growing of wheat.  If that figure is correct, it should not be an insurmountable problem for a Government to bring a practical plan into operation to ensure that we grow our own full requirements and, at the same time, give a reasonable allocation to those who have constantly grown wheat over the years.  It is the only method by which we can <Col N="814" /> get rid of such Supplementary Estimates in future.  We should place the growing of wheat under contract in the same way as the sugar company places the growing of beet.</P>
    <P>Down through the years, small and medium-sized farmers have loyally produced wheat when it was needed.  They have grown three, four or up to ten acres a year and they have never let the State down.  They are being hit to-day by the uncertainty of prices, all because of the fact that greedy people were allowed to exploit wheat-growing over the past couple of years.  Is it right that that should be allowed?  Is it further right that the small farmer should pay this penal tax now to subsidise the millers, bakers, and large wheat exploiters?  There is an onus on the Minister to have a practical plan prepared whereby in future wheat will be grown by contract and whereby the small and medium-sized farmer will be protected.  After that, I do not care if the extra wheat that is needed is grown by a group of people who started to grow it only recently.  There is no other way out of it.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to plan the wheat programme on the basis that next year we will not have as much wheat, due to the married price.  That is a gamble and we cannot have a gamble, as far as production on the land is concerned. I do not want to see a Supplementary Estimate like this being brought in here again.  There is an awful lot to be said for having control over the growing of wheat, that is, a control to be exercised right from the growing until the wheat is processed and it reaches the consumer in the form of bread on his table.  In between, there are people who are getting away with the swag, the large millers and the large bakers.  To add insult to injury, the controlling influence in these concerns is exercised from outside the State.  I do not think we should tolerate that control being exercised from outside the State, especially in a fundamental matter like our food production.</P>
    <P>The other matter is the amount for the Industrial Development Authority, to cover the expenses of a representative of this country who is in America at the moment, seeking the establishment <Col N="815" /> of industries here.  I do not want to say too much on this at the present time, but I have heard a lot of talk about our being short of capital and short of money.  So far as I can see, we are not short of money but of methods whereby we can spend it. Deputy Corish pointed out that over the last five years people ranging from the rank of Cabinet Minister down to the like of Deputy Briscoe&mdash;I presume he could have been a Cabinet Minister, too&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have gone to the United States and tried their utmost to interest American industrialists in setting up industrial concerns and factories here, the enticement being that here is a suitable country, that grants are available under the Undeveloped Areas Act and that we are in a suitable position as a jumping-off ground, if the European Free Trade Area comes into operation.  However, in those five years, we have had no response whatever from any large-scale industrialist in America, but we have had an influx of people from America, as well as elsewhere, who, instead of setting up development works, bought land and property and other businesses in this State.  We do not want that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time, our chances of getting industrial projects from America are less than ever.  I do not like to be pessimistic, but my impression of the situation in America is that they are in for a very serious time during the next two or three years, and that the position in regard to unemployment in America is only starting. Our demands and pleas in America, in such a situation, will fall on deaf ears.  If we have money to spare at the present time, we should spend it in places where we can secure markets for the products we can already sell.  If we take the Middle East and the countries recently under colonial rule, there is a vast market for any Irish products.  If you look up <Col N="816" /> the trade returns, you will see that Ireland has an adverse trade balance with the majority of those countries at the present time.  If we had the proper approach to these, I have not the slightest doubt that we could increase our exports of processed goods of an agricultural nature to them.  During the past few months, we have imported something like £150,000 worth of ham. It is fantastic that we should be spending money in seeking industrial projects from America when we have the raw materials in agriculture at home which should be developed, processed and foreign markets sought for it.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest we can get into such markets overnight, for a number of reasons.  One of the greatest difficulties is the shipping drawback.  If to-morrow morning we were in a position to send large consignments of Irish foodstuffs to various countries, we would not be in a position to send them in our own ships.  We are up against the fact that so much trans-shipment has to take place.  If we sell abroad, our exports go to Liverpool and other British ports, where they are trans-shipped to the countries where the products are to be utilised. We have no control over the method of trans-shipment, once they leave our shores.</P>
    <P>The results of this have very often been shown in the adverse criticism levelled at Irish products, and the real cause of the criticism being levelled is the delays that take place, not between Ireland and Liverpool, but between Ireland and the country to which the product is being sent.  I am afraid that we are not putting first things first.  While we all agree on the desirability and necessity for increasing industrial activity here inside the State, we should first concentrate on the major industry that we have here, and use the multitude of by-products that can be processed out of the main industry itself.  If we concentrated on those industries and got markets for them, we would be doing a lot to keep our people at home and at the same time reduce this disequilibrium in our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can do anything <Col N="817" /> about refusing the Minister the extra money for which he is looking, but there is no harm in my going on record as saying I believe the money being spent on the tour by this individual in America is a waste of time.  I do not say that in any contentious sense as far as that organisation is concerned. The fault lies with our own Minister. When he and his predecessor, with their train load of expert advisers, could not get suitable industrial projects here, how can we expect a man in the position of the individual concerned, who has only very limited resources at his disposal, to do so?</P>

      <P>I am sorry the last speaker adopted such a defeatist attitude towards our trade representative, Count McCormack.  The period of ten years or so, over which we have tried to encourage United States industrialists to come here, is a very short period in a lifetime.  The advances made since the establishment of the State in 1922 have been big in comparison with advances in other countries that have hundreds of years behind them.</P>
      <P>Listening to the various speakers, I feel the time is past when it was a case of: &ldquo;No matter what you do, I can do something better.&rdquo;  It is time for a pooling of the best brains in the country.  Even if the Minister for Industry and Commerce had a wand and had all the power possible, he could not do anything without the full co-operation of the people.  If our country is to survive, that co-operation is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not cut the stick of any trade representative of this country. If he does not do good now, he may soften up the ground for somebody to follow him.  We want to prove to the world the potentialities of this country.  I am very disappointed that our products are not hitting the headlines in the American market.  I do not know who is at fault.  One such product is whiskey. I do not know whether or not the blend is palatable to the American taste but it is a product which should be a great dollar earner.  Instead of that, it is still relegated to a very poor place on the American market while <Col N="818" /> the Scottish product is worth millions of dollars.  I believe the explanation in that case is that the Scottish distillers have spent plenty of money on advertising.  They have succeeded in getting the blend of whiskey the Americans want and they have succeeded in selling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am dealing with our trade prospects.  I am pointing out the possibility of spending more money in order to export more goods from this country.</P>
      <P>I want to deal now with our industrialists. Those of them who are nationally-minded should join together, pool their plans and say: &ldquo;We are able to produce something a foreign country needs.&rdquo;  On the one hand, we are asking the Minister and his Department to do everything; on the other hand, we are condemning them for interfering too much with private enterprise. We cannot have it both ways. Industrialists anxious to get into the export market should pool their resources and ensure that the quality of their products is of the highest. Unless that spirit of co-operation is adopted by all sections, we will not go ahead as a nation.  Other countries have had to change with the times and we will have to do the same.</P>
      <P>I heard a number of speakers on the other side speak about wheat.  I am delighted to see that times have changed as far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned.  They are very anxious about growing wheat now but a few years ago their chief spokesman did not want it at all.</P>

      <P>I gave Deputy Corish a very respectful hearing when he was speaking.  He is getting a bit bothered now but I shall carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very nice to hear of the complete conversion to wheat of some of the leaders of the Fine Gael Party.  I <Col N="819" /> heard Deputy Dillon speak a while ago on this very problem.  It is nice to know he can change his mind, too.  He was one of the men who opposed the production of wheat.  I am very sorry that a number of the small farmers in County Dublin and other parts of the country, who stood by the people when there was compulsory growing of wheat, are now hard hit.  That is due&mdash;I have to agree with the last speaker&mdash;to the intervention of people who are not farmers and who only went into the business to make a racket of wheat growing.  They took hundreds of acres of land in every county they could. They succeeded in injuring the honest-to-God small farmer and the conacre farmer who made a good living on a mixed farm or a tillage farm.  That is a problem that the Government has now to face.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has a heavy burden on his shoulders&mdash;to see that the people who stood foursquare behind the Fianna Fáil Government and the people of Ireland will get reasonable protection now.  It is a very sad reflection that the land of this country should be destroyed by people who saw a chance of making easy money out of it.  When we wanted to have wheat grown in this country to feed our people during the war years, the owners of the large ranches thought very hard of growing any wheat at all.  During the 1946 harvesting campaign, in which I was interested, I went to a farm about 15 miles away from Dublin where a man had 600 acres of land.  He told the inspectors to get out of his fields and that he did not mind whether the wheat rotted or not.</P>
    <P>When the price of wheat went up, these people saw an opportunity of exploiting the market and of destroying the market for the hard-working small farmers.  This is now a serious problem for us.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce has already stated, an effort is being made to see if a loaf can be produced from Irish wheat.  I hope the experts will prove that it is possible to have an all-Irish loaf.  I hope that the people who stood by us in the years when we wanted <Col N="820" /> them to do so will get a square deal now and that they will get the protection they deserve.  I also hope that the exploiters who came into the market in recent years will not be permitted to squeeze the hard working people out of the market as they are trying to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has brought before the house shows, in the main, losses arising from the sale of wheat.  Once again we have emphasised the importance to the Exchequer of having stability in agricultural production.  Deputy Dillon has already pointed out that it was not quite necessary to be so emphatic about this being a charge on the taxpayer arising out of the subsidisation of agriculture.  There have been appeals from members of the last Government and from public men now in office that there should be an increase in agricultural production.  What the farmers have done has been in response to that general appeal to increase production.  Now that they have responded in that way there seems to be a concerted effort to imply that in some way they are benefiting unduly at the expense of other sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible for any Minister for Agriculture to say exactly when agricultural production, whether of milk, bacon, eggs or wheat, would be sufficient to supply the home market. Much of the charge which has now to be met has been caused by reduced consumption at home.  It seems, from replies that have been given both by the Government and by the millers, that this reduction in the consumption of bread and flour has been occasioned by three factors.  The first of these is an increase in the standard of living of the people.  It must be remembered that bread is the basic food of the lower income group and, when people move from that low standard group, they consume less bread.  The second factor is that of emigration which has an effect in particular parts of the country and the third factor, and not the least, is that the higher prices of bread and flour are reflected in this <Col N="821" /> Supplementary Estimate.  If we examine any commodity we will find that its consumption is governed by its price.  With a commodity such as bread and flour any increase in price has an impact on the cost of living of every family and there is no doubt that the sudden withdrawal of the food subsidies has resulted in a reduction in consumption.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this subject of milling and baking, I should like to express the great concern that exists in many small towns throughout the country at the mopping up process which is taking place with regard to the small family bakers.  This is being done mainly by two big cartels; I need not give their names.  To some extent the temptation to small people to sell out, has arisen because of the extremely attractive price that has been offered to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This does not arise under any of the subheads of this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that this mopping up is taking place does not bear out the contention that the milling industry is not in a position to bear any further impact on it.  It is an extraordinary thing that these millers are capable of making such extremely attractive offers to the smaller bakeries while here in this House we are being asked to pass such a formidable Supplementary Estimate which will accrue, in part, to the benefit of the milling industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister included an interesting item of news in his opening statement. He stated that, in consequence of the reduction of the food subsidy, troubles were brought on the biscuit manufacturers and their troubles will be remedied by this Supplementary Estimate. The Estimate provides that they will be given access to some of the wheat which has now become surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure of 300,000 tons of Irish wheat, which has now been stated by the Government as being the maximum figure of home grown wheat which can be consumed at home, is a figure that has been challenged. Deputy Hughes referred to it; organisations <Col N="822" /> representing farming interests have challenged it and there is no doubt that the producers were extremely interested, and will be interested, in what the Minister said to-day in regard to the tests carried out at the Curragh, tests which were expected to provide an answer to the claims made that it was possible to produce an edible Irish loaf made completely from home-grown wheat.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the producers, this has a very great attraction to anybody interested in the maintenance of our balance of payments equilibrium.  If we could eliminate from our imports such a substantial item as wheat, no doubt it would relieve any Government of the kind of measures they might be called upon to take should disequilibrium arise in our balance of payments.  Consequently, we can expect any Government to be sympathetic to the results that would flow from the production of an all-Irish loaf.  Like Deputy Hughes I am concerned to find that the long-awaited results have not been as encouraging as they might have been and have, in fact, an element of reservation in them.</P>
    <P>While the Minister was encouraging up to a point, he indicated that the rejection of one sack of the ten used in the test to some extent impaired the acceptance of it as a correct basis. That means that it will apply to any further report that will come on the completion of that test.  It is extraordinary that we can produce figures and results and reports for industrial standards that will bear the closest scrutiny and the most exact examination, but when we seek to find out the cost of producing a gallon of milk, through the Milk Costings Commission, or when we try to find out whether we can produce an all-Irish loaf, we are immediately up against mistakes in the very basis of computing the ultimate results in both matters.  That is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether, in his opinion, that would resolve any problem that the Government might have to meet in relation to what would be expected to flow from the production of a suitable all-Irish <Col N="823" /> loaf.  Is there any other difficulty which would emerge later as an alibi for the non-acceptance of a favourable result in the matter of the actual milling or baking of this bread?</P>
    <P>We know that at harvest time a Minister for Agriculture is hard put to it to ensure that the production of wheat in the previous harvest will be taken up without undue delay at the mill doors and we know it is in consequence of much arduous work on the part of successive Ministers for Agriculture, and very successful work on the part of their Department that the producers' problems have been met and that the flow can be handled, even though it has been aggravated by the fact that, with the introduction of mechanisation and the almost universal use of the combine, we now have the delivery season considerably shortened and that there is an immense physical job of work to be faced in the acceptance of the wheat grown by the farmers.</P>
    <P>It would be little good to the producers if, having surmounted one difficulty and got the green light in that regard, they were faced with the type of scrutiny and examination at the mill door which would quite possibly result in the rejection of much of the wheat produced, or result in slowing down the acceptance of wheat, which again, in the event of unfavourable weather conditions, would cause much loss to the producers.  I should like to know, when this question of dependence on the all-Irish loaf is again advanced, whether that has been resolved and whether the Government can meet the requests that come so constantly now from many quarters for an active move towards the attainment of a higher acreage of wheat for consumption at home, by the acceptance of the view that an all-Irish loaf is not alone a possibility but an imminent probability, so to speak.</P>
    <P>The smaller item included in the Minister's Supplementary Estimate in connection with the grant-in-aid for industrial development has been explained as being intended to defray the expenses of Count Cyril McCormack in his efforts in America at present.  I should like to compliment the Minister <Col N="824" /> on his selection of this envoy and to express the hope that the results which will flow from his work will not alone recoup the meagre expense which is required here, but will do justice to the hopes many of us entertain in regard to the advantages that could accrue to this country from the introduction of suitable enterprises with the capital and technical &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; that is so desirable in our present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude on the note on which Deputy Dillon began, by saying that it is a pity, when this Estimate is being made, that the whole fraud&mdash; it is a strong word to use, but nevertheless when one gets down to it it appears to be the only word to describe the existing set-up in relation to the implementation of the Control of Manufactures Act&mdash;is not remedied. We know there are numerous means by which a coach-and-four can be driven through that Act, that it exists merely as a facade, and that behind it we have devious routes by which non-nationals can come in and establish industries here, while at the same time some of us believe there are many reputable and well-established, desirable enterprises outside that will not resort to the methods necessary to circumvent the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given some slight indication that he has found that all that was intended to flow from the Control of Manufactures Act has not come about.  He is now enthusiastic about the desirability of obtaining foreign capital.  I think that while we retain this facade, it will not have the attraction for outside investors of any repute which it would have if there was a clear field thrown open to them.</P>
    <P>I would again wish that the consequences of the provision of this additional sum of £5,000 would be reflected in the success of our representative, Count McCormack.  I hope his efforts will not be dampened in any way by any diffusion of activities there, but that he will be recognised as the sole, authorised representative of the Government and of this House in bringing about what we hope will be successful results in consequence of <Col N="825" /> his activities in America at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested in the debate in relation to the provision of the additional sum of £500,000 required for the disposal of the wheat surplus and the debate on the 100 per cent.  Irish loaf.  There seems to be a great deal of controversy in the country as to whether we could produce in this country a 100 per cent. Irish loaf or not.  Arguments are adduced that certain vested interests are against using 100 per cent.  Irish flour.  I would not agree with that. In my opinion, all concerned would be most interested to see a 100 per cent. Irish loaf being produced, provided it could be made a palatable loaf with reasonable commercial possibilities.</P>
      <P>That is the only interest these people have.  Provided they get a reasonable profit for their work and provided they are able to turn out a reasonable article, they have no prejudice whatever against using 100 per cent. Irish wheat.  Up to the present and having regard to the type of wheat we have in this country, it has not been practicable.  Even before this, when we had all winter wheat&mdash;and that is not so many years back&mdash;you could not have used the same percentage in bakers' bread as we use to-day but, with the changes in varieties, the percentage has been stepped up.  I have no doubt that in the years to come we will produce in this country a variety of wheat which, treated by improved methods, will give us the 100 per cent. Irish loaf.  At the moment, I do not think these conditions are being fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had indications in relation to the experiments which were carried out at the Curragh.  The report seems to be delayed for a very long time.  I cannot understand why that report should be held up so long.  One would imagine that one month would be quite a considerable time for anybody to examine the pros and cons in relation to the types of flour used.  One could have had in that period many more experiments and they should not be confined to the one run of flour.  The experiments should be continuous and <Col N="826" /> I see no reason why we could not have experiments fortnightly.  If that were done, a loaf could be produced which would be a commercial proposition. The Minister said that they had special conditions in the Curragh which would not be available to the ordinary baker, but I am sure that these special conditions could be made available to the ordinary bakers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the disposal of the surplus, the Minister is helped by his officials.  They channelled it into three different departments&mdash;one for animal feeding, one for biscuit flour and the third for reduced extraction.  The millers seemed to think that the reduced extraction would help the sale of flour.  I would not agree with the Minister on that.  My feeling is that the tax of 43 per cent. which was placed on bread in the Budget of 1957 and the tax of 73 per cent. which they placed on flour in the same Budget were the main factors in reducing the consumption of bread.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">

      <P>The fall in consumption took place in 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be due to emigration at the time as well.  The fall in consumption took place since the Government put a tax of 43 per cent. on bread and 73 per cent. on flour in the Budget of 1957.  That was bound to have a big effect.  The Minister's officials should have been directed to find a method by which they could divert this surplus for the benefit of the people of this country.  Those who compose the Government may not know that at present amidst a surplus of wheat&mdash;and a very large surplus&mdash; there is great hunger and certain people are unable to purchase the wheat.  The Minister's officials should have been directed to place the £650,000 at the disposal of the hungry people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very closely connected with the trade and I know a good deal about the disposal of bread.  I know that people would be satisfied to get any little reduction in the price of bread.  The Minister has very helpful officials and he should have asked them to direct their energies towards finding a method to give unemployed families the benefit <Col N="827" /> of the surplus.  I feel that the £650,000 &mdash;or another £650,000 with it&mdash;would have been much better spent in finding some method whereby this surplus would accrue to the benefit of the people of this country.  A person said to me the other day that we have starvation amidst plenty.</P>
    <P>The difference of practically £3 between the price which the farmers received for good quality wheat and the price ex-mill of 130/-, is far too high. There is a great deal of clamour for efficiency experts in industry to reduce costs and I suggest that the Minister would get some of these experts to examine that matter, with a view to effecting a reduction, slight though it might be.  The slowness of demand was bad enough before we had the 43 per cent. tax on bread and the 73 per cent. tax on flour.  On top of that, we had another increase of 4/6 in the price of flour and bread which the Government will find it very hard to stand over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I would add my voice to those of other Deputies who have criticised the wheat position.  It is a complete national muddle.  It is the responsibility of the Government to see to it that it does not happen in the future.  There should be more calculation at the commencement of the year as to the direction in which we are going.  Unfortunately, we have none of that, but just a national muddle.  Farming is in a complete muddle; farmers are in need of guidance and direction from the top.</P>
      <P>It is scandalous that farming should be treated as it is treated at present. It is without management.  Poor leadership and poor direction are responsible for that state of affairs. We should work to a national plan instead of having a complete muddle and mess.  Nobody seems to be at the top or the bottom of anything.  Wheat-growing was bedevilled by speculators. That has been rife for many years in the Midlands and no Government has made the slightest effort to put an end to it.  We shall be far worse off at the next harvest because more wheat will be grown this year than was grown last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad to see the small farmer <Col N="828" /> and the middle-class farmer squeezed out by speculators, both foreign and native, who reap the profit that should go to the small man.  We are wiping out the little industries that were a tradition in the country&mdash;the cottier with his poultry, his eggs and his pig. He cannot continue with them, because he cannot make a profit.  It is the same with wheat.  In the past, we had a tradition of wheat-growing, but it was always done in rotation. The farmer would sow his wheat in October or in early spring and the job would be done properly and the wheat would be harvested in good condition.</P>
    <P>At the moment, the speculators with their huge machinery reap this wheat in the worst of condition, but that makes no difference to them.  Whether it rains or shines, they cut it night and day and rush it to the mills.  There was a complete glut in all the mills and it could not be otherwise.  All that was bad enough, but worse was to follow.  Those people turned themselves into money changers and were able to give handsome tips here, there and everywhere in order to get that rotten stuff off their hands.  At the same time, the small decent man, who would not stand for that low type of behaviour of buying his way, could not get into the mills at all.  I ask the Minister to put a stop to the speculators and to give the small decent man a chance.  It is bad enough that there should be smuggling at the Border without having the mills and so on involved in the same type of racket.  What will we end up as, but a nation of gangsters?  It is time to curb that tendency.  The same can be said about the pig industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask that we get back to a balanced rotation of crops. It is essential for the good of the land. Wheat-growing should be put on a basis similar to that of beet-growing. It should be put on a contract system. In that way, the small man will be able to get a return.  If the Government do not do that, we may as well throw our hats at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> There should be no gluts but proper guidance and direction at the top.  The people will then know where they are being led.  The trouble at the moment is that they are not being led.  Every Minister talks about the mess and says that we have too much wheat and asks what we shall do with the surplus.  We should not have a surplus.  We know the population of our country.  Why not put wheat-growing on the same basis as beet-growing?  If we have a small surplus, it is all right, but there is no need for a big surplus.  Let the small and the middle-class man get back into wheat-growing, pig-rearing and so forth, rather than have him squeezed out.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to speak to the Minister for Agriculture and get him to get his inspectors active and stop the abuses I have mentioned.  Otherwise, in a few years' time, an acre of good land will not be left on which we could grow wheat in a national emergency.  A lot of our land is like a dust bowl at the moment because, year after year, speculators are sowing wheat on it regardless of how they will leave it.  All they want is to get away with the swag.  Would any other country stand for it?</P>
    <P>The farmer should get a chance at the beginning of the year to calculate how things will turn out at the end of the year.  We are allowing speculators to squeeze out the small farmer and the middle-class farmer and to leave them as hewers of wood and drawers of water.  The same can be said for the mills and bakeries.  There should be no large combines in this small country, where a Christian outlook should prevail.  Instead of all that, we allow the speculator to be the big fellow.  Is it not time the Government gave direction and guidance and showed good management and business methods?</P>
    <P>What would become of any business, if it were run the way our agricultural industry is run?  Surely any other business would have to go into liquidation? The Government should consider the small and the middle-class people who have carried this country along in the <Col N="830" /> past, but who are sadly neglected to-day. They should take some of the land from those large speculators and thus prevent them from taking what, in justice, should be given to other people, so that we will get a balanced economy, have good business methods and an Irish way of life of which we can be proud.</P>

      <P>No.  We have had two debates in one&mdash;a separate debate under each sub-head of this Supplementary Estimate.  No doubt, that complicated matters for Deputies.  I will deal with each of these matters separately in my reply.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated that, in a debate on a Supplementary Estimate of this kind, only particular aspects of policy directly relevant to the sub-head can be referred to.  Some of the wider issues of policy raised by some Deputies can more usefully be discussed on the main Estimates which are now coming along.  It is necessary to emphasise that the immediate problem with which I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, am concerned &mdash;and to which this Supplementary Estimate relates&mdash;is a <i>bona fide</i> surplus of wheat in the hands of flour millers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the 1956 harvest, a surplus of wheat was recognised to exist.  The Government of that day, which included Deputy Dillon, included in the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce a sub-head relating to that problem.  They proposed to provide £150,000 under that sub-head to offset the losses likely to arise upon the disposal of that wheat surplus.  The amount provided was completely inadequate&mdash;and that is the part of the problem I am dealing with now.  It is true that the surplus has been more than doubled as a result of the 1957 crop experience, but, nevertheless, the position is complicated <Col N="831" /> by the fact that there was this carry-over of wheat from 1956.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said that there was no problem in disposing of the surplus. When he was Minister, he brought in the millers and said: &ldquo;There is a lot of wheat being produced, more than you require; because of the bad weather during the 1956 harvest, some of it is barely of millable quality, but you buy the lot at the guaranteed minimum price and if you have any difficulty after that, talk to the Minister for Industry and Commerce&rdquo;&mdash;then Deputy Norton.  That settled the problem for Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture, but it did not settle it for anyone else, either Deputy Norton, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the flour millers who were holding the wheat.  It was left to me to try to work out a practical method of taking from the millers that wheat which they held in excess of their requirements and to get rid of it in the most useful and least costly way.</P>
    <P>On a couple of occasions Deputy Dillon referred to seed wheat.  That does not arise in this connection at all. The surplus I am talking about is a surplus in the hands of millers, wheat bought by millers for milling into flour, but purchased under Government direction, in excess of the quantity they needed or the quantity they were required to buy by their quota obligations under the Cereals Acts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said we should get rid of this surplus by cutting the extraction rate to 50 per cent.  I do not know if 50 per cent. extraction flour was ever on sale in this country, but the suggestion indicates an inability to understand the essentials of this problem. That inability was reflected in the speeches of other Deputies who spoke about a 100 per cent.  Irish loaf. One of the aspects of this problem in which we are all concerned is that the present price guaranteed for Irish wheat is about £10 a ton more than the price at which we could buy imported wheat.  Therefore, any proposal such as that which Deputy Dillon has made, to reduce the extraction of wheat so that more Irish wheat will <Col N="832" /> be used by millers, or to increase the percentage of Irish wheat in the grist so that less foreign wheat will be used, means that flour will cost more, that bread will be dearer.  Deputies must not leave that out of account. The problem of increasing the percentage of Irish wheat in the grist is not merely the technical problem of producing good flour from 100 per cent. Irish wheat, but it is also the problem of the higher cost to the consumer of flour and the consumer of bread which is necessarily involved.  Therefore, we must not glibly talk about there being no problem of disposing of the wheat surplus.  It is a very clear problem, both in respect of the technical arrangements that could be made to secure it and in the effect of any measures we may adopt upon the cost of this essential commodity to the consumers.  I should imagine that a 50 per cent. extraction loaf would cost about nearly double the price of the present loaf.  Therefore, it is rather foolish to put forward that proposal as a solution.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite talked about the 1957 wheat crop costing more.  The prices guaranteed to farmers for the 1957 crop were fixed by Deputy Dillon as Minister and he altered the scale of moisture content deductions to which the guaranteed price applied and particularly he introduced this idea of a 5/- per barrel bonus for wheat under a certain moisture content.  I am not finding fault with that arrangement, but surely Deputy Dillon or the Government which approved of that arrangement must have realised that if there was a good harvest and a high percentage of dry wheat delivered to millers the cost of that wheat to the millers, who had to pay the bonus, would be higher than it was in the previous year.  Perhaps it is more accurate to say that the cost of the wheat to the millers in the previous years was lower because of the very high moisture content.  I hope we shall always be able to get as good a harvest as in 1957.  Certainly, we do not want to see a repetition of the 1956 harvest, with a high moisture content and a consequently low price payable for wheat as in 1956.  The good harvest meant there was a higher price payable <Col N="833" /> for wheat in 1957, plus this bonus introduced in that year.  The total cost of the wheat to the millers was increased considerably and their cost of the flour made from that wheat rose as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister excuse me?  Is not there the impact of the reduced cost of drying good wheat, as compared with drying wheat which is wet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I mentioned that.  I said that the saving which might have been achieved by reason of the lower cost of drying the wheat was offset in 1957 by higher transport charges and higher interest charges.  Let it be quite clear.  It never was the policy of any Government in this country to produce wheat for export, a surplus of wheat which could be disposed of only by export. After the war we considered the details of a long-term policy for agriculture and announced our conclusions as to the form we thought that long-term policy should take.  We indicated that the aim should be to produce here two-thirds of our total wheat requirements. Our total wheat requirements then were higher than they are now, because of this falling off in the consumption of flour and bread to which reference has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We aim now at producing and using four-fifths of our total wheat requirements and the obligation on the flour millers is to buy from the farmers four-fifths of the total wheat requirements of this country at the guaranteed prices.  That is 300,000 tons of dried wheat.  The question whether we can go from four-fifths to 100 per cent.  Irish wheat is, as I said, partly a technical problem and partly a price problem. The technical problem may be resolved. Deputy Booth said you do not ask experts if you can do something: you ask them how you can do something. In the case of the technical problem of producing flour from 100 per cent. Irish wheat, the experts have been asked: &ldquo;Can it be done?&rdquo;  with a result which will be satisfactory from the point of view of the consumer. Some millers say it cannot be done, that there are chemicals in Irish wheat which tend to produce what <Col N="834" /> is described as a bole in the bread when it is baked in the ordinary type of oven available to the Irish baker, that is, a ridge of doughy matter immediately inside the crust.</P>
    <P>The experiment carried out on the Curragh would indicate that a palatable loaf can be produced under certain conditions from a flour made out of 100 per cent. Irish wheat.  The experiment on the Curragh however, which was conducted under the supervision of experts, was of doubtful value, for these reasons.  The production of the palatable dough and of good bread from it required an addition of certain chemicals on a controlled basis in order to improve the appearance and quality of the dough.  The probability is that most of the bakers in this country could not do it.  They would not have the facilities or the equipment to enable them to do the same job in the same way.  We could be taking a risk, and indeed would be taking a risk, in deciding on a 100 per cent. Irish loaf, before all these aspects of the matter had been fully examined and the report of the Institute for Industrial Research upon them had been received.</P>
    <P>Even if we decide that there are no technical reasons which would prevent the production of a 100 per cent. Irish loaf, we still have to consider another problem, arising out of the fact that the price of Irish wheat is £10 per ton higher than that of the imported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, that requires some imports.  There are two purposes in that.  The bakers say that to produce a good loaf in a batch oven, they must have some hard wheat used in the flour.  The Irish wheat is a soft <Col N="835" /> wheat.  They say they cannot produce a loaf in a modern batch oven without some hard wheat in the grist.  The millers use only a soft wheat for shop flour and there would be a price problem, if they were required to use 100 per cent. Irish wheat.  Consequently, the national wheat percentage is the same for millers of both bakers' flour and shop flour.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish was under some misunderstanding as to the position in thinking that the taxpayers have to pay £500,000, and the farmers at the same time face lower prices for wheat. That is not happening at all.  This year, the whole of the cost of disposing of the surplus wheat is being carried by the taxpayer and is being met by the Exchequer.  The proposal is that next year that cost will be met by the producers of the wheat.  The position will be reviewed some time before the harvest and a decision taken as to what the total of the harvest is likely to be, and then there will be a deduction from the guaranteed price to the extent necessary and a fund will be set up to be administered by a committee of the growers themselves.  I do not know if that will work out.  I do not know if it will be a permanently suitable arrangement.  I have no objection, and no member of the Government has an objection, to the introduction of a contract system into this business, but it is a sign of very superficial thinking to say that such a system can be introduced without difficulty.  It is also a sign of superficial thinking to compare a contract system for wheat with the system operated and applied to sugar beet.  The aim of the sugar company is to increase the acreage under sugar beet.  Their contract is designed to make sure that the farmer will deliver the minimum that he has contracted to grow and there is a very big difference between trying to get the acreage up and applying a contract system of that sort, and applying a system to get the acreage down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I personally would very much like to see a situation whereby a grower of wheat would <Col N="836" /> have an obligation, because of his possible relationship with an individual miller, or otherwise, to harvest his wheat well, to deliver it in sound condition to the miller and possibly to ensure the uniformity of quality which the millers regard as of so much importance to them when they are handling grist containing such a high percentage of Irish flour.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes was under some misunderstanding regarding the statement I made regarding a 79 per cent. mixture of Irish wheat and the figure of 87 per cent. which the millers say they are using.  The millers say they buy 87 per cent. of Irish wheat, but the Deputy must understand that Irish wheat has to be dried, to be reduced in volume by a drying process, whereas imported wheat often has to have moisture added to it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Eighty-seven per cent. of undried Irish wheat is equivalent to 79 per cent. dried.  A number of points were raised which concern the Department of Agriculture in so far as long term agricultural policy is involved rather than matters which relate to the Department of Industry and Commerce, which is concerned with the utilisation of the wheat grown here by the millers.  Those points will no doubt be discussed on the main Estimate.</P>
      <P>I want now to deal with the second sub-head of the Supplementary Estimate. Deputy Dillon made some comment on the Control of Manufactures Bill and Deputy Booth did likewise.  I do not propose to deal with them now because that Bill will be before the House later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, however, talked about collaboration with the United States Government in a manner which Deputy Corish, I think, rightly, described as very innocent.  Count McCormack, as representative of the Industrial Development Authority, and our diplomatic representatives in the United States have, in connection with this campaign, already made contact with the Commerce Department of the United <Col N="837" /> States Government and have received every evidence of goodwill and a good deal of useful advice in connection with their work.  Everybody knows the American Government is committed to the private enterprise system of industrial development, and it is foolish to think that we can count upon direct Government intervention in the United States in order to persude private firms to engage in industrial projects in this country in preference to other countries which they might choose. That type of thinking is undesirable.</P>
    <P>We have a job of work to do here if we are to get our industrial programme developed.  We will have to do it ourselves and nobody else will do it for us.  It is undesirable to circulate the idea that somebody else is going to do the work we must do ourselves.  Deputy Dillon asked what case we could make to American industrialists to entice them to establish factories in Dublin or Cork, instead of Rotterdam and Amsterdam.  I think that mentality is deplorable.  If there was any justification for propounding an idea like that, the only thing left for us to do would be to dig a hole, jump into it and pull it in after us. That type of pessimism is far too widespread and it is deplorable, therefore, to see it fostered by public men.</P>
    <P>We have many and very substantial reasons to advance why industrialists abroad should come to this country rather than to any other in Europe. As I have often mentioned in the course of public speaking, we have what can be described as a degree of political stability that does not exist in other countries.  There is at any rate no policy of doctrinaire nationalisation being preached here as it is being preached in countries not so very far away from us.  We proclaim our belief in private enterprise and that will be a matter of interest to American industrial firms.</P>
    <P>We have labour available here for any industrial enterprise that may be undertaken, not merely a surplus of labour which we deplore and which is a situation we want to remedy, but we have a higher average level of intelligence amongst our labour force than most European countries.  That <Col N="838" /> is a fact which has been commented upon favourably by foreign factory managers employed by Irish industrialists and by anybody from abroad who has had intimate contact with Irish industrial firms.  They have paid tribute to the quality of Irish labour and to the speed with which Irish workers can acquire proficiency in complicated industrial processes.</P>
    <P>Also of importance from the point of view of the American manufacturer is the fact that we have no language problem, as far as their technical and executive personnel may be concerned. That is a problem they are likely to encounter and which will certainly cause them difficulty in the countries to which Deputy Dillon was directing attention, such as Holland and Belgium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean we have the capacity to communicate in a language they will understand.</P>
      <P>We have these tax inducements and capital grants which are given for the precise purpose of encouraging people to select this country for new industrial projects rather than some other country.  So far as I know, they are not paralleled in any other European country.  It is true that in the Six Counties they have an arrangement under which cash grants are given for industrial undertakings, although they are not as great as what we can offer under the Undeveloped Areas Act. They also have a system of building factories for renting.  While we do not want to represent ourselves as being in any sense in competition with that part of Ireland in the matter of attracting new industries, because we would like to see their prosperity proceed parallel with our own, we can claim that we are offering advantages at least as great as they are in a position to provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter we should not ignore.  We have here trade agreements with non-European countries which can be of very great importance to firms establishing factories <Col N="839" /> here for the purpose of engaging in export trade.</P>
    <P>Deputies have assumed that as a result of the campaign to interest American industrialists in Ireland's possibilities, we have not produced any results.  That is not correct. There are, I am glad to say, at least five undertakings where finance by American capital is contemplated which are now proceeding.  Details of these projects will have to be made known by the people who are promoting them.  They are quite important, and in the case of at least two of them almost the whole of the production is intended for export. There are two other American concerns which have started operations here&mdash;admittedly in a small way&mdash;but we hope their activities will expand. Certainly the firms associated with them would have no difficulty in effecting that expansion if the possibility for it presented itself.  Even on the basis of the limited effort made during the course of the last year by certain newspaper publicity and other contacts, some substantial results have been achieved.  They are not nearly enough to solve any problems here, but certainly enough to encourage us to believe, in the circumstances now prevailing, that a more vigorous campaign will get more substantial results.</P>
    <P>As I explained in introducing the Estimate, this period was selected for that campaign because we think this is the time in which American industrial firms will be discussing the desirability of establishing plants in Europe in the light of the possible emergence of European free trade. Deputy Corish said the amount we are providing for this campaign is inadequate and that it is not sufficient to make a sufficient impact on American opinion.  I will agree the amount is not very large when one considers the vast scale of the American scene.  But the advertising we are talking about is advertising in a very specialised type of journal likely to reach the people we want to contact.  The distribution of the brochure to which reference has been made will itself bring inquiries which <Col N="840" /> then can be followed up by the officers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly it will be used.  If we get the results which appear to justify it, I think I shall have little difficulty in persuading the Minister for Finance to increase the appropriation.  He will certainly look for evidence first that it will be worth while.  It is true that the majority of the important new industries being discussed at present are being sponsored by companies from continental Europe rather than the United States of America.  That in itself is an interesting development.  For that reason we are discussing at the moment measures which might be adopted to extend the campaign or some similar type of campaign to these countries or to Britain when the time appears opportune and the results appear likely to be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to say, arising out of some comments of Deputy McQuillan and others, we are not relying entirely on the outcome of this campaign to secure an extension of industrial activity.  I have always expressed the view that Irish industrial progress would come more generally and more speedily from the extension of the activities of existing Irish concerns rather than the establishment of new concerns by new companies.  It is the aim to ensure that all possibilities will be fully explored.  Deputy McQuillan talked about doing something else first.  We do not have to do anything else first.  We can try to plan our advance on a broad front and hope if we do not succeed on one wing, we will succeed on the other, and that generally the whole economy will move forward as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not presenting this Vote to finance this publicity campaign in <Col N="841" /> America as being the be-all and end-all of industrial policy.  It is only one segment of it.  While I hope it will prove to be an important segment and that substantial benefits will flow from it, nevertheless, its significance in the whole scheme of things should not be exaggerated.</P>
    <P>I would point out also that it does not represent the whole of the effort being made even in that American sector.  The Industrial Development Authority has always been operating there to some extent and this is merely an addition to its activities.  The efforts of the Shannon Airport Development Authority will help to supplement the work of the Industrial Development Authority and certainly should contribute to arousing interest in American business circles in Irish industrial possibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958, for the Salaries and Expenses of the General Valuation and Boundary Survey Office, including certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bulk of the travelling expenses in this Vote is due to the fact that the Valuation Office has to do so much valuation of buildings, inspections and so on throughout the country.  These arise either from requests for re-valuation by authorities or from appeals against valuations.  The Commissioners of Valuation have no control over the number of applications they may receive for re-valuation or the number of appeals they may receive against valuations.  It cannot, therefore, <Col N="842" /> be ascertained exactly what the number of these will be.  Applications for re-valuation have to be in early in April and the appeals early in July, but these Estimates have to be prepared early in November and it is therefore impossible to make a firm estimate.</P>
    <P>The number to be dealt with this year was greater than the number anticipated and therefore the amount of travelling expenses was greater by about £500.  There are savings under other sub-heads which leaves me in the position that I have to ask the Dáil for only £10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Wherever one travels in this country at the present time, there is to be found proof of the need for this Supplementary Estimate.  I think it is generally accepted that there has been more revision of the valuations of buildings throughout the country in the past year than there has been for a very long time.  Certainly that is the position in relation to my own constituency, and I have been told that it is the same in other constituencies.  In case the Minister has any doubt in the matter, I am one of the people who have been hit in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does seem to me to be somewhat absurd that, at a time when we are doing our utmost to ensure that people will spend money on keeping buildings in proper repair and on modernising business premises, on making the countryside and the towns generally attractive to tourists, nobody can do the slightest little thing to improve his premises in the smallest degree without having an immediate descent on him for revaluation purposes.  That is a deterrent to progress and improvement and it is a feature of our life <Col N="843" /> that will have to be tackled by someone at some stage.</P>
    <P>The general method by which the Valuation Office operates is one that must be considered.  I want to make it perfectly clear that, in saying that, I am not criticising in any way the valuers or inspectors, or whatever they call themselves, but I do know that there is very considerable delay in completing valuations for certain purposes. There is the verification of estate duty valuation, on the one hand, and stamp duty valuation, on the other.  Both of these have got into a system from which it is not feasible to get the results for the taxpayer as quickly as they should be got.</P>
    <P>I think that arises because of the system by which valuers go to certain parts of the country only at certain fixed times of the year.  I know it is difficult to map out the valuers' work so as to get the best results and at the same time to avoid having the valuers crossing and re-crossing their own tracks.  I know that the officials are, at all times, anxious to facilitate as best they can in relation to an urgent request, but the general run of the system is not all that it should be.  I want to take this opportunity of asking the Minister to see that something be done to correct it.</P>
    <P>I assume that the increase of £500 arises because of the necessity to increase the subsistence allowances, owing to the Budget of last year.  If I am correct in that, I need not say anything more on it, as my views are already well known and I expressed them here some time ago.  If it is the position in the current year that we wanted £13,200, and the trend is going up all around the country, as I believe it is from what I hear, and that more and more valuations are being made, it is rather extraordinary that for the next year the Minister is asking for less than the revised Estimate here.  However, that is a matter which we will discuss when we come to deal with the 1958-59 Estimates.</P>

      <P>There are many people in the country who are very disturbed at the present time about the activities of the Valuation Office officials <Col N="844" /> throughout the country.  I believe that they are putting a premium on progress and I cannot see why the Valuation Office should interfere when a man improves his holding.  It is a handicap on progress.  I was speaking to a farmer last night who had just received a notice that his valuation was to be increased by £6 5s.  He bought that land eight or ten years ago and spent quite a lot of money on bringing the holding up to the most modern standard.  Now, this is to be the reward for his industry.  He was quite annoyed that this thing should happen to him in a free country.</P>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister for Finance how many of these officials are abroad through the country at the present moment, inspecting farms and business holdings. I had a case the other day of three people who live in non-municipal houses in a small village in Cork.  The houses are now vested in them and they have had notification from the Valuation Office recently that their valuations have been increased enormously compared with what they were previously on their holdings.  I think that something should be done to curb the activities of the Valuation Office. The people who are faced with this sort of thing are very slow to carry out improvements, because, if they do so, they will immediately be visited by the officials and their valuations increased.</P>

      <P>In regard to Deputy Sweetman's point that the number has been increased&mdash;it has been slightly increased, I agree.  As a matter of fact, the number is fairly high.  Revisions of valuation in this last year numbered 43,600 compared with 43,800 the year before.  Appeals were up from 4,400 to 4,800, so that the number between revisions and appeals really did not amount to very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Manley's point, I am afraid he cannot blame the officers of the Valuation Department: they go only on request and make a report, according to the law.  It is the law that is probably to blame.  I mean by that, that if Deputy Manley thinks the system is wrong, it is the law that must be changed not the activities of <Col N="845" /> the Valuation Office.  To change the law is a very big matter and one which should get full consideration.</P>

      <P>I think if one examined the matter one would find that it is logical, so long as we have this system of valuation.  The old principle, laid down 100 years ago, was the letting value at that time, which is not the letting value now.  I think it is now based on the valuation at the time. That has grown up as a sort of system, and under that system or the policy built up under that, if a house is improved, then logically the valuation must go up.  If the Dáil wishes to do so, let us change the law, but, so long as it is there, we must carry it out.</P>
      <P>I want to say to Deputy Sweetman that the Budget last year was responsible for many things, but not for increased subsistence allowances which were given as a result of the arbitration of 1956.</P>

    <P>Mar is eol don Dáil, bhunaigh Comhdháil Ghinearálta na Náisiún Aontaithe Fórsa Eigeandála na Náisiún Aontaithe i mí na Samhna, 1956, chun deireadh a chur leis an gcogaíocht le linn éigeandála Suez agus maoirseacht a dhéanamh ar na cúrsaí a bhain leis. Mar gheall ar an meanma achrainn a mhaireas ó shoin i leith sa limistéir sin is gá an Fórsa seo a choinneáil ar an láthair d'fhonn ord a choimeád.</P>
    <P>Aontaímid go léir nach le neart ba chóir fadhbanna eadarnáisiúnta a réiteach ach le riail dlí.  Má tá an dlí le bheith i réim, áfach, ní mór gléas a bheith ann chun feidhm a thabhairt dó. D'fhéadfadh Fórsa Éigeandála na Náisiún Aontaithe bheith ina ghléas chuige sin.</P>
    <P>I gComhdháil na Náisiún Aontaithe an Meán-Fhómhair seo caite, tharla agam gur mholas go mbeadh fórsa iniúchta de chuid na Náisiún Aontaithe ann chun go gcuirfí i bhfeidhm, i rith idirthréimhsí, na beartais a ceapadh le haghaidh réiteach na gcrua-cheisteanna críche is measa atá os comhair an domhain faoi láthair; agus an tSamhain seo caite, sa díospóireacht sa Tigh seo i dtaobh beartais choigríche, chuireas in iúl athuair mo mhuinín sa togra réitigh seo, agus d'áiríos roinnt samplaí inar cuireadh i bhfeidhm é le dea-thoradh.</P>

Dá bhrí sin, measaim go bhfuil lucht síochána faoi chomaoin acu sin a mhol go gcuirfí an fórsa seo ar fáil agus a chuir ar bun é.  Tá ár mór-bhuíochas ag dul freisin do na hoifigigh agus do na fir as na tíortha éagsúla atá sa bhFórsa, as ucht a n-araíonacht chumasach agus a ndílseacht do bharrshamhla na Náisiún Aontaithe.

    <P>An uair sin, níor bhfeasach cé mhéid a hiarrfaí orainn a ranníoc ina dhiaidh sin agus, dá bhrí sin, níor bhféidir suim airgid a chur sna meastacháin ghinearálta do mo Roinn-se in aghaidh na bliana airgeadais reatha.

Ach mar gheall ar shuimeanna móra a tugadh go toildheonach ar an ocáid seo, ar a n-áirítear íocaíocht an-mhór ó Stáit Aontaithe Mheiriceá&mdash;12 milliún dollaer&mdash;níl dlite dhínn ar fad ach £6,750, cothrom 18,910 dollaer.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The primary occasion for this Bill is to enable county councils, where they so wish, to increase the maximum contribution payable to committees of agriculture for the service of their agricultural schemes to a sum not more than 15 times the produce of a rate of 1d. in the £ in the area consisting of the county, exclusive of any urban districts therein.</P>
      <P>The annual income at present available to each committee of agriculture consists of a contribution from the county council equal to the produce of a rate of not less than 2d. in the £ nor more than 10d. in the £ and a State grant related to the amount of the agricultural rate.</P>
      <P>The existing maximum agricultural rate of 10d. in the £ was fixed under the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1955.  Since the enactment of that Act 11 of the committees have obtained a rate higher than the maximum of 7d. in the £ prescribed before the passing of that Act.  Three of these are in receipt of the present statutory maximum of 10d. in the £, while two are in receipt of a rate of 9½d. and 9d. in the £, respectively.  The increased expenditure of committees of agriculture in recent years has been largely due to the expansion of their agricultural advisory services resulting in the number of advisory officers in the employment of the county committees being increased from 185 in 1948 to 312 in 1958.</P>
      <P>It is clear that rising costs will prevent the committees, who are now receiving the existing maximum rate of 10d. in the £ and others who in the meantime will go to that figure, from maintaining their agricultural programmes unless they are enabled to secure a larger income in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed, therefore, to empower county councils, where they so desire, to increase the maximum contribution to committees of agriculture from 10d. in the £ to 1/3 in the £.  I would emphasise, however, that this <Col N="849" /> provision is purely a permissive one. It does not impose any obligation on county councils to increase their contributions to the committees of agriculture. It simply empowers them to do so where they consider such an increase is called for.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken in this Bill to accede to requests from committees of agriculture that they should be put on a par with other local bodies, such as county councils and vocational education committees, by being made bodies corporate.  Corporate bodies normally have the right to acquire and dispose of land, to sue and be sued and to borrow money.  The exercise of the powers to acquire or dispose of land or to borrow money will, however, be subject to the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and to any conditions he may impose.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the retrospective application, where the Minister so desires, of regulations made by him in respect of the salaries and allowances of officers of committees of agriculture, and for enabling the travelling and subsistence allowances payable to members of committees of agriculture in respect of attendance at committee meetings to be brought into line with those of members of county councils.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are simply amendments of existing legislation consequential on the foregoing provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason why this Bill should not be read a Second Time.  There are certain matters upon which I should like to comment.  It is not very long ago since I sponsored legislation here to authorise county councils to raise a maximum rate of 10d. instead of the then 7d.  Now it is proposed to extend that permission to 15d.  As the Minister says, this is purely a permissive power.  No county council need do it if they do not want to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing in mind the staggering burden of the rates on people who own land in rural Ireland and, worse still, <Col N="850" /> on people who have agricultural holdings in Ireland, one cannot help feeling some degree of alarm at the prospect of a further increase, even if it is only 5d. in the £.  Nevertheless, in this case at least there is the consolation that, if there is an increase, it will be used in the service of agriculture.  In that connection I should like to raise this matter.</P>
    <P>Much of the additional funds raised by county committees, either through the rate or the supplementary agricultural grant, in recent years has been devoted to multiplying the number of agricultural structures.  That would be a good thing provided we were satisfied that the agricultural advisory service, as at present organised, was giving us the best value.  I do not think it is. I believe it is a matter of urgent importance that we should arrive at a stage where there would be available in every rural parish in Ireland one competent agricultural adviser for those farmers who desire to avail of his services.</P>
    <P>My experience has been that where that is made available every farmer ultimately seeks to avail of those services. I think that to realise that ideal immediately would be, perhaps, too ambitious.  I would be quite content with an interim measure, if we could arrive at a point where there was an adequate advisory service available to every group of three parishes.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question as to whether existing advisory services are adequately organised.  There are many counties in Ireland in which the direct responsibility of the agricultural adviser is unduly scattered.  He has not any particular territory for which he is personally responsible.  The result is one gets the feeling that a great deal of his time is spent sailing around and filling up his diary whereas, if he had a restricted area for which he was personally responsible to the chief agricultural officer of the county, it would be very much easier to observe what success attended these efforts and, what is even more important, a zealous and effective agricultural adviser would have the personal gratification of seeing the results of his labour in a limited <Col N="851" /> area for which he was exclusively responsible.  I tried to give effect to that by the provision of parish agents in those areas where there were not sufficient advisory services available from the county committees of agriculture. I believe about 20 such parish agents were functioning, when I left office, directly under the supervision of a senior inspector of the Department of Agriculture.  As I have often said, I would be quite prepared to have the result of that service judged not by the result in the best of the groups of three parishes served by it, but by the results in the least successful group and, even there, I believe results would be found which abundantly justify whatever cost was involved.</P>
    <P>I do not think it very much matters whether the agricultural advisory service is provided directly by the Department of Agriculture or by the county committees of agriculture, as a general rule.  However, there are some county committees of agriculture in this country grossly inefficient and constituted very largely of persons who have no real interest whatsoever in the agricultural industry.  Unless that is remedied, sooner or later, I think the whole present system of county committees of agriculture will be called very earnestly in question by the farmers.</P>
    <P>At first glance, the obvious and simple reform would appear to be to provide that nobody would be eligible for appointment to a county committee of agriculture but a farmer.  However, when you try to apply that formula, it is not as simple as it at first appears. I cannot see why an agricultural worker should not be eligible.  Then there are other categories of persons in rural Ireland who might have a very real interest in agriculture and be eminently fitted to make a useful contribution to the deliberations of a county committee of agriculture who would be excluded, if you simply provided that nobody but a farmer should be eligible for membership.</P>
    <P>It seems perfectly clear to me that, as we increase the field of activity of the county committees of agriculture, we ought to concern ourselves to <Col N="852" /> ensure that they will be more properly representative of the interest they are charged to help in their capacity as the county committee of agriculture.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister for Agriculture if he proposes to provide further facilities by way of the parish plan as operated by the Department, or whether he proposes, under his general powers of approving or disapproving of schemes submitted by county committees of agriculture, to urge on these committees that there should be some system in their advisory services analogous to the procedure operated by the parish plan under the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I think he should be prepared to do both: (i) to expand the services available under the parish plan operated by the Department and (ii) to use his influence in so far as is reasonable to urge the county committees of agriculture to operate their advisory services on the same model.  It is right to say that certain of the county committees are at present operating that system, I think, with a high degree of success. The example of the parish plan operated by the Department of Agriculture and of the parish plan as operated by certain of the committees is quite ample justification, I think, for the Minister in pressing the development of this system of advisory services on the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>In regard to the incorporation of the county committees of agriculture, I think that is a proper step.  If my recollection serves me right, the decision to take it was made some considerable time ago.  I am not quite clear, and I do not think the Minister has made it adequately clear, what the purpose of Section 6 is, that is, the section which says that regulations under Section 27 or Section 28 of the Principal Act may, if so expressed, have retrospective effect.  The Minister might have told us into what category those regulations fall.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It concerns the payment of proposed increases of salaries that might be influenced or affected by improvements in the standards of, say, civil servants.  In many cases, the employees of local bodies have to wait for the determination of the higher <Col N="853" /> level.  They will, therefore, be entitled to reward as from a date earlier than it would be possible to give them that award.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is designed to give the committee power to pay in retrospect, so as to bring them in line with officials of similar status in the other services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the purpose, then I think it is a proper purpose. Generally, I think, the conferring of retrospective powers of this character on the Minister is a source of great embarrassment to him.  It is a very much easier position, certainly for a Minister who is required to pass a final judgment on these things, to be able to say: &ldquo;I have no power; all I have is power to approve as from the date submitted to me.&rdquo;  Otherwise, you are liable to get applications to approve retrospectively all sorts of things which should not be approved.</P>

      <P>I agree.  If this is no more than bringing county committees of agriculture into line with other analogous bodies, I do not think there can be reasonable opposition.  I take it that Section 7 is for the same thing &mdash;to bring it into line with the vocational education committee.  I accept the Minister's word that the consequential amendments on Section 8 arise on the other adjustments made. In these circumstances, I think the House can very well give this Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a farmer.  I listened with interest to what Deputy Dillon had to say with regard to the <Col N="854" /> types of people who should comprise committees of agriculture.  I am a member of the Louth County Committee of Agriculture.  Representing, as I do, a rural constituency, I must, of necessity, interest myself in agriculture.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to what the Minister had to say by way of explanation of this Bill.  He enlarged a little on his reasons for bringing in Section 2, which increases the maximum amount of contribution which a county council can make to a committee of agriculture.  He said that the maximum rate which county councils are empowered now to pay represents a rate of 10d. in the £, the minimum being 2d.  It is proposed now to increase that to 1/3.  One of the main reasons for these extra powers being given to county councils is that, in recent years, there has been greatly increased expenditure evident as a result of the appointment of many agricultural inspectors throughout the country.  I am not condemning such appointments; I appreciate that they are necessary to further the agricultural drive.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that another reason for this Bill having certain points enshrined in it was the agitation on the part of many agricultural committees.  I agree that their advice should be listened to, but I question&mdash; in a small way, at least&mdash;the wisdom of giving them so much power.  Knowing the position throughout the country with regard to the level of the rates, I am afraid that these additional powers may&mdash;I say &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash; tempt them to shove up the rate still further.  If that happens, the time will come eventually when people, especially farmers, in the various counties will not be able to pay their rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the committees now are to be empowered to purchase lands and to erect buildings, and also even to borrow money.  That will be a source of grave temptation to them, to adopt the attitude that the sky is the limit as regards expenditure.  I trust the Department will continue to carry out the arrangement hitherto pertaining, that is, arranging the recoupment to <Col N="855" /> the amount of 50 per cent. of the local rate.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to most of the sections of this Bill, but did not make any reference at all, as far as I can recall, to sub-section (2) of Section 2, which gives county councils power to donate the produce of a 1/2d. in the £ to local committees of agriculture, in a county where forestry schemes are being implemented.  I observe further that the operative word is &ldquo;shall&rdquo;&mdash; that the county council shall make this contribution.  I am wondering if this is an attempt on the part of the Government to shelve some of its responsibility and throw some of its financial burdens on to the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The sub-section is qualified by the insertion of the words &ldquo;if so required by the Minister,&rdquo; but I am sure that, in these days of stringency, the Minister always will require that such be paid in counties where afforestation schemes are being implemented.  I am suspicious of it and I have a feeling that, some day recently, the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Agriculture, got their heads together and decided to insert this in the Bill, as it obviously is a move to reduce the financial burden on the Government with regard to afforestation in general.</P>
    <P>I agree that afforestation is very important.  In my own county, there are two or three schemes pending and we are waiting anxiously for them to start.  Now it seems that, when they start, we are to be presented with a local bill for them.  Afforestation is a national undertaking and afforestation in general should be a Government concern, as it is the nation as a whole which will benefit from the eventual fruition of these schemes.  In conclusion, I would like the Minister in his reply to enlarge on sub-section (2) of Section 2, which relates to forestry schemes in particular counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill may be described as an enabling Bill, giving power to committees of agriculture to commit the county council up to 1/3, instead of the present 10d.  While we have this Bill before us, we had better discuss the merits of the system under <Col N="856" /> which the committees of agriculture operate at present.  The first question I would put to the Minister is this: Are the farmers satisfied with the manner in which the committees function? Are they satisfied with the services available to them through these committees? Is it not a fact that the committees concentrate mostly on horticultural activities, such as the science of growing vegetables, particularly in market gardening, in addition to the science of growing various types of plants, and carrying out certain tests in relation to seeds?</P>
      <P>Any of us familiar with the set-up of these committees of agriculture must admit that they are not set up in the best interests of agriculture.  They are set up through the county councils. On them, a certain number of councillors must be appointed.  It does not matter whether these councillors are farmers or non-farmers&mdash;they can be nominated to function on the committee of agriculture.  In fact, I believe there would be a majority of council members on any such committee. The remaining members are co-opted and it is not specified that the persons co-opted shall be engaged in agriculture or know anything about it.</P>
      <P>When the committee is set up, the various activities come before them, usually monthly.  They have different programmes in operation according to the staff they have employed and the purposes for which those persons have been appointed.  Usually, there are horticultural instructors and they are allocated to various districts in the county.  They are available to give advice to people who wish to learn something about the growing of any particular crop.  They also give advice on the growing of flowers such as roses and shrubs and trees, and the pruning of these shrubs and trees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These services are available in general to the public through the committees of agriculture.  The services of these people can be got by interested persons making application to the county council or committee of agriculture for them.  The result is that the agricultural officer will visit any person who is interested in any aspect of the <Col N="857" /> activities for which these services are available.  The adviser visits these people and he follows up the advice he has given and the work being done in a particular garden, field or farm. These services are given by the officers of the committee in relation to such things as experimental plots where the yield of a particular crop can be tested, and in relation to experimental crops where varieties of seeds can be tested by these officers and advice given to the interested person.</P>
    <P>There is also the scheme whereby trees are available to persons desiring to plant them and they have the advice of these instructors regarding the variety of trees to be planted.  People desiring to plant fruit trees can consult these advisers regarding the variety of fruit tree it will be best to plant.  These officers also engage in organising ploughing competitions in these counties and, on the other side of the scale, there are poultry instructresses who will advise people engaged in the poultry business.  Similarly, there are grants available for pedigree cattle, horses and pigs.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are grants available to people who are prepared to hire out certain types of machinery in districts where they reside to persons desiring to use such machinery.  There is also the soil testing service whereby persons desiring to know about the condition of the soil in a particular garden or field can have it tested by the committee of agriculture.  I have mentioned this matter so that we can have a picture of the services available through these committees, and the question I am inclined to put is whether in fact they contribute substantially to the welfare and economy of agriculture?  I feel there should be greater emphasis on the live-stock side of the advisory services available through these committees.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is wandering away from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with you, Sir, because this Bill seeks power to increase the maximum of 10d. up to a maximum of 15d. and everything that the 10d. already covered can be <Col N="858" /> discussed under this Bill.  I feel that while these committees are helpful to people desiring to have technical advice in relation to the various activities I have mentioned, there is an opportunity there for them to engage in a more profitable type of advisory service, which they could make available to the farming community, relating to cattle, pigs, sheep and poultry which are the backbone of our national economy, particularly in regard to the value of our exports.</P>
      <P>The other services appear to be of a domestic nature and do not contribute substantially to the national economy, apart from, perhaps, fruit growing.  On that score, I should like to mention that, unfortunately, we are very far behind in relation to fruit growing.  For several months of the year, it is necessary for us to import apples when, in fact, we have plenty of land in every county where we could have large orchards established, thus cutting out the need for the importation of apples which exists for a number of months each year.</P>
      <P>I feel that these committees could engage to the profit of the farmer in the operation of a pig progeny scheme and also a cow testing scheme, operated independently of the committees of agriculture, and which would improve the existing system of milk production. This Bill gives us an opportunity to consider again whether the committees of agriculture, as they are set up, and the services which they give, are justified and whether in fact they can be improved or ought to be replaced.  The committees of agriculture as they stand could be used to greater advantage for the farming community, if they were utilised to operate a parish plan in an intensive manner in every county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen examples of the advantages which the farming community can gain from a concentrated effort in a parish in relation to all the activities on the land.  Through these committees of agriculture, a vigorous parish plan should be operated and, if it were operated, we would have in addition to the advisory services presently available, the advantages which a parish plan would bring to the community in general, by improving the <Col N="859" /> quality of our live stock and our system of farming in various areas.</P>
    <P>I feel that the farmers themselves are not satisfied with the services available to them through these committees. They are waiting for a lead to be given by the Minister and the Department of Agriculture to ensure that these committees will be used as a jumping-off ground from which much better services will be made available to the farmers in general.  Much of the time of the agricultural advisers, and of the travelling expenses paid to them, are taken up to a great extent by people who have a fad for the growing of one variety or another of either vegetables or fruit.  These services are not availed of to a proper extent by the ordinary farmers who are aware that the services are available to them in relation to these testing schemes.  If it were made known to the farmers that still greater services could be made available to them by these agricultural advisers, they would avail of them.  Instead of that, it is unfortunately a lot of people who have a hobby of some kind or other who are demanding the services of these technical officers.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, if we examine the figures for these various committees of agriculture, we will see there is a greater amount of money spent on salaries and travelling expenses for these officers than there is on grants towards the various schemes operated by those committees whether they be fruit growing schemes, grants for machinery or grants for pedigree animals and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just one brief word to say to the Minister.  I want to take this opportunity of saying that the method by which agricultural officers are appointed at the moment is something that should be looked into.  These graduates who come from college, having successfully passed their examinations and having put their families to the very heavy expense involved in getting them through college, have now to go through a campaign of canvassing which can only be compared with that <Col N="860" /> which people seeking election to the Seanad go through.</P>
      <P>It is terrible that these men are not appointed to these positions in the same way as other officers of local authorities, either by the Appointments Commission or by a board set up under the local authority.  I consider that the method by which they are now appointed is a case of who you know and not what you know.  The fact that some of these boys have to undergo thousands of miles&mdash;and I am not exaggerating&mdash;travelling around, haunting the doors of members of committees of agriculture and bringing every conceivable pressure to bear on members of committees of agriculture, is an extraordinary state of affairs.</P>
      <P>To visit any county council chamber even preparatory to the creation of vacancies and to see these lads having to bring relatives, clergymen, creamery managers and all kinds of influential people to haunt the members of committees of agriculture is to witness an awful procedure, and I would ask the Minister to look into it.  When these lads have successfully got through their examinations, they should not have to resort to this kind of canvassing but should go forward to the Appointments Commission or some such body which will impartially judge them on their individual merits, not on who they know but rather on what they know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker made reference to the appointment of agricultural instructors.  We all know what happens when it comes to an appointment like that.  We all vote one way or another.  This complaint refers to temporary appointments only.  Permanent appointments are always made from above.  The last Deputy should not make statements of that kind.  I think he fought a very hard campaign in his own constituency to get a friend of his own appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rooney commented on the amount of money spent in regard to the growing of apples, etc.  Surely we have appointed people to look into those matters and they have done fairly well.  There was also the complaint that we were not giving sufficient <Col N="861" /> encouragement to cattle breeding associations.  My experience of my own committee is that we have given grants both to cow testing and cattle breeding associations.  It is amazing to see Deputies getting up and speaking as if these things were not being looked after.</P>
    <P>Some members made great capital out of the proposal to give local committees power to increase their rate from 10d. to 1/3.  There is no farmer who will agree to put up the rates by 3d. or 4d.  I do not know if our committee are at their maximum rate yet. If you increase your rate you will hit the farmer, the man for whom you want to cater.  Deputy Dillon referred to certain members on committees who had no knowledge whatever of agriculture. Perhaps they have not, but they may represent a rural area and have experience of what the people want to grow and know how they can help them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney said we were wasting a lot of money on salaries and travelling expenses.  If we want instructors to do their jobs, they should be enabled to travel around, meet the farmers and give them advice.  In our area we established offices in certain towns where the farmers can go in and meet those people.  They are doing a very good job.  We appointed these officers under the parish plan.  Certain committees may have objected to it but our committee was not one of them. These officers have done very good work.  In regard to Deputy O'Sullivan's remarks about college graduates, every one is entitled to have his own views and to vote whatever way he likes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how Deputy O'Sullivan came to conclude that permanent appointments to the committees of agriculture were made on the basis&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, temporary appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very necessary to make that clear for the purpose of the record.  For many years all appointments have been made through the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission.  I suppose cases arise <Col N="862" /> where temporary appointments have to be made.  I know of no other way in which a temporary appointment can be made except by the committee itself. I do not know whether there is in it the objection Deputy O'Sullivan mentions. Some of these young men&mdash;and young ladies, too&mdash;are anxious to get their feet in and naturally busy themselves to secure a temporary appointment even for six or 12 months because the work will give them experience. When there are more people qualified than there are vacancies, there is bound to be a bit of effort in order to get a place.  I know of no means of eliminating the practice.  Whether or not it is desirable that it should be eliminating the practice.  Whether or not it is desirable that it should be eliminated, I cannot say.  If the Department succeeded in finding some other method, without having examined it I would find myself in grave doubt as to whether it would be any better.</P>
      <P>I am invited to discuss the whole matter of the composition of committees of agriculture, their personnel and the method by which these committees are brought into being.  As far as I know, the last named is provided for by law.  I shall not travel over all that field and I do not think I am called upon to do so.</P>
      <P>We all feel for the bodies we ourselves know most intimately.  I know a few county committees and their personnel.  While they might not be completely and absolutely ideal, in the main they are composed of people who have a very close association with agriculture.  I do not think it would be possible to make any amendment of the law that would result in improving the material that goes to make up these committees.  I think that even if they were elected on the same basis as members of county councils the personnel would not change very much.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coburn was in some doubt as to what might be lurking in the back of the mind of the Minister for Agriculture in putting forward these proposals. I made some inquiries as to the number of occasions on which this permissive provision has been revised in the last 30 years or so.  I find that in 1931 it was increased from 2d. to 3d. in the £ and in 1941 from 3d. to 4d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" /> In 1948 it was increased from 4d. to 7d. in the £ and in 1955 from 7d. to 10d. in the £.  All these steps have been taken on the understanding that, where the premier body took advantage of this provision and increased the rate, the State would be committing itself, pound for pound, with the local contribution.  Whatever Deputy Coburn may think of the ideas of the Minister for Lands and myself, the only thought we could have is that if the county council decides to increase the rate, the result would be that the State would have to increase its contribution also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to sub-section (2) of Section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case the Deputy was also on the wrong track because the provision there is to give committees of agriculture power to acquire and power to dispose of.  I have been told that in the case of one county committee of agriculture it is the owner of a forest.  No county committee of agriculture would have been entitled to acquire a forest for themselves but it so happens that this plantation was left to this committee prior to 1931.  It is only right that if a county committee of agriculture is given something free it should also have the right to dispose of that property whenever it thinks fit and proper.  It was not the intention that county committees should be empowered to go into ordinary business in forestry, if that is what Deputy Coburn had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely sub-section (2) gives them a mandatory power to make a halfpenny rate available whenever they think right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That right was provided in the 1931 Act but it was never used in that sense or for that purpose.  The sub-section to which the Deputy referred is a clarification of that position. I am talking about the over-all position of forestry and its relation to the county committees of agriculture.  The sub-section to which the Deputy refers is a different matter entirely.  The Act of 1931 made provision for the striking of a rate of a ½d. in the £ for forestry <Col N="864" /> purposes and this has something to do with the clarification of that matter in which I am not too well versed.</P>
      <P>I have the same views as have been expressed here in relation to the rate position all over the country.  There is no doubt that local rates have been rising and have now reached the stage where people are crying out, and not without good reason.  It is because of that that I was hesitant about introducing a Bill such as this at a time like this.  Every time, down the years, that this permissive provision was increased the county committees of agriculture succeeded in inducing their parent bodies to push the rate along until the maximum was reached in a short space of time.  It may be that that will not be so easy in the years ahead because of the rate position in general.</P>
      <P>However, it is a permissive matter and the local committees have been asking for it.  Three of them have already reached the maximum allowed by law, and two others are very close to it.  They have been asking the Department to amend the law so as to enable them to get additional money and that being the case I do not see how we could oppose them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not my intention to go into the question of the services rendered by the officials of these committees.  I am conscious of the fact that outside officials employed, not only by local authorities but by State Departments, are not easy to watch.  It is not easy to control their activities so as to see that value is being received for the money spent.  A great deal depends on the extent to which there is public demand for their activities and help.  If the public do not make use of their assistance, whether they are employed by county committees or are parish agents, you are not going to get good value for the money spent upon them. I think that, by and large, there is that demand for their services and I hope it is on the increase.  Let us hope it will continue to increase because there is nothing so demoralising as the provision of money for the employment of technicians who are running about the country and are not applying their knowledge and doing the work they are supposed to do.  I <Col N="865" /> do not think there is any matter on which I want to say anything further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £4,139,040 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, for the Defence Forces (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Act, 1954 (No. 18 of 1954), and for certain administrative expenses in connection therewith; for certain expenses under the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 <Col N="866" /> and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946 (No. 21 of 1939 and No. 28 of 1946); for Expenses in connection with the issue of medals, etc.; and for a Grant-in-Aid of the Irish Red Cross Society (No. 32 of 1938).</P>
    <P>The gross Estimate for 1958-59 is £6,418,250 and the net Estimate, after deducting Appropriations-in-Aid, is £6,208,560.  There is an increase of £37,340 on the net Estimate for 1957-58. It may be recalled that the latter Estimate showed a reduction of nearly £900,000 on the figure for the preceding year.  It will be apparent, therefore, that the Estimate now before the House has been prepared against the prevailing background of financial stringency.  Every item has been carefully considered and weighed against the pressing need for economy on the one hand and the maintenance of an efficient defence force on the other, and I believe that this Estimate strikes a fair balance between the two. Admittedly there is is a modest increase, but we have to provide for certain increased costs of a fairly substantial nature which were not in evidence when the previous Estimate was prepared.  Also, this Estimate provides for an additional 250 men at a cost of about £55,000.  I shall refer in greater detail to this matter later.</P>
    <P>The major portion of the Estimate is accounted for by provision for the pay, allowances and maintenance of the permanent Defence Force.  This provision is spread over a number of sub-heads and totals, in round figures, £4,000,000 or about 62 per cent. of the entire gross Estimate.  As in previous years, the Estimate for the permanent Defence Force is framed on the basis of the full peace establishment, that is 1,334 officers and 11,864 men.  Deductions are made in the relevant sub-heads in respect of the numbers by which the actual strength during the year is likely to be below the establishment. This Estimate, in effect, caters for a net average strength of 1,153 officers, 40 cadets and 7,500 men (including all Corps and Services).  As compared with the approximate average strength maintained during 1957-58, these figures show a reduction <Col N="867" /> of 21 officers and 13 cadets and an increase of 250 men.</P>
    <P>The reduction in officers is due mainly to the retirement of a number of officers with I.R.A. service medals following the enactment of the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) (No. 2) Scheme, 1957, which was discussed and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas last year.  As regards the increased number of men provided for, it was found that the provision for last year only enabled the strength to be kept at a level barely sufficient for the essential day-to-day tasks of the Army. This has imposed a considerable strain on the personnel, which if continued might prove harmful to morals and efficiency.  The opening of an internment camp last year and the situation along the Border have also made greater demands on the number of troops available.</P>
    <P>It has been decided, therefore, to maintain an average strength of 7,500 men during 1958-59.  This is considered to be the minimum number that will afford the necessary relief to hard-pressed personnel.  The strength at the end of February stood at 6,950 noncommissioned officers, privates and seamen.  A recruiting campaign has already been started with the object of securing the required number of recruits as quickly as possible and I would like to ask Deputies to lend their full support to this campaign.</P>
    <P>Taking the sub-heads individually, I will deal first of all with those that show appreciable increases.</P>
    <P>As regards sub-head A&mdash;Pay of Officers, Cadets, N.C.O.s and Privates &mdash;there is an increase of approximately £37,000 for &ldquo;Pay of Other Ranks&rdquo; due mainly to provision being made for the extra 250 men I have just mentioned. Against this increase, however, there is a reduction of over £34,000 in respect of the pay of officers and cadets.</P>
    <P>For convenience, sub-head C&mdash;Pay of Civilians attached to Units&mdash;and sub-head S&mdash;Barrack Maintenance and New Works&mdash;may be taken together. Between them there is an increase of approximately £15,000.  Provision is made in sub-head C for the employment of 30 additional employees with <Col N="868" /> the Corps of Engineers.  This increase is necessary in order to carry out the programme of maintenance and new works for which the materials are provided in sub-head S.  It was necessary to give this programme careful consideration in view of the financial position and only works which are strictly essential have been included.  It would obviously be false economy to try to save on maintenance.</P>
    <P>As regards the new works which are provided for, the vast majority of these are relatively small and most of them are directly concerned with improving the living conditions for the troops.  This is in continuation of a policy that successive Ministers for Defence have pursued.  I would like to be able to do much more in this direction, but unfortunately this is not possible for the time being.  I am glad to be able to say, however, that in 1958-59 we hope to start work on a housing scheme for married soldiers at Collins Barracks, Cork.  Negotiations are nearing completion for the purchase of a site near the barracks and it is intended to build 24 houses.  A communal laundry and bathhouse will be provided for the occupants of the married quarters at Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick.  Work on the initial stages of a new dining hall and cookhouse for men at Customs Barracks, Athlone, and a gymnasium at the Curragh has been commenced and this Estimate makes provision for the continuation of these projects.</P>
    <P>The increase of £7,373 in sub-head E &mdash;Pay of Officers of the Medical Corps, etc.&mdash;is due to the fact that there will not be so many unfilled vacancies in the corps during 1958-59.  There is an increase of £12,047 in sub-head G for subsistence allowances for all ranks. Increased rates of allowances were approved recently following similar increases granted to other public servants.</P>
    <P>The largest increase of any sub-head occurs in sub-head K&mdash;Provisions and Allowances in lieu&mdash;which is up by £62,732.  This is due to a number of factors, namely, the larger number of men to be catered for, the higher cost of foodstuffs following the removal of subsidies last year; and an increase of <Col N="869" /> £10,000 in respect of supplies purchased for issue on repayment.  In regard to the last mentioned item, there is, of course, a corresponding increase in receipts under Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head O&mdash;General Stores&mdash; the increase of £22,159 is due mainly to provision for the purchase of four elementary training aircraft and one general purposes aircraft.  These are of the piston-engine type and will cost about £38,000.  They are essential for carrying out the training programme for regular and reserve pilots and to continue the short service training scheme by means of which pilots are provided for the Air Corps Reserve and for Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The amount of £51,567 provided under sub-head P (1)&mdash;Civil Defence&mdash; shows an increase of £8,485 over the provision for 1957-58.  The two main items are Grants to Local Authorities and Equipment and Stores.  Grants to Local Authorities account for £25,067, an increase of £1,610 over last year. Those grants include contributions towards the cost of civil defence administration by local authorities, towards the cost of uniform for civil defence volunteers and towards the servicing, maintenance and storage of equipment issued to local authorities. The provision of £27,200 for the purchase and maintenance of equipment and stores represents an increase of £6,875 as compared with last year's provision.  This increase is mainly attributable to proposed increased purchases of equipment, especially for welfare, fire-fighting and rescue training.</P>
    <P>The recruiting campaign for civil defence during the past year has, an initial effort, been reasonably satisfactory. In some counties the response has been very good.  About 3,000 men and women have enrolled in the organisation throughout the State and upwards of 2,000 of them have been undergoing instruction given by local authority civil defence instructors. There is now the nucleus of a civil defence organisation in most counties. This represents definite progress but a much greater effort on the part of the people must be made.  I would ask all members of local authorities and particularly <Col N="870" /> those who are members of this House to take a greater interest in civil defence in their local authority areas and encourage people to join it. Civil defence is an inescapable obligation of every country and needs the encouragement of the public representatives belonging to the local authorities which have a statutory duty to promote it.</P>
    <P>I need not repeat what I said last year regarding the object of the recruiting campaign, but I do wish to assure the House that nothing has happened since then to lessen the need for a civil defence organisation as part of the national defence of the State. In some respect, the potential hazards are increasing as a result of the continuous development of new types of missiles.</P>
    <P>The increase of £24,090 in sub-head P.2&mdash;Naval Service&mdash;is attributable mainly to an increase in the cost of fuel oil for the corvettes and to the proposed purchase of a quantity of ammunition for the guns of those vessels.  Fuel oil is now costing nearly £3 a ton more than when the 1957-58 Estimate was prepared.  It is not practicable to offset this increase by reducing consumption as has been done in the case of petrol for mechanical transport.  The stock of ammunition is now very low and replenishment cannot be deferred any longer.  I may mention that one of the corvettes has undergone a major overhaul, and has been put into a thoroughly seaworthy condition.  Work on the second corvette is in hands at present, and this Estimate contains provision for the overhaul of the remaining corvette. The provision for the pay of personnel of the Naval Service remains practically unchanged at £97,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>It has been found necessary to increase the provision under sub-head R for fuel, light and water by £18,599. This is due mainly to the higher charges for electricity which became operative some time ago and to increased consumption of electricity.  The provision of improved living conditions and amenities for personnel to which I referred earlier has necessarily made increased demands on this sub-head. <Col N="871" /> The consumption of solid fuel, electricity, etc., is being closely watched and no opportunity is lost of impressing on all concerned the necessity for strict economy.</P>
    <P>In sub-head X&mdash;Incidental Expenses &mdash;the provision of £19,000 for advertisements shows an increase of £9,000 over the provision for 1957-58.  Ordinary departmental advertising will absorb about £2,000 and £17,000 is required for recruiting advertisements for the Army and Civil Defence.  I hope we will be able to achieve our targets without having to expend the full amount, but as the building up of both these forces is an urgent task, it is necessary to make fairly substantial provision.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in sub-head X (3) for a payment of £15,450 to the Irish Red Cross Society by way of a Grant-in-Aid. This is an increase of £1,000 over the provision for 1957-58 and includes a sum of £5,000 approximately for the maintenance of a group of White Russian refugees which the society has agreed to receive and look after.  Some time ago the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees appealed to this and other countries to take some of the 15,000 White Russian refugees in North China.  Arrangements have been completed under which the Irish Red Cross Society will take up to 20 at a time on behalf of this country.  The arrangements provide for the grant to the society of 20,000 dollars by the High Commissioner for Refugees for the purchase and equipment of a premises to house the refugees, the society to become the owner of the premises on arrival of the first batch of refugees.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed to indemnify the society to the extent of not more than £5,000 a year in respect of the cost of maintaining the refugees in this country.  Suitable premises have been purchased and fitted out and the first batch of seven refugees arrived last November.  It is not known at the moment when the other 13 will arrive.  The society continues to look after the Hungarian refugees at <Col N="872" /> Knockalisheen Camp and to bear the maintenance costs from the special fund created by the generous subscriptions of the Irish people.  The society is to be highly commended for its activities and deserves every help and encouragement.</P>
    <P>In sub-head Y (2)&mdash;the Reserve Defence Force&mdash;the provisions for the Reserve of Officers&mdash;First Line and the Reserve of Men&mdash;First Line are substantially the same as those in the 1957-58 Estimate.  In the case of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiuil and An Slua Muiri there is a net increase of £12,805. This is mainly due to an increase of £21,000 in respect of clothing.  In 1957-58, we had available certain stocks of clothing and consequently the provision for new purchases was rather low.  These stocks are now exhausted. The increase, however, is partly offset by a saving on pay and rations resulting from revised training arrangements. The attendance of the Reserve at training during 1957 was well up to the standard of previous years.</P>
    <P>Lastly, there is a regrettable but unavoidable increase of nearly £17,000 in sub-head AA&mdash;Expenses in connection with the Offences Against the State Acts.  Deputies will be already aware of the reason for this and it is hardly necessary for me to go into any detail.</P>
    <P>Turning to the sub-heads that show reductions, I think that only sub-head P&mdash;Defensive Equipment&mdash;where there is a reduction of £164,134 calls for special mention.  While full mobilisation stocks have not yet been built up, fairly substantial quantities of weapons have been procured and the Army is now moderately well equipped with the lighter types of armament which are unlikely to be superseded in the near future.  With this in mind and having regard to the present financial situation, I felt that this sub-head could bear a substantial cut and that we should try to do with a provision of just over £60,000 for 1958-59.  An appreciable part of this sum is for maintenance.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that no provision has been made for the Bureau of Military History.  The bureau was wound up on 31st December last, but a small <Col N="873" /> office staff is being kept on for the present to deal with outstanding matters and to prepare the archives for storing away.  Provision for this staff is made in sub-head Y&mdash;Office of the Minister for Defence&mdash;for a period of nine months only, as it is expected that the work will be completed by 31st December next.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank all who contributed to the work of the bureau. They will be gratefully remembered in years to come by historians of the struggle for independence.  I should also like to appeal to those, who are in a position to make important contributions and who have not yet done so, to lose no further time in preparing or completing their statements, so that as complete a record as possible may be available for the future historians.</P>
    <P>The reduction of £16,506 in Appropriations-in-Aid may call for some comment. The main items affected are sale of surplus land and sale of surplus stores and unserviceable clothing which show reductions of £10,700 and £10,000 respectively.  In 1957-58, there were two fairly large areas of land for disposal at Baldonnel and Tallaght and it was assumed that both would be disposed of before 31st March, 1958.  The Baldonnel lands have been transferred to the Land Commission.  The disposal of the Tallaght lands, however, has taken longer than was expected, but is likely to be completed during 1958-59 and the anticipated receipt has been taken account of accordingly.  As regards the sale of surplus stores, and so on, the quantities available for disposal are diminishing, but I shall make every effort to obtain the maximum revenue from this source.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to pay tribute to the loyal and efficient manner in which the Army has discharged its duties during the past year, which was a particularly difficult one and made great demands on the personnel of all ranks.  If there are any matters on which Deputies require additional information, I shall do my best to supply it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>For a great number of years, I have had the desire&mdash;<Col N="874" /> and I must say that when the Government Party were in Opposition, they co-operated to some extent with me in this&mdash;to take the Army out of the arena of political controversy.  I am glad to say that I think we have achieved that to a very great extent.  Therefore, as long as the responsibility rests upon me on this side of the House for commenting upon the problems of defence, I shall try to keep the Army out of the political arena.</P>
      <P>There is good reason for that.  The Army is the Army of the people, and the need may arise for each and every one of us to take our part with that Army and, therefore, it is essential that politics should be kept out of it. I wish to pay tribute to the Army itself in that it has carefully avoided any taint in that direction&mdash;if you could attribute such a word to the art of politics&mdash;because it is important that it should have no political affiliations in the discharge of its duty.</P>
      <P>On a recent Vote I pointed out to the Minister that the seniority list is not a thing to be ignored.  He is a young Minister, not long in office and I will not comment any further on the matter, other than to remind him that seniority is of considerable importance. Provided there is efficiency and fitness, seniority should not and must not be discarded when the question of promotion arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the civil end, I should mention and place on record our appreciation of the services rendered to the Army and to the State by the retiring Secretary of the Department.  I know it is not customary to refer to a civil servant in this House on his retirement, but the circumstances in this case are unique.  He is a Secretary of a Department of State who has held office for a very long time; it might be regarded as the end of a period.  We are all getting on in years and it is unfortunate that even in the Army the age of 65 is reached and that time does not stand still.  Therefore, I should like to place on record from this side of the House the fact that we appreciate the services rendered to the Army and the nation by Lieutenant-General Peadar MacMahon, who is about to retire.  In regard to the <Col N="875" /> appointment of a successor, I am not happy.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just one point to make.  I will not touch on the matter beyond saying that there are misgivings.  I want it to be clearly understood that I am not reflecting in any way upon the person appointed.  He is an efficient and courteous officer.  I had him as an official for a long time, so I have no doubt about what I am saying.  At the same time, I am not happy on the matter.</P>
      <P>In relation to increases, it is rather significant that the poor Minister for Defence, the Quarter-Master General and the ordinary officers, suffer the same hardship as the people generally in connection with the cost of living. Although the sum provided is very substantial, the Minister very wisely said that the increase there is due to the cost of living and did not beat about the bush.  I believe it was the right thing to do.  However, although it is difficult to meet all the requirements, there are still hardships in the Army in relation to pay.  Keeping in mind what I set out to achieve, I do not want to comment any further on this subject, but the Minister should carefully consider the whole question of the pay and emoluments of the Army, and make sure they are not kept in a lower state than anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody should do his utmost to see to it that the recruiting campaign is a success.  I know the Minister will be only too glad to see even a greater number of recruits than the number he has catered for here.  I do not think there will be any difficulty in having a Supplementary Vote passed, if he gets more men, because the strain of a small force in keeping on the alert &mdash;and they are on the alert at the present time&mdash;is very great.  I should like to see a considerable number of our youth in the Defence Forces.  The question whether voluntary service is in the long run the best method of maintaining a Defence Force should be considered.  That is a matter which the Government and the Minister <Col N="876" /> should consider in present circumstances. However, I am not going to comment on that beyond suggesting that it should be examined.</P>
    <P>With regard to recruiting for civil defence, with the Minister I appeal to every section of the community to take part in this very important aspect of our defence.  I know that some people sneer at our efforts in relation to civil defence or, indeed, to defence at all but let them sneer.  Let me pray that the day will never come when they will regret their sneers.  It is imperative, in so far as it lies within our power, that every effort should be made in regard to civil defence.  I am glad to learn that the Minister and the Army have been so successful.  I hope there will be greater success.  I am certain that if civil defence were fully understood and appreciated by the people of this country and if an emergency arose&mdash;God forbid it should ever arise&mdash;the service that civil defence could render to the people would astound even the doubters.  I am glad the Minister made the appeal he did.</P>
    <P>On the question of general stores, this is a matter which every Minister will have difficulty in handling.  It is important that the general stores should be kept up and maintained. That is equally the case in regard to equipment, ammunition and other defence items.  It is important that they should be kept up to full strength. Without giving anything away, I agree with the Minister that our equipment and light armament are very effective. I have no doubt whatever that the armed forces of the State would render a good account of themselves if they were ever called upon to do so.</P>
    <P>It is heartbreaking to find such an amount provided for the enforcement of the Offences against the State Act. I only want to make one comment on the matter because I think it is the Minister's responsibility, on the question of administration.  The case has been made&mdash;and it appears to be well-founded&mdash;that a prisoner, who is a Deputy of this House, has been refused permission to have an interview with a solicitor of his choice.  I want it to be clearly understood that if a solicitor <Col N="877" /> is not struck off the roll, and is a solicitor of good standing, that he is on the hazard, so to speak, the person who wants to see such a solicitor is the only person who can nominate him. No Government or Minister has the right to say &ldquo;No, I will not let you see So-and-So; you can name somebody else.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister that, if that position still obtains, he should change his attitude in the matter provided the solicitor is of good standing and has not been struck off the rolls.  Even in times gone by I claimed that it was my right to select my solicitor and not my jailer's right.  There must not be any question about that.  The Minister should make sure, no matter what anybody says to the contrary, that a person is told he can see any solicitor who is a member of the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister paid a tribute to those who took part in the work of the Bureau of Military History.  I would be glad to know what steps the Minister has taken, and the Government proposes taking, for the safe custody of the documents connected with the bureau.  An undertaking was given that unless the contributor directed otherwise there would not be any breach of confidence in regard to the publication of these documents and that they would be safe for such time as the contributor thought fit, for 50 years at least.  Therefore, there is a serious obligation on the Government to make sure that that bond is fully honoured and that there cannot be any question of doubt about the maintenance, care and custody of these documents.</P>
    <P>I wish to compliment the Army upon its efficiency and its loyalty to the nation.  We can be very proud of the fact that the Army has always been loyal to the elected Government of the people whoever they were.  It is a great tribute to the Army and may it always remain so.  In my opinion, that is the highest point of loyalty to democracy in any country and it is something that of which both sides of the House can be very proud.  May it always remain so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. I hesitated for a considerable period before drafting that motion because I felt that the onus lay upon the Leader of the Opposition or upon the former Minister for Defence to submit such a motion so that the whole question of defence and expenditure thereon could be discussed properly and the criticism levelled at the Department and the Minister could be seen through the medium of a vote of criticism.</P>
      <P>I was, therefore, slow to put down a motion to refer back because I felt that the major Opposition Party, if you could describe them as such, would have taken the necessary steps.  Consequently, it was only when I saw that the Fine Gael Party failed to put down this motion that I took it upon myself to submit the motion before the House.</P>
      <P>When the Estimates for 1957-58 were forwarded to each Deputy, there was a circular contained in the Book of Estimates as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance has not had time for detailed examination of the Volume of Estimates for Supply Services for 1957-58 which were printed and ready for circulation when the Government assumed office and accordingly he cannot accept responsibility for them as regards either form or amount.  They are at present being examined in the various Departments concerned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That comment was enclosed with the Defence and other Estimates when the present Government came into power. The indication was that they had no responsibility whatever for the Estimates and the amounts to be spent but that they themselves were in the process of a careful screening of the proposed expenditure and that we could hope that, when the next Estimates came before this House, that is, the Estimates for 1958-59, we would see, as a result of the hard work of the Fianna Fáil Ministers, a great reduction in expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Minister for Defence, in the course of his remarks here on a motion very recently dealing with Defence, <Col N="879" /> stated that every possible effort was being made to cut unnecessary expenditure to the bone and that he was fully engaged in ensuring that any anxiety on the part of the public would be allayed in so far as this proposed expenditure was concerned. What do we find in this Estimate that the Minister has now brought before the House?  We find that, instead of a decrease in expenditure on Defence, there is an increase.  We find that, out of the 40 sub-heads contained in the Defence Estimate, no fewer than 26 of those sub-heads request an increase of expenditure&mdash;and that comes from the Minister who assured the public, through this House, that he was fully engaged in paring expenditure in his Department.</P>
    <P>I know there are Deputies in the Fine Gael Party, in the Labour Party and in the Fianna Fáil Party who, time and again, have voiced their disapproval and criticism of what they believed to be excessive expenditure by the Department of Defence.  However, when it comes to trying to get a reasonable approach to this matter, and when some Deputies decide that they themselves must criticise the expenditure, we find a number of Deputies in the Fine Gael Party and in the Fianna Fáil Party suggesting that we, in our efforts to reduce unnecessary expenditure, are sneering at the Army.</P>
    <P>We had a lot of ráméis for the past ten minutes from the former Minister for Defence.  Not long ago, the former Minister for Defence sought to suggest in this House that a number of us who wanted a reduction in Defence expenditure were objecting to the Army, as such.  The trouble is that we really have no Army at all.  It is a disgrace for an ex-Minister to try and bluff in this House that we have an Army in fact.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree for a moment that we have a full complement as far as the officer personnel of the Army is concerned.  We have.  However, when I criticise the fact that the officer personnel is up to full strength, that is not a criticism of the individual officers concerned.  It is a criticism of the <Col N="880" /> Minister and of the Government for either failing to reduce the number in the officer personnel or to bring up in the N.C.O. and private rank the strength that would be in proportion to the officer personnel as it is at present.</P>
    <P>When we seek to have a proper proportion between both groups, the suggestion here is that we are sneering at the individual members of the Army.  I have to put it on record again that when the former Minister for Defence, Deputy MacEoin, and a former Fianna Fáil Minister for Defence, Deputy Traynor, had responsibility for the Department of Defence they showed very little consideration for the Private or the N.C.O.  Whenever an increase in allowances or an increase in salaries was mentioned it was always the officer personnel and, moreover, the very senior personnel of the Army that got first preference.</P>
    <P>I remember one increase that came. The Minister and the Department thought so little about the whole affair that they allowed the senior element in the Army to decide who should get the necessary increases&mdash;and we know how far down the ranks it came.  Is it any wonder that, to-day, we have the present Minister for Defence embarking on a further recruiting drive&mdash;the same as his predecessor and his predecessor before him again?  For the past ten years, they have been trying to bring the Army at least up to a reasonable strength.</P>
    <P>We have seen recruiting campaigns year after year and in not one single year since the end of the emergency have we seen the Army up to what we believe should be its strength.  The fact is that we want an Army of soldiers on the cheap.  We pay the officer group, and rightly so, reasonable emoluments.  However, when it comes to the private, no matter what advertisements we put in the cinemas and no matter what grand advertisements are put on the walls and hoardings all over the country showing the figure of a fine-looking soldier with polished boots and a nice new uniform, we find that the pay allowance offered to that soldier is anything but attractive. Certainly it will not bring in the <Col N="881" /> recruit we want to an Army of the type we have to-day.  Therefore, when we hear people talk about the desirability of getting a recruiting drive under way we have to test their sincerity by what they are prepared to give these young men if they go into the Army.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks, Deputy MacEoin casually posed the question of whether an Army of the type we have &mdash;a volunteer Army&mdash;is the right type to have now or whether the methods we use in our recruiting are the correct methods.  Has Deputy MacEoin come to the view now that we will not get sufficient personnel of the right type by this voluntary recruiting campaign and that there should be imposed on every citizen of this State the duty of taking his part in a defensive system? Does Deputy MacEoin believe now, after all the years of talking about volunteers, that the time has come when we must ensure that every able-bodied citizen will play his part in the defensive system?  If that is his view, I can see no reason why he did not elaborate on it.  This is the place to elaborate on such a view and, if that is his view, we can only condemn the point of view that existed here over the years, as far as the voluntary recruiting campaign is concerned.</P>
    <P>Some time ago there was a motion here for discussion in which it was sought to set up a Select Committee of this House to examine into the whole question of expenditure on defence, in the light of modern developments and modern requirements and in the light of the tremendous strides which have been made in the production of new destructive weapons.  That motion was dealt with here, in a most casual manner, by the members of the House. Indeed, the Minister's contribution to that debate was better left unsaid.  I think even his own comrades in his Party, and certainly members of the Forces outside who read his contribution, were amazed that a man who was Minister for Defence could descend to such a low level in replying to a serious motion of that nature.</P>
    <P>On that occasion, I found it absolutely necessary to get all Deputies to express their views.  When they <Col N="882" /> were not prepared to speak or tell the House what they thought about various matters, there was only one way to get their views about the defence position and that was to get them to trot into the Division lobby, and trot in they did.  We found out their attitude when it came to a question of trying to get a reasonable proposition examined, namely, that in the light of the present situation a Select Committee of the House should sit to examine the whole question of defence, to examine the expenditure and then report back to the Government.</P>
    <P>That committee would not be given any responsibility or authority to make changes.  All it would have power to do would be send for persons, to examine records and to make reports to the Government.  Instead of allowing that committee to function, the two major Parties saw fit to combine here to throw out the motion.  I think that many of the people who had to vote on that were very dissatisfied at the time and I know now that many of them are highly critical of the Estimate which is now before the House.  Many of the people who at that time were perturbed at the expense felt that, as a result of that motion, the Minister would at least make some effort to reduce expenditure.</P>
    <P>The increase on the face of the Estimate actually is in the region of £37,000; but that is not the true picture.  In addition to that increase, we had to add the sum of at least £47,000 in pensions for the men who were retired very recently.  Therefore, on the Defence Estimate and on the pensions which go to pay a number of individuals who retired, the actual increase should total £84,000 rather than £37,000.  Unfortunately, one of these increases to which I refer is not accounted for on this Estimate but comes under Vote 58, which follows, concerning Military Service Pensions. It is important to realise that, as a result of certain activities of the Minister, we have not alone an increase in expenditure on serving personnel but also a substantial increase in the pension allowances.</P>
    <P>In spite of all this, we have fewer personnel serving in the rank and file. <Col N="883" /> The Minister told us he is embarking on a recruiting campaign and he said that he was perturbed&mdash;and rightly so &mdash;over the danger to the morale of the troops and to the Army in view of the small number serving.  Is it not about time that he woke up to that?  I spent two or three years in this House pointing out to the Minister how depressing and how demoralising it was for junior ranks in the Army&mdash;namely, the lieutenant and the captain group&mdash;to be dealing with mythical troops, and that no true training could be given to the officer personnel if all they had to handle were mythical troops.  The Minister has come now to my way of thinking namely, that it is bad for the morale of the Army itself that its strength is so low, and that the figures for recruits are so low.  I am glad that, even at this late stage, he has come round to that point of view.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate we have made provision for 7,846 privates, while the serving personnel in privates is a little over 4,000&mdash;4,194&mdash;according to one of the most recent figures.  I gather that we have over 1,100 officers serving at the moment in the regular Army and that we have just over 4,000 privates.  We have an officer now to fewer than every four men.  We have a commissioned officer for fewer than every four men in the Army.  It has gone down even from the figures I gave 12 months ago. There is certainly reason for the Minister to be perturbed about the morale of the Army when it has reached that stage.</P>
    <P>Bad as that is, let us have a look at the other side.  Let us have a look at the columns in connection with civilians who are attached to the Army.  The Minister glossed over very nicely the question of the Civil Service and the civil personnel.  While we have a reduction in the number of private soldiers, we have an increase in the civilian personnel.  Did anybody ever hear anything as daft as that?  I cannot extract the exact figure down to the last pound, but I do not think I will be more than a few thousand pounds out with regard to the pay of the soldiers when I say that the pay <Col N="884" /> of all the privates at the present time is less than £650,000, while the pay of the civilians and the Civil Service attached to the Army is £952,260. Therefore, it costs more to pay the civilians attached to the Army than it does to pay the troops.</P>
    <P>Now, if anybody here wants me to deal with more than the privates as far as pay is concerned, I shall give a worse example.  We all agree that it is desirable to pay the officer personnel well.  We find that, in spite of the fact that the officer personnel are reasonably looked after, their total pay is £876,000 odd.  In other words, they draw merely £100,000 less than the civilians who are attached to the Army. I cannot for the life of me understand why it is necessary to have an increase in the number of civilians attached to the Army at a time when the ranks of the Army are being depleted.</P>
    <P>We have at present the situation in which skilled craftsmen are drawing grade pay in the Army and are employed as batmen or orderlies, while the work they should be doing is being carried out by civilians, being paid some £8 to £10 a week, to do work for which men are trained in the Army. How does the Minister stand over the position that a man who is trained as a fitter or a skilled mechanic is not employed upon such work, although he is drawing grade pay as as a skilled artisan, having passed the necessary qualifying examinations?  How is it that, instead of that man doing the work he is qualified for, civilians are employed to do it for him?  Is there not a great misuse of public funds there?</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that very strong pressure is exercised by a number of civilians on both sides of this House.  I should put it another way, that is, that a number of civilians attached to the Army are able to exercise great influence with Deputies on both sides of the House and that, irrespective of whatever Government may be in office, the civilians attached to the Army will get their pound of flesh.  Now, I do not want to deprive any man of his livelihood.  The Minister may sneer.  I think that he has not got a clue, poor <Col N="885" /> fellow, but I do think that where we have men who are members of the Defence Forces trained as fitters, drivers, mechanics and so on, they should be employed on that type of work and that if the civilians are doing it, then other work outside the Army must be found for them.  It should not be too hard to absorb these men into various industrial concerns in the country.  It should not be too hard, over a period of years, to get them suitable work outside the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Nobody suggests that overnight all the civilians employed in or attached to the Army should be dismissed. Nobody wants that, but the House and the country want the Minister to make a start, to ensure that men who are qualified or trained for certain positions or for certain work carry out that work rather than that other men should be brought in to do the work, thereby duplicating the amount of money being spent.  The Americans have a saying in the Senate when schemes are being put forward by individual Senators that it is in order to get votes and such a scheme is described as a &ldquo;pork barrel&rdquo;.  If ever there was a pork barrel, it is in the Department of Defence, especially in regard to money spent on the civilian and Civil Service end of it.</P>
    <P>For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Minister has not made some effort to reduce, even in a limited way, the expenditure on the civilian end of it.  The demand throughout the country at present is for the establishment of more industries, and wherever an industrial concern is being set up there is a necessity for employing skilled men.  Skilled craftsmen are absolutely essential for an industrial concern.  Surely something could be worked out between the Minister's Department and the Department of Industry and Commerce, so that first preference would be given, where any new concern is being started, to men who up to this have been employed as civilians attached to the Army.  Would that not be one way of helping to solve the position and ease the position for these men, if they became unemployed?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> The Minister will sneer in this House and suggest that I am solely concerned with getting rid of the civilians attached to the Army.  I am not.  I can realise the position of men who, for a number of years, have been employed in or attached to a particular barracks, but there are other people in this country and there are thousands of people every week who have to leave the country, and I do not see any worry on the Minister's face or on the face of any other member of the Government with regard to these people who have to get out.</P>
    <P>I am not asking very much, but I suggest that the time is overripe for the Minister to put a plan before the House as to how he proposes drastically to reduce unnecessary expenditure within the Forces themselves and, at the same time, ease as far as possible, the position of individuals likely to lose their employment.</P>
    <P>I see under sub-head X that the Minister wants another £9,000 for this recruiting drive.  Is it not time that he woke up to the fact that the money is wasted, that all the expenditure we have every year is money wasted, as far as the recruiting drive is concerned? Every year about January or February, we have this farce going on of recruiting officers attending certain barracks up and down the country and a number of cinemas, which are anti-national in their outlook, making damn good money showing advertisements for an Irish recruiting drive and from the £9,000 or £10,000, 20 or 30 fellows may go in to be examined by the recruiting officer.  It is a disgrace to see the money wasted in this regard.  If there are suitable terms offered, there will be no shortage of applications by the right type of individuals, but you are not going to get them on the present figures.  In those circumstances, it is a complete waste of public money to be indulging in a recruiting drive.</P>
    <P>There is a section here dealing with offences against the State and the Minister pointed out that his appeal for recruits was necessary to a great extent, in view of the strain of the work falling on the Army so far as offences against the State are concerned. Does the Minister think that <Col N="887" /> he will bring 2,000 or 3,000 men into the Army on so-called patriotic grounds, when his purpose is to use these young men to keep other young men locked up in the Curragh and elsewhere?  That is really what the Minister is at and he appeals to Deputies to support the recruiting drive in order to get more young men into the Defence Forces, so that they, in turn, can look after other young Irishmen who are locked up for their national activities.  The whole situation is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin mentioned the position in connection with a member of this House, namely, Deputy R. Brady.  It might be no harm if the House realised the type of Minister who is charged with defence at the moment.  Deputy Brady was sentenced in the courts of this country for certain alleged offences against the State.  He completed his sentence, but he was not released.  He was taken from the prison, pushed into a truck and rushed off down to the Curragh.  While he was imprisoned, he made application to see his solicitor in connection with his position as a vocational teacher. He understood from the vocational committee that his position was in jeopardy, due to circumstances which had arisen.  He asked for permission to see his solicitor in order that his livelihood afterwards would not be jeopardised.  To the amazement of the Deputy himself and others, the Minister for Defence refused him permission to see his solicitor.</P>
    <P>The matter was brought before Roscommon County Council on a number of occasions and the Minister had not the decency to send down the reasons why he refused him permission to see his solicitor.  Pressure was brought to bear on the Minister by the county council and by&mdash;I must say and congratulate them&mdash;the members of the Fianna Fáil Party on the county council, who were unanimous in condemning the Minister for his attitude towards Deputy Brady.  In the course of time, tragedy struck the Brady family and Deputy Brady was allowed out on parole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> During that time, another letter had been forwarded by the county council to the Minister asking him to change his decision and allow Deputy Brady to see his solicitor.  All along, the Minister's answer had been that, for security reasons, he would not&mdash;he could not&mdash;allow Deputy Brady to see the particular solicitor.  The Minister's letter, when Deputy Brady was out on parole, stated that he was out on parole and stopped at that.  In other words, it was up to Deputy Brady to see his solicitor when he was out on parole, but he could not see him when he was locked up.</P>
    <P>The Roscommon County Council took the matter up again and pointed out that the Minister was quibbling over the whole problem, and I am glad to say the Minister changed his mind and has given permission to Deputy Brady to see his solicitor.  It was not Roscommon County Council, or Deputy MacEoin, or Deputy McQuillan who changed the Minister's mind.  It was the Convention on Human Rights that changed the Minister's mind, and the Minister knows very well that the commission dealing with another internee's case are going to have a look into the case of Deputy Brady.  Consequently, the Minister got cold feet.  He realised that he had made a mistake from the very beginning and he realised that, no matter how he might bulldoze things in this House, no matter how he might override the Roscommon County Council, no matter how he might violate the rights of the human individual, he was up against the Commission on Human Rights in Strasbourg, and he backed down.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin must think it was a disgraceful thing for a Minister to take it upon himself to make a decision like that.  The right should be there for an internee, or prisoner of any kind, to seek legal advice, and it would be very bad that any Minister of State should decide what legal adviser a prisoner should consult.  If I, or Deputy MacEoin, or any other Deputy, were in that position and a preference was requested with regard to a particular leval adviser, surely that right would have to be respectful?  Surely a Minister could not say it was against the <Col N="889" /> security of the State, and that a prisoner was not to be allowed to communicate with a particular solicitor?</P>
    <P>The reason I mention this is that this Minister, in spite of the fact that he is new to the House, shows something of the same mulishness and stubbornness as men twice his age have shown, and I think it is a very bad start.  I can well picture any man when he goes into the autumn of life becoming very conservative.  Perhaps he may get cranky; perhaps he may become very cautious.  At any rate, that seems to go with the advance in years, that a man gets more and more cautious in his approach to problems, more and more conservative and more and more annoyed if new views are expressed and new ways of dealing with problems are brought forward.  That is understandable and is to be expected. It is something which will apply to all of us, if we live so long, but it is too bad when we find that mentality showing itself in a young man who has been only 12 months in this House, who never spent a day in the hard fighting as a back bencher, who never went through the hardships of a real campaign on his own, who was foisted into this position and who now, when he is in it, cannot show the slightest signs of making a success of it.  God knows I have asked on a number of occasions that the older members on both sides of the House call it a day, pack in, and let the younger men take over, but I should begin to hesitate, if I were to think there were more men of this type to replace the present Minister for Defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment very briefly on the Minister's speech on this Estimate.  The most remarkable feature of his speech was that it was very subdued and no policy was stated in relation to the Army.  It seemed to be a routine introduction of an Estimate in this House.  We were not given any statement of policy by the Minister, either internal or external, as far as the Army is concerned.  We were given nothing in that respect which could be debated here to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> However, I should like to put before him the attitude of his Party in previous years in relation to the Army as compared with the kind of speech we heard from the Minister to-night.  In his statement, the Minister mentioned that he had approximately 7,500 serving men.  It seems, when the Fianna Fáil Party are in Government, that all is well so far as the Army is concerned, but, when they are in opposition, they try to profit by crying &ldquo;Wolf, wolf&rdquo; to the nation and they use the strength of the personnel in the Army as a danger signal.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister now of the campaign carried on here, a very vigorous campaign, by the Fianna Fáil Party in the year 1950 and subsequent years, when the inter-Party Government were in office.  At that time, they would hear of nothing less than 12,500 men.  The Minister told us to-night that he has 7,500 men and he will spend £9,000 on a recruiting campaign.  He did not take the trouble to tell us the amount which was spent annually prior to this for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote now from some of the speeches made in relation to Army strength some years ago. Deputy Traynor, a former Minister for Defence, speaking at column 609 of Volume 120 of the Official Report, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let me again develop this point in regard to the 12,500 Army....</P>
    <P>With an Army of 12,500 men, we could have, at the end of two years, about 5,000 men going into the Reserve ranks every year.  In five or six years there would be at the back of the Army a Reserve of from 20,000 to 30,000 men.  Can anyone realise the peace of mind it would be to a general officer commanding, who knew that within 72 hours of the start of an emergency, such as that with which the late general headquarters staff had been confronted, he would have behind him an Army of 30,000 men, according to the strength of the Reserve?  In addition to that, he would also have the knowledge that he had the Volunteer force the Minister has been emphasising as so necessary to the nation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> There, one sees Deputy Traynor in opposition bringing in the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo;.  When the Fianna Fáil Party are on this side of the House, they use these figures as a political puppet to create anxiety in the minds of the public in relation to the Army.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see Deputy Vivion de Valera in the House so that I can quote for him some of his own statements in relation to the Army.  In 1950, the Korean war was in progress and apparently Fianna Fáil considered the time appropriate to create anxiety in the minds of the general public.  At column 634 of Volume 120 of the Official Report, Deputy Vivion de Valera said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There have been many things said about the 12,500 Army.  It was simply this, that on any showing, no matter how you were to raise and prepare a defence force, a minimum regular Army of that number was necessary.  As a matter of fact, the staff considered you needed a few hundred more which you might add to the 12,500 as a minimum.  If you had that minimum you could make a serious attempt at building the defence force that this country could afford; that would be a practical and realistic approach to the defence problem in so far as a country like ours could approach it.  That figure has been so bandied about that I think that explanation in regard to its genesis is necessary.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke of the disposal of land owned by the Army at Tallaght. Is this land being acquired by the Irish Land Commission?  The Minister mentioned that he had credited the Estimates with the amount of money expected for this land.  I am interested to know whether this land will be put up for public auction or is it being handed over to the Irish Land Commission?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will state whether there has been a change.  I understood arrangements were being made between the Department of Defence and the Department of Lands for the Irish Land Commission to acquire that land from the Department of Defence in order to subdivide it amongst suitable applicants for holdings in the area.  From what the Minister has said, it now appears that this land will not be handed over to the Land Commission for that purpose, but that it will be put under the hammer at public auction.</P>
      <P>These are the only comments I want to make on the speech of the Minister. I had hoped he would have given us a general view of the defence policy being pursued, but instead we had from him a general account of the ordinary administration of the Army and of the arrangements being made for the coming year to continue that administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We must all agree that the Estimate which the Minister has produced is a modest one and could not by any stretch of the imagination be described as extravagant in any way.  We can all realise the pressure under which the Minister must have been to increase expenditure under practically every head of the Vote.  He has to be congratulated on the fact that, in the face of such pressure&mdash;and in practically every case, I am sure he could sympathise with the pressure&mdash;he has succeeded in producing an Estimate in which the total outlay is only very insignificantly increased on the previous year, while, at the same time, he has produced for us a balanced and sensible programme for defence expenditure.</P>
      <P>In Fianna Fáil, we believe&mdash;and I think most responsible members of the House believe&mdash;that to provide and maintain a necessary minimum of Defence Forces is, in the first instance, a national duty and, secondly, is nothing more or less than common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is faced with the problem of meeting that minimum national requirement and, at the same time, keeping expenditure to a level which the national economy, in its present <Col N="894" /> circumstances, can afford.  It is against that background that we must consider the Estimate.  If we do so, we must agree that it is a sound and sensible distribution of our resources.</P>
    <P>I am personally disappointed, and have been for a number of years, at one particular aspect of our defence policy, and that is in the manner in which successive Ministers have treated the branch of our Defence Forces about which I know most, the F.C.A. Under this heading, the Minister is provided with the opportunity of reconciling his two conflicting aims of meeting the minimum national defence requirements and at the same time keeping the cost within reasonable bounds.  The F.C.A. has always seemed to me to be an instrument whereby a pool of trained men would be available at any given moment for reinforcing the permanent forces at comparatively little cost.</P>
    <P>Sufficient attention has not been given in our defence policy to the F.C.A.  I am reinforced in that opinion again this year when I find that the Minister proposes to spend, between the F.C.A. and An Sluagh Muiri, a total of £391,000 approximately.  The pay of civilians attached to units of the Defence Forces alone amounts to a much greater sum, £664,000.  If we take those two figures in relation to each other, they indicate that in our policy sufficient emphasis is not placed on the advantage the F.C.A. could be to our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>For a very small expenditure, we could procure a substantial pool of trained part-time soldiers.  In addition, the F.C.A. could offer several other advantages to the country.  It has always seemed to me that it would be a very good thing that our young men from the ages of 17 to 20 should go into the F.C.A. and have an opportunity of being inculcated with patriotism, proper national ideals, a sense of discipline and all the other advantages that go with military training at that early age.  A great number of our modern teenage social problems would be got over, if more of our young people were recruited into the F.C.A. and taught there to cultivate a sense of responsibility and discipline.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="895" /> I also feel that the F.C.A. provides at the moment, and could provide to a far greater degree, an outlet for that military patriotism which is natural to young men everywhere, but particularly so in this country.  A lot of young men, who find themselves caught up in movements without realising fully what is involved in the ultimate, would never get into these difficulties if the career of a member of the F.C.A. were made more attractive and interesting.</P>
    <P>The authorities have been lacking in bringing a certain amount of imagination and vision to their planning and approach to the F.C.A.  I would suggest to the Minister that a number of things could be done to make the F.C.A. a much more interesting and attractive proposition for young men and that they need not necessarily cost the Exchequer any great amount. Some time ago, there was talk of a new and more attractive uniform for the F.C.A.  I would not be terribly worried about that aspect.  The uniform they have at the moment is a very serviceable and sensible military uniform.</P>
    <P>I think that when young men are prepared to give their time and energy free and voluntarily to the country, they might be provided with proper uniforms, properly fitted.  The type of uniform is all right.  It is just that it is not supplied to the units of the F.C.A. in proper sizes and in proper quantity.  I believe that it is true that a great number of units have difficulty in getting adequate supplies of clothing. There may be some excuse for not supplying them with the most up-to-date and modern weapons, but it is a very poor affair altogether if they cannot be provided with properly fitting uniforms in the quantities required.</P>
    <P>I also think that more military transport should be placed at the disposal of the F.C.A. units and that far greater attention should be given to accommodation throughout the country. I know of units in Dublin which are excellent parading units but which cannot find suitable accommodation. In all these matters I suggest to the Minister that if he gives some thought <Col N="896" /> and imagination to the requirements of this force, he will find that, without any great expenditure, he will be able to meet a great number of the grievances and complaints which tend to stop recruiting and which keep the F.C.A. from being the force that I think it should be.</P>
    <P>A little more attention should be paid to making the force, as such, more important and attractive than it is.  Young people are interested in glamour and in a sense of importance and this aspect should be catered for to a greater extent.  I hope the Minister will devote, possibly more expenditure, but certainly a great deal more thought and imagination to the requirements of the F.C.A., and if he does that I feel that he will find that a lot of his man-power problems in the building up of the Defence Forces will be overcome.  I think the young men of the country would be prepared to come forward in great numbers and join the properly organised Defence Forces of the country rather than partake in any other form of activity, if a greater incentive were given to them to do so and if the F.C.A. were made the attractive force it can be made.</P>
    <P>Apart from that aspect of the Estimates, I feel that the Minister has done a good job in reconciling the conflicting pressures to which he must have been subjected and in giving us a reasonable Defence Force while keeping defence expenditure in line with our resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to join with Deputy MacEoin in paying a tribute here in the House to the former Secretary of the Department of Defence.  He is an officer who rendered considerable service in difficult times in the building up of our Defence Forces and in ensuring that they were regarded by all our people as the Army of the country.  I am certain that, in his retirement, he carries with him the knowledge of good work well done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>References have been made here this evening by Deputy McQuillan, and on other occasions by the same Deputy and other Deputies, in relation to the position of the Army in the country. Deputy McQuillan recalled a motion in <Col N="897" /> his name asking Dáil Éireann to establish a select committee to inquire into the whole position of the Army, its future and so on.  He seemed critical of the fact that the Fine Gael Party was at one with the Government in rejecting and voting against that motion.  If he passed to consider for a moment, he would realise that there is such a committee established by this Dáil, that is, the Government of this country.  It is their function and responsibility to have regard to the position of the Army in the country, to have regard to the manner in which the Army should be organised, and it is their responsibility to work out the defence plan of this country.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that this responsibility is placed upon the Government, one must feel that the Minister's statement here this evening is not a very enlightening one.  It consisted largely of a recital of facts so often repeated in this House that many of us know them practically by heart.  There was nothing running through his speech of any realisation of the fact that there are new considerations in relation to defence not only here but elsewhere.  Since the Minister assumed office 12 months ago, startling and dramatic changes have taken place in Britain and elsewhere in relation to the organisation of defence forces.  One would have expected that, in the Minister's statement here to-night, some evidence would have been given that these developments were also being considered here.  Instead of that, nothing new has been added in what surely should be a new situation. Obviously, from what the Minister has said here in reply to an interjection, we are still to have the same old argument from the Minister's side of the House with regard to the optimum strength of the Army.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, as has been pointed out, it was commonplace for members of the Minister's Party while in Opposition to regard it as doctrinaire that we must have an army of 12,500. One fewer would not do and, apparently, one more was unnecessary.  Just 12,500 troops represented the ideal Defence Force for this country.  Of course, it is many years since we had <Col N="898" /> such an Army and, indeed, many people feel that it will be many years before we will get such an Army.  We certainly have not it now nor is it intended to obtain an Army of that size this year.  These Estimates are based on an estimated strength of 7,500. Therefore, one can at least assume that the talk of an army of 12,500 is now something that can be remembered but certainly does not represent a live policy to-day.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is the ideal strength of our Defence Forces.  I would imagine that the wise and sensible thing is to plan in relation to the strength that it is felt can be mustered. If, with ordinary recruitment, based on the conditions of service that we can afford to offer, we cannot have an Army of a strength greater than 7,500 or 8,000 in the permanent forces, the sensible thing is to plan our defence policy on that strength rather than to plan it with a whole lot of &ldquo;ifs and ands&rdquo; which, in fact, represent nothing practical.</P>
    <P>The certain thing is that over recent years the strength of the permanent force has not exceeded 8,000.  A recruiting drive has taken place in the spring of every year for many years.  I have not the information before me, but I guess the position to have been that such recruiting drive each year produced a limited number of recruits, but certainly never in any way made an impact on the strength of the forces. Therefore, it seems to me that, unless we decide drastically to alter the manner in which we are to raise our Defence Forces or unless we can afford to offer considerably more attractive conditions of service, we should plan our defence policy on an effective strength in the permanent forces of something around 8,000.  I feel that there is the criticism of the Minister's statement here to-night that there is no evidence in it of any practical consideration of that kind.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister when he is replying whether and, if so, what progress has been made in relation to the preparation of a casualty service.  The Minister has referred to the provisions in relation to civil defence and he has asked for the <Col N="899" /> co-operation of local authorities and the public generally in the building up of a civil defence army.  With Deputy MacEoin, I should like to concur in everything he has said and to ask for every possible co-operation throughout the country in the building up of this service.  But, the civil defence service is only one aspect of the services which should be available to the public in the event of the outbreak of war or the effects of war being felt here.  There is also the perhaps more important service in relation to the victims of attack and that is the casualty service. I know&mdash;certainly it occurred when we were in Government and I dare say the same position still obtains &mdash;there was some difference in view between successive Ministers for Defence and successive Ministers for Health in relation to the responsibility with regard to that service.  I only trust that those differences have now been composed and that progress is being made in organising a casualty service.</P>
    <P>In that regard I should like to remind Deputies who may not be familiar with the problem that, in relation to a service for casualties, particularly around this city, we must have regard to the fact that in Dublin City all our major hospitals are centred within a radius of two or three miles.  Were the worst to happen and an atomic bomb dropped on or near this island which might have its effect on Dublin City, our problem is that the means by which casualties could be treated would be obliterated, so that in relation to the building up of a casualty service consideration has to be given to the provision of alternative hospital services outside the city.  I hope that the Minister may be able to report some progress in that regard when he is replying.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday last I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister to ask him what was the present strength of the Defence Forces.  I did so as a Deputy seeking information.  I received in tabular form a reply which was printed in the Official Report and which was available to the public for their information.  That reply gives the strength of the Army on 28th <Col N="900" /> February, with the following particulars: (a) Na Buan-Óglaigh&mdash;the particulars were given; (b) (i) An Cúltacha Oifigeach agus an Cúltaca Fear&mdash;the particulars were given.  Further particulars were given under such headings. I never heard the permanent forces so called and I was never aware that our reserve forces were so styled. It is the first time I was aware of such information being given with particulars which would not be known or recognised by the general public.</P>
    <P>I have taken the trouble to ascertain that, under the Defence Act, 1954, the proper style of our Reserve Force is the Reserve Defence Force, officers and men, First Line, and so on, and I suggest to the Minister, when such parliamentary questions are asked, that he give the information in accordance with the statute in that regard passed by the House.  It is important that these matters should not be disguised; it is important that, when a question is asked to elicit information with regard to our Defence Forces, the reply should be given in a manner capable of being recognised by the general public.</P>
    <P>I dare say there was scarcely a Deputy in the Dáil, irrespective of how proficient he might be in the speaking of Irish, who would have been aware of what the Minister had in mind when he referred to An Cúltaca Oifigeach agus An Cúltaca Fear.  The fact is the official style is the Reserve Defence Force, the Reserve of Officers, First Line, and so on, and certainly they should be so referred to by the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Defence Act of 1954 was passed through this House in English.  It is not one of the Acts passed through the Irish language; it is translated into Irish, but the force which it establishes, with the exception of An Slua Muiri, is known by its English title.  If the Minister desires it otherwise and wants to <Col N="901" /> get the approval of this House, there is a way of doing it, but until it is done, the Minister should refer to the parts of these Defence Forces according to their proper style and manner.</P>
      <P>I should like to subscribe to the views expressed by certain Deputies&mdash; particularly by Deputy Haughey&mdash;in regard to the importance in present circumstances of getting our people, particularly the younger people, to have not only respect but a deep affection for the Army and our Defence Forces.  I feel that in the past 18 months or two years, we should have made more use of our Army in public ceremonial than in fact was made.  It is important that young people should realise that the Irish Republican Army is the Army we are discussing here to-night and no other, and that any other force that no styles or parades itself is a force treasonable to the the State.  That can be got over properly only by getting young people, particularly, to realise that when an Army band plays a group of marching soldiers along the streets those wearing the green uniforms are our men and represent our Army.</P>
      <P>In that regard, it is perhaps a pity and I hope it is a matter that the Minister and his colleagues will consider in relation to next year&mdash;that there has not been a revival in present circumstances of the Army parades of St. Patrick's Day.  Certainly, I would like to feel that on other notable dates in the year, perhaps at Easter, or on some other occasion, an effort should be made to have a ceremonial parade or parades in different parts of the country by the Defence Forces.  I know that at times in the past such parades were so frequent that in fact their novelty began to wear off, but I feel the time is now opportune for a revival of some public ceremonial in relation to the Army&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The views I am about to express are purely my own and being as I am, a pacifist, they will not necessarily represent the views, perhaps, of the vast majority of people in the House, or in fact, of the vast majority of the people in the Party to which I belong.  But I think it is just as well that everyone elected to the House who has views to express should have the courage to express them, even if they do not receive acclaim or applause from the people listening or from a good many of the people reading them.</P>
      <P>To my mind, a good deal of humbug has been spoken here on this Estimate. Obviously, this country is too small, too impoverished, to be able to afford a Defence Force of a type that would be able to offer any effective resistance in terms of the repulse of any invading force.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin said he was quite sure the present Army would give a good account of itself.  I am quite sure it would, if that account were to be measured by the number of Irishmen who would risk their lives and suffer death rather than allow an enemy to come into the country.  A good account of themselves given in that way, to my mind, as one who has no use for that type of bloodshed, is ridiculous.  I would prefer, if we could not successfully repulse an attack, that at least we would conserve our man-power and woman-power rather than waste it in a useless outflow of blood.  Obviously, with the nuclear weapons they have, the big competing powers hold the key to the strategy of this country.  If we are vital to one or other, they will see to it that we are defended or attacked as they decree.  In these circumstances, to talk about the man-power or firing power is just rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that the State has a duty to maintain an armed force, whether we call it an army or police or defence force.  The State has the duty to itself to uphold its own authority, to ensure that anarchy will not prevail or that armed resistance by <Col N="903" /> any group will not be able to upset it. With that I think we all agree.  I suggest that these 1,500 officers, our line of reserve officers, the 11,000 peace-time troops aimed at are completely unnecessary, and that there is an absolute waste of money which is badly needed for economic development.</P>
    <P>Military manoeuvres, jet planes screaming overhead&mdash;for what use? Even if they were helicopters, which could be adapted for some actual humanitarian purpose, even the rescue of life at sea, even to fly in an emergency case from one of our islands, I could subscribe to that.  But in the waste of pounds per second in aviation fuel, for certain young Air Force officers flying all over the country, I see no advantage, other than the possible training of those young men as commercial pilots.  Even in that, I am told&mdash;I am not quite sure of it&mdash;that a man with a rank in the British Air Force is rated more higly, even in Aer Lingus, and certainly in some of the other airways, than our own Irish-trained boys.  Even if it were the aim to train for Aer Lingus, why should it be necessary to spend badly needed money for such a purpose?</P>
    <P>I would suggest that an emergency group of armed people, whether we call them a police force or a defence force, is needed, but I would suggest they should so combine it with the other needs and services of this country, such as fishery protection, ambulance services, fire-fighting services, civil defence services of all sorts, as to make them in some way remunerative for the money that they cost.</P>
    <P>It was regrettable to hear this evening of the amount of money which had to be spent on the activities of our troops guarding the internees at the Curragh.  While I hold no brief for anyone in this country who attempts to defy its lawful Constitution by armed force, I equally have no use for any group or Government that interns men without trial or without evidence that can be brought before a judge on which a conviction could be secured, and which uses our Irish troops to keep them under barbed wire in the <Col N="904" /> Curragh.  As long as I am here, irrespective of which Government is in power&mdash;whether it is one of Parties, or one of which I would be a member, in the form of an inter-Party section, or not&mdash;I will express that view.  The danger I see is that what is done to-day to a group of people under one name could be done to-morrow to a separate group of people called by a different name altogether.  That is all I want to say on defence.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all Deputies not to be led away by the hambug as to what our young men could do.  I give them all the credit, that they will lay down their lives and do so willingly but what would be the use?  In laying down their lives, the object for which they would be laying them down would be to save life, to save the people of the country and, in their attempt to save the people, they would destroy more than they would save.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my views, which are a little different, perhaps, from those of other Deputies. I am not claiming any authority on this question of defence, but I suppose I have as much knowledge as anyone else.  I served in the various Defence Forces and while I do not claim to have any advanced military knowledge, one can be a good soldier without having a knowledge of general military policy or its requirements.  I have always taken a keen interest in military history, military biography and warfare. If I express views at all, they are based on that, and I would like to put them objectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everything has a purpose.  Even you yourself, Sir, are here to keep order in this House; you are not there just to be looked at.  Likewise, our Defence Forces are there for a specific purpose, that is, to defend this country, if need be.  We are spending over £6,000,000 this year for that purpose and we spent hundreds of millions during the past 30 or 40 years on the same purpose. What would we get for this £6,000,000, or these hundreds of millions, if there were an emergency?  Does our Defence Force exist just as a kind of Swiss Guard for ceremonial purposes?  I am not much interested in that, but I am interested in the purpose of defence.  I <Col N="905" /> am trying to visualise an actual attack here.  That is the purpose of defence.</P>
    <P>Every nation has a military policy, depending on how it is situated, who its neighbours are, the strength of those neighbours, the policy of those neighbours and their experience.  We know that Britain has always looked on the sea as her defence, and, therefore, she never developed any large land force.  She always gambled on having a navy big enough to keep people at a distance and give her time.  She could not afford a big navy and a big land force at the same time.  That is why she makes an alliance with France, seeing in France a big land power which would give her certain advantages and an opportunity to mobilise her own forces.</P>
    <P>America has her war policy.  She had it for years, with the Monroe Doctrine, under which no one would be allowed to intervene in any little differences between the various South American nations.  They could shoot away, but no outsider would be allowed to intervene. Every country has a policy in military matters.  It is laid down on a certain basis.  Now, what is our policy? Are we just to have a sort of Swiss Guard, to parade at certain times of the year?  Is our Army there to withstand an attack and, if so, by whom and in what way?</P>
    <P>We know that from time to time there are certain internal disturbances here, but we do not need a conventional army to guard ourselves against them.  I refer to the form of disturbances we have had, which have been handled by small police forces. We do not need a heavily armoured force to meet a situation like that. Even the little troubles we have up in the North at the moment are being handled by light, land police forces. Our main function is to defend this country against external attack.  I am trying to visualise an external attack, and I say to myself, just as the British say: &ldquo;The British have to be watched, the Russians have to be watched; we as a nation must see that England has to be watched, and England's enemies.&rdquo;  They are the only possible opponents we could have; there are no others.  England will allow no one to come in here, in her <Col N="906" /> own interest&mdash;and, therefore, England herself is the only possible one; or, if England were defeated, her opponents might come in.</P>
    <P>Outside some disturbances within the State, our potential enemies would be England herself or England's enemies.  In each case it would be a mighty force.  That is the point I am endeavouring to make.  We have a conventional force organised in a manner that would put up, as I call it, a frontal or open resistance.  Because of the size of our population and our finances, and because we can get no support from anyone, I hold we are actually at the mercy of those two gigantic forces who might possibly be aggressors.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to think in terms of a conventional defence.  I hold that our proper defence should be a kind of local defence force, well armed and trained with a small conventional force solely for th purpose of training that local defence force to put up some kind of delaying action, in the event of an invasion.  It is not possible for this country to put up any form of conventional defence and it would be suicide to try it.</P>
    <P>My point is that we are wasting a lot of money on conventional defence. The whole system should be reorganised in the light of what we might expect.  In that way, we could economise and save several million pounds. I believe that half the barracks we possess could be sold.  The Curragh could be given over to the local council for use in connection with a housing scheme.  What use is the Curragh?  If ever there was a sitting duck for one bomb, the Curragh is.  I put it to the House that we are thinking too much in terms of a form of defence which it is not possible for us to sustain.</P>
    <P>According to the Estimates, there is an increase in regard to naval matters. Why the increase?  I could understand getting lightboats for the purpose of defending our fisheries, but what sense is there in any form of a naval force, from a defence point of view?  We have all seen what happened in regard to the Egyptians whose fleet disappeared overnight.  Money spent on naval defence here is a waste of money, time and lives.  We are not in a position <Col N="907" /> to put up any form of conventional defence.  Therefore, we should give it up and reorganise our defences. I am not talking about empty gestures; I do not believe in empty gestures.  The only form of defence is attack and we are not in a position to attack in a conventional sense.  Our salvation lies in guerilla defence.  We ought to come down to earth and make up our minds to organise ourselves so that, if there was an invasion, we could at least attack.  A conventional defence would lead to our annihilation and actually immobilise all our forces.</P>
    <P>We have a few examples of that.  The form of defence put up in 1916 was conventional. The men who went out in 1916 were undoubtedly brave men. From a military point of view, nothing was achieved.  Houses and buildings were occupied, but they were surrounded by the enemy and all were captured.  Leaving aside political issues&mdash;we are dealing only with the military factor&mdash;during the Civil War, troops occupied buildings and were surrounded and captured.  Going further back in history, the same thing happened at Vinegar Hill.  The only time we won a battle at all in a conventional sense was at Clontarf and the only other victory we can claim in that sense was in 1921.  The hope of an enemy is that we would put up a conventional defence so that he could annihilate us.</P>
    <P>We should be Machiavellian in our approach to defence.  Our whole defence force is little more than a ceremonial affair and is a waste of money. We should save the money and give it to the people in need.  As I said we do not need half the barracks we possess. We should sell them.  We need only light armaments.  What we really require in this country are small arms. We do not manufacture them.  We have no ammunition supplies and we depend on Britain, who might not be able to do so, to help us.  We should have a small arms factory in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want something more than an empty gesture.  I would like a proper defence, such a defence as would enable us to attack.  I may be getting into deep water, but I want to show that there is a good deal of money being <Col N="908" /> wasted.  The Army serves no purpose; it is only a kind of ceremonial Army.  I ask that we pursue a down-to-earth policy.  We can save £2,000,000 without any trouble and yet have a most effective local defence force which will give us adequate support, in the event of invasion.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that the guerillas in Spain tied up 200,000 of Napoleon's troops.  Napoleon could win whenever a conventional defence was put up, but, in the absence of a conventional defence, he was as much at the mercy of the guerillas as the British in Ireland were in 1921.  We should think along the lines I have indicated in regard to the organisation of our Defence Forces.  As it is, we are throwing away several million pounds per annum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with the point which has just been raised, I think it would be most unjust to assume that the Defence Forces were organised on a basis of putting up purely what the Deputy has called a conventional defence. In actual fact, the Forces are organised very much on the lines which the Deputy himself has advocated.  The regular Army is a training cadre essentially and not in itself a fighting force. It is a training cadre on the basis of which a local defence force can be raised and trained at comparatively short notice.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy need worry for a moment there is any danger that the regular Army, as such, will be immobilised and put up a thin green line across the country to defend it against an invader.  Any such conception was out of date well before the last war.  The whole conception of defence now is extreme mobility and the ability to strike, retire, slip round the flanks, get round the rear of the enemy, strike again and run.  That is the only defence which a force such as ours can put up and it is all that it could be expected to put up.  I do not think anybody could accuse our Army of being a ceremonial Army&mdash;quite the reverse.  It is a very work-a-day outfit which indulges in the very minimum of ceremonial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister referred to the strength of the forces and to the <Col N="909" /> necessity for maintaining a minimum number, at least, in the interests of the morale of the forces.  That is an extremely important consideration. There is nothing more damaging to morale than forces which are grossly under strength and that actually is always the case with a peace-time Regular Army.</P>
    <P>I would agree on one point which the last Deputy made, that is, about the number of barracks.  I mentioned the matter on the Estimate last year and I should like to mention it again.  The number of barracks actually occupied in Dublin appears to me excessive.  I am speaking as an outsider, a layman. However, knowing the number of troops accommodated in the same barracks during the 1939-1945 period and knowing approximately the number which are now accommodated in the same quarters, I cannot help feeling that those barracks are not half-manned.</P>
    <P>Once barracks are open, they have to be maintained.  That means extra guard duties, extra fatigues and so on. It means that the great propotion of the men are engaged on maintenance of barrack duties and the minimum number of men on actual military training.  That can have a very adverse effect on morale generally.  I would again ask the Minister, as I did last year, to look into the matter very carefully to see whether there cannot be some economy in that line.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-head A of the Estimate, I should like to refer in particular to the officers of the legal branch.  I am disappointed to see that there is little difference in the pay for these officers, as compared with last year.  These officers were the only professional officers who did not receive additional professional pay during the last few years.  As one who has served in the legal branch of the forces, I should like to state that it is not purely a question of personal prejudice.  I know the very wide scope of the duties of the legal officers attached to the Army.  I do not think anyone could feel that officers who have become qualified in the law are only less entitled to professional pay than other professional officers.</P>
    <P>At the same time, all the other professions <Col N="910" /> have received an increase on the professional pay and the legal officers have not.  I think that was primarily the fault of the legal profession itself in that it did not draw the attention of the Minister earlier to that injustice.  The Minister's attention has already been drawn to that matter and I would earnestly ask him to try to prevail upon the Minister for Finance to see if the comparatively small amount necessary in this very large Estimate could be included in order to grant the legal officers the same conditions as apply to other officers with professional qualifications.</P>
    <P>I found out to-day, rather to my surprise, that there is no copy of the Army establishment available in the Library.  That, I presume, is a confidential document.  At the same time, it makes it rather difficult to discuss this Estimate without having more precise information as to the present establishment of the Army.  I noticed some time ago a reference to some function in relation to coast defence artillery.  I had believed, and, I may say, hoped, we had given up coast defence artillery.  Perhaps it was some function dealing with those who had been in that branch of the Artillery Corps but if there is still coast defence artillery on the establishment I find it difficult to understand its significance.</P>
    <P>Similarly, anti-aircraft artillery has, I think, now become completely outdated. I grant that infantry in the field will require some light anti-aircraft protection to give them some defence against spotter aircraft.  They will not be able to give themselves any defence against jet aircraft but they would require some defence in the field against reconnaissance planes. However, when we come to light and medium anti-aircraft artillery, it is significant that this has largely been abandoned by most of the present-day armies.  I would ask the Minister to look into that matter, too.  A number of our men have been very well trained in modern anti-aircraft artillery work, especially radar-controlled artillery, but even radar-controlled artillery is of very little use in these days.</P>
    <P>With regard to the naval service, I am a little concerned as to whether the <Col N="911" /> corvettes are the most suitable vessels for this service. They are apparently fairly expensive to maintain and to run.  Their running expenses on fuel oil are high, yet they do not seem to be able to give adequate fishery protection, which is their main duty. Most of them appear to be engaged on fishery patrol most of the time and they have not the speed to catch the offender in the act.  I am not quite clear in my mind as to the alternative but it seems that a lot of money is locked up in the small force of three corvettes and, with the heavy maintenance and running costs, I have some doubts as to whether they are an economic proposition.</P>
    <P>On the civil side, I am disappointed that there appears to be no reduction. I hope I have not got a prejudice against the civil side though I am open to conviction on that point and maybe I am prejudiced in favour of the military rather than the civil side.  At the same time, there is a tremendous expenditure under the heading of the Minister's Office in respect of civilian employees.  The Minister and Secretariat account for a total expenditure of £287,500.  Some of these sections are rather a mystery to me.  There is <Col N="912" /> the Minister's own Office and his immediate executives.  Then there is the Lands Section.</P>
    <P>I can quite see that you need some civil servants to look after the Army land but there seems to be an enormous number of people in the Establishment Section, on a very large sum of money annually.  I come back to the point I raised last year&mdash;to the Soldiers' Pay Section, where we have 105 officials engaged in the distribution of pay of approximately 11,000 men.  Seeing that every man is paid not by a civilian but by his own officer, I still cannot understand why you need 105 officials in the Department of Defence to see that the right amount of pay has been given out, considering that that costs the Department £55,700.  Therefore, the expenditure on soldiers' pay is £55,700 on the civilian side and all the money is actually paid out by the officers in charge of the various units.  I am convinced there is overlapping of function there which is quite unnecessary.</P>
