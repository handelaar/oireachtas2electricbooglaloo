    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he will institute an inquiry by a Prices Advisory Committee into the prices of shoes, particularly those of women and children, and of repairs to shoes, in view of the present exorbitant charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received no recent complaints that exorbitant charges are being made either for shoes or shoe repairs.  In the circumstances, I see no point in instituting an inquiry as suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware of public dissatisfaction with the quality of shoes; and whether a standard specification has been prescribed in relation to shoes, and, if not, whether he will request the Institute <Col N="1254" /> for Industrial Research and Standards to prepare a specification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of public dissatisfaction with the quality of shoes.  Although sales of shoes (other than rubber footwear) in this country are of the order of 5,000,000 pairs a year only six complaints have been received in my Department this year and, in at least three of these cases, the quality of the footwear was not at fault.  The fact that the Irish footwear industry effects substantial sales in the highly competitive export market is in itself evidence of a high degree of efficiency in the industry.</P>
      <P>The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards has not declared a standard specification for shoes though they have for men's heavy boots. It is doubtful whether men's and women's shoes are suitable subjects for standard specification.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is given substantial evidence that a great deal of justifiable dissatisfaction exists in this city, and in every other place throughout the country, amongst people with moderate incomes, firstly, in connection with the price of ladies and children's shoes and secondly, with the fact that these shoes give no real lasting value&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state generally <Col N="1258" /> the extent to which the cost of maternity cases, including doctor's attendance in hospitals, is met under the Health Act of 1953 as regards persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts or their dependents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons currently or until recently insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and dependents of such persons, are among the classes entitled, free of charge, to maternity and infant health services under the Health Act, 1953.</P>
      <P>These services include general practitioner medical and midwifery services by a doctor and midwife chosen from those who have entered into agreements with the health authority to provide services.  The services also include, where necessary, hospital and specialist services, a supply of medicines for persons in the lower income group and maternity packs for all domiciliary confinements.</P>
      <P>Where an eligible woman accepts the hospital service made available by a health authority in a public ward in their own hospital or in any other hospital with which they have made appropriate arrangements, no charge is payable by her either for maintenance in hospital or for medical attention there.  The same position obtains in respect of her infant up to the age of six weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An eligible woman may decide not to avail of the free hospital service and to make her own arrangements for her confinement in an approved hospital or registered maternity home.  In this case the health authority will pay a subvention&mdash; usually 8/- per day&mdash;in respect of her stay there and will also pay for or contribute towards the cost of certain specified extras.  The remainder of the cost of maintenance is payable by the patient.  With regard to the cost of medical attention in the institution of her choice, the position is that, if she is attended by the doctor with whom she registered for maternity care under the scheme, the health authority will pay that doctor's fee.  If she goes into a public ward in an approved hospital, the agreement between the hospital and the health authority provides <Col N="1259" /> that she shall not be liable for any medical fees.  If, however, she goes into a maternity home or a private or semi-private ward of an approved hospital and is not attended by the doctor with whom she registered under the scheme, she is liable for medical fees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will indicate the up-to-date range of benefits available to persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts and their dependents (a) free of charge and (b) subject to charge; and if he will state the nature or amount of the charges, if any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that the question relates only to the health services which are made available for insured persons and their dependents under the Health Acts.</P>
      <P>The services available to insured persons, as such, and their dependents are the general institutional and specialist services, the maternity and infant welfare services and the mental treatment service.  The maternity service and the infant welfare, service for infants up to six weeks old is free of charge.  The remaining services mentioned are also free for such insured persons as are in the lower income group but in the case of insured persons who are not in the lower income group charges not exceeding 10/- a day may be made for general or mental hospital in-patient services and, in regard to out-patient services, charges of 7/6 for an X-ray examination and 2/6 for any other service are made for specialist examinations.</P>
      <P>All insured persons, in common with the rest of the population are, of course, entitled, free of charge, to the full range of the infectious diseases service.  Those who are in the lower income group are also entitled to the services provided for that group, including attendance by the district medical officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, a copy of a statement on the health services available to insured <Col N="1260" /> persons and others which is issued by my Department will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">AN ROINN SLÁINTE.</P>
    <P Just="Center">HEALTH SERVICES.</P>
    <P>A summary of the health services available for various classes of the population is set out below.  These services are provided by local health authorities.  Inquiries about entitlement to them or about their operation should be addressed to the secretary of the county council or, in the case of persons resident in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Waterford, to the city manager.  If, by reason of special local arrangements, the person mentioned is not dealing with the particular service, he will forward the inquiry to the proper person.</P>
    <P>A person who thinks he is eligible for any of the services and wishes to use them should apply in good time to the local authority as, in some cases, late applications will not be considered.</P>
    <P>There is no compulsion on any person to avail himself of any of these services.</P>
    <P>(1)  <i>Services for the lower income group</i></P>
    <P>Persons in the lower income group (that is, broadly speaking, those who are unable to provide the services from their own resources) and their dependents, are eligible, without charge, for:&mdash;</P>
    <P>the general medical service provided by dispensary doctors together with any medicines, appliances, etc., which may be necessary;</P>
    <P>maternity care service and infant welfare service (for infants up to six weeks old);</P>
    <P>hospital and specialist services;</P>
    <P>a supply of milk for expectant and nursing mothers and for children under five years of age (available at the discretion of the local health authority);</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> a maternity cash grant of £4 for each confinement;</P>
    <P>essential dental, ear and eye services (where provided by the local health authority).</P>
    <P>Note&mdash;General Medical Services Cards are issued by local health authorities to persons in the lower income group, for presentation whenever the services of the dispensary doctor are needed. Persons who consider that they come within the lower income group may apply to the local authority for one of these cards.</P>
    <P>(2) <i>Services for the middle income group</i></P>
    <P>The middle income group includes such of the persons in the following categories as are not in the lower income group, and their dependents:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) persons currently, or until recently, insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952;</P>
    <P>(b) adult persons whose yearly means are less than £600;</P>
    <P>(c) adult persons whose yearly means are, in the opinion of the local health authority, derived wholly or mainly from farming, the rateable valuation of the farm or farms (including the buildings thereon) being £50 or less.</P>
    <P>In calculating yearly means for the purposes of (b) and (c) above, the means of the husband and wife and of any unmarried sons, daughters, stepsons and stepdaughters living in the household are taken into account. &ldquo;Yearly means&rdquo; includes an estimated annual value of investments, property, etc., in addition to income in cash.</P>
    <P>Persons in the middle income group are entitled to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>a free maternity care service and infant welfare service (for infants up to six weeks old);</P>
    <P>hospital services as in-patients&mdash; free for maternity patients and for patients suffering from tuberculosis and certain other infectious diseases, and at a charge not exceeding 10/- a day covering all the hospital services in other cases;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1262" /> specialist services as out-patients &mdash;free for maternity patients and for tuberculosis patients, and at a charge of 7/6 for an X-ray examination and 2/6 for any other specialist service in other cases.</P>
    <P>(3) <i>Services for persons outside these groups</i></P>
    <P>Other persons (and their dependents) who, in the opinion of the local health authority, would be unable without undue hardship to provide the services needed for themselves or their dependents may be given maternity services, hospital services and specialist services.  The maternity services for these are free, but charges are leviable for hospital and specialist services not related to maternity or infectious diseases.</P>
    <P>(4) <i>Services for children</i></P>
    <P>Apart from any services to which they may be entitled as dependents of persons in the groups mentioned above, there is available for pupils of national schools a free school health examination service, with free hospital and specialist services and dental, ear and eye services for defects discovered at such examinations. A child welfare clinic service for children under six years old is available free of charge in some urban areas.  Free dental, ear and eye services are available for children in respect of defects discovered at these clinics.</P>
    <P>(5) <i>Choice of hospital or home</i></P>
    <P>If a patient, eligible for hospital services (other than for infectious diseases) prefers to make a choice, from a list approved by the Minister, of a hospital, nursing home or maternity home instead of availing of the hospital service provided by the health authority, that authority will, subject to certain conditions, contribute to such hospital or home towards his or her maintenance there.  In such cases the person concerned will be liable for charges by the hospital or home over and above the contribution paid by the local authority.</P>
    <P>(6) <i>Tuberculosis and Other Infectious Diseases</i></P>
    <P>In addition to the hospital services mentioned above, services are provided <Col N="1263" /> for discovering if persons are suffering from tuberculosis and certain other infectious diseases.  These services are provided free to any person using the health authority's scheme.  Facilities for B.C.G. vaccination against tuberculosis, immunisation against diphtheria, and similar measures of protection are also provided free by the health authority.  There is no means test for any of the foregoing infectious diseases services.  Cash allowances are payable while persons undergoing treatment for tuberculosis or certain other infectious diseases are not able to provide for themselves or their dependents, where hardship would result if allowances were not paid.</P>
    <P>(7) <i>Disabled Persons (Maintenance) Allowances</i></P>
    <P>A disabled persons (maintenance) allowance is payable to a chronically disabled person over 16 years of age who cannot maintain himself and whose near relatives cannot maintain him, provided that his disability has lasted or may be expected to last for at least one year from its onset and that he is not maintained in an institution. The maximum allowance payable is £1 per week.  There is no provision under this scheme for allowances for dependents of such persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he has seen a report of a speech made by an Irish delegate at the United Nations urging that adequate standards of literacy be attained by trust territories before considering them for independence, cautioning against cutting a territory loose to shift for itself as a new nation before it is prepared to do so and, in using Ireland as an illustration, stating that the responsibilities of independence threatened the foundation of the new State; and if this speech represents the policy of the Government towards trust territories and reflects the mind of the Government as to the ability of this country to endure the responsibilities of independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1264" />
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As a member of the United Nations, Ireland is a trustee of certain territories which are still under the control of non-native Governments, and has the honour this year of holding the chair of the Special Trustee Committee.</P>
      <P>Certain of these territories, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, are inhabited for the most part by tribes who are completely illiterate, who cannot understand the language of other tribes in the area, who have had little or no contact with modern civilisation, and who have had no experience of administration beyond the administration of tribal affairs.</P>
      <P>As a general principle, we hold, as I stated in a speech at the United Nations, that &ldquo;Powers which are in forcible occupation of foreign territories must declare their willingness to withdraw at the earliest practicable date to be fixed in agreement with the United Nations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As one of those responsible for the territories still under the trusteeship of the United Nations, it is our duty to advocate that the inhabitants of those territories should be educated, and given experience in administration, so that they may be able as quickly as possible to govern themselves in an orderly, efficient and democratic manner.</P>
      <P>In the speech referred to by the Deputy, the Irish representative emphasised that even Ireland, with all its well-known advantages of literacy, ancient culture, democratic traditions and experienced administrators, encountered great difficulties in meeting the problems of the modern world after the achievement of partial independence. He stressed how much more necessary it is that the peoples such as the inhabitants of the trust territories should receive the training necessary to enable them to make good use of the independence, which we advocate should be given to them with all possible speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to the last part of the Deputy's question, I may say that in <Col N="1265" /> a number of States which achieved independence in recent times democracy has broken down and authoritarian régimes have taken over.  However, as we successfully surmounted the efforts that were made at establishing authoritarian régimes here, and as our Constitution is now generally accepted by all Parties in the Dáil, I feel confident that the democratic independence of the Twenty-Six Counties is reasonably assured, and that we will ultimately extend that independence to the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to say that the speech to which this question refers was generally regarded as the best ever delivered in the United Nations on the subject of trustee territories. It was written and delivered by one of the team of brilliant young representatives which Ireland has the good fortune to have in New York.</P>
    <P>The full text of the speech can be found in the Library, and I am sure that all the Deputies who read it will be as proud of it as I am.</P>

      <P>In the long and rather tendentious reply which the Minister has given, he has failed to deal with the reason this question was put down.  Is it a fact that our representative in the United Nations used, in relation to this country, the argument that the British used in 1920, that we were not fit for self-government?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Deputy, following Deputy McGilligan's allegations in this question, is undoubtedly following the lines of a tendentious report published in the <i>Sunday Review.</i>  I want to say that we attempted to give the Irish people, through the columns in which the allegations were made, the full truth, but it was not published. Deputies can discover that for themselves by looking up the paper in question and considering this statement which I issued at the time to the <i>Sunday Review:</i>&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for External Affairs was aware beforehand and approved of the views expressed by Mr. E.L. Kennedy, Counsellor of the Irish Delegation to the United Nations, in his speech of 5th <Col N="1266" /> November in the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations on the report of the Trusteeship Council.  There is, therefore, no truth whatever in the allegation contained in the sensational head-lines in the <i>Sunday Review</i> of 9th November that Mr. Kennedy's speech &lsquo;embarrassed the Government.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is, of course, Ireland's duty in the United Nations to press for the development in the territories under United Nations trusteeship of the conditions necessary for stable, progressive and democratic government. This, indeed, is the whole object of the U.N. trusteeship system which is intended, in the words of the Charter &lsquo;to promote the political, economic, social, and educational advancement of the inhabitants of the trust territories, and their progressive development towards self-government or independence as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some peoples are still in a nomadic or tribal stage of development and not only have a low rate of literacy but have no experience of administration.  It would be wrong and contrary to the principles of the Charter for the Irish Delegation to lend, or to appear to lend, support to those who would play politics with the lives of such peoples, by demanding that they be immediately and without preparation of any kind thrown on their own resources.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some countries which gained their independence in recent years, and which were much more highly developed than these trust territories have had great difficulty in setting up efficient and smoothly-running institutions to meet the needs of their peoples and to compete with the highly developed industry and agriculture of old and long-established States.  Indeed in several of them the democratic processes of government have foundered and have been replaced by dictatorial or authoritarian rule.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" />&ldquo;The United Nations trusteeship system is intended to protect the peoples of the trust territories from tyranny and exploitation and to ensure not only that these peoples will attain independence and self-determination as soon as possible but that they will receive from the trustee powers the educational facilities and the administrative experience without which progressive, democratic government is impossible in the difficult and dangerous world we live in to-day.&rdquo;</P>

Since the new State was threatened, I should like to know from the Minister whether our delegate in speaking, cited Ireland as an example of a country which was not fit for self-government?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if in view of the persistent demands from the rural community for provision of running water supplies he will encourage local authorities to initiate major regional schemes for supplies, preferably by gravitation, in rural areas; and in this connection if the necessary financial accommodation to carry through such schemes will be made available by way of loan through the Local Loans Fund or other sources of borrowing at a reasonable rate of interest, the repayment of which, with ordinary maintenance charges, could be met from economic rents charges to the users.</P>

      <P>The suggestions contained <Col N="1275" /> in the Deputy's question are substantially in accord with my policy on rural water supply schemes where the circumstances support the provision of water supplies by means of regional schemes.  Such schemes will be found feasible in some areas but not in others where, for a variety of reasons, alternative methods, such as smaller public schemes or private piped supplies, may be preferable.  Where a regional schemes proves to be the best solution the local authority concerned will be authorised to borrow the necessary capital from the Local Loans Fund and a State subsidy will be payable in respect of the repayments by the local authority of capital and interest.  In addition, a special capital subsidy in Gaeltacht areas is made available for schemes by Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned I was dealing with the remarkable fact that on the two occasions when it was proposed to submit a matter directly to the people this charge of attempted dictatorship was made by the Opposition Parties. The Opposition, and Fine Gael in <Col N="1289" /> particular, seem to have an inherent dread of submitting anything directly to the people.  If this dishonest campaign is to be revived again on this occasion, there can be no complaint if we point out to the people the past anti-democratic record of these people and if we point out that in many countries where democracy has disappeared the change came about because of the impossibility of getting a decisive result at elections.  There can be no complaint if the people draw their own conclusions from these facts: the past undemocratic record of these Parties on the one hand and, on the other, their present almost fanatical adherence to a system of election that seems specially designed to bring about a situation similar to that which has preceded the collapse of democracy in many other countries.</P>
      <P>However, I would prefer that this matter would be debated in accordance with the arguments for and against the two systems of election in question.  I have no doubt that if the people are allowed to decide the matter in a calm and factual way in accordance with legitimate arguments, they will decide to replace this system by a system more democratic and realistic.  The speeches already made on the Government side have dealt very well with the main point: the dangers that are inherent in the present system of election.  I listened to some of the speeches here but I heard no attempt being made to deny that the present system tends to foster a multiplicity of Parties, nor did I hear any attempt to counter the examples given of the damage done in other countries by a multiplicity of Parties securing seats at elections. Therefore, it is hardly necessary for me to cover the same ground now.</P>
      <P>Elections in this country since 1948 have been contested by no fewer than 22 different groups, and that is counting Independents as one group only.  That shows that the tendency of the system here is to foster these Parties.</P>

      <P>Very well.  Altiri na hAiseirighe, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan, Farmers, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Independents, Independent Farmer, Labour, National Labour, Socialist, Cine Gael, Independent Labour, Irish Workers' League, National Action, Sinn Féin, Young Ireland, Independent Republican, Independent Unemployed Worker, Ratepayer and National Progressive Democrats.  As far as we know there are further splinter groups.  It appears that the Clann na Talmhan Party is also split and that the National Progressive Democratic Party appears to have been split almost before it was formed.  Apparently, the number is still growing.</P>
      <P>There were these different groups contesting elections here in the last ten years.  However, that aspect of the matter, arising from a multiplicity of Parties, has been adequately covered. I intend to devote myself mainly to the principal argument on which Deputy O'Higgins based his contribution. He seemed to base his case on a statement he made, but did not substantiate, that the present system was essentially fair and just.  I do not think that the present system is essentially fair.  It can be easily shown that the principle on which it is based is a wrong principle.  In fact, my views on the matter seem to coincide very closely with those of Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>The House has already had quotations of Deputy Dillon's views on this matter and I do not suppose it is necessary for me to repeat them.  I hope to dispose of Deputy O'Higgins' claim, but I cannot hope to compete with Deputy Dillon in outright condemnation of the system.  I can only say that the things Deputy Dillon said about the system in 1947 express my sentiments fairly well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this debate those people in favour of retaining P.R. start off with a certain initial advantage arising from the <Col N="1291" /> fact that the system has been given this title &ldquo;P.R.&rdquo; and that nobody has attemped to give it instead a title that would describe the operation of the system more accurately.  It can be shown that that title is a misnomer and that the effect of the system is to give disproportionate voting power to a small section of the people.  The differential voting power that it confers is conferred, not on the people who would normally be considered more responsible, but rather on people who appear to vote in an irresponsible way.  I think it is fair to say that the theory on which the democratic system is based is that the majority of the people are likely to choose from those on offer the type of Government most suitable to their needs.</P>
    <P>If that be so, if a case could be made for giving extra weight to the opinions expressed by any section of the community, it would be given to the opinions of the majority rather than those of the minority but, under the system we have, we give extra weight to the opinions expressed in the ballot boxes by minorities, and, the smaller the minority, the greater the weight that is given to their opinions.  For instance, a person who votes for a Party which gets only negligible support from the electorate may eventually have his fifth or sixth vote treated in the same way as the first preference vote of the majority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, the case I want to make is that equal consideration should be given to the opinions expressed in the ballot boxes by every voter.  The only feasible way to do this is by means of the system we are proposing now, that is, single seat constituencies with the direct vote.  We give people who choose candidates <Col N="1292" /> who can receive only very small support almost as many votes as they like until eventually they work their way down to a policy that is so conceived and so presented to the people as to command a reasonable volume of support.  But even if such a policy is fairly well received by the electorate generally, if a man votes for it only as his fifth or sixth choice, surely it cannot be contended that he thinks very much of it?  Nevertheless, his vote counts for exactly the same as the vote of a person who chose that policy in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I have often thought that if I were to try to arrange matters in my Department in accordance with this peculiar idea of P.R., I would, for example, arrange in future that the shooting competitions in the Army should be conducted on the basis that the soldier who could not hit the bull's eye at the first attempt would be allowed to keep firing away until such time as he did hit it so as to give him a chance of having as good a score as the marksman who could hit it at the first attempt.  That is what we do under P.R. The intelligent and responsible voter gets one attempt to elect a candidate but the man who votes for the small crackpot type of Party gets almost as many chances as he wishes.  He gets at least sufficient chances to bring him from his original choice to one of those Parties that approach the problems of Government in a responsible and realistic way.  It is not right to do this, and if a person in the exercise of his own free will decides to disfranchise himself by voting for such a Party, it is wrong that the State should contrive, by an artifice such as P.R., to give him what is very often a decisive voice in the ultimate result, seeing that through his ill-considered use of the franchise he has done everything he could do to waste his vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That kind of principle is all right at a sports meeting where the objective is to provide an artificially close finish to entertain the spectators, but if the objective is to establish the best performer in each event, then there are no handicaps allotted and all the competitors start on equal terms.  What <Col N="1293" /> P.R. attempts to do, by giving this extra voting power to the minorities in the electorate, is to create an artificially close finish to elections.  An election which is held to provide a legislative assembly and a Government for the country is an important thing and should not be treated in that way.  It should be treated in a serious and straightforward manner.  It should not be the objective to achieve a stalemate in an election by giving the majority one vote only and the small minority five or six votes.</P>
    <P>I cannot see what anybody can say is wrong with asking a man who aspires to become a member of the Dáil to go into a constituency and convince more people in that constituency than any of his opponents can convince that his views are the soundest ones before them in the election.  What is unfair is that after the people have voted, the returning officer and his staff can scrutinise the votes and manipulate them in accordance with a set of illogical and unjustifiable rules and produce a manufactured result that may not necessarily be in accordance with the wishes of the people at all.</P>
    <P>Under P.R. we are not satisfied to get a simple expression of their views from the people.  Instead of that we get them to indicate what we describe as their second, third, fourth and subsequent preferences, but we do not at the same time get any indication from them as to the extent to which the policies of these lower preferences are acceptable to them.  We take that inadequate information and deal with it, as I said, in an arbitrary way and from that we purport to interpret the innermost workings of the voters' minds.</P>
    <P>The advocates of P.R. contend that by this system one gets results which accurately reflect the wishes of the majority of the people.  I do not think that is so and it is easy to show it is not so.  It can be shown by taking an example of P.R. in its simplest form. In doing so, I hope to show the fallacy of the principle upon which P.R. is based.  Since the question of substituting single seat constituencies with the <Col N="1294" /> transferable vote has been raised in this debate, I think this example applies with particular force to that type of electoral system.</P>
    <P>The example I propose to take is where there are three candidates and one seat to be filled.  That situation may obtain in a single seat constituency with a transferable vote, or it could arise in a by-election, or in a general election under the present system towards the conclusion of the count.  Suppose we have candidate A with 6,000 votes, candidate B with 5,000 votes and candidate C with 4,000 votes.  Under the system of P.R., we eliminate candidate C.  The returning officer distributes his 4,000 votes among the other two candidates by counting the number 2's and treating the papers then as though these number 2's were votes for candidates A or B.  A possible distribution would be that A would get 1,400 and B 2,600.  These are added to their own votes and we get a result, A, 7,400 and B, 7,600.  Candidate B is then declared to be elected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no justification for that statement.  It may be said that if C's votes were not distributed, the 4,000 electors who voted for him are disfranchised, but under the present system, the 6,000 electors who voted for A are disfranchised, and if it is wrong not to give the 4,000 who voted for C a second chance, there is a 50 per cent greater wrong in not giving the 6,000 who voted for A a second chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> The argument in favour of this system, is, that since the voters who voted for C did not poll in sufficient strength to elect their candidate, they should get a second chance.  As a result of the manipulation of the votes, candidate A is defeated, and I maintain that in these circumstances the 6,000 who voted for him have at least an equal right to get a second chance of electing their candidate.  It is possible that if these 6,000 votes were distributed in accordance with the same principle on which the other 4,000 were distributed, they would go: 4,000 to C and 2,000 to B.  The result then would be: B, 7,000 and C, 8,000. It is a reasonable proposition that the 6,000 voters have an equal right to have their second preferences considered as the 4,000 voters have. Therefore it could be claimed that if a majority wanted B, a bigger majority wanted C.</P>
    <P>Take then the 5,000 who voted for B.  Their second preferences have not been considered.  It is conceivable that if their second preferences were considered, the result would be: 2,000 to A and 3,000 to C.  A would then have 8,000 and C 7,000.  I maintain it is unjust to consider the second preferences of one group only who have failed to elect their candidate, and to ignore other groups who have failed to elect their candidate.  The fact that you do it in the case of a minority only aggravates the injustice.  If it is an injustice to allow people to disfranchise themselves by choosing a candidate who gets a minority of votes, then you should devise some fair and logical way of bringing them back into the reckoning.  The present system only results in transferring the injustice&mdash;if there is an injustice&mdash; from the minority to the majority.</P>
    <P>If the second preference votes are to be considered, it should be done in the case of all.  I have shown that if you do that in accordance with the ridiculous principle that a second choice is of equal value with a No. 1 vote, you are likely to arrive at the conclusion that a majority of the electorate wanted each of the candidates <Col N="1296" /> and of course that is absurd.  But if you base your reasoning on an absurd. assumption, you are very likely to arrive at an absurd conclusion, and nothing can be more absurd than to allot the same value to a second preference vote as to a first preference vote.  I maintain it is nonsense to do that.</P>
    <P>P.R. would be unjustifiable even if it stopped at that, but a system of election that visualises the possibility of even a 13th or 14th preference vote being given the same importance as a first preference vote is obviously ridiculous.  We are advised under P.R. to exercise the franchise fully by voting for every candidate on the ballot paper and I can remember seeing over 20 candidates on a ballot paper. Surely if in circumstances like that the earlier preferences indicate degrees of preferences for the candidates, the later ones merely indicate degrees of dislike.  Under P.R., a vote, which merely means that a particular candidate is slightly less objectionable than any of the remainder, may be treated in the same way as the vote giving the person's first choice.</P>
    <P>It is unjustifiable to manipulate people's votes in accordance with arbitrary rules like those, but when only a limited investigation is carried out, it is worse still.  If there is to be manipulation of the votes, it should at least be done in a thorough manner and there should at least be a thorough investigation and application of the system.  I have shown that if you have a thorough application of the system on which P.R. is based, the system will be exposed for the fraud and cod which Deputy Dillon has declared it to be.</P>
    <P>Deputy J.A. Costello referred to the defects in the system.  It is obvious that he has some other proportional system in mind, but he wants to leave the position vague.  As he said himself, he wants to leave it vague so that the Dáil may be in a position to change it. So far, however, he has refused to be drawn as to what the defects are or how he would propose to remedy them.  One thing is obvious, that whatever alternatives system he has in mind, <Col N="1297" /> it is not for submission to the people. He wants a blank cheque to bring in whatever change he thinks is desirable. I have pointed to a fundamental defect and I should be interested to know how it is proposed to overcome that.</P>
    <P>One could think of other ways in which one could consider the distribution of the second and subsequent preference votes but I think, in any of these systems, and I can think of several, one would still be forced to the conclusion that they are all of an arbitrary nature.  The correct and the most feasible thing to do is to accept the vote as the people express it and to abandon the mathematical manipulation of the votes after they are cast particularly as the system of manipulation has no logical or democratic basis at all.</P>
    <P>In considering any of these systems, I am driven to the conclusion that it is much more simple and much more democratic to ask the people to indicate what candidates they want elected and to accept the result as they express it without making any attempt to prove by mathematical trickery that they did not mean what they said.  In the example which I have quoted more people wanted A than wanted B or C and therefore, in common justice, I think A should be elected.  It is very easy to give an actual example from an election of how the present system has operated unfairly.  It is very easy to show from the figures in many actual elections that there is no logical basis and no justification at all for the way some of the seats were allotted.</P>
    <P>However, it is hardly necessary for me to do that.  In the last General Election in 1957 there were 13 per cent. of the voters whose votes were disregarded in the way I have described merely because they happened to vote for candidates who got sufficient support to remain in the fight up to the closing stages.  On the other hand, there were 17 per cent. of the electorate who voted for candidates who got negligible support and who were eliminated in the early stages of the procedure and whose No. 2's were treated as No. 1's and in most <Col N="1298" /> cases their subsequent preferences were treated as actual votes also.</P>
    <P>If that 17 per cent. which I have mentioned would have been treated unjustly in not having account taken of their preference votes, then the 13 per cent. mentioned were in fact treated unfairly.  In contrast to that, you had the 21 per cent. of the electorate who voted for candidates who obtained surpluses.  Their second preferences were taken into account in a different way.  They were given fractional values ranging from .007 to .441.  The remaining 49 per cent. had their votes credited only to those for whom they were cast. No account was taken of their second preference at all.</P>
    <P>The net result of the 1957 General Election, therefore, was that 62 per cent. of the electorate had their votes treated in the same way as that in which we now propose they should be treated in future, 21 per cent. had their second preferences given fractional values and a favoured 17 per cent. had their second preferences treated as if they had been No. 1's and in most cases their later preferences also.  I can see no justification for this and I think it would be much fairer if everybody's vote was treated as the votes of the majority of the 62 per cent. were treated in 1957.</P>
    <P>The statement has been made here that the ideal Parliament would be one in which all groups would be represented.  That argument is also unsustainable.  Suppose we could provide such a system under which all groups would be represented in proportion to the support they got from the people throughout the country, I think that such a Parliament would not represent the will of the people.  There are so many aspects to the national life and so many different interests that there would be a large number of groups represented in such circumstances.  The object of elections is to provide the country with a Government to guide the nation along certain lines.  If you have a large number of small groups <Col N="1299" /> the only result will be chaos and stalemate.</P>
    <P>We have seen how the election of a large number of small groups has worked out in France and other countries.  Even though the people in these countries did vote for these small groups nobody voted for the position of stalemate in the formation of Government.  There may be some people who would be anxious to see such a condition of affairs here but their number would be very small. The present system is designed to bring about such a position.</P>
    <P>Elections are not a game.  They should be treated in a straightforward manner.  They should not be used for the purpose of experimenting with all sorts of ridiculous theories or to bring about interesting but unworkable results.  The results which P.R. bring about could be interesting.  It is interesting to see the jockeying and the bargaining for position that goes on in the formation of Coalition Governments but it is a very serious position for the country.  It would be all right if the objective was to provide a debating society for the entertainment of the people but the objective of elections is to provide a Government for the country and that it is serious business.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it is desirable to encourage people to adopt a purely selfish or sectional approach to national problems.  The nation consists of all classes of people and the proper approach to the election of a Government is to subordinate personal interests as far as possible to the interests of the well-being of the community as a whole.  P.R. is admitted to be designed to encourage people to organise themselves into political Parties in accordance with their own narrow interests and it was imposed here because it was clearly seen that it must eventually lead to political chaos.  The fact that it did not produce that result yet is due to the peculiar circumstances which operated here but it was with that object in view that it was imposed and it is time the people were given the opportunity to get rid of this dangerous system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> It is worth remarking that the man who presented us with this system made no attempt to confer the same benefit on his own country.  Deputy MacEoin has stated that since opportunity was not taken of removing the system in the Constitution of 1937, it could not now be claimed that it had been imposed from outside.  The Deputy knows well why it was not attempted to remove it at the time of bringing in the new Constitution.  He knows that at that time there was very strong opposition to the Constitution and he knows that it was just as unscrupulous as the campaign which is now being waged against this proposal.  The charge of dictatorship was made then.  Women were to be imprisoned in their homes.  Possibly, if this one more argument had been available to the Fine Gael Party, we would probably still have the foreign-imposed Constitution here and still have the Irish Free State here.</P>
    <P>I went looking for the rules under which P.R. is conducted.  I did that because I had noticed at different elections procedures I considered to be very peculiar.  I find there are 12 rules, some of them being divided into as many as 11 sections and some of the sections sub-divided a number of times again.  You would think that such a set of complicated rules represented a very thorough and painstaking attempt to establish a system of election giving effect to the idea of proportionality, to the idea of allocating votes in accordance with the number of people voting in a particular way.</P>
    <P>The first thing which is obvious on looking through the rules is that the idea of proportionality was abandoned in the very early stages of the manipulation of the vote.  I have dealt with the system on which the votes of eliminated candidates are distributed. Rule 6 deals with what is called the transferring of surpluses.  That rule provides further evidence of unfair discrimination against the majority.</P>
    <P>Rule 6 (2) (b) deals with the question of a surplus, when the votes credited to the elected candidate consist of original and transferred votes. It provides that only the transferred <Col N="1301" /> votes shall be considered in the distribution of the surplus.  This means that, even if such a candidate had 9/10 ths of a quota of original votes and received the remainder from one or more candidates, it is the lower preferences of these candidates who made a negligible impression on the electorate that receive further consideration and not those cast for a man who made a reasonable appeal to the electorate, even though these votes which he got by way of transfer may have been used three or four times already.  Surely, if the votes of an elected candidate are to be dealt with on a selective basis in regard to the distribution of the surplus, it should be the votes he got in the ballot himself that should be so considered and not those he got merely because of this system of P.R.&mdash;either that, or they should all be considered for distribution.</P>
    <P>Rule 6 (3) deals with the distribution of the surplus of a candidate elected with original votes only.  It provides that, if he has a number of non-transferable votes, some of these must be included in his surplus, thereby reducing the amount of the surplus available for distribution.  I think that that contrasts with the way in which the second preferences votes of a candidate who is eliminated are dealt with.  His second preferences are considered as No. 1 but, in the case of an elected candidate, his second preferences only have a fractional value depending on the relation of the size of his surplus to his total vote.</P>
    <P>This Rule 6 (3) further reduces that fraction.  It provides that a certain number of these non-transferable votes &mdash;in other words, votes in which the voter was so definite in his choice as to refuse to vote for anybody else except his own selected candidate&mdash;will be set aside and described as non-transferable votes, not effective.  This is a system that is supposed to interpret the wishes of the people accurately but here, where a voter expresses his opinion with the utmost clarity, the Returning Officer can take the vote and set it aside and describe it as non-effective.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough to give a candidate <Col N="1302" /> votes not cast for him as is done but to take from him votes that were cast for him in the most definite way possible and set them aside is a worse principle still.  I wonder how many people who give candidates votes which are, described as &ldquo;plumpers&rdquo; know that they are liable to be taken and set aside by the Returning Officer.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, however, the distribution of a surplus is at least dealt with in a proportional way.  They are distributed in proportion to the people voting No. 2 for the different candidates. However, all pretence at distributing the votes in accordance with the proportions voting in different ways is abandoned at this stage because a further section of this rule, (4) (d) provides that the distribution of votes will be effected by a physical transferring of a number of actual papers to the appropriate continuing candidate and that the papers so transferred will be those last filed in the sub-parcels concerned&mdash;in other words, the papers to take a further part in the election are selected completely at random.</P>
    <P>Remember that if, as a result of this, a further candidate is elected, it is these votes, selected at random as they are, that are eligible for redistribution. No attempt is made to distribute these in proportion to the No. 3's on the papers of the candidate for whom they were cast.  Surely, if the second preferences are to be distributed proportionately, so also should the No. 3's. Obviously, the inventors of this perfect system could not face up to the difficulties involved in applying their theory consistently and so they abandoned the principle on which it was supposed to be based at an early stage in the manipulation of the votes.</P>
    <P>It would have been quite feasible to distribute the No. 3's proportionately if the original transaction had been carried out as a paper transaction rather than by a physical transferring of actual papers but, while I say it can be done, to do so would make a system that is already cumbersome and complicated more cumbersome and more complicated and would expose P.R. for what Deputy Dillon described it to be.  I suppose it was to avoid that that <Col N="1303" /> no attempt was made to apply the principle of the system beyond the preliminary stages.</P>
    <P>I think that the vote of the people, which, is the basis of democracy, is an important thing.  It should not be treated lightly.  It should be exercised with care and it should be our objective to encourage people to treat the privilege of being able to vote in a responsible way, rather than encourage them to exercise their franchise in an irresponsible way.</P>
    <P>Under present conditions, the irresponsible voter can say: &ldquo;I can vote for this candidate, although I know he is not going to get many votes and then I can vote for someone else and it will not make any difference.&rdquo; That is wrong and the system of election should not encourage such an attitude.</P>
    <P>The line that has been taken in the speeches so far shows, I think, that the approach of the Opposition has been to try to make political capital for themselves out of this proposal rather than to consider what is best for the country.  The future of Fianna Fáil is in no way bound up with the abolition of P.R. Everybody here knows that, but still there is an all-out attempt being made to convince the people that the idea behind the proposal is to perpetuate the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Fianna Fáil Party will remain as the major Party so long as we can retain the confidence of the people and no longer.</P>
    <P>If the people at any time decide they do not want us, the Party will decline, no matter what system of election is in operation.  If we feared such a decline of public support, I think it is obvious that we would have been anxious to retain P.R. rather than change it.  We have done very well, as a number of the Opposition Deputies have remarked, under P.R.  The Party grew up with it.  Our organisation is geared for P.R. and if it is abolished, it must be disrupted and re-aligned to suit the new circumstances.  Therefore, if the only question in our mind was that of retaining our own representation at its maximum even if we were to lose public support, it is obvious that we would not dream of abolishing <Col N="1304" /> P.R., but because the possible effects of the system can be so disastrous for the country, we think the people should be given the opportunity of changing the system.</P>
    <P>I should like somebody to tell us how the removal of P.R. can favour Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil only.  If a Fine Gael candidate can get more votes at an election in any constituency, he will be elected.  Therefore, the Fine Gael and Labour contention that this will mean the perpetuation of Fianna Fáil can only mean that they realise their own policy is so devoid of merit that they could not ever hope to gain more support from the people than Fianna Fáil.  If their policy is better than ours, then surely it must be possible to convince the people that that is so.  If they succeed in convincing the people that their policy is better than ours, then the only effect of the abolition of P.R. would be that the decision of the people would be decisive, but if they are to gain more support than we gain and if P.R. remains, the only difference will probably be that we will then be in a position such as they were in in 1948 or 1954 to bargain with whatever other small groups may be in existence in order to form a Government, that is only if we were prepared to abandon our principles, as they were, for the sake of office. The system we are proposing means stable government.  It is well known that the Fine Gael Party, when they were first formed, were in favour of the abolition of P.R.</P>

      <P>It is too much to hope that the people are going to be allowed to decide the matter in a calm and practical way.  Instead of that, we have this spurious allegation that in some mysterious way this proposal will benefit Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil only.  It is not a political issue at all.  The question is a simple one.  Which system of election is likely to produce the more satisfactory results from the point of view of stability in Government.  We have no reason to be dissatisfied with P.R. from the point of view of maintaining the numerical strength of our own Party.</P>
      <P>We have no doubt that if we retain the confidence of the people we will remain the major Party.  We do not expect any increased support by the abolition of P.R. nor do we expect any decline in support if the people decide to retain it.  It is from the point of view of the well-being of the country solely that we decided the people should be given the opportunity of abolishing P.R.  An all-out effort is being made to prevent the people from seeing the issue clearly.  I think the Fine Gael amendment was put down purely in an attempt to divert the people's mind from consideration of the simple issue as to which system is the best for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point in the amendment is that this will &ldquo;interfere with the legitimate rights of minorities.&rdquo; No minority Party of the type envisaged when P.R. was imposed here has, in fact, developed because there was no need for it.  Possibly it was expected that a minority Party would develop but those who might have been interested in the development of such a Party realised fully that their interests <Col N="1307" /> were not in any way threatened.  They found it neither necessary nor desirable to organise themselves into a Party in order to defend their rights. On the contrary, they found it possible to take their place in the ordinary political Parties.</P>
    <P>The minority Parties which we have here are minorities purely and simply because their social and economic policies are not acceptable to the people.  But P.R. appears to be designed to give such Parties a decisive voice in the information and conduct of Government.  We are asked to believe that it is the legitimate right of minorities to dictate policy, to decide on the formation of Government, and to decree how long a Government will remain in office.  My conception of democracy is that it is the majority rather than the minority which should decide these things.</P>
    <P>The second point is that &ldquo;it is contrary to our democratic traditions.&rdquo; I have shown that P.R. is the reverse of democratic.  It differentiates between voters for no good reason.  How can it be held to be contrary to democratic traditions to ask the people to decide the matter, as we are asking them to decide now?</P>
    <P>The third point is that it &ldquo;is likely to lead to unrepresentative parliaments and to arrogant government&rdquo;.  If the proposal embodied in this Bill is adopted by the people in a referendum, under the new system of election which will then obtain each constituency will elect the candidate who can command a majority vote in that constituency. Parliament will, therefore, be more representative.  The candidate who is elected with some of his own votes and some of the votes cast for three or four different Parties cannot be said to represent any policy at all.  I cannot see how one could decide what policy is represented by a man elected by votes cast for three or four different policies.  If a voter says: &ldquo;I am in favour of candidate A, but B is slightly less objectionable than C, and C is slightly less objectionable than D&rdquo; if B, C or D is elected it cannot be said that any of <Col N="1308" /> them represent the views of the voter in question.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that this would lead to arrogant government, I think it is admitted that the straight system of voting provides the people with a more favourable opportunity for changing their minds. Changing public opinion will be more definitely reflected in the results under the straight system of voting than it is under the present system.  I cannot see then how such a system could lead to arrogant government.  I cannot see how any Government could afford to be arrogant, knowing the people had such an effective system of election for expressing their displeasure with arrogant behaviour.</P>
    <P>The fourth point is that it &ldquo;will make more difficult the ending of Partition&rdquo;.  Of course the majority Party in Stormont removed P.R. years ago.  I do not see how the existence of P.R. here could attract them.  Are we supposed to believe that it will be an attractive proposition for them to come in under conditions in which they would have to be a minority Party?  A strong argument in favour of ending Partition is that it has not been necessary to organise Parties down here on lines similar to those in the Six Counties.  The best way in which to influence these people to come in here is not so much to assure them that their rights as a minority will be safeguarded but rather to point out to them that there is no need for them to consider themselves a minority and that there has never been any need to organise Parties on sectarian lines in this part of the country.</P>
    <P>The fifth point is that it &ldquo;has not been demanded by public opinion&rdquo;. That is a matter which can be decided by the referendum.  If public opinion does not want the change, then the proposal will be defeated.  We think public opinion demands it.  When the referendum is taken, the matter will be decided one way or the other.</P>
    <P>The sixth point is that in present world conditions and in our economic circumstances it will impair rather than assist the solution of our national problems.  The economic circumstances <Col N="1309" /> in which we find ourselves are largely the result of the two periods of Coalition Government, during which we had a number of different Parties each pursuing their own particular policy and Party advantage instead of pursuing common aims.</P>
    <P>One of the most urgent needs for the improvement of our economic circumstances is that we should have a system of election which would enable the people to decide clearly what Government they want and provide the people and the country with a Government which will have an opportunity of putting its policy into effect and which will be responsible for its actions and cannot blame its failures on other Parties; that was the position that obtained in the two Coalition Governments.</P>

      <P>The straight vote system of election will have the effect of giving a Government, which will have the opportunity of putting its policy into effect.  The present system because of the incentive it gives towards the formation of a number of small Parties makes it almost impossible for a decisive electoral result to be given.  The two examples we have had of Coalition Government should be sufficient to warn us of the possible effect of a succession of such types of government on our economic circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The six points in this amendment seem specially designed to divert the people's attention from the actual issue under discussion, namely, that the present system of election does not work out for the betterment of the country and it is therefore desirable to replace it by the straight vote system and single seat constituencies. It was asked why this was not adverted to in the last general election. There was no point in introducing it into the election campaign.  This is <Col N="1310" /> something that cannot be done without going directly to the people.  It is something which should only be done when a single issue is involved and when no other issues enter into the reckoning.  Nothing could be done in relation to this proposal at the general election.  Why, then, should it have been raised on that occasion?  I have no doubt that the Opposition would have liked any other side issues like that to be raised so that the main issue in the general election could have been clouded.  That was the incompetent manner in which they had handled the country's affairs since 1954.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Defence, I am afraid, must have been watching sputniks and going into questions of the kind of calculation that would have to be made in order to deal with the defence of this country against unknown terrors.  He seems to have paid a visit to the School of Cosmic Physics or to some section of the school of higher learning.  I can give no other explanation for his approach to the general ideas with regard to how persons should be elected, on the one hand, and his mastering of the rules of P.R. down to and including Rule 6.  I suggest that he give his imagination, his mind and his reason a change of air and a little rest and go to the Dublin Corporation or to some county council and see how they elect, say, their chairman, or how, say, a county council would elect a rate-collector.  I imagine he will find there that where there is a number of candidates for one position there is a common-sense arrangement of elimination of the people who are not particularly desired for the position or have not the greatest preference among the electors for the position, until the number is reduced to the last two and then every member <Col N="1311" /> of the committee or council who wishes to have a vote is given a vote.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister consider some of the examples that he has in mind and about which he appears to be so outraged, from the point of view of whether the ultimate thing that happens, when it comes to the last manipulation&mdash;as the Minister calls it &mdash;of the figures in regard to a P.R. election, is that everyone who wants to have a vote at the final assessment or determination of the situation is given one vote?  I should like him to consider that.  If it is too far to go to a county council or if that is too complicated, it might be a greater relief from considering things at the level of the school of higher learning if he went to a Fianna Fáil convention and could figure out in a case where, say, there are nine candidates for a general election how the candidates are selected.</P>
      <P>I would imagine that some of them are eliminated in a common-sense, natural, friendly kind of way, at any rate a businesslike kind of way and, when it comes to the last two, everyone present who wants a vote is given a vote.  I would have felt that there was, an element of pure and fair democracy about that.  I do not know what other kind of system you may have, but I think the idea of the transferable vote, to speak alone of the transferable vote, is a lot simpler than the Minister seems to make it at the present time wherever his studies have been carried out.</P>
      <P>Before leaving what the Minister has so flat-footedly said, I should like to ask him a question in relation to his statement that the man who presented us with the system of P.R. did not present it to his own country.  I am sure the Minister would like to say that it was Lloyd George who forced P.R. on this country.</P>

It stands for the right of the people of this nation to determine freely for themselves how they shall be governed and for the right of every citizen to an equal voice in the determination; it stands for civil and religious equality and for the full proportional representation and all possible safeguarding of minorities&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in the person of President de Valera, at that particular time, speaking on behalf of the First Dáil and making a declaration on the 4th May, 1921, does not say, &ldquo;by direction&rdquo; or even &ldquo;under the inspiration&rdquo; or even &ldquo;with the agreement of Mr. Lloyd George&rdquo;.  What has happened between 4th May, 1921, and to-day or between December, 1947, and to-day?  These are questions which I would put earnestly to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The net proposal before us is that the country should be honeycombed with areas that would be represented by one person in the Dáil and that that person would be selected by a straight vote.  I like the word &ldquo;straight&rdquo; and I can imagine how that one word will be enough on a Fianna Fáil poster to guide people along the right lines&mdash;&ldquo;A straight people should vote straight.&rdquo; Take the straight vote in a constituency which will be represented by one person and in which at least 20,000 vote.  We have been terrified by the number of Parties that there are in the country.  If all these Parties put up their candidate in any constituency in which there are 20,000 voters the compact solidity of Fianna Fáil would certainly keep their representative at the top and he would get in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take a normal constituency where, in accordance with the development of their political interests and in an endeavour to bring to their political work the most qualified and the most capable experience and information that they can bring, men have organised themselves in a farmers' organisation, a Labour Party or a Party. They want to develop along a broad <Col N="1313" /> national line.  Let us suppose that they have found out Fianna Fáil, and feel that Fine Gael was so badly tarred by all the things that had been said about it that they, wanting to put in a real national Party, could not join Fine Gael, that they want to go off on their own as Clann na Poblachta did.  In a constituency of 20,000 voters you might have, in an election called in the morning, a Fianna Fáil representative, a Fine Gael representative, a Farmers' representative and a Labour representative and some new uprising people who had a particular type of interest, a particular type of qualification or a particular type of broad national outlook, who wanted to be a real national Party who would win the interest and the support of a large number of people interested in broad national questions.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose the Fine Gael candidate gets 5,000, the farmer 3,000, the Labour Party man, 3,000, the other Party candidate, 3,000, and the Fianna Fáil man, 6,000.  Then the Fianna Fáil candidate, with 6,000 votes, goes in over the 14,000 votes, cast for the others.  That is the pattern contemplated at the moment, that in a free country, where the people were encouraged to be free, to devote them selves to those aspects of social political, economic and cultural life in which they felt they were qualified, and in touch with, and having got a Parliament in which to express themselves, in which they might get enough support, they are now to be squeezed out.  The 14,000 people who think on these lines are to be set aside, and their votes made null and void, while the man with 6,000 votes is elected. That is the trick this Bill is intended to play on the people at the present time.</P>
    <P>The question of dealing with that type of trick is one thing, and it may very well lead to the introduction of that element of bitter criticism in the debate here, and in the country, that Deputies on the Government Benches suggest should not be brought into this.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce says that he would prefer to see this matter discussed entirely <Col N="1314" /> without reference to Party, and it is explained that Fianna Fáil has no vested interest in the decision that is being taken here.  That may be simplicity on their part, but, unfortunately, we have had a considerable amount of experience of that type of simplicity.  However, I should like to keep as far as I can to the principle of the question.  The Minister went a considerable distance to prove that the manipulation of the votes under the P.R. scheme is doing people out of their votes, and is giving an unfair advantage.  We say that the P.R. system, that is enshrined in the Constitution, involves a principle and that it is a principle for which the free Irish mind in politics naturally stood.</P>
    <P>Quotations have been given by Deputy Costello from the writings of Arthur Griffith in 1911.  I should like to quote one or two other things from his writings.  On 29th June, 1912, again in <i>Sinn Féin</i>, he was writing with regard to the question of the extended franchise that was to be associated, it was hoped, with the Home Rule Bill, with the women's vote brought in.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All that the extended franchise is going to do&mdash;even with the women brought into it&mdash;is to increase the power of the boss and decrease the liberty of the individual unless the electoral system is reformed on the basis of one vote one value.</P>
    <P>If democracy is to survive as a working principle of Government it can only survive on the admission of the minority to a share in representation with its strength in the government of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Twelve months before that, dealing with what the idea was of fair representation, he wrote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Sinn Féin voter in a Parliamentarian district, a Redmondite voter in a Conservative district, a Conservative voter in a Redmond district would be equally powerful with his brethren in the places where they are strongest.  A vote would always be a vote.</P>
    <P>At present a vote in a district where there exists a large majority of voters of the opposite Party is <Col N="1315" /> of no value whatever.  P.R. would invest every voter with absolute equality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the approach to how the people ought to get fair, and ought to get exact representation in Parliament. I do not know whether there was any consideration, at that time, as to why a Parliament was represented to give the people a strong Government, to take decisions on their behalf and to take action, or whether there was an undue emphasis on the representation of the people.  I think it is representation of the people that is wanted and, if the people are intelligently and honestly spoken to by people on the political level, then the nature of the Government, in carrying out its work, could very well be left to what the people, working in their own way and on their own political basis, would make of their Parliament.  That was the theory before the people were subjected to the trial to which they were subjected in establishing their Parliament.</P>
    <P>At that time it was undreamt of that the opposition to the passage of the Home Rule Bill, on the side of the British Parties, would be as great or as violent as it turned out to be But it did turn out to be so violent that an English historian, within the past 18 months, writing generally on European history, declared that the attack being made by the Conservatives against Home Rule in 1912, 1913 and 1914, was a rebellion against the British Constitution; that it was a crisis, not only for the Irish nation, but for the British Constitution, and that the guns of Sarajevo sounded only in time to save English parliamentary institutions.  It is no harm to repeat that so violent was the opposition that the people of Ireland were to meet in having their own Parliament established that, as early as 1914, looking back, an historian could say that parliamentary institutions in Great Britain would have been jeopardised, if not destroyed, through the viciousness of the attack on Government policy, if the first world war had not broken out.</P>
    <P>That forceful objection to giving <Col N="1316" /> their own Parliament to the people of this country was continued, not only during the war, but after the war.  It gave us the Black and Tans.  What was the response of the people?  In November, 1913, every Party, creed and class were called upon to come together and, if necessary, to arm themselves to secure the rights and liberties common to all the people of Ireland.  Every Party, creed and class came together in the Volunteers, so that from 1913, all through the struggle that went along to 1919, 1920 and 1921, there was a unity of feeling a coming together of every Party, creed and class in Ireland, to set up parliamentary institutions here.  That ideal, that was looked forward to by Arthur Griffith in 1912 and 1913, was declared in May, 1921, by the Taoiseach, speaking then as President of the Dáil that was established, as a fact and as a force, and we are sitting here to-day because every Party, creed and class came together.  They came together to set up a Parliament bound not only by its pledges to see that there was fair representation for every section of the people but bound also by the natural traditions and instincts of the people.</P>
    <P>Now we have a Government elected under the system that set up the State here saying, in its day of power, that they want to sweep away all that.  They say that Irish parliamentary institutions are to be based upon two artificially created columns.  One is Fianna Fáil, stemming from those years which we must regard as very unfortunate, slipping its hand into the &ldquo;Soldier's Song&rdquo;, which became the National Anthem, and taking its name out of it so that school children and people who wanted to honour the country in the National Anthem, and wanted to cement the country's institutions, would be expected to sing &ldquo;Since Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The other is supposed to be the combination or group of Parties which came together in 1948 to set up an inter-Party Government&mdash;Labour, which at that time was divided, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan and Fine Gael.  We were sneered at by the <Col N="1317" /> Leader of Fianna Fáil for doing gallant and heroic work.  He declared across the floor of the House that he hated that Government, that he hated Fine Gael, Labour, Clann na Poblachta and Clann na Talmhan working together in an Irish Parliament and implementing policies to improve our economy, our social living and our finances.  That was a group representing all the various responsible sections of Irish life. It was based on comradeship, mutual trust and mutual understanding.  It came together and studied the facts, examined the real strength of the people and led our people along constructive lines.  Those lines were adopted not by bargaining but through honest informed thought, not only around the Cabinet table but in Party conference and here in the Dáil.  So much was that so that when an inter-Party Government sat over there we had complaints from members of Fianna Fáil that the members of the inter-Party Government were talking up the time of the Government by talking. They complained that the representatives of the people who sat on those benches actually talked.  The Taoiseach hated them in Government and now the Minister for Industry and Commerce gibingly suggests that they ought, to come together and form the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what the Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks he has in mind.  We heard him the other day jeering at the members of the Labour Party because they could not make up their minds in relation to the Apprenticeship Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Then he went and did what the Labour Party suggested and consulted the two bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Now they want the Parties to come together in one Party to provide the Fianna Fáil Government with an Opposition at which they could always gibe saying that they were a heterogeneous group drawn from all sections and classes. It is part of the insolence with which the Government treats this House.  It is part of the arrogance which we say would operate if they were in the position that they could reduce to a nullity 13,000 or 14,000 votes cast for <Col N="1318" /> other Parties in the various constituencies and form a Government because 6,000 or 7,000 votes cast for the Fianna Fáil candidate were more than the votes cast for any other single candidate.</P>
      <P>As I say, it is trickery and a piece of insolence and it is treating this House in a way intended to destroy the influence of this House and to bring apathy amongst the people so that Fianna Fáil may hope to get this referendum through.  There is another aspect of this matter which shows how utterly irresponsible the Government is.  Take the other day when it was declared, with a certain amount of insolence, that we were to deal with the Committee Stage of the Apprenticeship Bill to-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Minister was to have the Committee Stage on December 3 and then he did what was suggested to him in the House.  That is all to the good, but if parliamentary institutions are to last and if they are to work in a way in which a properly oiled and adjusted machine is to work, without friction, that is not the way things should be done.  We sat here for four hours discussing difficulties raised with regard to the wheat levy.  Appeals were made to the Minister and the case was very strongly and effectively argued that the money raised by the levy should be repaid in the circumstances, when the conditions under which it was statutorily permitted did not materialise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the insolent way in which this House is being treated and I am discussing the type of Government we, have at present, a Government which is seeking more and more power in a way that is simply tricking this House and the people.  I merely want to say that the Minister sat during the debate and gibingly suggested that the speeches being made on the subject <Col N="1319" /> might be of local or political use.  He gave the House no information, no &ldquo;soot&rdquo;, as they say, for the way things were being done.  He then turned his back, went to his office and did the very things he was asked to do, but only after he had wasted the time of this House for four hours, while his own Party had sat behind him dumb and silent while important matters were under discussion.</P>
      <P>Now, at Dáil level, we are discussing proposals, that the Government wish to put before the people to change a vital principle in the Constitution.  The Bill was introduced before it was printed or ready.  A practice has grown up here that if the Dáil is going into Recess, the Ceann Comhairle will give permission to put a Bill on the Order Paper and give it a First Reading, so that during the Recess it may be printed and circulated; but in this case the House had been in Recess for quite a long time.  We assembled, and permission was given to introduce this Referendum Bill on the basis that we would get it in a short time.  More than a week passed.  Actually, the Bill was not prepared at the time and a week or so later, we were offered another Bill that has some afterthought reference to the measure before us.  We have not seen this other Bill yet, so that we are discussing this matter for the second or third time, one might say, without having the Bill before us.  That is how the Dáil is being treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This institution has been established because every creed and class in the country united to resist pressure from outside which would prevent us exercising our freedom.  Yet this is the sort of treatment we are getting from people who say they want the country to be run on democratic lines.  This is the democracy we get under P.R., when you have an Opposition in the House of various Parties reflecting various aspects of the country's life, keeping closely in touch with the life of the country, considering and explaining the position of the country and how necessary it is that the House should be informed of what is wrong and that the House should be advised <Col N="1320" /> along the right lines.  We are being treated in that way by a Government which is pushing through proposals of a very serious kind at the same time.</P>
    <P>In our reasoned amendment, one of the things to which we draw attention is present world conditions and we suggest that in our economic circumstances distractions of this kind will impair rather than assist in the solution of our national problems.  What are our national problems?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce on 18th June last in discussing references made to proposals published before that for the economic improvement of the country said, as reported at column 294 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;First, I wanted to stress the magnitude of the economic problem confronting the country, to make it clear, in so far as I could do it as an individual, to the Government then in office, to the trade unions, to the employers' associations and to the public generally that the position developing was far too serious to be capable of being put right by pettifogging, fiddling methods.  I wanted to emphasise that only a tremendous effort embracing all sections of our people would be adequate to rectify it.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I set out to try to demonstrate that it could be done, to try to deny the pessimism of those who were talking as if the country was finished, to show that by making the effort, given the combination of policies and plans embracing all sections of the people, it could be done.</P>
    <P>Deputies have quoted these statements who obviously have not read them or, if they have, they have certainly forgotten their purport.  My main object was to emphasise my view that the economic situation of the country, our unemployment and emigration problems, could not be put right by Government action alone, that there was no Bill that could be passed, no resolution that could be adopted in this House that would solve these problems; that there was no slick, easy solution; <Col N="1321" /> that it would be a long, tough job to put the economy of the country right and that we could succeed in doing that only if every section of the people was pulling in the same direction.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not presume to discuss the details of the economic situation.  I am discussing the fact that there is a serious economic situation and that, in connection, with proposals for improving it, one of the things pointed out in the economic development memorandum recently issued by the Government (P.R. 4803) it is pointed out in page 19, paragraph 32, that Ireland has the significant advantages of political stability among other things.  According to that document in the letter written by the secretary of the Department of Finance on December 12th, 1957, it is stated at the beginning of the letter to the Minister: &ldquo;This note records what I have said to you orally about the desirability of attempting to work out an integrated programme of national development for the next five or ten years which, I believe, will be critical years for the survival of the country as as economic entity.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply telling the House that we are dealing with this proposal in the temper and manner in which the Government is dealing with it at a time when we are told by the most authoritative and recent publications of the Government that the next five or ten years will be critical years for the country's survival as an economic entity.  When dealing with violent constitutional changes, intended radically to affect the foundation of parliamentary institutions and to withdraw from the Constitution a <Col N="1322" /> principle which not only affects the parliamentary representation of the people in the House, but which enshrines deeper and more intangible things with regard to the spirit that inspires the work of the people of the country and its representative institutions, I feel entitled to point out that these matters are being dealt with now at a time when we are told the next five or ten years will be critical years for the country's survival as an economic entity.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I insist that I cannot shut my eyes to the fact, or allow Deputies on the Government Benches or any other benches to carry on this discussion, without a realisation of the fact that they have been told by high authoritative quarters that the next five or ten years will be critical from the point of view of the economic survival of the country, that the Government cannot do much to solve our difficulties, that the Government cannot do much to solve the situation and that the greater part of the productive effort required is one that requires to be made by the private sector.</P>
      <P>I shall leave this with one quotation from page 18:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It would, indeed, be impossible for Departments of State or other public authorities to visualise more than a fraction of the future possibilities of productive development. One would naturally expect the principal source of new productive ideas, in a predominantly free enterprise economy, to be the private sector, enlarged by imported enterprise, organisational ability and technical competence, and the principal function of the State to be that of stimulating such ideas and helping to bring them to fruition by the provision, where necessary, of capital, fiscal incentives and other facilities.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this important element in the situation.  The Government, fiddling with the public mind in relation to this measure and with the foundations of our parliamentary institutions, is a Government responsible for giving a lead in these, matters, responsible for binding together all the strength, enterprise and energy of the people, and for holding high the credit of this country, so that, if technical or financial assistance from outside is required, our prestige in dealing with any matters affecting our trade and economy will find our people a strong people, supported by a strong and representative Government.</P>
      <P>I want to know what do the members of the Government and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party sitting behind them think?  What will be the position of our people facing their work throughout the country, if they are to be told that in a particular constituency with a straight vote, there is one Deputy to be allotted to them to be closely in touch with the constituency, and that, if any other Party goes up against Fianna Fáil, the rest &mdash;the non-Fianna Fáil vote&mdash;will be so divided that Fianna Fáil will get in on the minority vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask Deputy Davern, say, about dealing with this matter in South Tipperary.  There they have had farmers' Parties.  In certain places, integration has been going on and some of the farmers have lined up with Fine Gael and maybe some with Fianna Fáil.  But you had Labour in the field there and Clann na Poblachta also.  You had Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.  It is quite on the cards that at any election in South Tipperary, you will have, five candidates. What kind of argument is any Deputy in Tipperary going to make outside the church doors as to why the farmers should step aside and leave Labour in, Labour step aside and, leave the farmers in or Clann na Poblachta or anybody else, if they want to escape from under the wing of Fianna Fáil?  While they might touch them at Cabinet level, they might not want to do so locally in the Party conferences.  They are going to be deprived by the Constitution <Col N="1324" /> of the right of feeling that they stand for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let them go down and tell the people that, but in the meantime, why is it necessary to have all the twisty explanations and misrepresentations that Ministers and Deputies have given us here in regard to the proposal?  Why say you are running away from something stuck down the throats of the Irish people by Lloyd George and going back to straight, Irish things.  I challenge the members of Fianna Fáil to let us know in this discussion, now that we know what exactly the main principle of the thing is, as shown so nicely by Deputy Davern, what their views are.  I know I may be creating difficulties for you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, by suggesting this, but I think they ought to be able to explain how this is going to affect the situation and to deal with the economic troubles caused.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated in the most explicit way that if this was passed, the economic work of the Government would be tremendously improved and the general work of the country would be developed in an astounding way.  That may be found in the Minister's statement, but I think his statement requires to be backed up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A principle is being taken out of the Constitution by this measure that refers to more things than representation. It has been suggested here by one speaker that the Protestant minority do not require separate representation and that they have been integrated here, there and elsewhere in the various Parties.  I regret very much the unprecedented temper of the statement made by Deputy Booth here the other day.  To those <Col N="1325" /> who had the pleasure and privilege of listening to the voice and seeing the graciousness of men like Dr. James Craig, Professor Thrift, Professor Alton, Dr. Rowlette, Major Bryan Cooper, Major Myles and the late H. M. Dockrell, certainly the voice and attitude was far different from what we were accustomed to.  It was a really unprecedented atmosphere and I think a little reflection, and a little more touch of the comradeship of this House will exorcise Deputy Booth of any queer feelings he may have at present.</P>
    <P>If it is a fact, and no doubt it is a fact, that the Protestant community have been integrated in one way or another with the various Parties, they are not the only minorities in this country and they ought to have, and I am sure they have, an appreciation of other minorities.  Why should we depart from a principle in our Constitution that has been so happy and effective in its effect of integrating a minority of that kind into our various political groups in the normal way?</P>
    <P>We had the pleasure of seeing under an inter-Party Cabinet the two sections of the Labour Party joined together as a unified Party.  That is an integration which took place under P.R. and which otherwise might not have taken place.  There are other integrations necessary but one real integration which requires to take place is among the families and parishes, among all the people dealing with our economic work.  That is where, to the greatest and most disastrous extent, the policy of Fianna Fáil has split and crippled the efforts and energies of the people. If there is considerable unemployment in the country it is unemployment caused by opportunities lost as a result of much of the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party back over the years.  If there is unnecessary emigration, much of it is from distaste brought about by the stink in the political atmosphere, the unhealthy and unsavoury atmosphere which shrouds all our public and private life due to playboyism on the one hand and, on the other hand, pure dissension-making on the part of Fianna Fáil in many of their activities.</P>
    <P>It is not profitable to go over these <Col N="1326" /> things but it is inevitable to remark on them, particularly in the light of the way in which this Bill has been presented to us and the implications in it.  I have no hesitation in saying that, far from its being any kind of gift by way of last will and testament, I regard this as the last shake of the bag from which many seeds, of dissension and disruption have been poured.  When this is offered to us as the last chance the people have of securing their democratic strength and power, I say it is not so much a last chance for the people as the last challenge of this kind they will ever get.  I believe the people will understand the challenge for what it is.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, who has looked at so many of the doings of the Government leaders and knows so much of the reactions of some of their more thoughtful people, even if they have to surrender in a spirit of loyalty to their conscience, that an anti-Irish and an anti-Christian philosophy is inspiring their actions and that there is an opportunity now, when the people are being brought to face what is being done, of exorcising the evil.</P>
    <P>I have not made any contribution to the many biographies of the Taoiseach that have been made, but on page 86 of <i>De Valera and the March of a Nation</i> by Mary Bromage, the statement is made with regard to the Taoiseach:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The extent of his calculating determination surprised one of the newly elected Republican Deputies, Dick Mulcahy, who understood the chief to say to him when they met one day in Fitzwilliam Square: &lsquo;You are a young man going in for politics.  I will give you two pieces of advice&mdash;study economics and read <i>The Prince.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in April, 1919.</P>
    <P>The Dáil had been set up in January, 1919, and the full Cabinet was established by April.  With responsibility as Chief of Staff and Minister for Defence and in the circumstances of the newly established revolutionary Government having been set up and the struggle about to begin, I did not think the study of economics <Col N="1327" /> was particularly necessary for me and I did not know what <i>The Prince</i> was. I would like to be clear as to what spirit is driving the Government at the present time.  Some time ago a book was sent to me by a private citizen who wished us well in handling the heavy responsibilities of our political positions.  The sender considered it to be the most valuable book he had ever read and he believed it to be of value to us.</P>
    <P>I shall quote what a Catholic writer, F. J. Sheed, in <i>Society and Sanity</i> says with regard to <i>The Prince.</i>  He is talking of the realist and he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You will find the realist in the naked state, so to speak, among the practical politicians.  For these men (the Machiavelli who wrote <i>The Prince</i> is their arch-priest) the only problem is how should man be handled&mdash;that is bullied, coaxed, bluffed or tricked into doing what they want him to do.  Their art, such as it is, lies not in understanding men, but in knowing how they will react.  It is the art of getting men to jump through this or that hoop: but the true object of politics is to help men to be more completely men. Where the doctor studies man in order to heal him, this sort of blackguard studies man in order to use him.  You could make a sort of &lsquo;Politician's Handbook&rsquo; of their rules.  Every man has his price. There's a fool born every minute. Throw enough mud and some of it will stick.  If you can't beat them, join them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House deals with the State, and the individual who carries out his own work is incapable of living a full life or doing even his own work without the help of his neighbour, without the help of the community.  Throughout the community, we set up bodies of one kind or another for economic, social or business purposes and at the top, elected by the political Parties, we set up a Government and a State, and every day and every month that passes in the developing world has caused man to give more delegated powers to bodies of one kind or another, and to the State it gives a power which is of the very highest order.  To a State set up by man by constitutional or statutory means, they transfer part of their power and part of their rights.  They want to be free to go about their own business, business within their own reach, properly, and they have to see that the persons to whom they transfer the rights of the State are persons in whom they have perfect confidence, people who will express their wishes and honestly do their duties and they want to feel that they will be able to keep control over them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I give quotations here, I am giving quotations in relation to a certain type of approach to setting up a State and the policy by which people can be fooled or gulled into handling over powers, a policy by which advice is given as to how to win a kingdom and hang on to it rather than anything else.  I am quoting in relation to advice given by the Taoiseach on a <Col N="1329" /> former occasion, which has been referred to in rather approving tones by a biographer and which is intended to impress the people.  I propose to give just a small quotation as to what the advice given in that book is.</P>
    <P>I suggest, Sir, that I am in order in giving a quotation which shows why I am throwing out the challenge that the spirit that inspires the Fianna Fáil leadership and brings them to the point that they can hate co-operation between other Parties is a spirit that is un-Irish and unchristian.  I am quoting this small paragraph to show what that advice means and I suggest I may read just this further paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Its theme is how to win a kingdom in Italy and hang on to it, nothing else: no advice on how to be a good ruler or how to serve the interests of his people: simply how to get power and keep it.  It is not a book on politics, therefore, but a sort of Gangster's Manual.  As such it has to be tough.  &lsquo;A prince should have no other aim or thought but war.&rsquo;&lsquo;A prudent ruler ought not to keep faith, when it is against his interest.&rsquo; A prince must often act against faith, against charity, against humanity, against religion.' &lsquo;Men will always be false to you unless they are compelled by necessity to be true.&rsquo;&lsquo;Men must either be caressed or annihilated.&rsquo;&lsquo;A conqueror should commit all his cruelties at once&rsquo; (it unsettles everybody if he has to keep recurring to them).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is my purpose to refer Deputies, who want to examine why it is that some things happen which they do not understand, to F.J. Sheed's book <i>Society and Sanity.</i>  I ask Deputies seriously to consider what the tradition of our people has been which has enabled us to establish a Parliament in this country, in spite of the difficulties with which this country was faced, and what will guide this country through the troubles in the world, and raise it out of the confusions, the disillusions and the dissensions, of which there are so many in the country but the seed of which is here.  From every debate which is not satisfactory, the <Col N="1330" /> seed goes out and is sown far down the country.</P>
    <P>At a time when it is proposed to take the principle of P.R. out of the Constitution and it is declared that that is being done to strengthen democracy, we must consider what democracy means and the extent to which we have it as an inspiration and a legacy from the Christian faith. In the light of that, when Ministers and Deputies go down the country to speak at a meeting after Mass and preach what this thing is about and preach that the straight vote means an improvement in the economic conditions of the country and the strength of the people, will they try to remember that they are talking to people who have just come out from Church, having prayed that they may be partakers of the Divinity of Him Who partook of our humanity, that they are dealing with problems which arise, as their own financial documents tell them, from neither financial nor technical difficulties, but are really psychological difficulties in the way of development and that the element that is missing in our economy and our activities is the element that regards man for what he is, that he has his own gifts of humanity and divinity and has a supernatural order to assist him?</P>

      <P>The Bill is intended to deal with man's affairs, with all man's affairs and all man's strength. This Bill is an attempt to trample on them and particularly is it the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party in dealing with this measure here and in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only the other day, a military writer writing in the <i>Irish Press</i> dealt with what happened in France, which has come in for so much notice here.  I feel that if many of the people talking about Germany, Italy, Scandinavia and so on, would put their noses rather closer to what is happening here we <Col N="1331" /> would probably be a lot clearer about what we are thinking and what we are doing.  In France, they built a Maginot Line.  We saw the Maginot Line of the Fianna Fáil Party in the debate on the wheat levy the other day.  They sat there like lumps of mortar, like slabs carefully put into position.  Nothing could shift them; nothing could move them in any way.  They sat there until the blinds were pulled down here and then they went home.  Somewhere something came along the flanks of the Maginot Line and with their arguments got around them and broke them down.</P>
    <P>The Maginot Line of concrete is there but little Parties are coming in and putting up their heads here and there and they look like ghosts from the past.  Something is coming round the flanks of the line and something must be done to hit the people before they wake up a little more.  They are generations of the past and the memory of every Party, class and creed from 1913 onward&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I again assert that I came into Irish public life, and many young men with me, to stand for the safety and security of a generation of our people in the matter of the Home Rule Bill.  I also assert that, as far as Arthur Griffith and the Sinn Féin movement were concerned, they stood aside in order to give John Redmond and his followers the opportunity of having the assistance of the whole country in dealing with the problems of that kind.</P>
      <P>If there are Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party who are being misled by assertions such as those made by Deputy Davern, that is typical of some of the other assertions made.  They are unaware of the traditions of Irish political leaders which can be put into the phrase: &ldquo;Ní nearth go cur le chéile.&rdquo; There never was an Irish movement that had any strength or an Irish leader who added to Irish strength who was not aware of the necessity of uniting the efforts of the people.  It is because that is not the spirit that Fianna Fáil leadership has brought into the country that we oppose them.  We do not oppose them as a matter of Party feeling but because we are unable to do anything but resist a spirit of that kind.  The reason for that is that we were brought up and lived in an Irish tradition that all the work ever done for this country was done by unity in spirit and leadership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that we are keeping the Bill from the people but it is we who have made it possible for the people to decide matters of this kind.  We could not have done that as members of Fine Gael alone if we did not also have the support of members of the Labour Party, the Farmers' Party and of all the other Parties, and even of some people who now sit on the Fianna Fáil Benches.  I ask those people who now occupy our old seats on the Fianna Fáil Benches, where do they think they <Col N="1333" /> are going or where are they being led. Who is leading the Taoiseach in this proposal?  To my mind, the action he is taking here now is typical of action he took before.  He is being blinded by the conceit of thinking that what he alone thinks himself is right.  He is not right; nor has he been right all along.</P>

They are now going out, with all the paraphernalia of misrepresentation, to get the people, by their votes or by their apathy, to surrender rights that they have got over every aspect of the economic and social life of the country, to surrender rights to express themselves through political machinery so far as they want to do so, so that the State which is set up here will be behind all their efforts, so that it will be a reflection of their wants and their needs, so that it will carry out its work in such a way that it will safeguard and co-operate in the work of the people.  Let the people indicate themselves the kind of <Col N="1334" /> Parliament they want.  The Parliament will come here worthy of the people.  What is wrong with the people is that they have been divided and distracted.  That is why there is so much make-believe and hypocrisy by the Party responsible for so much of the confusion and the difficulties in the country.</P>

      <P>In page 4, to delete Section 7, lines 19 to 28, inclusive, and substitute:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>7.&mdash;Where the submerging of Fitzgibbon Bridge (otherwise known as Dripsey Bridge) situate on the River Dripsey in the County of Cork has caused or will cause loss or inconvenience to any person who, at the commencement of this Act, is the owner or occupier of land situate in the townland of Cronody or townland of Fergus, both in the County of Cork, the board shall pay to that person compensation in respect of the loss or inconvenience aforesaid of such amount as shall be agreed upon with such person; or <Col N="1335" /> failing such agreement shall be awarded by an independent arbitrator.</P>
    <P>In moving this amendment, I think it fair and proper to draw particular attention to the necessity for ordinary protection for the people concerned. Under Section 7, which we are hoping to have amended, there is no such protection for them.  It is giving to the E.S.B. powers which would mean the automatic cutting-out of any advantages or fair play these people would hope for.  At this stage, I do not see the necessity to dwell at length on this amendment which is clear-cut and explains the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the position to some extent.  Under the law as it stands, there is no provision to enable the E.S.B. to pay compensation to any person who claims to have been inconvenienced or made suffer a loss by reason of the closing of a public road or a public bridge.  The purpose of the section which I have inserted in this Bill is to enable the E.S.B. to pay compensation in such a case.  They had no power to pay compensation in such a case heretofore.</P>
      <P>The position that arose in connection with this bridge over the Lee, which was removed in the process of the scheme, was that the board were obliged by the Order sanctioning the scheme to build a bridge.  They reported that the technical problem was such that the cost of the bridge would be very high.  They therefore asked to be released from the obligation of rebuilding the bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not prepared, nor was my predecessor, to release them from that obligation.  I said it seemed to me, from certain information I had obtained, that there was a great deal of local misunderstanding about the amounts of compensation that the board would pay, if they were empowered to do it, in consideration of not building the bridge and that, if they made it known to the landowners concerned that compensation on quite a generous scale was in mind, it was possible they would get agreement <Col N="1336" /> amongst these landowners to accept compensation and agree that the bridge should not be built.  I said to them that if they got the substantial majority of the landowners concerned to agree to accept compensation I would amend the Order releasing them from the obligation to build the bridge.</P>
    <P>Eventually, they came back and announced to me that, of the 14 or 15 landowners concerned, by far the largest number were quite willing and had agreed to accept the compensation they offered.  In these circumstances, I am now putting the board in the position to pay that compensation. There are four or five others with whom agreement has not yet been made.  Two of them, I understand, are willing to agree to the acceptance of compensation but the amounts have not yet been finally negotiated with them.  Three have not yet agreed.  In one of these cases it is, I think, very questionable whether any right of compensation arises at all.</P>
    <P>It is now suggested that we should at this stage, provide for arbitration to deal with these residual cases and presumably reopen the question of the amount of compensation in all the other cases where agreement has been made.  I could quite reasonably have said to the board: &ldquo;Instead of building the bridge, you will pay compensation to be determined by an arbitrator.&rdquo; However, I am quite certain that any arbitrator working under any reasonable terms of reference that might be given him would, in fact, give a very great deal less to the landowners than they are receiving.</P>
    <P>One of the troubles in this matter is that there is no conception of the terms of reference that could be given to an arbitrator.  In his amendment, the Deputy uses the words &ldquo;shall be awarded by an independent arbitrator&rdquo;. There is no law on our Statute Book which settles the terms of reference for an arbitrator who has to calculate the loss suffered by reason of the closing of a public road.  There are terms of reference where land is compulsorily acquired or other interference with property occurs but in this particular <Col N="1337" /> case it is a public bridge that has been closed and there are no terms of reference for any arbitrator under any Act.  No arbitrator would undertake this job without having some rules to guide him, some principles laid down by which to determine the compensation in each case.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, would not agree that this is a case for arbitration.  It is a case for agreement.  Everybody there knows now that the amounts of money which the board are willing to pay are quite substantial.  In nearly every case, I think they exceed the market value of the holdings concerned.  Indded, many people in that area are about to be in possession of sums of money far larger, I am sure, than they ever conceived it was likely they would own.</P>
    <P>My view about the whole business was that it would cost a great deal of money to build the bridge which would be used only by a very limited number of people on limited occasions and that it was a far better idea to give that money to the people rather than to put it, into a construction of that kind. Therefore, I would suggest to the Deputy that he should not press the amendment.  The board is being empowered to pay this money.  They cannot pay it yet.  The Bill must be passed before they can pay it.  They should have litle difficulty whatever in coming to terms with the remaining cases and paying them reasonable sums which will be very adequate compensation for any inconvenience they may suffer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the former Minister refused to release the board from their obligation.  They had a very serious obligation to these people affected by the submerging of Fitzgibbon Bridge.  I appreciate what the Minister said.  When it comes to arbitration, those who stood out against arbitration may now be penalised.  There is no power whereby the board can deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I think the bridge should have been replaced.  Any amount of compensation will not pay these people for the inconvenience they must suffer for generations to come.  Some of them live in close proximity to the <Col N="1338" /> bridge.  They are much more adversely affected than those at a greater distance.  Personally, I think there was some shady practice about this whole business.  The board went around telling those people they would be compensated.  Had they any legal right to say that?  What was their motive?  I doubt if any arbitration settlement will iron out the whole thorny problem as it exists to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not come in here as a champion of those people who are objecting to compensation.  I have come in here to have the whole matter thrashed out.  The Minister&mdash; and I do not want to twist his words &mdash;said that these people were being treated very generously.  I am not asking for special treatment for anyone. All I am asking is that in this case the facts be considered in a proper light, completely divorced from what has happened in the past in relation to some of them.</P>
      <P>On the Committee Stage, the Minister stated that 13 out of 16 landowners agreed to compensation.  Let me inform the Minister that that is not correct.  In proof of that, I can give the figures submitted by the E.S.B. themselves.  The number of people affected, according to the E.S.B. returns, in the townland of Cronody&mdash; the main townland where the people are really affected&mdash;is nine.  In the townland of Fergus where they are affected to a much lesser degree, the number is three.  Therefore, instead of 16 landowners being affected, the actual number, according to the E.S.B. returns, is 12.  In the townland of Cronody, where they are much more severely affected, of the nine landowners, five objected to compensation and insisted upon the replacement of the bridge.  It also appears, as can be seen from the E.S.B. returns, that of the nine landowners in that, townland, the five who objected happen to be the five landowners with the greatest amount of land. Therefore, from that aspect alone, the people concerned in the area most severely affected are those who are not in favour of compensation.  They ask that the bridge be replaced.</P>

    <P>In view of the Minister's statement <Col N="1339" /> that they are being very generously treated, I should like to ask upon what basis the E.S.B. are making their offers in relation to this compensation.  The E.S.B. in their defence against these people have put forward the argument that it would cost approximately £250,000 to provide a new bridge, whereas, in actual fact, expert evidence presented by one of the most highly qualified professional men on behalf of the farmers, shows that the actual cost of the replacement, and so on, would work out at roughly £100,000. The E.S.B. in their defence try to put up the argument that, as it would cost so much to replace the bridge, it would be better if compensation were accepted.  What is the compensation based on?</P>
    <P>I do not for one moment ask that these people should get more compensation than they are justly entitled to. We cannot, therefore, understand upon what it is based.  The Minister is satisfied with the negotiations that have already been carried out by the E.S.B. representatives in relation to compensation. It is quite obvious that the Minister admits now that the offer for compensation was made before this Bill was introduced in this House. Therefore, this is not the case of a new departure.  In effect, it is being said to the E.S.B. that the offers already made at a time when there was no legal power to do so are now being legalised through an Act of Parliament. In other words, the offers which were illegally made will be legalised.</P>
    <P>Can we stand for that?  Why is it that the Minister made no reference to the fact that the E.S.B. have been doing that which they were not entitled to do?  I would certainly support most strongly the view expressed by a colleague of mine from South Cork, Deputy Manley, when he said that strange things happened in relation to the offers of compensation to different individuals, the playing off of one against the other and the threats indirect and, at times, direct, issued to people.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that if the section being provided here by the Minister is <Col N="1340" /> to operate the E.S.B. will decide whether or not serious damage has been caused.  In view of the fact that, in one townland, five landowners have stood out against them and refused compensation, what protection is in this section for these individuals? Unless serious damage is admitted by the E.S.B. then they are out of court straight away.</P>
    <P>The Minister is apparently still prepared to say that if the E.S.B. should become over-generous and decide there is a certain amount of serious inconvenience or damage caused the E.S.B. can decide compensation. Again, may I ask upon what basis? Why is it that the board's representatives can go to one person on their own initiative, with no one to hinder them, decide that the landowner stands to suffer a certain amount and assess the amount themselves?  They may go to another man, a man who agitated for the replacement of the bridge, and they may tell him they will give him £10.  There is nothing in this section to prevent their doing that.  In my opinion it would be far better not to legislate at all rather than bring in a section like this, a section which gives such arbitrary powers to the E.S.B.  Remember, these powers can be abused.</P>
    <P>In one particular instance a small bridge has been erected to accommodate one individual.  If this section is enacted, there is nothing to prevent the E.S.B. compensating this man still further on the ground that he is suffering a certain amount of inconvenience not completely covered by the bridge they have provided.  Nobody can dispute that that position may arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister made his case and now, I think, the other side must be considered.  In March of 1956, or 1957, the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton, inspected this area.  A good deal of surprise was occasioned by his visit to the townland. It is not often that Ministers of State take the trouble to see the actual situation for themselves.  He travelled the entire area and examined it in detail. The outcome of his visit was&mdash; this is a fact known to the present Minister&mdash;that when the E.S.B. asked for permission not to replace the bridge <Col N="1341" /> Deputy Norton refused the permission and gave them 12 months in which to replace it.  As far back as 1953, when this battle first started, the E.S.B. never said they would not replace the bridge.</P>
    <P>Now, having got the 12 months, they did nothing.  On the 19th December last, the people concerned had to assert their legal rights.  They moved for a conditional order on the E.S.B. to replace the bridge.  The case came before the court for hearing on 17th January, 1958.  What happened?  The Minister knows well what happened. The E.S.B. got 14 days in which to prepare their defence.  Just before the 14 days were up, they asked for an extension and they were given another 14 days.  They had 28 days in which to prepare a defence.  It is on the records of the court that, if the Minister interfered during that period, who might be considered as a person who should be before the court for contempt. Yet, before the second 14 days had elapsed, on the 3rd February this year, the Minister stepped in and gave the E.S.B. the power they were seeking, namely, the power not to replace the bridge.</P>
    <P>It is easy for the Minister to come in at this stage and say that he told the E.S.B. in the month of May to try to get agreement between all concerned. Why did he not adopt the same course in February?  He knew the E.S.B. had not got agreement.  He knew the E.S.B. had no power to offer compensation. He knew that the matter was before the courts for decision. Yet, he stepped in subsequently and interfered in a manner which has now complicated the entire issue.  I fail to understand why the Minister should say that, because these people are now being dealt with so generously by the E.S.B., we should do no more.</P>
    <P>This is not merely a case of championing a cause purely for the sake of the cause.  If the people are entitled to compensation, they should get compensation; they should get nothing more and nothing less than that to which they are entitled.  But it is quite obvious that under this section they cannot get that to which they are entitled.  They will now be at the mercy of the E.S.B.  It is the E.S.B. <Col N="1342" /> who will decide as to whether or not they are entitled to compensation.  It is the E.S.B. who will decide as to the extent of the compensation.  In these circumstances, I would under no condition agree to the section.</P>

      <P>Now, do not push me too far.  I want to say to Deputy Desmond&mdash;this is relevant to the question Deputy Norton is asking also&mdash; that, so far as people who are owners of land in the area and who had normal use of this bridge are concerned, nobody wants to deny them compensation. The E.S.B. want to pay them compensation.  The only thing stopping them is that they have no legal power to do so.  The purpose of this Bill, therefore, is to enable them to pay compensation.  It is not a question of forcing them to pay.  It is a question of enabling them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to power, I think I made it quite clear that the E.S.B. had no power, and has not yet got power to pay compensation. What I told them was that, if they got agreement between a substantial <Col N="1343" /> majority of the people concerned to accept compensation, I would bring in a Bill here enabling them to pay it. That is what I am doing now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton asked about the compensation.  One of the difficulties is that I have a very clear picture in my minds as to the people who should get compensation.  Deputy Desmond talked about 12.  According to my information, there are at least 14, and not 12, who should get compensation. Once you start talking in terms of compensating people for the closing of a public road or a public bridge, and provide some legal machinery, such as an arbitrator, for the purpose of assessing the compensation, you have no knowledge as to how wide the net may be cast and no knowledge as to the people who may put forward claims, and perhaps even get acceptance of these claims, before an arbitrator.  My aim is to enable the E.S.B. to do what they want to do, namely, pay out substantial sums in compensation to landowners in the locality inconvenienced by the closing of the bridge.  There is no question at all of having to force the E.S.B. to act.  They are most anxious to pay compensation and they will pay it forthwith when this legislation is passed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the legal proceedings, all I am doing here is empowering the E.S.B. to pay compensation in these cases.  No other change in the law will be made.  There will be no interference with anybody's legal rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to the amendment.  Apparently the Minister is afraid, that too many people might come in if there was any question of arbitration.  The amendment states quite clearly that it refers to any person who is the owner or occupier of land at the time of the coming into operation of this particular section.  Therefore, that in itself closes the ranks in relation to any outsiders who may imagine themselves aggrieved to the extent that they would be entitled to compensation. That, at the very start, covers it. Secondly, the Minister is worried about the question of compensation and the <Col N="1344" /> question of the arbitrator.  On what grounds are the E.S.B. acting as arbitrator? Somebody has to arbitrate. The Minister has given figures here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in saying to the Minister that the E.S.B. often gave compensation in other cases in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There were never such cases before.  They never paid compensation in such cases before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying to the Minister, through you, Sir, that had it not been a case that these five persons had realised that they had protection under the law to object to the E.S.B.'s compensation, not alone would it have been a question of compensation, but it would have been finished by now and the board would have paid irrespective of the fact that at that time there was no legislation empowering them to pay compensation.  It is a well-known fact that it was much to the upset of the E.S.B. when they discovered that some people, at least, did get to realise their legal protection and objected to the system.  That is what I am telling the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still say that I do not agree with the Minister's attitude that these people should be satisfied that they will get very good compensation.  I do not want to give these people one brown ha'penny more than they are entitled to but I want to see that each of them will get what he is entitled to. I am sure the Minister must know the bitterness that has been caused by the bartering, offering and tricks, made by certain people in relation to the compensation being offered.  Some people, because they refused compensation, were <i>personae non grata</i> with the E.S.B.  If this Bill goes through, there is nothing in it to prevent the E.S.B. from saying to some of these five persons who are defending their rights: &ldquo;You are getting nothing.  There has been no serious damage affecting you.&rdquo;<Col N="1345" /> What protection would that person get?  It is poor consolation for a person living in the townland of Cronody that A, because he agrees to the question of compensation, will get £2,000 or £3,000 whereas B., because he fought for the right to get an alternative bridge, will be told by the board: &ldquo;There is no serious loss or inconvenience.  Therefore you will get nothing,&rdquo; or, alternatively, if he is told by the E.S.B.: &ldquo;There is a certain amount of serious loss but it only amounts to £10 or £15&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not mind what figures the Minister may mention.  I want to see each individual treated in a proper manner and the only way in which that can be done in this particular instance is to have preparation made whereby, if the E.S.B. fail to accept that there has been loss or inconvenience or fail to accept a fair discussion in relation to compensation, the arbitrator comes in and says, first of all, whether or not in his opinion the particular landowner has suffered inconvenience or loss and, secondly, if so, to what extent.  That is what I am asking in the amendment and that is what I maintain is just.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of one remark by the Deputy, I want to give a quite specific assurance that no person entitled to compensation will be prejudiced in respect of the amount of it by reason of the fact that he was associated with the legal proceedings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it quite clear from the Minister's statement that, irrespective of the compensation offered, if those people persist in their right to have access to the courts and if the decision goes against them in the courts, they will still be entitled to compensation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  The compensation is because a bridge is not built.  If, as a result of court proceedings, the E.S.B. is required to build a <Col N="1346" /> bridge, then, of course, the compensation will not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, may I ask the Minister, should the decision of the court be that the E.S.B. must build the bridge, what will happen in the case where the E.S.B. have already provided in that particular townland a bridge and an entrance to the property of one particular person with whom they negotiated successfully? Will he get it both ways?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extremely complicated business.  I visited the place for the purpose of informing myself as to what exactly was at issue and I saw many of the local landowners who are affected.  It was estimated at the time that the erection of the bridge would cost something in the vicinity of £150,000, and when I went there and saw these people I sounded them on whether they would be willing to take compensation.  The offer of a cheque of substantial proportions to a hardheaded farmer living in a remote area was something which I thought would develop in the farmers concerned an affection for the compensation but, much to my surprise, every single one of them said that they did not want compensation; they wanted a bridge.</P>
      <P>I took the view then that, in the national interest, we were flooding the land concerned and were submerging the bridge.  I did not feel that the relative handful of farmers in the area should be asked to make unreasonable sacrifices for what was a national requirement, nor did I think it fair that the E.S.B. should be entitled to dislocate the lives of the local people in doing, something which Parliament was charging them with the responsibility of doing.  Therefore, I took the view that the E.S.B. should be required to build the bridge, as was contemplated in the original Order, and I told the E.S.B. that I would not release them from that obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reasons which influenced me were, that the submerging of the Fitzgibbon Bridge and its non-replacement would cause considerable local dislocation, that these people ought not to have their lives dislocated in that way and hardship inflicted upon <Col N="1347" /> them when the difficulties were being caused in satisfying a national requirement. I said to the E.S.B.: &ldquo;You ought to go ahead and must go ahead and build the bridge.&rdquo; After I left office, certain changes took place.  The Minister told the board, I understand, that he would authorise them not to proceed with the building of the bridge provided they could make a settlement with the persons concerned. I found a distinct prejudice there against taking cash compensation in lieu of the bridge.</P>
    <P>A certain position has now been reached.  The E.S.B., apparently, are prepared to make offers to certain persons and, from what the Minister says, I understand that these people have undertaken to accept those offers. That is all right and I suppose nothing serious would happen if they were all in the same boat and the E.S.B. could make a settlement with them all but the position, as I understand it, is that some of these people have brought their case to court to require the E.S.B. to erect the bridge and that matter is still at hearing.  It may very well be that the court will decide, on the legalities and the equities, that the E.S.B. should be required to construct the bridge in lieu of the submerged bridge.  If that happens, the whole question of compensation is up in the air because, presumably, a new bridge will be erected, unless the Minister comes to the House with an amending Bill to upset the judgment of the court by retrospective legislation.  I hardly imagine that the Minister contemplates doing anything of the kind.</P>
    <P>In this particular instance, the net point of difference between Deputy Desmond and the Minister is, who should determine the compensation. Deputy Desmond's amendment, as I understand it, travels a long distance with the Minister except in so far as the last line of the amendment is concerned, that is, that, failing to get agreement between the E.S.B. on the one hand and the affected farmer on the other hand, the amount of compensation shall be awarded by an independent arbitrator.  That is the net point as I see it, between them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> In this matter, not only have we to be fair but we have to appear to be fair.  While it may be possible to have, as it were, a horse-trading arrangement, whereby the E.S.B. will give a person more compensation than he would be likely to get from a legally appointed arbitrator, nevertheless, you do not provide for the case of a person who feels he may have got more if the person who has to pay the money is not to determine his compensation.  The E.S.B. has no high reputation for generosity in compensation claims.  Anybody who has any experience of the E.S.B. in that field will not be bursting with anxiety to pay tribute to the generosity of that body.</P>
    <P>In this case, the Minister is saying to the E.S.B.: &ldquo;You are the body concerned. You are the people who are liable to build the bridge.  These people complain that you are not building the bridge and we will let you out of the whole arrangement by your paying compensation.&rdquo; However, in this case, the E.S.B. is really the defendant and it is a bit unusual, if one is thinking of equity and fairness, that the defendant should decide what amount of compensation he will pay for the wrongs he has inflicted on the plaintiff.</P>
    <P>The normal procedure in a case of that kind is to allow somebody, standing between the plaintiff, on the one hand, and the defendant, on the other hand, to find a basis of agreement, if they cannot find such a basis themselves. The Minister says the E.S.B. offer is generous, but nobody knows how much these people might get, if the compensation were assessed in any other way.  Is there any difficulty in assessing compensation?  Maybe there is, but I am quite sure that among our 3,000,000 people, somebody can be found who is able to assess compensation, in the same way as somebody in the E.S.B. has attempted to assess compensation in the case of those to whom compensation has been offered.</P>
    <P>I think, as I said earlier, this is a case of not only being fair but of appearing to be fair, as well.  There is something basically wrong in allowing a defendant to determine the amount of compensation payable to a plaintiff. If they agree, well and good, but if it <Col N="1349" /> is a case of disagreement, surely somebody else should be allowed to do so? I do not think it is beyond the wit of man, or beyond the wit of officials in the Department of Industry and Commerce, or the E.S.B., to devise some type of machinery which will operate to adjudicate upon the reasonableness, or otherwise, of compensation, in the event of disagreement between the two parties.  I think the Minister should reconsider this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is producing false analogies.  Arbitration, presumably, must be open to every party.  Here the E.S.B. have not gone into an arrangement for assessing the compensation on some legalistic basis but upon a quite generous basis. Arbitration, presumably, must mean that somebody is going to discuss in legal terms the basis of compensation. To talk of arbitration now, the conditions under which an arbitrator is to operate, and to talk of how compensation is to be assessed on any legalistic basis, or any accountancy calculation of the losses suffered by these individuals, might mean that the amounts offered as compensation might be a great deal less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly would not contemplate the E.S.B. going back over cases where they had already agreed to pay compensation, but I think it would be quite unreasonable at this stage, having got agreement in respect of all but a couple of cases, that the question of arbitration should be raised.  There may, perhaps, be in the minds of certain people who are associated down there with the legal aspects of the question, a feeling that they may have prejudiced their compensation with the E.S.B.; that by holding out, they may have worsened their prospects of compensation. The assurance I am giving is that the E.S.B. will not reduce the compensation in these cases, and I shall be personally concerned to ensure that the compensation in these cases is in accord with the general picture of the agreements already concluded.  I could not go any further than that because there are a number of factors to be taken into account which I might not know.  The compensation, however, <Col N="1350" /> will be in accord with the agreements already reached.</P>

      <P>Thanks be to God, these people still have the protection of the courts and, in spite of the action taken on 3rd February last, they are still in the running.  Is there any provision in Section 7 to prevent the E.S.B. from giving compensation to these people for the inconvenience they have suffered in the meantime, should the court decide that a bridge must be built?  The taxpayer is involved in this also, because the E.S.B. are not handing money out of some private fund or &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; of their own.  It is taxpayers' money.  Is there anything to allow the E.S.B. to pay compensation for such inconvenience, if a bridge has to be built?  Surely the Minister is not proposing to leave a section in the Bill open to that line of argument?  There is no use in the Minister's saying he will give one guarantee or another. There is no guarantee that can be given that he will be in this House when the matter arises.  That is why I say the section is bad.  It is not giving protection to the people concerned or to the taxpayers.</P>

Where two people <Col N="1352" /> have a difference over a question of money and compensation, I think an independent arbitrator is the proper person to adjudicate in a case like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House is of the greatest importance. <Col N="1355" /> The proposal contained in the Bill is to alter the system of election of Deputies to Dáil Éireann.  If that is passed, as it is likely to be in view of the large majority which the Government has, and, should it be ratified in the referendum which will follow, without question it will affect the lives of many generations to come.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to alter a system that has been enshrined in our Constitution as the result of a decision taken, not 50 or 100 years ago, but just over 21 years ago, a system of election of representatives to the Dáil which, to my mind and to the minds of many people, is a valuable safeguard in returning Deputies to this House.  The electorate could make the utmost of each vote and the preferences that went with it to the extent of indicating a preference for each candidate seeking election.  By the intelligent use of the preference, a voter could ensure that the surplus votes, on the elimination of a candidate, would play an active part, if the first-choice candidate were not returned, in securing the election of the second-preference candidate.</P>
      <P>Many Government speakers, including particularly the Minister for Defence, have said that is a ridiculous attitude, that it was tantamount to giving a number of votes to the people who voted for the lowest candidate. I suggest that there is nothing wrong in giving&mdash;as is given under P.R.&mdash;to an elector the right to say: &ldquo;If my first choice to represent me cannot possibly be elected, then I would decide in favour of my second choice.&rdquo; I see nothing wrong in that.  One might as well say that a housewife who decides to decorate a room and finds that the colour she chooses is not available cannot have a second choice of colour. Surely it cannot be said that, because for some reason her first choice was not available or could not be secured, she had no further right to a choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ridiculous to hear the Minister for Defence claim that, contrary to the Constitution, the electorate have more than one vote.  It should be well known <Col N="1356" /> to anyone who knows anything about P.R. that under that system you have one vote and one vote only.  Your twos, three, fours and fives are preferences of where you would like your vote to go should it not be used on the first choice you make.  I suggest that P.R., as carried out in this country, is the fairest and best system yet put forward, and until a better system is put forward I believe it is essential for the people to continue electing Deputies in the manner to which they are accustomed and which has become a fundamental part of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>During portion of his speech last week the Tánaiste thought fit to taunt some members of the Opposition with the suggestion that, because they engaged in long and exhaustive debate on the merits of this Bill, they were seeking by some underhand means to deprive the people of their right to vote on the principle contained in the Bill&mdash;in other words, that they were seeking to defer a referendum.  The Tánaiste knows well that it is the duty of the Opposition to examine each Bill proposed by the Government, to debate that Bill and amend and improve it if possible.  Opposition Deputies have every right&mdash;in fact, there is an obligation on us&mdash;to debate this or any other Bill affecting the people.</P>
    <P>I wonder if there was any way of changing the principle of P.R. to a straight vote without holding a referendum, would the Tánaiste be so anxious that the matter be submitted to a referendum?  The Tánaiste knows quite well&mdash;but many people may not be so aware&mdash;that there is no way of changing P.R. without a referendum, irrespective of what the Opposition or the Government may say.  From the record of Fianna Fáil I have no doubt that, if there was such an alternative, we would have been told, as we have been told so often, that the Taoiseach knows what is best for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to alter a fundamental of the Constitution.  One would have thought that with such a proposal in mind the Government Party would have decided to have consultations with the Opposition groups.  I cannot speak for any Party but my own, but <Col N="1357" /> I am quite sure that no such consultations were either proposed or held with the Labour group.  The first knowledge any member of my Party had was when a certain national newspaper announced through its political correspondent that the matter was under consideration by the Cabinet.  Following that, the Taoiseach made a short statement admitting the truth of the rumour.  That was followed up by a discussion at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis at which, we were informed, the proposal that the Bill should go forward received unanimous approval. Deputy Norton has already paid tribute to the solidarity the Taoiseach received for that proposal.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the method by which the Deputies on this side secured the news of such an important proposal was nothing short of contempt of the House.  Perhaps the reason our opinions were not sought was because Fianna Fáil had made up their minds that, irrespective of whatever proposals were made by Labour or any other Opposition Party, they would go through with it.  Matters of much less importance than the electoral system have been the subject of discussions between Parties.  One would have expected that, before legislation dealing with such a fundamental was brought in, there would have been a proposal to set up a commission of experts, people versed in the knowledge of P.R. and other electoral systems, that such a commission would have been constituted and its advice sought. On such questions as emigration, the Seanad elections, licensing laws, education and language matters&mdash;to mention but a few&mdash;such commissions were established.</P>
    <P>It is strange that on this fundamental issue no such proposals were made. If such a thing had been mooted I have no doubt that agreement could have been got on this side.  It is quite true that no Government need be tied by such decisions, but at least we would have the advantage of a majority report and a minority report, with the facts for and against marshalled for consideration, both by the members of this House and the <Col N="1358" /> public in general, who, as we are told, will be the final judges.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the case has been made that there was urgency and hurry because of the need for a revision of constituencies early next year.  I suggest that that is not a reason but an excuse, because in the Constitution which makes provision for such revision, it is clearly stated that a revision of the constituencies must take place at least every 12 years.  There was nothing to hinder the Government having such a revision of constituencies within the prescribed time, then instituting a commission to examine the proposals of this Bill, whether or not P.R. or the straight vote was the more advantageous in securing good government in this country, and, having secured the report, introducing the Bill in this House, which could possibly be an agreed measure.  Even if it were opposed by the Opposition, by the same pressure of the majority of votes they hold, they could put the Bill through prior to the date when the life of this Parliament is to end.  In that way, they would have the advantage of having the views and the opinions of experts, of having a debate on the politics and decisions of that commission and still be enabled to put their Bill through and have a referendum of the people within the prescribed lifetime of this House.</P>
    <P>I suggest the reason that was not done was that if such a commission was established and should it happen that the majority report did not agree that P.R. should be abolished, the Government Party would feel that the electors might then refuse to accept the proposals at referendum time and throw out the proposals they would bring forward.  I again suggest it is indicated that irrespective of a commission, irrespective of what anyone in this Dáil on the Opposition side might say, Fianna Fáil made up their minds that the straight vote is to come and come it will, and the only thing that can stop it, and thanks be to God for that, is that the people will have the final say.</P>
    <P>Many of us awaited the speech of the Taoiseach with impatience last <Col N="1359" /> Wednesday.  Many of us were anxious to know what type of argument he would be able to put forward that would be so convincing that it would allow the people to accept the argument in face of the continued praise which he has been expressing for P.R. over the past 20 to 25 years.  The Taoiseach is well known to be able to put a very good face on a very bad case.  He is well known as a highly skilled politician and I for one was expecting some particularly brilliant line that I and many others had not conceived. To my surprise and practically to my dismay, I failed to hear the Taoiseach make a single convincing point.  He said that P.R. did not tend to stable government and said he hoped the straight vote would build up the Opposition to such a point where they would replace his own Party.  He suggested that P.R. gave minority groups representation here.  One would assume from that that each minority group securing the return of a number of Deputies on their behalf would automatically build up an Opposition.  He suggested that his interest in establishing the straight vote was to do the very thing he had blamed P.R. for doing.  I fail to understand that line of reasoning.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste followed with much the same proposals, except that he gave us a prophecy.  He could foresee in the foreseeable future a Government comprised of Fianna Fáil Party members, with the Labour Party as the principal and, I think, the only Opposition, with&mdash;if I do not misquote him&mdash;Fine Gael fading out.  That certainly is a change from the old story, even from the story Deputy Davern had to-day, that Fianna Fáil represent the workers, that Fianna Fáil get more workers' votes than the Labour Party get.  I do not quarrel too much with that belief. I would say quite honestly that Fianna Fáil have fooled many workers over a long time.</P>

      <P>He is dealing with the ideas expressed by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in relation to the capitalist Party and the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>If you will listen to me for a moment, I will relate what I have said to my next remarks and to the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the working class that that suggestion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that we would have a Fianna Fáil Government with a Labour Opposition, and Fine Gael fading out, is nothing but an attempt to induce a sense of wishful thinking in the Labour voters so that they might follow that and vote for the referendum.</P>
      <P>Whatever the intention was, it is now clear that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, possibly induced by the fact that he envisages this Bill going through, and being passed by the people, and Fianna Fáil being returned to power, is now clearly coming out to say: &ldquo;We will be the Government and represent the capitalists or employing classes and the Labour Party can represent the workers.&rdquo; That is not a position from which I would be at all averse, but I realise the Minister did not make any such suggestion with Labour interests in view.</P>
      <P>I also believe it is right and proper that the Minister should admit that his Party no longer claim that they represent the Irish workers.  He knows quite well that should he, by that statement of his, induce the Irish workers to vote for the referendum, it is quite probable that not a single Labour Deputy would appear in this House after the general election following, and after a period of even five years, he hopes, I suggest, that its effect on our organisation would be such that it would be very difficult, if not well-nigh impossible, for us to secure representation here again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the organised trade unionists of this country and, in particular, to trade union leaders, that it will be a sorry day for the workers of this country, if they allow a Party to establish a scheme that will set up a dictatorship in this House, and will lead to an Opposition of so small a number that it will be a mockery of <Col N="1361" /> the word &ldquo;Opposition&rdquo;.  I suggest that if the straight vote is introduced at the next election, no longer can trade unionists, through parliamentary pressure, exercised by members of the Labour Party, hope to secure compensation for increased cost of living, or hope to fight any attempt that might be made to introduce anti-strike legislation in this House.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach suggested the present system of voting led to such a multiplicity of Parties in Dáil Éireann that it affected the life and the stability of the Dáil.  Since the Fianna Fáil Party came into power, just over 25 years have passed.  Should each Dáil have continued for its full period in office under the Constitution, there would have been just five Dáil between 1932 and the present day. Those who take the trouble of counting the number of Parliaments since 1932 to the present will find that we have had ten elections, that is, five more than the normal, if the full period of time had elapsed between elections.  I suggest also, that if the student examines the records, he will find that in five of these elections, the then Government went out without being defeated in this House.  They went out of their own free will and there was no need for an election, if the Government had desired to continue in office.</P>
    <P>It was said, and perhaps rightly, by the Taoiseach, that they did go out, but they had to go out because they could not be dependent on a minority support.  They wanted the legislation they introduced to be their own legislation and not that dictated by a minority, and that was why they held the five extra general elections.  Well, what if they did?  What was wrong with having five extra general elections and what is wrong with continuing that process?  Would it not be better for this country that a Government, finding themselves unable to govern for one reason or another, should submit its case to the people and let the people decide whether they had a good case and whether they ought to be returned with greater or lesser numbers?  Is that not preferable to the suggestion now before us, that <Col N="1362" /> when a Government get in, they must get in with such a majority that over the five years to come, irrespective of what they do, the people will have no opportunity of showing their disapproval of them.  Once they get in, they are there for all time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>By-elections are incidentals. They are more or less an act of God.  It is very rarely we have a by-election as a result of a Deputy deliberately resigning his seat.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>And ex-Deputy John Murphy of recent years.  As I say, all others are acts of God and a by-election may or may not occur.  If one does not occur, the public have no opportunity of expressing their view, and, as the Minister for Education knows very well, a by-election can be held in a particular constituency and the result will not be at all a reflection of the general feeling of the people.  It can be taken only as an indication and nothing else.</P>
      <P>This Bill, I suggest, and it is admitted, I think, by the Government side, deprives minority Parties or groups of their rights of representation here in this House.</P>
      <P>I think the Bill is deliberately brought in to deprive minority groups of their rights.  I would suggest to any ordinary person, if he wants to find out what will be the effects of this Bill, that the easy way to do it is to take as an example his own constituency with which he is familiar and the representatives he is acquainted with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compare the two systems.  Automatically, I think of my own constituency in Waterford.  In that constituency, at the general election last year and over the past number of years, approximately 35,000 people voted.  Of that number, Fianna Fáil secured between 16,000 and 18,000 <Col N="1363" /> votes; Fine Gael got between 10,000 and 12,000; and the Labour Party got from 6,000 to 8,000.  Fianna Fáil, with just half, or slightly over half, secured two Deputies, or 50 per cent. of the representation.  Fine Gael with roughly about 33 per cent. secured only one. They had not sufficient to secure the second, and the Labour Party, with about 25 per cent. of the votes, also secured representation.  That is as reasonable and fair a method of electing representatives of the people as anyone could think of.</P>
    <P>Should you change that method, I have no doubt that, with careful selection of the constituencies, it is quite on the cards that Fianna Fáil would turn that into a 100 per cent. success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nonsense and the Deputy knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt about it in my own mind, but I hope I am wrong.  The Bill, it is admitted, is a Bill to introduce a new system to take from smaller groups their representation and to turn it to the larger Parties. I think there is no argument on that, but I suggest that it is contrary to democracy, as we know it in this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister for External Affairs, on last Thursday, took Deputy Norton to task for mentioning the effect which the Bill would have on religious groups, without indicating what religions they were.  He spoke as if Deputy Norton had sought to introduce into the debate a subject that should not be ventilated in any way.  He indicated that people of a different religious persuasion from that of the majority in the country could go into any of the Parties in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is quite so, but, equally so, people of any persuasion, political, religious or vocational, have a perfect right to band themselves together for the advancement of their religious beliefs, their political convictions or of their vocational life such as farming, labour or any other avocation.  What is wrong with that right of people to be represented here in this House and, through the medium of their Dáil <Col N="1364" /> Deputy, to endeavour to persuade the other representatives of the people of the justice of their case?  I would suggest that, if you fail to give the people this right, you cannot stop them from uniting into bodies and forming organisations of that kind.  If you do stop them from coming here by constitutional means, are you not giving them the excuse to say: &ldquo;What we cannot get constitutionally, we will have to get some other way&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I suggest that it is a bad day's work to deprive any small Party, be it Labour, Clann na Poblachta, Sinn Féin or any other Party, who feel they have a right to send representatives here, of the right to do so.  I would have felt that the Government would have been well advised to extend and widen the Constitution, to encourage minority groups to seek representation through our national Assembly.  It is foolish to suggest, as the Minister suggested, that this measure can have no effect on Partition or that, should ever the happy day come when the people of the North will unite with the people of the South, the people of the North will not consider that their minority and sectional interests would be lost sight of under the system of voting here.</P>
    <P>There is a saying that the poacher makes the best gamekeeper.  If there is any truth in all the stories we have heard of the gerrymandering in the North to keep the Catholic minority out of power, it is quite reasonable to expect the thought to enter their heads, if they ever unite with the Southern Parliament with the same system of voting, that the same game as they have played would then be played against them.  I do not think that is a thought which would encourage anyone on the other side of the Border to look with any great favour on the question of unity.  They would need to have assurance that each group, irrespective of class, creed or colour, would have its interests represented in the National Parliament.</P>
    <P>It may well be said that these things are not likely to happen, but, without mentioning the name in this House of the Parliament concerned, because every country has a perfect right to <Col N="1365" /> do things on its own, I should like to refer Deputies to the results of recent elections which were broadcast by the B.B.C. and Radio Éireann. These results were proof of the methods by which certain people received large representation in these elections and other groups, with ten times as many votes, were reduced by practically 90 per cent.</P>

      <P>I could not agree with the suggestion by the Minister for External Affairs last Thursday that there is no need for a Farmers' Party in this country, that the farmers in the <Col N="1366" /> Fianna Fáil Party would look after the interests of all the farmers and presumably, although he did not say it because Deputy Lemass had said it, that there was no need for a Workers' Party.  Deputy Davern said to-day that Fianna Fáil would look out for the farmers and the labourers.  There is a slight difference.  The idea was that all the people would be looked after, that there was no need for any Opposition, that his Party would deal with all that. It is a point of view.</P>
      <P>The farmers of this country, having watched the vote on the motion introduced on the wheat levy&mdash;I think, by the Fine Gael Party&mdash;would be very silly to pin all their faith on the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The national teachers would be very foolish to pin all their faith on the national teachers in Fianna Fáil if they think of the teachers' strike.  I shall grant to Fianna Fáil that the Party has complete control over its Deputies.  Even Deputy Corry, who is inclined to kick over the traces, can very well be controlled when it comes to going into the division lobby.  Therefore, I do not agree with the suggestion that there is no need for the small groups. However, whether or not I agree, it is very strange to suggest that there is no need for vocational groups such as farmers, labourers and others in this House when the whole system of election to the revised Seanad, a system introduced by the present Taoiseach to replace the old one, is based completely on vocational representation and election under P.R.  Why different treatment for the Dáil as compared with the Seanad?  We both deal with the legislation of the country. For the life of me, I cannot see why in one House of Parliament we have vocational representation, elected by P.R., and that for this House it is suggested we should not have that vocational representation, that there is no need for it and that we should have a straight vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was an ex-leader of the Labour Party, ex-Senator T. J. O'Connell, who wrote lately in one of <Col N="1367" /> the evening papers asking why it was, even if we had to have single-seat constituencies, the man to represent the people of a constituency of, say, 20,000 people could not be elected on the single transferable vote.  He instanced how a man securing 26 per cent. of the total votes&mdash;say, 26 out of 100 votes as against the 74 secured by the other groups&mdash;had to be elected. Either Mr. O'Connell is being very cute and is writing to the paper only to draw attention to the matter or else he is being very foolish. Obviously, there is a reason for it.  If you had a transferable vote it would mean that Fianna Fáil could lose the seat and then what was the object of bringing in the Bill at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and you might as well have left it the way it was. Therefore, I feel that Mr. O'Connell must be very innocent or else&mdash;as I really believe&mdash;very intelligent in drawing the people's attention to that fact.</P>
      <P>The suggestion has been made that criss-cross voting&mdash;No. 1, Labour; No. 2, Clann na Poblachta; No. 3, Fine Gael; No. 4, Farmers, or <i>vice versa</i> or any way around&mdash;has something fundamentally wrong with it.  The Minister for Defence gave a long dissertation to-day on how stupid, unreal and unfair it is.  I think it is quite a good thing that the process of picking your own Party and the Party next less disagreeable to you, if not the next most favourable, should be in existence as in that way you get some co-operation and agreement.  That is particularly so if you intend to form a Government such as the inter-Party Government or, as Fianna Fáil prefer to call it, the Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with both the farmers and the labourers of this country having to sit down in a Cabinet and either side being able to achieve exactly what is best for them or being able to hammer out an agreed solution or going as far on the road as they possibly can by co-operating with and helping one another.  There is nothing <Col N="1368" /> wrong in any number of Parties, be they ever so opposite in their views, finding a common factor that can bring them to some measure of prosperity higher than that which they had at the moment they made that agreement.</P>
    <P>It was on that basis that the inter-Party Government were proceeding and would have continued to proceed were it not for certain factors which brought about dissolution on two occasions&mdash;(1) the Health Bill and (2) the fact that certain measures taken by the inter-Party Government resulted in severe unemployment and that a certain group, which had been supporting the Government, indicated that they were withdrawing their support, which they had a perfect right to do if they wanted to.  Were it not for these two factors, I believe we could have continued in Government, weathered the storm and done as good a job as, if not a much better job than, the present Government are doing with 60,000 persons emigrating each year for the past two years.</P>
    <P>A point with which I had intended to deal was the suggestion that P.R. was forced on this country by England. Deputy Mulcahy dealt with that effectively to-day.  He quoted the words of the present Taoiseach when he was President of the first Dáil, speaking in May, 1921, when, without reservation, he indicated that he stood behind the principles of the 1916 Proclamation and included in his remarks P.R. or sectional representation in the Parliament of the country, the ideal Parliament that followed from that.  I do not think any words of mine could add to what Deputy Mulcahy said to-day or to the quotation given.</P>
    <P>The Constitution of 1921 was arrived at by many of the 1916 Leaders.  It is true that certain groups had broken away to the Cumann na nGaedheal people of 1922 comprised, in the main, of many prominent people of the 1916 Proclamation standard and that they saw fit to incorporate in the first Constitution the system of election by P.R. Furthermore, after 15 years' experience of P.R., the Taoiseach in 1937 decided to include the same <Col N="1369" /> system of election in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is very strange that it was only when the smaller Parties combined in 1948 to put up an opposition Government to the Government which had been in existence for 16 years that this sudden distaste for the system of P.R. developed.  It is true we had rumblings at various times, but at no time was any definite promise given by Fianna Fáil: &ldquo;If we are re-elected, we will take steps to abolish P.R.&rdquo; It is only since 1948 they have found out there was an alternative and now they know that any time the people want an alternative Government, it can always be got.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence stated to-day that there were 22 different Parties, including Independents, splinter groups or minority groups as he called them, contesting elections from 1948.  Having repeated many of them by different names, such as Aiseirghe and Clann na Poblachta, which I believe are practically the same group, giving National Labour and the Labour Party as two separate groups, Farmers and Independent Farmers, and various others, he succeeded in giving us 22 different groups, all with different shades of opinion.  But he did not mention that without abolishing P.R., without any action of the Government in relation to a straight vote, the public, in their wisdom, succeeded in whittling down those 22 different groups, some of which exist in the present House.  The public are very wise.  You can form splinter groups; you can form any kind of association and call it what you will; but when you contest an election, you do not come back here, unless you have something to offer.</P>
    <P>It was slightly unworthy of the Minister for Defence to cast doubts on the integrity of returning officers in the counting of votes under P.R. The impression he gave me was that he tried to imply that there was something dishonest about the election of candidates under P.R.  I do not think that is so.  He may disagree with the principle of the election under the system, but it is not fair to suggest there was anything dishonest in this set of rules.  Whether they were good <Col N="1370" /> or bad, they were the same for all Parties, and I am convinced that the interpretation of how the people voted followed exactly on the way the ballot papers were marked and the results achieved from that were the exact results issued, subject all the time, to the human element and the error that can be made in a count, by either a counter or a scrutineer.  I feel sure that the Minister for Defence, if he reads his words in the Official Report, will agree with me that his remarks could be misconstrued in a manner he would not like or with which I certainly would not like to be associated.</P>
    <P>In connection with the commission which it is proposed to set up under this Bill to draw the boundaries of the constituencies&mdash;one might call it the boundary commission&mdash;it is proposed to have a judge appointed by the President, to have three representatives from the Government side appointed by the Taoiseach and three from the Opposition appointed by the Ceann Comhairle.  In the event of disagreement between the members of that commission and their not being able to arrive at a decision, the chairman is then empowered and obliged to draw the boundaries himself and any decision come to cannot, I understand, be upset even by the courts of law.</P>
    <P>I can see a commission drawn from all Parties in this House coming to agreement on many matters but I should be inclined to think that on the vital matter of boundaries, it is practically a 100 to one bet that there will be disagreement, which will leave it to one man to decide.  Because no one has yet been appointed, I can, without any personal reflection on any judge, suggest that it would be very hard to appoint any judge who will be so detached from the political affairs of this nation as to be a Solomon when it comes to exercising this function.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Kyne leaves the House, as he may in a short time, I should like just to correct any misapprehension he may have as to what the Minister for Defence actually said here this evening when he was dealing with the function of returning officers in connection with the transfer of votes.  I was listening to the Minister's speech this afternoon when he was dealing with that point.  He made the point that the Third Schedule of the Electoral Act, 1923, imposes upon returning officers the obligation of selecting, at a certain stage of the count, votes by lot, so to speak.  It was that system he was criticising and not the function of returning officers in implementing it.  Returning officers have no alternative and I am sure that, if the Deputy reads that part of the Minister's speech, he will find that the Minister made no attempt to cast any reflection whatever on returning officers or on their manner of carrying out their functions.</P>

      <P>If there has been any common theme running through the <Col N="1372" /> Second Reading debate on this Bill&mdash; and not only through the Second Reading debate but also through the unprecedented First Reading debate&mdash; it is the allegation of arrogance and dictatorship on the part of the Government in introducing this measure. What savours less of arrogance than that the duly elected Government, within the Rules of Order of this House, within the provisions of law, and within the provisions of the Constitution should introduce a measure such as this and, having passed it, as it will be passed, should then submit it by way of referendum to the people finally to decide the issue?  Where is the arrogance and where is the dictatorship in that particular exercise?</P>
      <P>We have been accused by Deputy Costello, particularly in his speech on the First Reading, of throwing the country into bitter controversy.  We were accused by Deputy Norton on Wednesday last of causing division amongst the people.  When Fianna Fáil decided to introduce this measure they hoped it would be discussed in an objective and reasoned manner.  We do not want any bitter controversy either inside or outside the Dáil.  We do not want any controversy between Parties in their approach to this measure.  All we want is an objective debate and, when the issue ultimately reaches the people, we want a calm and reasoned approach to it.  If there has been any controversial matter raised in the course of the debate, then the Opposition will have to bear their fair share of the responsibility.</P>
      <P>Consider, for example, the incomprehensible criticism of the judiciary by Deputy Costello and the jeering and gibing at the Taoiseach on the part of Deputy Norton.  Such conduct is not conducive to reasoned debate.  It is not conducive to the reasoned debate that not only the political Parties but the country in general would desire on an issue such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal now with some of the points made by Deputy Costello. At one stage he sought to give reasons why the straight vote in Britain and the United States operates well.  He said of Britain that it operated satisfactorily because the people had a long <Col N="1373" /> tradition of a political character behind them.  He claims, in other words, that the people of Britain, because of their experience in the satisfactory operation of the straight vote system, can be relied upon to operate the vote in a responsible and satisfactory manner; but that Irish people cannot be expected to do so at this particular stage of their political development.  The United States of America has got a straight vote system, and Deputy Costello used the United States as an illustration for his argument. He said at column 1019 of Volume 171 of the Official Report that the Founding Fathers foresaw the dangers in the full, logical operation of democracy and &ldquo;they put their checks and balances in a most scientific and farsighted way into that Constitution exactly to ease any revolutionary situation that might come about by the over-logical workings of democracy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In taking that as an example, does he assert&mdash;apparently he does&mdash;that at this stage of our political maturity it is beyond our wit and beyond our wisdom to foresee such dangers, such revolutionary changes as might come about by the logical and, indeed, I might add, the often unreliable results of the P.R. system; and, having seen them, that we should not take adequate steps to change the system with all its inherent weaknesses&mdash;to use the words of Deputy Dillon, &ldquo;this fraud and cod that ought to be abolished&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Is there any nation in the world to-day with such a variety and such a diversity of heritages&mdash;a nation in which Greeks and Turks, Italians and Africans, Orientals and Occidentals, and even Irishmen and Englishmen, can work side by side in complete harmony&mdash;is there any nation in which this system of election has achieved the political and economic status that the United States of America has achieved?  The United States stands to-day as a bulwark of freedom, a bulwark against the kind of totalitarianism to which the P.R. system has led in so many European countries.</P>

      <P>It was suggested here last week, and again to-day, that the statements made on this side of the House that the P.R. system was a British system were wrong.  Deputy Costello claimed that it was because Arthur Griffith wrote favourably of it in 1909 that it was ultimately adopted by the Irish people and consequently by the British as a system of election for Ireland.  Arthur Griffith was a man of great mental capacity, but I suggest that, in 1909, he was a man of some political immaturity.  Certainly, he was a man of political immaturity so far as assessing the merits of respective electoral systems went.  I believe, and, in fact, history can prove, that the British did not introduce P.R. in Ireland because Arthur Griffith or anybody else was wedded to the idea. They introduced it simply to defeat the national unity that had been attained in 1918, when Sinn Féin won a sweeping victory in the straight vote election.</P>
      <P>To go back a little, the British, it might be remembered, set up a commission in 1910 to inquire whether the P.R. system should be introduced into their own country, a commission which in 1911 reported and roundly rejected it and on no fewer than three occasions in that same decade, the British Parliament rejected P.R. as a system of election and each time by an increased majority.</P>
      <P>Following the Sinn Féin victory in 1918, the British Attorney General, Mr. Samuels, introduced the Bill which proposed P.R. for Ireland in respect of local elections.  It is clear from his introductory remarks that the intention of the Bill was, not to safeguard minorities, but to destroy the national unity achieved by Sinn Féin and, in fact, to destroy Sinn Féin itself. As Deputy Dillon said, it was tried out on the dog.  It was tried out on the dog in this case in order to prevent him from barking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1375" /> The Minister for External Affairs quoted excerpts from that debate when he was speaking here last week and, notwithstanding these quotations, the assertions are still made that the British did not impose the P.R. system in this country with any ulterior motive.  I might quote again, and more fully than the Minister for External Affairs did, from Volume 114, columns 175 to 176 of Hansard. Mr. Samuels stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the general election, on the parliamentary franchise...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that was the General Election of 1918&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...75 per cent. of the representation has gone over to the Sinn Féin Party.  What is the declared object of that Party?  It is to make local government in Ireland absolutely impossible and to break down British reign and rule in Ireland by capturing local bodies....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Major O'Neill asked a question:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is it not the fact that the Right Honourable Gentleman never mentioned this question of the Sinn Féiners in his speech moving the Second Reading of this Bill?  May we take it that that was the real reason why this Bill has been introduced?</P>
    <P>Mr. Samuels: I did not mention the words &lsquo;Sinn Féiners,&rsquo; but I thought everybody understood from me that, owing to the impulse of certain political feeling in Ireland, the position the Government had to face was a serious one, and I pointed out it was a matter affecting not merely local and civic administration, but State administration also....  Who are you going to trust the administration of these things to?  Are you going to trust them to bodies elected on the present franchise and under the present machinery&mdash;bodies which have been absolutely captured by people who call the rest of the United Kingdom &lsquo;the enemy,&rsquo; and whose object is to break down the rule of the &lsquo;enemy&rsquo; and make the whole administration in Ireland impossible?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> Is it not clear from that that the P.R. system was introduced deliberately and, in the words of the man who introduced the Bill, in order to break down Sinn Féin and restore the British influence over, not only local authorities, but ultimately of the central authority in Ireland?  In fact, it came ultimately in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, when P.R. was applied for general election purposes in the country.</P>
    <P>The fact remains, however, that P.R. was introduced and has operated since then in this country.  It must be remembered&mdash;many Deputies have adverted to it&mdash;that there followed, soon after the imposition of P.R., the civil war, which divided the country and, for political purposes, subsequently, for the next 20 years or so, continued to divide the country and, largely, if not, mainly, for that reason, P.R. operated reasonably satisfactorily since then.  The memories of the civil war are passing, and, as they pass, there is every danger that a multiplicity of small Parties is likely to spring up in this country.</P>

The multiplicity of Parties ultimately deserted the centre Party in Germany, refused to support them against the Nazis and the Communists and, ultimately, Hitler achieved power.  A similar situation developed in Italy.  In France, since I have been asked, they had a P.R. system, the Party list or combined Party list system, and that system also led to a multiplicity of Parties, but they were able to combine&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The function of the Prime Minister to dissolve Parliament was something we placed in our Constitution in 1937, and was one of the safeguards against the weakness of the P.R. system.  That was a principle and that was a duty abrogated by Deputy J.A. Costello, when he was Taoiseach in 1948, when he declared, and undertook to his colleagues of other Parties, by way of bargaining, or making a deal, as Deputy Norton said, to stay in Government and to abrogate his function of dissolving the Dáil whenever he saw fit to do so for a period of 18 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>P.R. was the system in operation in all these countries. Deputy Costello asserted that there were defects in the present system.  He said that several times, but in this regard he was much more temperate than his colleague, Deputy Dillon, on the last occasion a measure such as this was before the House, when he referred to it as &ldquo;the obvious fraud that it had become.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Dealing further with what Deputy J.A. Costello had to say, I note that his motion provides for the setting up of a commission to examine and report on the present electoral system, but, apart from these references to the defects of the P.R. system, he made no attempt to illustrate or expand further on what form this commission was to take.  He did, however, refer in some detail to the commission on constituencies which it is proposed to set up under this Bill.  At the outset of his remarks in that regard, he made reference to the function of the President in, having consulted the Council of State, appointing a chairman from amongst the judges of the High and Supreme Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> In his remarks in that respect, he attacked the integrity of the President &mdash;whoever he may be at the time being&mdash;and that was something I did not expect to hear from a former Taoiseach and Leader of the Opposition. What was even more incomprehensible to me was the manner in which he offered a gratuitous insult to the judges of the High and Supreme Courts, in referring to them, or rather identifying them, with the remarks of the late Kevin O'Higgins as being &ldquo;lick-spittles of political Parties.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The &ldquo;lick-spittles of political Parties&rdquo;?  If we combine the function of the appointing of judges of the Supreme and High Court with the function of practising before these selfsame courts, there is no man in Ireland, or Britain, who has more experience than Deputy John A. Costello and, for that reason, it is all the more incomprehensible to me and, in fact, it is disgusting that he should address and criticise the judges in that fashion.  In the first place, does he wish that judges should not have any association with political Parties before they are appointed to the Bench?  Is it not a fact that the one judge who now operates, who was a member of the Oireachtas before he was appointed a judge, was a member of the Fine Gael Party and a Fine Gael Senator?  I do not think he was any less worthy of becoming a judge because of that.  I think that his interest in politics would have broadened his outlook.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should hate to have to stand over the statement of Deputy Costello at column 1030 of the Official Reports where in a reference to the appointment of a judge he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...who is what the late Kevin O'Higgins would have called a legal careerist, who got his job on the bench because he was the lick-spittle of a political Party.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As I have said with regard to the commission itself, it has been stated by two of my colleagues that Fianna Fáil are not wedded to the commission as it is proposed to set it up under the Bill.  If after reasoned argument a better proposition as to how the commission should be composed emanates from the House there will be no opposition from this side to establishing such a commission, if the House sees fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kyne again raised the old bogey of gerrymandering.  The commission is designed, as I have already said, to prevent any suggestion of gerrymandering but I think it is reasonably accepted&mdash;Deputy Costello certainly accepts it&mdash;that it would be <Col N="1384" /> wellnigh impossible in all circumstances to gerrymander any constituency. He took Kerry as an example and said that, having regard to the homogeneity of the population, the distribution of the population, it was such that it could not be gerrymandered to the advantage of any political Party.</P>
    <P>To leave Deputy Costello for the moment I shall return to Deputy Norton.  When he was not trying to ridicule the Taoiseach he made, on a number of occasions during his speech, rather brash observations that in my opinion could hardly stand up to examination.  For example, he said that only three European countries had the same electoral system as that which operated in Britain and these were France, Spain and Portugal.  I do not know why he alleges that France has the same system as Britain inasmuch as he should know, and I am sure he did know, that they had a proportional and combined Party system.  I think we can dismiss France as being similar in any way to Britain.</P>
    <P>In Spain and Portugal, as in Russia, the voters are handed a list which has the names only of members of one Party and they are asked to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I would ask Deputy Norton is that the system that operates in Britain?  Is that the straight vote system? In Spain they have not had that opportunity since the 1930s.  General Franco denies that opportunity to his people and appoints his own Government as the need and occasion arise. I would again ask Deputy Norton is that the same system as that which operates in Britain?</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton quoted at length from an article written by Dr. O'Rahilly, now Fr. Alfred O'Rahilly in an issue of the <i>Standard</i> for January, 1948.  During the course of his quotations he held him up as an impartial observer from Deputy Norton's point of view.  I doubt that very much.  Dr. Alfred O'Rahilly, President of University College, Cork, as he was then, vigorously opposed Fianna Fáil in the 1948 election, as he was clearly entitled to do.  In the course of his reference to Fianna Fáil in the issue of the <i>Standard</i> to which I <Col N="1385" /> referred, he speaks of the Party system. I quote from Deputy Norton's speech at column 1074 of the debates of last Wednesday:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Party, no matter how big, is a machine at the disposal of a small clique.  No wonder that it is difficult to find independent educated men to submit to the degrading inhibitions of this Party system which we have imported from England.  It seems to me simply ludicrous to hold up this caucus machinery, with its faked unanimity, as the sole possible ideal of democratic government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder does this mean that Deputy Norton does not agree with the Party system?  I am sure he does since he is Leader of a Party in this House.  I might say that for my part when I first came into politics, and before I was politically mature, I did not think very much about the Party system.  If I did think about it at all, I thought it was undesirable until I became a member of a Party.  Then, having listened to and partaken in debates in the course of Party business, I discovered and I satisfied myself that it was a furtherance of democracy &mdash;men representing all walks of life, having the same fundamental objectives and ideals coming together and discussing either legislation or plans to apply to the administration of the country, giving their views and ultimately agreeing on a common line of approach, and introducing that line of approach as a solid Party in the Parliament of the country.  I think that is the furtherance of democracy, not as Dr. Alfred O'Rahilly then described it &ldquo;faked unanimity&rdquo;.  People will have confidence in the Party system, somehow, if they see that the Party stands for defined principles, programmes and objectives outlined in advance of the elections and not as we have found here advocated after elections and then thrown overboard or &ldquo;put into abeyance&rdquo;, a phrase with which we became so familiar during the period 1948-1951.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, I believe, is wedded to that Party system but what he is not wedded to, as far as one can see, is the policy of openly declaring before elections <Col N="1386" /> his intentions as to whether he proposes to abandon some of his Party principles and submerge them in favour of others with whom he wants to coalesce after an election.  If the people could not trust the Party system as we know it, if there was an abandonment of principles and a making of deals to which Deputy Norton refers after elections, the people would soon tire of the Party system and if the public tired of the Party system I believe it would be the end of democracy here as we know it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello referred to the need for an effective Opposition.  I believe the most effective Opposition could be secured by the straight voting system and that the Opposition under that has a high degree of responsibility because it must realise that even a small change of will by the people could put it into Government after the following election.  If, on the other hand, we had multiple or small Parties, even small Parties all combining in opposition against one big Party in Government, and if the people decided to change, they would not know where to go or what Party to support, whereas, an intelligent and reasonably unified Opposition would offer an immediate alternative to them.</P>
    <P>Regarding defects in the P.R. system to which Deputy Costello referred it is worth quoting again from what he said at column 1071 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have always had a conviction that there are defects, perhaps serious defects, in the rules governing the operation of elections under that system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In contrast to that, it is worth referring to what Deputy Norton said at column 1076 in the same Volume:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What is the purpose of abolishing the whole system of P.R. merely because it is now believed&mdash;I do not believe it; I am not satisfied that it is generally believed&mdash;that there are imperfections in the system?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Costello in that respect and I should like to indicate <Col N="1387" /> to Deputy Norton that there are serious defects in P.R., defects that nobody can defend.  The rules governing the counting of votes after a general election are set out in the Third Schedule to the Electoral Act of 1923.  I do not know what mathematical or legal mind conceived these rules but, to the ordinary mind, they are frustratingly incomprehensible without, perhaps, a thorough practical demonstration of a count in operation.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend that I know to any great extent the details of that operation. Since I first came into public life, and in the four general elections I have contested, I have endeavoured so far as observation and reading of the rules could help to understand how surpluses were distributed.  Unfortunately, the precautions necessarily taken by returning officers in placing barriers at a certain distance from where the votes are counted and the fact that at another stage there are calculators at work at a still greater distance away at the top of the room, prevent the average person knowing what really takes places at an election count.  After the distribution of a surplus I have seen certain stamping of voting papers taking place.  I think they are stamped with a number to indicate in what count these papers were used.  After that stamping, the calculators did some work on certain figures and ultimately announced a result that to the ordinary observer it was impossible to understand.  To understand it properly would require exhaustive practical demonstration and it would not be practicable for me even to attempt in a speech like this to give my impressions of what takes place.</P>
    <P>I shall take just one small example. After candidate AB has been elected with a surplus, if CD is elected with a surplus also, with the aid of certain votes from AB, the papers credited to CD are picked off at random from the sub-parcel of votes last received by AB according to a number deduced mathematically by the calculators and only that number of the parcel or sub-parcel are passed on in their next preferences to continuing candidates <Col N="1388" /> I have said they are picked off at random.  That is a statutory requirement; only a limited number are picked off.  The returning officer or his assistant must go round and collect one here and there.  In other words it is a form of raffle like shuffling a pack of cards and taking a choice.  That, I think, is a negation of the principles of democracy and a frustration of the will of many of the electorate who, because their ballot papers were not luck in the draw, had their remaining ballot papers confined to a box and not further used in the distribution of third, fourth and fifth preferences in the course of that count.  That exercise may take place two or three times in a five-seat constituency and in the case of a seven-seat constituency&mdash;if such could exist&mdash;it could take place six times.</P>
    <P>Just one other example.  If it comes to the elimination of a candidate and there are two candidates with an equal number of votes at this count the returning officer is required to look to the previous count and, if necessary, to the first preference in order to estimate which of the candidates received the higher number of votes.  But if it happens&mdash;it might be said it seldom could happen&mdash;that the candidates are equal at all these stages, the returning officer decides the issue by putting the two names into the hat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Otherwise, I think it is just an election by raffle.  Here again, in the P.R. system which Deputy Dillon so eloquently denounced in 1947 we have several examples of this raffle in the election <Col N="1389" /> or elimination of a candidate.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said the other day that he doubted whether half the Deputies, much less half the electorate, knew what happened the third preference votes in the course of a count.</P>

      <P>The main points that can be made have already been made by speakers better equipped to do so than I.  Having regard to the example I have just given and to the examples given by the Minister for Defence, is it not about time that we introduced a system of election to reflect the true intentions of the people and ensure government of the people by the people rather than have it deteriorate into the mathematical farce it is now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words on this very important subject. I have already made my views known outside the House.  I should like to reiterate some of the arguments which convince me that the time has come to abolish P.R., or, as I think it is more accurately described, the single transferable vote.  We have not had P.R. for quite a few years now.  As the House is aware, over the past 25 or 30 years, the number of larger constituencies has steadily reduced, until now three-quarters of the constituencies are less than five-seat constituencies.  That procedure was objected to at the time by the then Opposition, but it was not altered when the Opposition came into power themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of fair representation, there is no argument against P.R., depending of course on the size of the constituency.  Twenty-five years ago, we had seven-, eight-, and nine-seat constituencies.  There was no doubt that a Deputy who secured 10 per cent. of the total poll had to be regarded as elected on a very <Col N="1390" /> fair&mdash;almost too fair&mdash;proportion of the total vote in his constituency.  If that situation could have been spread all over the country&mdash;having 15 or 16 constituencies with eight or nine Deputies each&mdash;it would not require a very great stretch of the imagination to see it would be quite impossible to govern the country effectively.</P>
    <P>Quite an amount of play has been made with the freak results which have arisen, particularly in Great Britain, under the straight or majority vote. Under P.R. in our country, there have been some quite remarkable results over the years.  I think I am correct in saying that not more than two elections ago, a Fine Gael candidate headed the poll in one of the Galway constituencies and failed to secure a seat.  A rather longer time ago than that, in a local election, I think, a certain candidate in County Kilkenny finished at the bottom of the poll but was subsequently elected.  I do not think it can reasonably be held that you have freak results under a straight vote only.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments which appealed to me most strongly when I first started to consider this matter was the fact that P.R. is a safeguard and favours minorities, small Parties and Independents.  But if we look back over the records of the various elections held over the past 12 or 14 years and see how the smaller Parties have fared, I do not think anybody could reasonably say P.R. has been a safeguard for the small Parties.  I was a member of a Party that came into this House with ten seats in 1948, and it has one seat to-day.  In 1944, I think Clann na Talmhan had nine seats; they have three to-day.  Over that period, there were very few Independents in the House who were first elected in the 1943-44 election.  It is not quite true to say that P.R. has been the custodian of small Parties and Independents.  Strictly according to the record, the contrary would appear to be the case.</P>
    <P>The fact that P.R. is in use in other European countries has been held up to us as an example of what a stable democracy can be under P.R., but the Deputies who advanced that argument <Col N="1391" /> did not know or did not explain that in these countries there are substantial national minorities or there are differences in those countries on very strong ideological lines.  These, in turn, form the basis for the various political Parties.  If you did not have some form of P.R. in these countries, it is quite certain you would have very serious internal trouble.</P>
    <P>An example is the form of P.R. in Belgium where you have the Catholic Parties, the Liberal Parties, and a third Party, the Socialist Party.  The voters vote along strictly religious and sociological lines.  The same thing happens in other countries.  Switzerland is held up as an ideal example. In Switzerland, there are substantial national minorities, German-Swiss, French-Swiss and so on.  These also vote according to their national feelings and associations.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested, and I think it is perfectly true, that over the past 35 years, P.R. has in general provided stable government in this country, but I must say I do agree with the contention put forward that this has been so rather in spite of than because of P.R.  No matter what arguments are put forward, the split which followed the Treaty did exercise an overriding influence on Irish politics over a long number of years.  That division is dying out now.  Secondly, the personality of the Taoiseach, whether one agrees or disagrees with him or his politics, has exercised a dominating influence on the Irish political scene for nearly 40 years.</P>
    <P>I do not think it needs any great exercise of the imagination to see that in the years ahead, when the Taoiseach passes from the political scene, there is bound to be fundamental changes in our country and in his own political Party.  If P.R. were to continue, it is quite likely that no single Party here could form a Government on its own and you might have a situation where you would have a series of small Parties contending to form a Government. In others words, you would have a Coalition Government and a Coalition Opposition.  I do not think <Col N="1392" /> that would be a desirable state of affairs.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the abolition of P.R. is anti-democratic.  I do not think that can be seriously suggested, in view of the fact that the whole question of the abolition or retention of P.R. is being put as a referendum to the people.  The largest democracy in the world to-day, the United States, uses and has always used, as far as I am aware, the majority system of voting.  The same applies in Great Britain, also a democracy.</P>
    <P>Some play has been made with the fact that there was no demand for the abolition of P.R.  The same argument could have been put forward 35 years ago by suggesting there was no demand for the inclusion of P.R.</P>
    <P>After the success of Sinn Féin in the election of 1918 nobody in Ireland, certainly not the majority, would have favoured P.R. if they could have exercised a choice at that time.  I believe the Irish people do not want a return to the form of coalition government we had up to 1957.  I say that seriously and sincerely.  I favoured the coalition form of government over a number of years but I am satisfied now as a result of what has transpired between 1948 and 1957, in spite of the good work done particularly by individual members of the Government, that the Irish people prefer a situation where there would be a Government and a strong Opposition.  I believe the majority of the Irish people would prefer to see the present Government Party opposed by a strong individual Party that could offer itself as an alternative Government on its own.  The only alternative I see to that if we are to retain P.R. is that the Government itself be elected on the P.R. system and that every Party of the House should participate in the Government, but I do not think that possibility could ever eventuate.</P>
    <P>Statements made by Arthur Griffith in 1909 and 1911 have been quoted. Nobody here has greater respect for Arthur Griffith than I have, but again what he said so many years ago can hardly be argued fairly in the context of Irish public life and Irish politics to-day.  We must learn by what has <Col N="1393" /> transpired over the years and relate it in a reasonable way to our plans for the future.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that P.R. prevents discrimination against minorities and Independents and that if it is done away with it will disfranchise a large section of the people.  The chief factor in the disfranchisement of a large section of the people is not the system of voting but the size of the constituency.  That argument could be very strongly put forward in connection with the United States or Great Britain.  In the United States you have one representative to something like every 400,000 of the population and in Great Britain one representative to something like every 80,000 of the population, which means that in a straight vote in America if the Republican or Democrat as the case may be, gets a slender majority, almost 200,000 people are disfranchised in the sense that their man was not elected.  However, I refuse to believe that where there is a single member representing a constituency all those who did not vote for him are automatically disfranchised. I think the opposite is the truth and that where you have a single representative for a constituency he will regard himself, and will be regarded by the people of that constituency, as being their representative in Parliament and he will stand or fall on his record over the years in between elections, when he comes to offer himself for election again.</P>
    <P>If, as is intended in this Bill, the provision is retained in the Constitution, whereby a Deputy may represent from 20,000 to 30,000 people, these small constituencies&mdash;they are very small&mdash; will automatically be a guarantee against discrimination against them.  In a constituency of 25,000 or 30,000 people where there are, say, 15,000 voters, of whom possibly not more than 12,000 will vote, it is possible to see a strong local candidate standing without any Party support being elected, if a majority system of voting comes into effect.</P>
    <P>Another strong argument in favour of P.R. is that it enables small Parties to take part in Government.  That is perfectly true but unless I am very <Col N="1394" /> wrong it is the ambition of every Party, certainly any Party worthy of its salt, to become a majority Party and govern on its own.  If one recalls the various statements made by Party leaders over the years, certainly it is their ambition to be strong enough to put their own policy into practice. That statement has been made again and again by Party leaders on behalf of their Party.  At least one Party in the Dáil have stated that under no circumstances will they coalesce with any other Party again.  They intend to stand for their own independent programme, put it before the electors and, if elected in sufficient numbers, will govern on their own.  In other words, they will stand or fall on their own policy not on a combined policy of various Parties in an inter-Party or Coalition Government.  That is a very sound statement and one which I would strongly support.  The only difficulty is that I do not see how you could possibly put that wish or desire into effect under P.R.  I do suggest that the Parties who aim to stand on their own feet, at the same time wanting to retain P.R., are trying to have the best of all possible worlds, which you cannot have in politics any more than in other spheres of life.</P>
    <P>Over the past 30 years only one Party has ever secured a majority of votes and that was Fianna Fáil in 1938.  That shows that it is practically an impossible task for any one Party to secure a majority vote.  It is almost equally difficult to secure a majority of the seats.  That is one of the reasons I favour the abolition of P.R. because it does ensure that the majority Party, even if it has a minority of the votes, at least has a majority of the seats and is free to govern with an adequate majority over a period of years.</P>
    <P>It is quite true&mdash;and this is one of the strongest criticisms against the majority system&mdash;that a majority in Parliament is secured at the expense of widespread representation.  In assessing the pros and cons of the two systems my considered opinion was that effective government comes before representation.  Representation is essential but if representation is to be so widespread that it endangers effective <Col N="1395" /> government, a system must be employed that will ensure that effective government comes first.  In every democracy we know government is carried out by political Parties, not by individuals, and no matter how grand it may be to call for the right of the individual&mdash;and I subscribe most strongly to the right of the individual &mdash;when it comes to the government of a country, a Party must govern, not 147 individuals or whatever the number may be.  The Independents, I think, contribute usefully to public life&mdash; perhaps having a nuisance value at times&mdash;but when it comes to government, I think you must have a single Party with an adequate majority, and when the date of the next election comes, they must stand or fall on their record during their years of government. If we agree that a Party must govern and an Opposition must oppose, it comes as a logical conclusion that policies and not personalities will be put before the electorate and people will vote on policy and not on personality.</P>
    <P>It would be a good thing for this country if the public were more and more encouraged to examine critically the policies of the various Parties contending for their favour, not on the basis of the individual concerned&mdash; whether he was a good athlete, or just a good talker or something else.  It would be for the better if he were a member of a Party with a good policy, even if he did not open his mouth at all.  I believe that, with the abolition of P.R., a strong Opposition Party will emerge.  I do not know whether it will be Fine Gael, Labour or any other group inside or outside the House.  I favour the emergence of a strong Party and I should like to make my views clear in that regard.  I hope a strong Party will arise to displace the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not want to see a collection of Parties doing it but one Party doing it.  If the Parties on this side of the House are worth their salt, they will avail of the opportunity in Opposition, with majority vote, to displace the Government Party with a better Party and a better policy in time to come.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> Some play was made with the fact that the Liberal Party in England is now practically an extinct force.  The suggestion was made, possibly with some grain of truth in it, that both the Conservatives and the Labour Party in England are deliberately squeezing out the Liberals and that the Liberals are the only champions of P.R. in England.  That is perfectly true.  The Liberals, so far as I am aware, are the only people who advocate P.R., but when the Liberal Party were in power up to 1912, they did not advocate it or any change from the majority system. It was only when they lost out to the Conservatives and Labour that the Liberals began to advocate the advantages of P.R.  It is not very hard to see why.</P>
    <P>My own view is that the Liberals were squeezed out because the public did not want them and the public does not want the Liberal Party, although they are a strong force in England to-day. I do not think the English public wants a Liberal Party.  If they did, it would be possible for the Liberal Party to get back into power again as a force, just as the Labour Party did when the contending forces were Conservatives and Liberals.  In that regard, I do not think the abolition of P.R. will stop&mdash;in my view, it will encourage&mdash;the emergency of a strong Opposition Party or Parties.  Some of the world's oldest political Parties, founded over 100 years ago, were founded under the majority system, and they are still existing to-day, when the Parties formed under the P.R. system have come and gone in the space of a few years.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that I give all credit to P.R.  It has served its purpose, but I feel that the changed conditions of Ireland to-day demand a change.  The psychological effect which the abolition of P.R., and its substitution by the majority vote would have, would be good for the country.  It would be a necessary prerequisite to tackling our problems of emigration, unemployment and the other national problems that beset us now.  It would also be in the nature of a shock treatment for the country in general and would help to dispel the apathy, indifference and frustration which seem to cloud over us to-day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1397" /> I intend to support this Bill right through and would like to make just one final comment.  There is one thing I should like to be satisfied about, that is, that there will be absolute impartiality and independence in the delimiting and drawing up of the proposed new constituencies.  The members of the Opposition Parties who have spoken to that have reason to sound a warning note: not only must justice be done in this regard but it must appear to be done.  Otherwise, it might be better to leave the system as it is.  The whole success of this change depends upon the drawing up of these constituencies and I hope they will be drawn up impartially and fairly to all Parties.</P>

      <P>This Bill, coming at this time, stinks in the nostrils of every decent, law-abiding citizen of this country.  The reason it does so is that they are alive and very much alive to the motives behind the Bill. The motives behind the Bill are selfish; they are political; they are ridden with malice; they are deliberate; and they are ill-designed.  These are the motives that are behind this Bill.  In the circumstances in which we are living now after the worst year's weather for 150 years, the time of this National Assembly is taken up in discussing whether we should vote with an X or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  We have problems to face and tackle which this Government, which gave so many undertakings at the general election, undertook to tackle, but we are compelled to discuss P.R.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why the Bill is being put through now is to hide the miserable failure of the Government to fulfil the promises they made at the general election.  Before the general election, there was no mention of P.R., and there was no mention of a revision of constituencies.  There was grave concern for the economic future of the country and there was an appeal by the Leader of the Opposition at the time, the present Taoiseach, for strong Government, and mind you, he appealed for strong Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to tell the House, the country and my constituents, if I am to take <Col N="1398" /> that as an example of strong Government, the performances of the Fianna Fáil Government over the past 18 months, I am against strong Government. I am opposed to strong Government and I hope this country never has strong Government of that type again, a Government who close their eyes to the wants of the people, who deceive the people, who deliberately mislead the people and make no effort whatever to solve the national economic problems affecting the very livelihoods of our people.</P>

      <P>Having read this Bill, I feel I may refer to it as a disgraceful, deceptive document.  There was no demand from the general public for this Bill and while we are discussing this Bill, there is grave dissatisfaction in the country and serious criticism being hurled at us by the <Col N="1399" /> general public for wasting the time of the House on it.  Parliament itself has fallen in the estimation of the general public because of the waste of time there is in discussing a Bill of this kind. However, if we want to refer to the terms of this Bill I shall do so and endeavour to give my opinion of it.</P>
      <P>Why was it that the Fianna, Fáil Party did not introduce this Bill in 1937 at a time when they were the architects of a Constitution which was then said to be a garden of roses and which now has apparently become a garden of weeds which we are frequently inspecting and from which the weeds are about to be pruned?  In 1937 when the people of this country approved of the Constitution they also saw fit to approve of a system of election called P.R.  At that time the present Taoiseach saw fit to praise the system.  He again praised that system in 1938 and at every general election from 1937 to 1948.</P>
      <P>However, in 1948, when the change of Government came, he paused.  He could not possibly understand how he was put out of office.  To use his own words, when he referred to the people who voted to accept the Treaty in 1922: &ldquo;The people had no right to do wrong.&rdquo; It is the opinion of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Taoiseach that when the Irish people changed the Government in 1948 they did wrong and that they had no right to change the Government and do wrong at that time.  The year 1948 taught the Taoiseach a lesson that Governments could be changed.  A very desirable weapon in a democracy is the right of the people to change their Government as often as the people want to change.</P>
      <P>The year 1954 again brought the removal from office of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Taoiseach.  For the second time he could not believe that he was put out of office.  In order to demonstrate his unbelief he proceeded to make a tour in company with the Indians....</P>

      <P>He then returned and on his return he proceeded <Col N="1400" /> to consult with himself as to what were the best methods of preventing the Irish people from ever again changing the Government.  He appealed for a strong Government at the last general election, giving as his reason that the Government had grave tasks to undertake&mdash;they had the great responsibility of Government and they must guide the people along the right road.  Now we have the Taoiseach, in the night time of his life, introducing this Bill with the full and unanimous approval of the Fianna Fáil Party, while the Labour Party, the trade unions, the organised Protestant organisations, the Fine Gael Party, the Clann na Poblachta Party and the Sinn Féin element outside the House are all opposing the measure.  It is noticeable that not a single living person within the Fianna Fáil Party opposes it.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out by the Leader of the Labour Party that not one of the European dictators or even a citizen of the type of Mr. Bulganin would ask a conference, in Russia or elsewhere, to approve of any of their ideas without getting more unanimous agreement.  The strange part of it all is that the fellows who got in on the 10th and 12th counts were the lads who applauded it the strongest.  I feel that, while we are discussing the terms of this Bill, there are evil motives behind it.  The Taoiseach saw that, having arrived at the night time of his political life, he had to leave some legacy to his old colleagues of the Fianna Fáil Party and the only one he could leave them was a source of everlasting power in this country. The only way he could do that was to deprive minorities of the right to be represented in Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is an attempt to deprive the people of certain rights and freedoms which they enjoy but I am of the opinion that this is one occasion on which the Taoiseach has bitten off too much.  You can tell the people anything and promise them the sun, moon and stars but if you take anything from them, that is the time the Irish people will be aroused.  This Bill takes from them certain liberties, liberties guaranteed by Griffith and Collins, <Col N="1401" /> rights and liberties that, as a free people, they are entitled to enjoy.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill which, without the least shadow of doubt, is the real foundation stone of dictatorship.  We hear people talking of the right of a political Party to govern but there is no such thing as a political Party governing in this country to-day.  When the Fine Gael motion on wheat growing was being debated you had a wide section of wheat-growing farmers in the Fianna Fáil Party who were not allowed to open their mouths.  They could not speak and had to go home and hide their heads from their wheat-growing neighbours.  Some of them went to different church areas on the following Sunday in order to avoid their neighbours.</P>
    <P>We now have the situation in which the cold hand of dictatorship is getting a firmer grip on this country.  When this Bill is passed, as it will be passed in the Dáil and in the Seanad, the real Donnybrook fair will start outside. That is where there will be trouble. That is where the members of the Fine Gael Party, and the Labour Party and the Independents of common sense and intelligence should do their talking&mdash; at the church doors and not in this House.</P>
    <P>We should start, if necessary, and if we are enthusiastic enough, because this is something of grave national importance, after Midnight Mass on Christmas Night in order to tell the people of the vital importance of holding on to certain liberties they have enjoyed and that Fianna Fáil are now taking from them.  We must get out and stand up at Church gates and at fairs and use the eloquence God gave us to try to defeat this unnecessary, brutal, unjust and cruel measure being imposed by the Fianna Fáil Party for no purpose other than to make their own nests more secure.</P>
    <P>The system of P.R. has worked well in this country.  I do not see where there have been any very great complaints. If the people want to send a &ldquo;dud&rdquo; to Parliament they should be entitled to elect him and to send him to Parliament.</P>

I also think that any man, no matter what views he may express, what policy he may believe in, what religion he may profess or what his outlook for the future may be, whether he is a rich man or a pauper, should have the right to offer himself for election to Parliament and that the Irish people should have the right to send him to Parliament.  Here we are faced with a deliberate move to wipe out completely all minorities.  The motive behind that move is to ensure &mdash;we have had it from various speakers since&mdash;that there will not be another inter-Party Government.  That is the main motive.</P>
      <P>I am of opinion that when the referendum is taken and the result is made known the Government will be seriously shocked.  P.R. has not produced instability in Government in this country.  Everybody knows that quite well.</P>

      <P>We know that when in 1929 the Government of the Six Counties abolished P.R. their action was denounced by everyone in Southern Ireland, and properly so, because it was a deliberate move to disfranchise the Nationalists and the Catholics there.  These fears were more than justified.</P>
      <P>The purpose of doing away with P.R. here is to disfranchise the minority and to lay the foundation stone of dictatorship.  I do not see what great opposition the Fianna Fáil Party should have or can have to new Parties.  This evening, the Minister for Education referred to the setting-up of new political Parties.  Has any constitutional group of free people not the right to form any kind of Party they like, provided they keep the law and, if they do not keep the law, the Parliament and the law are there to see that they abide by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a sad experience after over 30 years of native government, to witness a short time ago the present Taoiseach, standing on these Opposition Benches, saying: &ldquo;I hate that <Col N="1403" /> Government.  I hate the Government.&rdquo; Balls of pespiration rolled down his forehead as he put venom into his hatred when he was roaring across the floor of the House and saying he hated the men who sat on the Government, Benches.  There is a display of Christian charity.  There is a display of love of your neighbour.  There is a display of co-operation and friendliness.</P>
    <P>This evening, the Minister for Education tried to rattle the bones of the civil war.  The present Taoiseach, standing in these Opposition Benches, indicated that one group of Irishmen deliberately hate and despise another in an Irish Parliament.  Is that not a sad and extraordinary situation?  It gives little hope and confidence to the younger generation.  How can they have respect for any group of men or for any man who conducts himself in that manner?</P>

      <P>It has been argued that P.R. produces instability. We need no more than one example to test that argument.  For 26 or 27 years, Deputy Eamon de Valera has been Taoiseach.  He had the reins of government in this country in his hands continuously for a long period but, in all, for about 27 years during which time we have had a Fianna Fáil Government. At the same time, they are comparing the system with the electoral system in England.  In the 27 years, during which Deputy de Valera has been Taoiseach here. there were seven different Prime Ministers in England.  The comparison has been made though why I do not know.  I fail to understand the case being put forward by the Government for this measure.</P>
      <P>We all know very well from our experience that P.R. has given the minorities the right to speak in this House.  It has given small Parties the right to put forward the views of the people they represent.  It is only right and proper that they should have that right to speak.  P.R. has worked well and is working well in Switzerland, Sweden, Holland, Belgium and Denmark, but this deliberate attempt to wipe out small Parties will have a greater danger in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will tell the House where that danger will lie.  When you drive out of this House the elements that represent <Col N="1405" /> Labour, it means that a large section of organised workers in this country will have no spokesman in Parliament. When they have no advocate in Parliament, the only course that will be open to those people is to act on their own, to use the strike weapon and use the weapon of negotiation between the organised worker and his employer and the employer will have the favourable ear of the Government in office, while the unfortunate worker will not have the ear of anyone.  He will have no one to speak for him.</P>
    <P>I can see the extreme element, who have the right to come into this House, if they wish, going underground.  I can see secret organisations and secret movements expanding and expounding because they will be deprived of the right to be represented in Parliament. Efforts will be made to overthrow constitutional Government.  A measure of this kind leads to chaos and disaster. Those circumstances are not only likely to be availed of, but will be availed of, if minorities are denied the right to sit in Parliament.</P>
    <P>The most serious part of this Bill deals with the question of the setting up of constituencies.  It is bad enough to change the system of election; it is bad enough to deprive the people of a variety of public representatives.  If they do not want No. 2, they can have Nos. 2, 3, or 4.  It is bad enough to tell the people that they must have one representative for their constituency and one only.  Speakers pointed out that once the one member is elected, he represents those who voted against him just as he represents those who voted for him.  That is not so at present because in the present set-up you have Fianna Fáil working for Fianna Fáil and nobody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had the question of the filling of vacancies and the making of appointments.  We had the good old hobby and good paying racket of jobbery which was undertaken by them.  I venture to say that no Fianna Fáil voter, councillor or Deputy ever put any Labour or Fine Gael supporter into a job over the <Col N="1406" /> heads of a Fianna Fáil nominee.  They will never do that.  What hope is there for anybody getting any type of a job, if there is only a Fianna Fáil Deputy representing a constituency?  It is a means of driving people into Fianna Fáil.  It is a means of driving local political contributions into the pool to fatten the funds of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>This is going to be carried out from the Dáil down to the county councils and local authorities.  It will be carried down into the local authorities because the county councils are to be elected on the same system.  It will go down to the home assistance recipients, the home assistance officers, the county council ganger and from there to the road workers.  I cannot see that there is any hope for anyone because there is only the Fianna Fáil councillor or T.D.</P>
      <P>This Bill reeks of rottenness; it reeks of everything that stands for dictatorship; and it reeks of graft.  I trust that in the wisdom of the people, it will be given the answer to which it is justly entitled.  It is bad enough to deprive the people of a choice of Deputy and to be tied down to the single member constituency, but when it comes to gerrymandering the constituencies, it is the last word in graft.</P>
      <P>Let no man say that the constituencies will not be gerrymandered. If this measure is passed a constituency commission will be set up.  If I have read this Bill properly, when the constituency commission is sitting and if the commission cannot submit a report that they have agreed on certain boundaries, it will then be left to the chairman of the commission to create the boundaries himself.  According to the Bill, the chairman of the commission will be a High Court judge appointed by the President.</P>

I feel that this <Col N="1407" /> question of no agreement on constituency boundaries will be a deliberate concoction on the part of Fianna Fáil, because they will have their spokesmen on the commission and the making of the constituency boundaries will be left to one man who will be picked by favour.</P>

      <P>This is an evilly-designed Bill.  It will have a very bad effect on the future of the country.  The Minister for Education referred to-day to Coalition Governments. He referred in particular to the position in France.  Fianna Fáil Deputies, dealing with this issue down the country, have addressed the people.  They have used high-sounding phrases, not always intelligible to the ordinary man in the street.  They say that one of the reasons for bringing in this Bill is to prevent the same situation here as has occurred in France in the past.  They have not gone to the trouble of explaining&mdash;this explanation will, I hope, be given by others&mdash;that the French system of P.R. has no relationship at all to the system of P.R. obtaining here.  Neither have the changes in Government in France over the years anything to do with P.R.</P>
      <P>Once a Deputy is elected in France he is elected for five years.  Irrespective of whether or not the Government remains in office the Deputy remains a Deputy.  The Deputy in France, if he so desired, could vote the Government out every day of the week.  Indeed, he obviously desired that quite frequently in the past.  But that is not the position here.  If the Government is defeated here, a general election follows.</P>

      <P>In France, there was no question of a general election.  There is no parallel between the system there and our system and the comparison is a most unfair one. Not alone is it unfair but it is unreasonable. The people should be told the truth and those responsible <Col N="1411" /> for telling the truth should not try to bolster up the case in the hope that the people will blindly fall for it.</P>
      <P>Any amendment of a Constitution anywhere is a very serious matter. Such amendments are made only when grave necessity compels them.  This Bill may easily have the effect of depriving Parliament of some of its rights.  If this Bill is passed, we can reach a situation in which Fianna Fáil may gain 80 or 90 of a possible 120 seats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>History will deal with that, and we shall leave it to the historians.  It is stated that the intention behind this Bill is to give the people stable government, strong government and government that will last.  If that is the intention, I fail to <Col N="1412" /> understand the necessity for this measure.  At no time had we a Government with such a strong majority as the present Government.  If the Taoiseach thinks he has not got a strong Government now and it is his desire to ensure an even stronger Government, what exactly does he want?  Does he want all the seats in the House for his Party, and everyone else outside the House?  I am of opinion that that is what the Fianna Fáil Party are hoping for.  The stage is being reached when they are not satisfied to have 70 or 80 seats; they want the entire 147 seats.  When that happens, the Lord look down upon the people because, when Fianna Fáil have carried out the things they have carried out with the majority that they now have and with such strong Opposition, what will they do when there is no Opposition at all?</P>
      <P>I want to issue a warning that the country is in the first stages of the straight walk for dictatorship.  It is the duty of every Deputy who stands for true democracy to ensure that minorities and small Parties will have the right to representation in Parliament. We should organise the people in so far as is possible and warn them of the seriousness of the situation into which they are now being allowed to drift.</P>
      <P>How is it that there is no provision for compulsory voting in this Bill? They are changing the constituencies, gerrymandering the constituencies, changing the system of voting, but there is no provision in the Bill for compulsory voting.  That is because the Taoiseach knows, that all his supporters will vote, that the Opposition supporters are apathetic and careless as to whether they cast their votes or not, but that if there were compulsory voting, they would vote against him and his Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thoroughly recommend to the House the amendment tabled by Deputy John A. Costello and Deputy Mulcahy.  The amendment states very clearly that the abolition of P.R. will interfere with <Col N="1413" /> the rights of minorities.  Is there a Deputy who believes that it will not interfere with the rights of minorities? Every Deputy knows that if this Bill is passed and is approved by the people, the rights of small Parties and the rights of minorities will be gone forever.  It is quite true to say that it is likely to lead to unrepresentative Parliaments. There is no doubt that that is likely to be the case.</P>
      <P>So far as Partition is concerned, there is no doubt that that question will be made more difficult of solution. The question of Partition was whipped around this country by the present Taoiseach while whipping was good for it.  Having got tired of speaking on that subject, having obtained all that he could obtain by whipping Partition, he now, by bringing in this measure, introduces the same system of election in Southern Ireland as he condemned in the Six Counties.  This Bill, in my opinion, justifies the existence of the Six Counties and endorses the policy operated by Lord Brookeborough and his comrades. Everyone knows that there was no demand for this Bill by the general public.  I think it was Deputy Lemass who said that he knew of certain people who were demanding it.  I do not know where the strange type of people are with whom Deputy Lemass comes in contact.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not know whether it is at the pleasant Fianna Fáil functions in Clery's restaurant or where he meets the people, but I travel around the country and particularly in my own constituency as much as any Deputy travels in his constituency and I have yet to meet anyone who has demanded the proposed change, who has asked for it or has sought it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make a very strong appeal to every Party and to every Deputy, in the interest of the future of this country, to protect the rights of minorities, to hold on to the measure of freedom we have, to direct the serious attention of the general public <Col N="1414" /> to the fact that the measure of freedom they now enjoy is being taken from them.  When the people have a clear understanding that they are to be deprived of that measure of freedom, they will resist Fianna Fáil or anyother Party which proposes to take it from them.</P>
    <P>We heard the Minister for Education and other members of the Government saying that they want this matter discussed in the country in a calm atmosphere and apart from politics.  I am of opinion that the Fianna Fáil Party want as little propaganda and as little publicity in the country for this Bill as is possible, so that it will be put speedily through the House.  The best way in which we can arouse public interest in this matter is to explain to the people the privileges and the rights which they are now being denied by this Bill.  Fianna Fáil are against giving the facts and telling the truth to the people on this issue.  They want a peaceful and a calm atmosphere.  A peaceful and a calm atmosphere did not win for the Irish people the liberties which they now enjoy.  A peaceful and a calm atmosphere will not be an atmosphere in which rights and liberties of people will be taken. I hope and trust that when this referendum is held, the people will give the answer they are entitled to give, that there will be an overwhelming vote against this measure and that it will be proven, beyond yea or nay, to the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party and to every other member of that Party, that the Irish people are one people; that the Irish nation is one nation that will resist the setting up of a dictatorship, that we are determined to allow true democracy to reign; that the people will say no leader will be allowed to pass on a legacy of permanent power to his comrades, and that the right of the people to change Governments, when they so desire, will be upheld and cherished by them.</P>

      <P>If there is to be an overwhelming majority of the people against this Bill&mdash;and a good many of the Opposition Deputies have said so&mdash;I take it that the logical <Col N="1415" /> thing for them to have done would be to give us the Bill without any opposition. After all, we are not now declaring, or pretending to declare, in Canada, the establishment of a Republic. The other night I listened to objections being raised by several Opposition speakers that, because we did not mention an intention to bring such a measure as this into Dáil Éireann, we had no right to do so.

      <P>While Deputy Flanagan was Speaking, the Fianna Fáil Deputies showed great restraint and patience when he insulted a man who has given lifelong service to this country.  That man has given honourable service and the Irish people have demonstrated, time and time again, that they have confidence in him.  His name is not alone a household word in Ireland, but his ability, honour, sincerity and all the different qualities that are recognised as good statesmanship, have made his name a household word throughout the world.  I think it is a damned shame that, in an Irish Parliament, a man with such a record should be attacked by Deputy O.J. Flanagan or anybody else.</P>

      <P>When we hear ourselves, on this side of the House, being cajoled in one breath and threatened in another, in leading articles, in political journals that have always been hostile, it has the effect, even if we have not got the intelligence which this political journalism expects of Members of Parliament, of rousing our instincts.  I was very interested to be warned, and I am sure every backbencher was interested to be warned, that this thing is not going to work <Col N="1419" /> out as we are supposed to anticipate that it will&mdash;that Fianna Fáil are to be given a guarantee of permanency.  It did instance a number of colourful characters in this House who do provide more pabulum for that type of journalism than the ordinary disciplined members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>On to-day's Order Paper, Deputy McGilligan asked the Minister for External Affairs to give his view and the view of the Government on a speech made by one of this country's representatives at the U.N.O.  The full question was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for External Affairs if he has seen a report of a speech made by an Irish delegate at the U.N. urging that adequate standards of literacy be attained by Trust Territories before considering them for independence, cautioning against cutting a territory loose to shift for itself as a new nation before it is prepared to do so and, in using Ireland as an illustration, stating that the responsibilities of independence threatened the foundation of the new State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The question further asked:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...if this speech represents the policy of the Government towards Trust Territories and reflects the mind of the Government as to the ability of this country to endure the responsibilities of independence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That question referred to a report which appeared in the <i>Evening Press</i> of 6th November, a report which is headed &ldquo;Irish Appeal for Literacy at U.N.&rdquo; It refers to the speech made by our delegate and then has a paragraph <Col N="1420" /> headed &ldquo;Ireland.&rdquo; The report referred to the trend towards independence for dependent areas, and said that the delegate cautioned against cutting a territory loose to shift for itself as a new nation.  Then comes the paragraph headed &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; in which it states that the delegate used Ireland as an illustration and said that the responsibilities of independence threatened the new State.</P>
    <P>That report in the <i>Evening Press</i> seems to imply that our delegate, speaking abroad and representing this country, was using the type of argument used by the British in relation to this country prior to 1920, when they were prone to say that we could not govern ourselves, that we were not fit for self-Government and that if Ireland achieved its freedom, we would not be able to measure up to the task involved.  In any event, the question on to-day's Order Paper was tabled by Deputy McGilligan, as he was fully entitled to do, and I should have expected that the Minister in reply would deal with the question in an orderly and responsible manner.  Instead, the Minister read out a long prepared reply, a reply in which he took the opportunity of referring to live political issues in this country and giving a Party political slant to events which occurred here over the decade after we had achieved our freedom. The Minister at the end of his reply said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;However, as we successfully surmounted the efforts that were made to establish authoritarian régimes here, and as our Constitution is now generally accepted by all Parties in the Dáil, I feel confident that the democratic independence of the Twenty-Six Counties is reasonably assured and that we will ultimately extend that independence to the whole of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister why he said that.  Who asked him for that view?  I should like to know in what way does that sentiment bear any relation to the question tabled by Deputy McGilligan.</P>

      <P>The Minister's conduct this afternoon has, I regret to say, been typical of many of the Minister's performances in this House.  He appears incapable of discussing a matter in an objective manner.  He always appears anxious to impute motives, generally of an unseemly kind, when any Deputy exercises his privileges as a Deputy in this House.</P>
      <P>I think it was pertinent for Deputy McGilligan, in face of the manner in which this speech was reported in the <i>Evening Press</i>, to ask the Minister was the delegate, 3,000 miles away, saying of Ireland that 36 years ago we were not in a state to receive independence. It is true that 36 years ago the very foundations of this State were threatened. It is true that persons, including the Minister, sought at that time to endanger the new freedom we had found, but it is equally true that the Irish State was able to face up to its responsibilities and was able to establish, just after its foundation, the rule of law and order here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that it looks poorly that anyone speaking on behalf of this country abroad should speak of Ireland&mdash;an ancient country, with a civilisation far older than many other countries now in the United Nations&mdash;in a speech referring to illiterate nations.  It speaks ill that a report should have appeared which gives that impression.  I must say that I have read the speech made by our delegate and I would agree with the Minister's description of it. It is an excellent speech and a speech in which our representative states what I think would be the national view in relation to self-Government for dependent countries and countries <Col N="1422" /> under trusteeship to the United Nations.  I feel that the paragraph which is the subject matter of this question, paragraph 9 of the speech, is unhappily worded.  Our delegate, in speaking as he did according to Page 5 of his manuscript, unfortunately fell into the error of repeating the type of British cant used in relation to this country over 36 years ago.</P>
    <P>I do not in any way blame the <i>Evening Press</i> for its report of that speech.  I merely say that the question that was tabled to-day was a pertinent question on a matter of national prestige and had it been dealt with by the Minister this afternoon in an orderly manner without the type of imputation which he used in his reply, I certainly would not have raised this matter on the Adjournment.  I hope in future we shall get from the Minister in replying to questions a little bit of good taste and less of the kind of accusation made across the House this afternoon.  We are all here to try to serve the country and if we in Fine Gael see something said or done which we believe to be harmful to the cause of the country we shall raise it in the Dáil and we shall expect from the Minister or from any of his colleagues that they will deal with the question or whatever matter is concerned in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>To have the Blueshirts dragged into this question this afternoon was, in my view, a disgrace to the Minister. If that kind of ministerial antic continues this Parliament will become a farce.  The Minister was also pleased to say that this question was based on a report in some other newspaper. I do not know to what the Minister was referring.  Attached to the parliamentary question tabled in the Dáil Office was this cutting from the <i>Evening Press.</i>  I am sure the Minister was aware that it was the report in the <i>Evening Press</i> that was referred to in that question and why the Minister should avail of the question to suggest that some other newspaper report was being inquired into, I do not know.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to say anything more.  The matter would not have been raised by me or by Deputy <Col N="1423" /> McGilligan&mdash;if he had been here&mdash;if the matter had been met by the Minister in a more constructive manner.  It was not.  The Minister was pleased to refer to matters which had no relevance and no relation to this question merely for the purpose of having a crack at somebody else.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan's question wound up by asking me if the speech in the United Nations &ldquo;reflected the mind of the Government as to the ability of this country to endure the responsibilities of independence&rdquo;. Deputy McGilligan is a man accustomed to considering the meaning of words before using them.  The imputation in the question&mdash;and running all through Deputy O'Higgins's speech&mdash; was that our representative at the United Nations had called into question or cast doubts upon our ability as a nation to survive.  I resented that imputation because neither the <i>Evening Press</i> report, nor the speech itself, bore any such connotation.  The <i>Evening Press</i> report quite clearly showed what our representative at the United Nations was trying to do.</P>
      <P>The report shows that he was first of all warning the United Nations that certain of these territories suffered from great illiteracy, from a great number of disadvantages which Ireland had not suffered when we got the partial independence secured for this part of the country 36 years ago.  Just as we have here, there are in the United Nations certain people who want to make political play with the lives and fortunes of other peoples.  Certain delegations there are more interested in playing politics with the lives of the people living in these trustee territories than in helping to bring them towards independence as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy McGilligan are quite well aware of the attitude of our representative in the United Nations.  I myself sent him a copy of the speeches that outlined our policy.  I quoted them in the reply to-day.  I did not drag in the Blueshirts. I was asked about a dozen <Col N="1424" /> supplementary questions before General Mulcahy dragged out of me what I had in mind in replying to Deputy McGilligan's imputation that we thought this country could not survive as an independent nation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into this, matter at any great length.  I regret the fact that there are certain members of the Opposition who are always looking for division on matters of foreign policy, upon matters on which there is no division.  They play politics with foreign affairs and it is not right for them to do that.  They should know better; they know exactly the damage they are doing when they play politics in this way with such matters. There is no secret about this speech. I challenge anybody in the country to read the speech our delegate made on this occasion.  It was a brilliant speech and was recognised as such by those really interested in bringing these people forward to freedom.  It was recognised as the very best speech ever made in the United Nations on the subject of trustee territories.  I cannot read it here at any great length. It is in the Dáil Library and it is there for anybody to see.  It is open to the newspapers and particularly to those newspapers which completely misrepresented it.</P>
    <P>I am in the difficulty that I cannot read all this speech in the debate&mdash; something I would be very proud to do.  But I want to assure the country and our people that our delegation in the United Nations has reached the stage that when one of our representatives speaks in the Assembly or in one of the committees, he or she commands immediate attention.  When certain other delegates are speaking the headphones are down; what they will say is already known.  But when our delegates ask for the floor, as they say, when the Chairman asks one of them to speak, immediately the earphones are up and other representatives are listening, knowing that what is said is coming from the heart and is the truth as we know it.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that we speak in the interests of all the people of the world and particularly in the interests of those countries least able to look after themselves.  Among them are certain <Col N="1425" /> of the trustee territories.  Deputies O'Higgins and McGilligan know, as I do, that a number of countries got independence in recent years and that at least ten of them, are now under authoritarian or dictatorial forms of government.  There are more than that, because if you read the London <i>Times</i> of yesterday there is an article entitled &ldquo;Armies in Power&rdquo; which tells of many countries which have lost their freedom in recent years and which I did not include in the list of ten countries where democracy is out and the armies are in.</P>
    <P>I did not want to draw in the question as to whether we were capable of surviving or not.  It was Deputy McGilligan who raised the question, and I think it was legitimate to hint that I thought democracy could survive here because the Opposition that had formerly asked the people to reject the Constitution were now in favour of it.  It was only after several supplementary questions, many of which were in very bad taste, that I made a reference to a certain historical event which nobody can deny.</P>

That is what I was doing.</P>

      <P>The following table shows the estimated values, at the national average retail prices, in mid-August, 1958 (the latest date for which the information is available) of the quantities of food listed in Table 9 (page 14) of Part VI of the National Nutrition Survey, 1946-48 in respect of which comparable prices are available from the Consumer Prices Index.  Table 10 (page 15) values these items at the prices ruling at the time of the survey (1946-48).  This estimation has been carried out by reference to the detailed commodity listing such as that given in Tables 4A, 4B and 4C, pages 30-35 of Part I of the National Nutrition Survey Report.</P>
      <P>Some of the commodity groups shown in Tables 9 and 10 contain items which are not priced in the Consumer Price Index and these items have been omitted in deriving the estimated values at 1958 prices.  The items for which estimates of the price have been made account for 13/1 of the total expenditure of 14/8 per diet head per week at 1946-48 prices in Ireland.  Corresponding figures are shown in the table for each of the different areas.</P>
      <P>For particulars of the prices used for the different items and for the items for which it was not possible to estimate a price from the Consumer Price Index I would refer the Deputy to my written reply to a somewhat similar question by Deputy Norton on 20th November, 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> It must be emphasised that the prices used are the national average prices for retail purchase in shops and are uniform throughout the estimation. Furthermore it should be noted that much of the dietary of farming families, <Col N="1278" /> farm labourers' families and families living in the congested districts is not purchased retail but represents the direct consumption of agricultural produce without any sale process.</P>

      <P>The following statement sets out of the particulars requested by the Deputy.  The figures are derived from Table 2 of the Interim Report on the 1957-58 National Farm Survey, issued as a supplement to the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin</i> for September, 1958.  As stated in that report much <Col N="1279" /> of the increase in family farm income between 1956 and 1957 was due to the increase in inventories between the two years partly due to price changes. Further analysis has now been carried out and the statement includes particulars of the changes between the two years in family farm income adjusted to exclude the effect of the price element in cattle inventory changes.  Particulars are also included of the changes in family cash income, i.e., sales less purchases, in which all inventory changes are eliminated from the accounts.</P>

    <P>Figures in respect of vegetables other than potatoes, peas and onions, are not readily available.  In regard to meat, the cost would depend on the cuts used which very from day to day.  Further, much of the meat is bought in carcass form and consequently a retail price cannot readily be ascertained.  It is estimated, however, that in the case of adults, if all meat of the dearer types and cuts were issued in any week the approximate cost at Dublin retail prices would be 4s. 9d. and at National retail prices 4s. 6d., and if all meat of the cheaper types and cuts were issued the figures would be about 3s. 4d.  The weekly costs would lie between these figures.  The cost in the case of children would lie approximately within the same range.</P>
