      <P>I want to say positively that nothing in the Act, in the regulations made under it or in the instructions issued by my Department, give any grounds for regarding the figure of 10/- a day otherwise than as a maximum.  The information available to me indicates that health authorities generally have adopted reasonable standards for the determination of the charges to be made.  The responsibility for ensuring that individual cases are properly assessed having regard to all relevant circumstances rests primarily on the local administrative authorities.  If, however, the Deputy can supply me with specific instances of Section 15 cases in which, <i>prima facie</i>, payment of the maximum charge of 10/- a day was automatically insisted on, I shall take up the matter with the health authority concerned.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if his attention has been drawn to the returns from insemination stations for 1957, which show that beef strain nominations have increased to almost 60 per cent. of all nominations; and what steps he proposes to take to ensure that a continuance of this trend will not eventually affect the future supply of dairy heifers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if his attention has been drawn to statements made on behalf of organisations representing the veterinary profession and milk producers to the effect that there is likely to be a serious shortage of suitable heifers to replace reactors disposed of by dairy farmers over the next five years; and if, in view of the grave danger to the future of the dairying industry and to the production of cattle which such an eventuality implies, he will give the matter his urgent consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all conscious of the need for the provision of replacements for reacting cows and heifers. The brunt of this task must fall on the breeders.</P>
      <P>As a matter of information, I may add that recent returns from the artificial insemination centre in Kerry show that there is a substantial change over to the use of dairy bulls.  This indicates that farmers in that county are taking the necessary steps to provide the increased number of replacements. If farmers in the other dairying counties do likewise, the problem will be greatly eased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if his attention has been drawn to statements made on behalf of organisations of milk producers to the effect that their members are anxious and willing to co-operate with his Department in taking active steps to eliminate reactors from the dairying areas, but that, owing to financial circumstances, particularly amongst the small dairy farmers who form the bulk of milk producers, they are unable to bear the losses involved; and if, in the circumstances and having regard to the vital importance of the dairying <Col N="466" /> industry to our whole economy, he will give the matter his urgent attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given, and will continue to give, my closest attention to every matter that would adversely affect the achievement of the major task of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister could not see his way to give more inducement, particularly to the small dairy farmers, to provide their own replacements?  I know there are difficulties, particularly of a capital nature. This is an industry that produced indirectly £50,000,000 of our exports.  I feel encouragement should be given to the dairy farmers to make the necessary provision for replacements. According to the Minister's Department, it is estimated that requirements for the five southern counties and Kilkenny would amount to 150,000 replacements per year.  The present replacement rate is only 90,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time, all these matters of inducement and in centive have been discussed with interested parties.  As I have pointed out on more than one occasion, when engaged in these discussions, if the extent to which inducement could be offered were unlimited, I suppose it would simplify the whole process. But one has to make what one regards as the best use of what is available, and I think the provision we are making towards the eradication of bovine tuberculosis is fairly formidable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is no doubt aware, the current price of Shorthorn heifer calves has gone up during the past 12 months from £6 to £20 apiece.  Would the Minister consider guaranteeing a minimum price for dropped Shorthorn heifer calves? While I fully appreciate the limitations to which he has referred, in fact the current price is £20 and I do not believe it will ever fall below £20 for the next ten years.  It might help to get them bred if the Minister declared <Col N="467" /> himself to be a willing buyer of Shorthorn heifer calves at, say, not less than £18 or £20, for the next five years. I do not believe that would involve the Minister in one penny liability, but it would greatly encourage a number of people to send Shorthorn cows and heifers to the Shorthorn bulls.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the existing national school at Shranamonragh, Ballycroy, County Mayo, is overcrowded and that it is in poor condition generally.  A suitable site for a new school has been offered by the reverend manager and the Commissioners of Public Works have now furnished sketch plans of the school.  My Department is in communication with the reverend manager in regard to certain arrangements which will have to be made before a grant towards the cost of the erection of the school can be sanctioned.  I am unable to say at present when building operations will be commenced but I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made and will continue to be made to expedite matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands who were the allottees of land (a) on the Kenny estate, Moneyglen, Broomfield, County Monaghan, and (b) on the MacMahon estate, Brackagh, County Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The names of allottees are known in their own locality and I do not think it desirable to give them the wider publicity of mentioning them in the House.  However, I can say that the Kenny estate was divided amongst four smallholders living within a mile of the estate and the MacMahon estate&mdash; apart from seven acres still on hands &mdash;was allotted amongst 16 local people, all living within one mile of the lands, 13 of whom were uneconomic landholders, one an ex-employee and two cottiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister feel that it is an undesirable thing, once the allotment has been completed, to inform the neighbours who got the land?  Has the Minister adverted to the <Col N="470" /> fact that in rural Ireland strange rumours circulate as to who got the land, and would he not agree with me, once a decision is taken, a scheme completed and allotments made, it is a good thing to let the neighbours know who got the land so that the matter may be viewed locally on its merits, and not on the basis of rumour and falsehood?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy, my experience, which is admittedly somewhat limited, is that rumours circulate until the land is given out and then it is generally known to the people.  The rumours circulate prior to that.  It is generally known we try to avoid excessive publicity in view of the independence of the Land Commissioners and the very few complaints made in the last number of years in regard to allotments. If the Deputy would like to have a list of the allottees, I should be glad to furnish him with it and that goes for any other Deputy, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much obliged to the Minister, but I do suggest that is not a prudent course.  I think these matters are best communicated to Dáil Éireann rather than to individual Deputies.  Would the Minister not agree with me that Deputy Mooney might resent the fact that I had received from the Minister a list of allottees, as it might be reasonable for me to resent that Deputy Mooney had received a confidential list of allottees from the Minister?  No one can complain if the names are endorsed on the Official Report.  I do see the Minister's difficulty, but I think it would be more advantageous to put an end to rumours and arguments by stating, when allotments are made, who the allottees are.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that matter and I could repeat my question in a week's time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state (a) the year in which the first families were migrated from Galway West to the Midlands, (b) the number of families that have been migrated to date, (c) the acreage of land taken over by the Land Commission each year from migrants from Galway West, and (d) whether all this land has been disposed of, and, if not, the year in which it was acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards (a) migrations under the Lands Acts, 1923-54, from western counties, including Galway, to the Midlands have been taking place since 1927.  Apart from the fact that Land Commission records are not kept on a constituency basis, the precise information sought at (b), (c) and (d) is not readily available.  It would require considerable research to procure it and, in present circumstances, I would not feel justified in asking the Land Commission to divert staff for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it may meet the Deputy's requirements, however, if I state that in the period 1923-58 an area of about 238,500 acres was allotted by the Land Commission in County Galway by way of enlargement and rearrangement of existing holdings, local migrations and other miscellaneous allotments.  In the period from 1st April, 1948, to 31st March 1958, 124 families were migrated from various parts of County Galway to the Midlands and surrendered an area of approximately 5,700 acres in exchange for their new holdings.  The lands vacated by the migrants were and are being utilised for the relief of local congestion as speedily as circumstances permit.</P>

      <P>This estate became vested in the Land Commission on 10th January, 1958, which was fixed as the appointed day.

It is not possible, therefore, at this stage to indicate when allotment will take place.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately the numbers of offers of land in the immediate area seem to make it impossible, at the moment, to expand employment.  The high employment given in 1956, and for a considerable period in 1957, was due to costly thinning work which has now been completed.  The road construction programme has now also been completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the acute need for central housing for dock and other workers in the City Quay area; and whether, in view of this need, he is now prepared to accede to the representations repeatedly made for sanction for the building of flats in this area.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>I have imposed no veto on the construction of flats in the City Quay area and I will be prepared to consider any proposals on the subject which Dublin Corporation may submit for my approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the town plans are at present before the Minister, will he exercise his functions in that regard in order to permit Dublin Corporation to construct flats in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be well for the House to realise that the plan that the Deputy has mentioned is a plan that was prepared, proposed and submitted by the Dublin Corporation to the Department of Local Government. That plan, in its present draft state, and until such time as it has been confirmed by the Minister for Local Government, does not give any legal effect to the proposals contained in the draft plan.  So far as the proposition to build flats or houses in the City Quay area, which has been zoned under the proposed plan submitted by the Dublin Corporation as an industrial area, is concerned, it does not follow from it that houses may not be built but it does follow that the initiation of all proposals relating to the building of houses in that area must originate, as is the case in all other <Col N="475" /> local authorities, with the housing authority.  It might be well to add that only one proposition for the construction of flats in the City Quay area has been received in the last 20 years from the Dublin Corporation and that was some years ago for an insignificant scheme which was not approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it now that that scheme for which the residents in the City Quay area are anxious and which was vetoed absolutely by the Minister's predecessor, a Deputy sitting in this House to-day, can now be reconsidered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not to be taken from what I have told the Deputy. What can be taken is that I am anxious, and also the Government and my Department are anxious that any proposals for the building of houses in the City Quay area which are meritorious in their own right, coming from the housing authority, will be given sympathetic consideration and I hope that they do come forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state the date on which approval was conveyed to the Dublin Corporation for its proposal to build flats in Hogan Place, the date on which final sanction was given by his Department, and the estimated date of the handing over of these flats by the contractor concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Approval to plans prepared by Dublin Corporation for a scheme of flats at Hogan Place was conveyed by the Department's letter of 27th February, 1954.  Sanction was given by the Department on 4th January, 1957, to the acceptance of a <Col N="476" /> tender for the building of the flats and I understand that the corporation expect to have the flats handed over by the contractor on 30th June, 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's statement that, in effect, he agrees that this new look on flats in the Dublin City area did not start and could not commence until within two or three weeks of a general election, that these flats, which are particularly attractive and can be described as having the new look, were approved when he was not in office and were sanctioned as a result of the efforts of the previous Parliamentary Secretary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the House to know that first approval was given on the 27th February, 1954.  I think that is worth noting.  Secondly, it is also worth noting that final approval, which had been delayed from then until 1957, was not given until the beginning of January, 1957, when there was also an election on the way for those in the know.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1958&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That Section 21 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The net point here involved is that the Bill as submitted by the Minister, contemplates certain pretty complicated changes in respect of the existing law in regard to the expenses of directors, managers and employees of companies.  The Minister himself indicated that he fully appreciated that the proposed amendment was complex and Deputy Haughey, in his contribution to the debate, said that he had studied the proposals and believed that he understood the context of the Bill.  He expressed himself as being in agreement with my view that, even if one did fully understand the context of the Bill, it was extremely difficult to forecast how these provisions would react on people living in the conditions obtaining in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that these proposals have been taken over substantially from British Finance Acts, and some of us believe that in their present form they are suitable for conditions obtaining in places like London, Manchester, Liverpool and in the general industrial <Col N="484" /> context of life in Great Britain, but that they may not be suitable for conditions obtaining here.  I am prepared to confess quite frankly that I am not able to determine, in my own mind, how these provisions would impact on the bulk of our people who live in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are, in this House, sometimes inclined to overlook the fact that a surprising number of small businesses in rural Ireland have been incorporated into limited liability companies during the past 20 or 30 years. Therefore, without purporting to pass judgment on these proposals at all, the substance of my submission is that, inasmuch as we have sitting at present a commission to review the whole code of income-tax law, it would be more appropriate to leave this part of the Finance Bill to that commission, and ask them, if necessary, to give an interim report upon it, when this House could consider it with full information.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister for Finance that if he considers it to be a matter of urgency, there could be no exception taken to his dropping this part of the Bill for the present, on the clear understanding that if the Commission on Income-Tax gives us an interim report on these proposals during the Recess, the Minister for Finance could declare himself to be free to bring in an additional Finance Bill in the autumn to give effect to this proposal in whatever form he was satisfied was best, having perused an informed report and having had before him such evidence as interested parties might bring to the Income-Tax Commission.</P>
    <P>I could quite envisage a situation arising in which the Minister would not be prepared to accept the interim report of the Income-Tax Commission, but at least it would be available to him for consideration.  But, in my opinion, what is much more important, he would have available to him the representations of those who apprehended that these proposals might impact upon them unfairly, or unreasonably, or to a degree which had not been contemplated by the Minister when he submitted this Bill to the House.  That is a reasonable proposal and a proposal which the <Col N="485" /> Minister can reasonably be asked to consider on its merits, but also in the light of the declaration which I am prepared to make that I do not know how these proposals will operate in the conditions with which I am familiar in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I direct the Minister's attention to the fact that Deputy Haughey, who claims to have a very much clearer appreciation of the literal provisions of this part of the Bill, is also in my dilemma in so far as forecasting their impact upon the peculiar conditions obtaining in this country.  I use the word &ldquo;peculiar&rdquo; not for the purpose of indicating something strange, but to indicate that there are conditions obtaining in Ireland which may not be reproduced in Great Britain or elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the only point stressed by Deputy Dillon was that we should wait until the Income-Tax Commission report is received.  As I stated already, the undesirable practices we are attempting to deal with in Part IV are on the increase and I do not think we would be justified in allowing them to continue not to speak of allowing them to increase while waiting for the commission to report.  I do not know how long it will take to report but it may be taken for granted that, by the time we have received such a report and dealt with it, it will be a matter of another couple of financial years. I do not think we would be justified in waiting for that to happen.</P>
      <P>I was thinking over this debate on Part IV during the week-end.  I think I am right in interpreting the Dáil as raising no strong objection to the proposals dealing with benefits in kind. As far as I can remember, I do not think any Deputy condemned them and in fact I think it was said there was no great objection to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any objection either to dealing with a person who is getting money under the guise of expenses for the purpose of evading income-tax.  The company paying that money out is to blame.  Deputy Sweetman said he did not see why a company would do that because naturally they would be watching not to pay out <Col N="486" /> more money than was due to directors or employees.  The trouble is that there are some companies&mdash;not many because the great majority of companies are very strict in their dealings with their employees and even with their directors&mdash;who are prepared to say to a man: &ldquo;We will give you £500 a year and £800 expenses.&rdquo;  It makes no difference to the company in that case whether they give the man £1,300 salary or £500 and £800 expenses.  It makes no difference to them financially; it should make a difference to their conscience, if they have one. That is the type of case being dealt with here and I think Deputies have no great objection to it.</P>
    <P>The big objection appears to be in relation to entertainment.  There appears to be an anxiety or a fear that companies will not be permitted to entertain their business friends as they think necessary in the course of business.  There should not be any anxiety as far as that is concerned.  As far as the entertainment is concerned, the inspector will have a right to inquire.  He has no right to inquire at the moment but he will have a right to inquire if he is suspicious.</P>
    <P>Of course, Deputies must realise that in practice there are not enough inspectors to inquire into every entertainment. The most they can do is to inquire where they are suspicious of a particular company doing more in this way than is really genuine.  They have the right to inquire, therefore, whether a particular sum of money paid for entertainment was necessary in the legal sense for the benefit of the company. If the inspector disallows it, then there is an appeal to the special commissioners.  If the inspector allows it and if the special commissioners allow it, then there is no further inquiry.</P>
    <P>It has never been the practice of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;and they are not going to adopt any new practice under Part IV&mdash;to say that the entertainment was necessary but not on the scale on which it was given.  They have never said: &ldquo;You should not have given champagne and cigars.&rdquo;  If the entertainment is necessary, it is for the company to decide what form the <Col N="487" /> entertainment should take.  That is the point I want to make very clear.</P>
    <P>I admit I did not read it word by word but on looking through the debate, and also on recollecting certain letters and so on I got from business people outside, I believe the big fear they have is that the representative of the Revenue Commissioners will criticise the employer for the form of entertainment he gives.  There will be no such thing.  The ordinary entertainment given to business friends and to staffs will never be questioned. There may be a question in a particular case.  Talking to some businessmen recently I said: &ldquo;If a manager of a private company, let us say, wants to celebrate his wife's 21st birthday and if he asks 100 of his friends to the party, which has nothing to do with business at all, and it costs £500 and he puts it down to business, that will not be allowed.&rdquo;  That is an extreme case.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if a company is doing well and if the manager says: &ldquo;We are going to get publicity by giving the biggest spree ever given in this country; we are going to ask everybody who ever dealt with us to come up and we are going to give dinner, champagne, cigars and a dance for 1,000&rdquo;&mdash;if he thought that was necessary for his business, that would be allowed and allowed in full. There would be no question about the champagne and the cigars.  I think that is the point troubling some Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister for Finance thinks I am troubled about the champagne and cigars distributed at dinners given by wealthy companies in this country, I want to assure him that there is nothing further from my mind.  What I am thinking of is the shopkeeper in rural Ireland who lives in, and has lived in ever since he started his business, and is now the director of a company.  Does he become liable for income-tax on the bit he eats and the drop he drinks?  If he invites in a neighbour to have two half-ones on a Saturday night, must he charge up the half-one that he gives <Col N="488" /> the neighbour to his expenses and must he hold himself liable for the half-one he drinks himself?</P>
      <P>Quite honestly, my problem is that I cannot envisage how these proposals will impact on our kind of life in rural Ireland.  I am not in any sense desiring to give the Minister for Finance a short answer.  I think he entirely misunderstands my anxiety about this matter if he feels I am greatly concerned about the claiming back of legitimate business expenses by large corporations.  I can very well see that a very strong case could be made on strictly economic grounds by large companies that it is part of their necessary business to give banquets, substantial entertainments and so forth.  That is not an argument in which I am greatly interested.  I believe that such persons are well able to make their own case.</P>
      <P>What I am really concerned about is to ensure that a great deal of unnecessary inconvenience and apprehension will not be spread in country towns like Clones, Ballybay, Castleblayney, Carrickmacross and Monaghan. I can see that happening. Before we adopt these general proposals, which have been operating in England for some time, all I am pressing on the Minister is that we ought to have some opportunity of inviting bodies, such as R.G.D.A.T.A., and others representative of the kind of business that operates here, to state their views and explain their difficulties so that, even if we do not accept them at their face value, we can propose some means by which they can simplify their problem for themselves.  But I do want to impress on the Minister that it is quite illusory to imagine that you can put the proposals incorporated in this Bill into operation to-morrow morning without running into all sorts of snags in which I do not believe the Minister wants to involve people.  He will find that these provisions will catch all sorts of people and all sorts of practices in rural Ireland which are well established and to which no legitimate exception can be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned on a previous occasion, and elicited agreement from <Col N="489" /> the present Minister for Finance, that the tendency of all financial legislation for some time has been to make the position of the small private company more and more difficult and that such legislation is pretty well forcing the small private company out of existence.  There are certain world forces which it is very difficult to control or check.  I remember when I raised this matter in a wider context here the Minister for Finance replied that he entirely sympathised with me in my anxiety and wanted to say most emphatically that anything he could do to help the small business to survive in the complex world in which we live to-day he would conceive it to be his duty to do.</P>
    <P>When one contemplates a fiscal reform of this character, it is not the kind of contingency to which the Minister has just referred that worries me.  People like that can look after themselves.  It is the small business throughout the country which will get caught up in this new maze of controls and regulations.  The trouble is that there is no use issuing reassurances that the Revenue Commissioners will not do this and will not do that.  The Revenue Commissioners have to do their duty and it is we, in Dáil Éireann, who impose that duty on the Revenue Commissioners and they must do it in accordance with the letter of the law that we enact.</P>
    <P>I apprehend that under this part of this Bill in its present form we shall impose a duty on the Revenue Commissioners to carry out all sorts of inquisitions in regard to small business and thereby make the existence of the small business almost impossible.  What is worse, we are going to direct the Revenue Commissioners to do a number of things that we do not think they ought to do; and we are going to give them that direction because we do not know the meaning of the legislation proposed to us.  Surely every canon of prudence demands that, when we have in existence the machinery to get the information, we ought to use it.  There cannot be any urgency about this.  No very big sum can be involved and, whether the levy is enacted to-day or in 12 months' time, I cannot imagine that it will shake the foundations of <Col N="490" /> the State very materially.  There can be no advantages to the Exchequer in this financial year at all because any assessment made under these provisions will not operate until next year.</P>

But much can be gained by postponing this matter for further information and for second thoughts.</P>
      <P>In principle, if the purpose of this part of the Bill were fully and adequately explained by the Minister's explanation of it, I could find no serious fault with it.  If its purpose were to prevent the fraudulent granting of excessive expenses to directors and servants of public companies I do not believe any Deputy would take exception to it.  In that good cause let us not enact legislation which will carry confusion and anxiety, and a very real and unnecessary distress, into the houses of a great many honest people.</P>
      <P>In that connection let me remind the Minister, as was mentioned by Deputy Haughey earlier, that taxpayers are broadly divided into two categories. Like Charles Lamb's division into those who borrow and those who lend, taxpayers are divided broadly into two categories.  One is the category which says to their accountants: &ldquo;I want to pay whatever tax is due.  Let the accounts be submitted to the Revenue Commissioners without embroidery. Fight them as hard as you can but be in a position to assure me when I write my cheque that I have paid them the last penny they can claim against me.&rdquo; The other category is the person who says: &ldquo;Let us now apply our minds to how far we can put our finger in the Revenue Commissioners' eye&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> I am thinking of the poor devils who want to pay what is due and who, in a very considerable number of cases in rural Ireland, will find themselves levied under this part of this Bill with charges that I do not believe the Minister for Finance wants to levy upon them but which it will become the duty of the Revenue Commissioners to levy because, long after we have passed this Bill, the interpretation of these sections will fall to be made.  Anyone who has any experience of Government knows that theoretically, when a Bill is submitted to the Government, the Government is supposed to know, through its own advisers, what the Bill means, and it is on that basis they commend it to the House.  Any Minister of experience will tell you that when a Bill comes to be interpreted and enforced it frequently emerges that it means a great deal more than anybody foresaw, and sometimes it means a great deal less.</P>
    <P>There is a classic example of that before us at the present time.  We brought the Solicitors Bill in here.  We believed everybody knew what it meant.  We submitted it to the whole legal profession of Ireland.  They reviewed it at great length and, reinforced by the opinion of the law officers and the Government, we brought it to this House and passed it.  However, the first time it was judicially examined by a court of competent jurisdiction a horse and cart was driven through it.  We are now faced with the obligation of introducing amending legislation although the original Bill purported to have the approval of the entire legal profession plus the law officers plus the Government and the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am making this modest plea, that, before we clamp down Part IV of this Bill on the whole trading community of Ireland, we will at least ask the commission which is at present sitting to interrupt their proceedings for the purpose of considering the impact of Part IV on the people and inviting those who apprehend that it will affect them to come before them and let their voice be heard.  That is a reasonable and modest request and I press it strongly on the Minister.  All I have <Col N="492" /> said is said on the assumption that there is no proposal for retrospection in this part of the Bill and I am confirmed in that view by the Minister's interruption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get the question of dates clear first of all.  As I understand the matter, the effect of Section 21, if it is passed, is that the items included therein are by virtue of Section 25 to be included in the information given under Section 105 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, and we have already in Section 6 of this Bill been retrospective in our application of Section 105.</P>
      <P>Section 6 refers to payments made after 5th April, 1957.  Therefore, the combination of Sections 21, 25 and 6 of this Bill and Section 105 of the 1918 Act has the effect of making the provisions of Section 21 retrospective.  If it has not, I should like the Minister to explain to us why there is nothing in Part IV of the Bill to suggest that, notwithstanding the combined operations of the sections I have mentioned, Part IV is to take effect on the 5th April next year?  Could the Minister elucidate that conundrum for us before we proceed any further?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>Will the position not be that in the year 1958-59, the income of the kind of people we are talking about will be taxed on the basis of what they earned in the year commencing 5th April, 1957, and ending 5th April, 1958?  Therefore, in so far as the expenses which we are talking about were incurred in the year ended 5th April, 1958, they will come within the ambit of this Bill and be assessed for 1958-59 on the basis of the previous year, so that in that respect the section is retrospective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  If you would look at Section 63 (7), it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Parts IV and VI of this Act and the First Schedule thereto shall be deemed to come into force and shall take effect as on and from the 6th day of April, 1958.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As regards one's income for the year 1958-59, is it not on the basis of what one received during the year 5th April, 1957, to 5th April, <Col N="493" /> 1958, that one is taxed under the provisions of the Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an expert on income-tax, but the Revenue Commissioners must have an indication or a measure of this year's income.  It is required only for that purpose.  You are assessed on last year's income but it is corrected in the following year. Your income for 1957 is only a measure of what you will pay in 1958.  The actual 1958 figure will apply afterwards. Therefore, Section 63 (7) is correct; in that respect the provision does not come into operation until 6th April, 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the effect of Section 21 to bring these expenses in under Rule 1 of Schedule E and is Schedule E not always assessed on the preceding year without any adjustment when the actual figure is available, except of course in the case where you are dealing with the concluding year of a job or something like that?  I think the Minister has gone astray in that respect.  I am rather inclined to think, however, that Section 63 does mean what he says in one respect but that it does not in another.  It is quite clear that under Section 6 of this Bill a return must be made as from the 6th April, 1957, in respect of the matters included in Section 21, even if only the return has to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is wrong for the Minister to be looking for the returns if he is making the case that there is no tax liability in respect thereof?  If his case is that there is no tax liability in respect thereof, the return should be looked for only in respect of the period for which there is tax liability and Section 6 gives the date as 6th April, 1957.  The information should be available from the 6th April, 1958, for 1958-59.  I think Section 6 is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an argument as to whether retrospection exists or does not exist and into that argument I do not want to be drawn for the moment, <Col N="494" /> because I made my argument to the Minister on the basis that I accepted his proposition that the element of retrospection did not enter in.  I based my arguments on entirely different grounds designed to secure from the Minister the reference of this part of the Bill to the Commission on Income-Tax for examination so that he and we might be more fully informed of its public impact in the peculiar conditions obtaining in this country.</P>
      <P>I want to reinforce that representation by reminding the House of this fact.  The Revenue Commissioners' duty is the protection of the revenue and to that end they make their recommendations to the Minister for Finance.  I submit to the House that the first check upon the commendable and admirable zeal of the Revenue Commissioners in the protection of the public Exchequer is the judgment of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance, having some proposal by the Revenue Commissioners for the better protection of the revenue, brings that to the House to hear from Deputies on all sides their views as to how this measure, which all agree is designed to improve the prospects of the revenue, will affect the citizens of the State.</P>
      <P>I think a very strong case has been made to the Minister, that this proposal calls for further and better inquiry as to how it will react upon the people.  That is all I am asking.  I am not asking the Minister to say now that he has been shaken in his original view, in regard to Part IV of the Bill, that the Revenue Commissioners' recommendation is right.  All I am asking him to say is: &ldquo;Listen; having heard the anxieties expressed in the House, I am prepared to suspend judgment until I have before me a record of the evidence of interested parties on whose behalf Deputies appear to speak, who will at least tell me what their apprehensions are, and the report of the Income-Tax Commission on their recommendations.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That could be said, on the clear understanding that the Minister may come back to the House and say: &ldquo;I do not accept the view of the commissioners <Col N="495" /> and I propose the following answers to the various anxieties expressed by interested parties in the minutes of evidence which have been submitted to me, and I suggest the following simplifications in procedure to those interests or individuals who have expressed anxiety in order to ensure that these legislative proposals in the Finance Bill, which are designed to put an end to abuses, will not inadvertently make life impossible for those who are concerned only to conform to the law.&rdquo;  Surely that is a reasonable proposition to put to the Minister and surely it would mean no serious abridgement of his purpose if he indicated that he was prepared to accept it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one short observation on what Deputy Dillon has said, before we go back to the other question of dates.  Over the week-end, I had the opportunity of having a word with a few people who understand this type of taxation matter in a way that I could never hope to understand it.  They have all been unanimously of the opinion that the man who wants to put through a fake, such a fake as the Minister mentioned of £500 or £800 expenses, has half a dozen ways by which, at sight, he can get away with it under this part of the Bill.  There is not the slightest difficulty in an individual driving a coach and four through this Bill, if he wants to deal with matters on the lines the Minister indicated a few moments ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only effect of this part of the Bill will be on the people who want to be straight and want to pay their share as they go.  As it stands at present, they will be put to very considerable additional expense and trouble in making out the details that are to be required.  Those I spoke to were quite unanimous in the view that there was nothing in this part of the Bill which would deter a man who wished to get around the existing powers and principles in the Income-Tax Acts; that all that would happen under this was that companies would have to keep considerable additions to their books and that auditors would have to do considerably more work in relation to <Col N="496" /> their audits; that in 99 per cent. of the cases it would work out at exactly the same result as at present for the revenue, from the point of view of tax; and that in all cases it would be additional administrative cost for the companies concerned and an additional administrative cost for the auditors, and that, of course, would ultimately fall back on the manufacturer or trader, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am not an expert in relation to this matter at all, but it seems to me, as far as I can read this Bill, that if a person has a small company&mdash; a publican, shall we say&mdash;and one of the directors of that company is standing behind the bar in a rural town in Ireland, anywhere you like, and in the ordinary course of events, it becomes necessary for him to stand a drink to somebody coming in to do business with him, he will have to put that down in a special way in his ledger account. That is a thing which happens quite regularly&mdash;it has got to be done&mdash;every publican will tell the Minister that it has to be done.  I am sure the Minister has been on the other side of the counter and seen it happen, wholly and necessarily and exclusively for the purposes of the business.  I cannot see the sense of returns of that sort having to be kept.</P>
    <P>I am at one with the Minister in being anxious to ensure that a fake will not be perpetrated on the general body of taxpayers.  We are all quite happy to ensure that that will not occur.  However, this Bill will not provide against such an occurrence.  All this Bill will do is give more trouble, cause more expense to the 99 per cent. of the taxpayers who are decent, honourable people and it will not prevent the other 1 per cent. from getting away with the matter as they wish.</P>
    <P>It has not happened on the other side.  We are in an entirely different position here.  I really cannot see what the Minister hopes to gain by this section&mdash;except, perhaps, to drive a lot of people against him in business who would be otherwise inclined to take a reasonable view.  It seems to me that there cannot be any other conclusion in relation to this.  It will mean that those who wish to avoid paying <Col N="497" /> their full share will be able to do so under this part of the Bill, those who do not will pay as they pay at present and, in addition, for the privilege of paying, they will have to pay more staff to keep additional accounts in their offices and in their trading returns and they will have to pay their accountants more fees for doing their audits.  If that would be any benefit to the auditors, there might be some measure of approval from certain sections, but I suspect that it will cost the auditors far more in time and staff to do the audit of the additional amounts than any increase in fees they may be able to obtain.</P>
    <P>I would seriously ask the Minister to take another look at this section.  I do not think he quite correctly interpreted me when he was speaking before, but that does not matter in the slightest. It seems to me that the matter could be got round by some form of certificate being required from the secretary of a company for the purposes of the revenue, that no director or employee of the company had been paid any expenses other than such as were required for the proper and reasonable reimbursement of the expenses he had incurred in his job.</P>
    <P>I am not tying myself to that phraseology, but something like that would save a lot of unnecessary accounting and the onus would then be on the secretary of the company to do what was reasonable.  If there was a deliberate fake of the sort the Minister mentioned, the secretary of the company would be amenable for having certified what was not a genuine transaction, for certifying a fake transaction as genuine.  The secretary, or chairman or some officer of the company would know that responsibility rested on him and if fake transactions were certified as genuine by an officer of the company, everybody in the House will agree that in such circumstances it would be right that the law should come down like a ton of bricks on the person who so certified.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the Minister can otherwise avoid encumbering the 99 per cent. of honest straightforward people for the sake of trying to catch the other 1 per cent., and I am told <Col N="498" /> he will not succeed in doing that, in any event, under this section.  One of the ways in which that could be done would be to adopt the suggestion made already by me and again by Deputy Dillon in relation to this section, that the whole of Part IV of the Bill should be referred to the commission for the purpose of a special interim report, if needs be.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from all that, I should like the Minister to tell us clearly what is the object of going back in Section 6 to 5th April, 1957, linking Section 6 and Section 25 with Section 105 of the Income Tax Act of 1918, if the chargeability this year will not be based on the returns obtained for last year.  Finally, may I ask the Minister to say, categorically, yes or no to this question?  I think he is incorrect when he said some minutes ago that Section 21 would be variable year by year, that the expenses of the preceding year would be used as a measure and adjusted to actuality at a later stage. Is he correct or not in that?  I am not trying to score any point, but I think he was incorrect.  I think the position is that it is always the income and expenses of the preceding year that are taken and that it is only where a person is terminating his employment that there could be any question of coming back to actuality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the subject matter of my amendment as to the type of payment which might be excluded from the operation of Section 21, the Minister has indicated that in future the revenue authorities will be very pleased to negotiate with bodies acting on behalf of employees and directors.  I am very grateful to him for that statement.  I thought, when he was replying to the debate on Section 21, he might also have obliged me by dealing with a question I put to him about dispensations which are practised in England, and also with home savings and whether he is completely satisfied about the word &ldquo;perquisite&rdquo; as used in line 35.  If he could deal with those matters, I should be very grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it would be <Col N="499" /> very rash for a Minister for Finance to say that he would bring in a Bill through which no one would drive a coach and four.  If that happened in this case I think I would be the first Minister for Finance ever to do it.  In all probability, Deputy Sweetman is right in saying that the people we are trying to catch under this will find a way out of it to some extent, but the Revenue Commissioners and representatives will be in a stronger position. For the first time, they will be able to get at least whatever information may be in the accounts of the company.</P>
      <P>They will be able to examine the accounts and find out how the expenses were distributed between the various directors and employees and that may help them to stop this irregularity we are trying to end.</P>
      <P>Secondly, as the law stands, an employer may give, let us say, £700 to somebody for expenses.  He need not give any return of that; if he did make a return of it under the law at the moment, I presume the inspector could deal with it, but in future the inspector will definitely be in a position to deal with it under the new legislation, and, in the case of that amount of £700, he will be able to tell the individual concerned what he believes would be a fair measure of his expenses and that he would be assessed therefore for income-tax on the remainder of the £700.  Of course the man may appeal, and then it will go the same way as every other question of income-tax goes.  I believe we would be in a stronger position with this legislation to deal with these people than we are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who spoke against this part of the Bill have not been very helpful in suggesting other ways of dealing with it.  Deputy Sweetman made one proposal, that we might ask the secretary of the company to certify that he was sure that the amounts set out were properly expended by the company in expenses.  The trouble with that is that we would accept that &mdash;I am quite sure&mdash;from the great majority of companies, but these are the companies with which we have no trouble at present.  There is a minority <Col N="500" /> of companies who are giving trouble and I am afraid that the secretaries of some of these companies would sign anything in the way of a statutory declaration, unless we have some way of testing its veracity.  If we are to have a way of testing it, that means examination.</P>
    <P>My point is that we cannot accept a declaration from the secretary of a company because these companies that are evading income-tax at present by paying out far too much under the guise of expenses to directors and higher employees are the very people who will certify whatever suits them. We need some way of proving that the certificate is correct and I do not see how we could prove that, unless we have Section 6 in Part IV of this Bill to do it.  For that reason, I do not know if the certificate is very much use, but I think the certificate would be very useful as a means of getting over what we might call the honest companies&mdash;we could probably accept that in their case and be quite satisfied to go no further.  I think, however, that certificates in lieu of what is here would be absolutely useless.</P>
    <P>With regard to this question of retrospection, Deputies have put a certain doubt in my mind.  I do not mean to have retrospection and I shall have to consider the matter.  I must look at it again before the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to admit that the two Deputies who did most of the speaking&mdash;Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Haughey&mdash;know more about income-tax than I do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We may have different ideas about how it should be done.  I must admit I was wrong in saying that, if a man were assessed under Schedule E, as he would be under Section 21, it would not be adjusted afterwards. <Col N="501" /> That makes the question of retrospection more serious than I thought.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey referred to the word &ldquo;perquisite&rdquo; in Rule 4 (3) of Schedule E.  I am told that that was repealed in 1922 and does not therefore arise.  The Deputy also referred to home savings.  I do not think it arises through legislation but is a matter of administration.  I suppose we should review the matter and see if it would be possible to have it considered in that way.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I shall have to put aside the question of dispensations at the moment as I am not very clear on the point.  I may come back to it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to hear the Minister say that, up to now, the Revenue Commissioners have been powerless to investigate in the question of expenses.  If they have been powerless, they have not been unduly scrupulous about keeping within the letter or the spirit of the law.  As a businessman, I know they have inspected business accounts in the greatest detail and have demanded, and received, the most detailed explanations of almost every conceivable sort of expenditure on any company balance sheet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister is misinformed when he says the Revenue Commissioners had not already got that power. I cannot imagine that the Revenue Commissioners would have acted <i>ultra vires</i> for such a long time without being questioned.  To my knowledge, they have gone through accounts to such an extent that, where two companies joined to form a new company and where a person who was associated with, shall we say, one of the old companies, company &ldquo;A&rdquo;, and did not wish to be associated with the new amalgamated company and was granted a pension by the amalgamated company, the Revenue Commissioners decided the new company was not entitled to pay a pension to a person who had not actually given service to it, even though service had been given to its immediate predecessor.  I cannot imagine how the Revenue Commissioners ever got wind of that arrangement, unless we were compelled to, <Col N="502" /> and did in fact, disclose it on our accounts.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners already have a very adequate power to investigate expenses.  I am not one of those who favour cigars and champagne: let the Minister be under no illusion about that.  My worry is the additional administrative expense to which a company will be put by reason, now, of being forced to make individual returns for each employee and each director.  It puts an almost impossible burden on them.  Inevitably, these returns will become inaccurate, even in the case of an honest company, and, in the case of a dishonest company, it would be quite impossible for the Revenue Commissioners subsequently to decide whether it was an accurate or inaccurate return.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to investigate the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to make inquiries on expenses or any other item of accounts submitted to them.  I am convinced their powers of inquiry are virtually unlimited.  If it should be established by the Minister that the powers are as restricted as he said earlier this afternoon, I would hope he would conduct an immediate inquiry into the past history of the Revenue Commissioners and inspectors of taxes and inquire from them under what power they have been acting up to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Booth's point with regard to existing procedure which appears to have been adopted by the Revenue Commissioners all down the years.  It is my experience as a businessman that, from time to time, they may question and ask for a break-down of the returns given of expenses of employees or directors, as the case may be.  Any accountant will tell you that when he is submitting the returns of a firm's audit to the Revenue Commissioners, the report is usually accompanied by a break-down statement on a number of items, more particularly with regard to expenses deemed to be incurred by such employee in the discharge of his duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel the Revenue Commissioners already have machinery to satisfy <Col N="503" /> themselves that any expenses claimed are proper and that, when they find irregularity in that connection, they can disallow the expenses.  In practice, any person who has appealed has found it very difficult to sustain the appeal before the special commissioners.</P>
    <P>If this section as it now stands is to go through I think all firms who, at the moment, generally speaking, are obliged to have their accounts audited, for purposes apart from the Revenue Commissioners at all, will find themselves put to expense.  Accountants will have to undertake more work and go into greater detail.  In that way, additional expense will be imposed on the business management of the company or concern, as the case may be. I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter and try to be satisfied with the existing powers of which the Revenue Commissioners are possessed and which I consider to be quite sufficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amazed to hear the Minister suggest a minute ago that the Revenue Commissioners had no powers at present to examine expenses submitted by any company.  I do not believe the Revenue Commissioners have been carrying out an examination such as they have been carrying out for the past 25 to 30 years without such a power.  Apart from anything else it seems to me fairly clear that the powers exist as part of the general examination, and I feel sure that the Minister cannot have been advised that the Revenue Commissioners have no powers at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are additional powers included in this section, that the Revenue Commissioners have not got at present, then I would ask the Minister to tell us what are the exact additional powers that they have not got as it is.  If we knew what the existing position was, and what the new position will be, then we would have a somewhat net issue about which to argue.  To suggest that the Revenue Commissioners have no powers at present to examine the accounts of companies, of boards of directors or individuals, <Col N="504" /> to see whether there was undue charging for expenses in their accounts is, I think, miles wide of the mark.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a statement.  The Revenue Commissioners are not able to find out, or to get, the information they require with regard to a person &mdash;he may be a director or he may be an employee&mdash;who is getting money under the guise of expenses but which is really far too much for that purpose. It is true that they have not got that power.  When a company makes its return, when the auditor or solicitor, or whoever it may be deals with the Revenue Commissioners, the company must give information to an inspector to justify its expenses.  The inspector may ask questions about how these expenses were incurred, and so on, but the company can evade or refuse to give the details with regard to what is paid out to each director.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Revenue Commissioners came to me with this part <Col N="505" /> of the Act, that is the first thing I said to them.  I asked them had they no power and they replied they had not, that companies can refuse to answer questions on this matter.  They said if they asked how much a director got for expenses the company could reply its returns were net total expenses for travelling, and it did not know how much each individual director or employee received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listen to me for a minute. I am repeating what the Revenue Commissioners told me.  They instanced a case where an inspector dealt with a company's return of £5,000 for expenses.  That inspector could say: &ldquo;I am cutting that down to £1,000 because I am not satisfied,&rdquo; but later the special commissioners could hold that, even though the inspector was not satisfied, the £5,000 was a reasonable sum for expenses for the company concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because if a dishonest company wants to give £1,000 to a director, which he will not put down for income-tax, the company will put it down as expenses.  Now the commissioners will have more powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It leaves the position as it was in which there were £5,000 expenses put in the accounts and the special commissioners said: &ldquo;That £5,000 is reasonable for that sort of business.&rdquo;  That is the case, as I understand it, made by the Minister. If the special commissioner says £5,000 expenses are reasonable for that case, what further information does anybody want about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect what this section is for, and it is not what the Minister believes it is for.  I suspect it is to get in something new.  I suspect the Revenue Commissioners are not <Col N="507" /> satisfied with the decisions of the courts as they are at present, and this is an endeavour to get around that.  I do not think the Minister realises that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I myself have heard people boasting about getting expenses in a certain way which was not justified.  I am sure there is not a Deputy here so innocent or so green that he does not know that is going on.  It is certainly going on, and this is something we are endeavouring to stop.  Some Deputies seem to think we are going too far in trying to stop it; some Deputies, like Deputy Dillon, think we are going too soon to stop it, and Deputy Sweetman says it is useless, that it will go on in any case.  As between the whole lot, is it not as well to let the Bill through and see what will happen?  One thing I want to try to impress on Deputies is, that the powers are not there.  That is certain.  The inspector can question a company about expenses from the point of view of the company.  In that process of questioning, it is not his primary purpose to look for information against a director or an employee. It is the company he is dealing with.</P>

      <P>What else am I doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>You are doing the reverse.  The Minister, in this Bill, will not be able to get after the tricksters at all and he is going to impose a wholly unnecessary load on the 99 per cent. of the people who are trying to bear their fair share of the burden. The plain fact of the matter is that the Minister is working himself up to a little heat because he knows he has got a very bad case.  It is perfectly clear on the case the Minister made&mdash; I take the Minister's own case&mdash;that if a company has to incur £5,000 travelling expenses spread over one person or 20 persons, the special commissioners, when it comes up to them, will obviously consider how many travellers are needed for that business and so forth.  The special commissioners decide that for the purpose of the business the £5,000 expenses are necessary. It does not seem to me to make a hoot of difference to whom it is paid, if it is necessary.  There is nothing in that at all.  The whole purpose of this section must be something more than the Minister has indicated.</P>
      <P>Let us come back to the Minister's tirade for a moment.  We have not been long on this section, but we have spent days on this Bill because the Bill does not do the job that should be done by a Finance Bill.  This Bill puts a brake on industry, on trade, by unreasonable provisions and does not provide in any way for stopping the holes to which the Minister has made reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made a suggestion earlier to-day in relation to the certification by the secretary of a company which could be dealt with quite easily and, notwithstanding what the Minister says, it could be dealt with in such a way as to ensure that the trickster could not get away with it.  I am interested in relation to this section to ensure that people will not be expected to keep innumerable additional records that are wholly unnecessary.  It would be perfectly simple to restrict the records <Col N="509" /> to be kept to the type of case the Minister has mentioned on more than one occasion, the case where a person is paid £1,300 and the company says that £500 of that is salary and £800 expenses, even though the proper proportion should be, shall we say, £1,000 salary and £300 expenses.</P>
    <P>It would be perfectly easy to restrict the effect of this section to cases where composite expenses were paid, where a director or an employee was paid a round composite sum to cover his expenses.  There would not be much difficulty in returns being completed in that respect.  What annoys me is that every honest taxpayer has to keep an account of trifling sums under the section as it is now framed.  It would be perfectly easy to ensure that the secretary of a company could certify and that the certificate would be accepted, a certificate that the amounts included for expenses other than those in the return were only in respect of reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses, that the composite expenses would then be in the return and that the Revenue Commissioners would have all the information they wanted in relation to the composite expenses figure.  Then it would be quite easy for an inspector of taxes, on such a certificate, to satisfy himself beyond yea or nay whether the secretary's certificate is right or is not right.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself has admitted that it is not the vast majority of companies&mdash;I said 1 per cent. and I do not think the Minister and I will fight about a percentage&mdash;but only a small percentage of companies whose secretaries' certificates he could not accept.  All right.  Everybody knows that accounts are examined at present, that notwithstanding what the Minister says, the Revenue Commissioners do examine accounts, do satisfy themselves as to what they are in respect of.  The case made all along by the Minister in respect of this section is that he wants to get after the faked composite expenses accounts.  O.K. Let him do so but let him not involve the ordinary businessman in keeping strings of unnecessary records for that purpose.</P>
    <P>If this section were amended to <Col N="510" /> ensure that there would be a return of composite expenses, that in respect of actual reimbursement of actual outlay paid, the secretary of a company would be bound, with the appropriate penalties as are included in the Income-Tax Acts, to certify that everything outside the return represented merely repayment of actual expenses, the Minister would save the 99 per cent. honest taxpayers&mdash;to use his own words&mdash;having to go to additional administrative expense and trouble and he would have all the powers that he wants to get after the trickster, of whom he spoke a minute ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said a moment ago that we appear to have reached the stage of trying to get the better of one another.  He may believe that of Deputy Sweetman and myself. Does he believe that Deputy Haughey, Deputy Booth and Deputy Moloney are activated by the desire to get the better of their own Minister in public debate?  I do not think they are.  They are all too hardy practitioners to engage on so perilous an occupation in public.  I could imagine that trying to get the better of the Minister, even in the secrecy of the Party room, would be a rather perilous undertaking.  I cannot see Deputy Moloney riding forth like Don Quixote on an expedition of that kind.  Probably Deputy Booth might qualify for that rôle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But Deputy Moloney's more mundane approach to public <Col N="511" /> affairs, I think would suggest that wherever opportunity would offer, he would follow the admirable example of Deputy Faulkner and spend his time thanking the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting away from the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.  I am trying to probe the intentions of Deputy Moloney when he intervened on the discussion on Section 21 and I want to repel the suggestion by the Minister that Deputies are trying to get the better of one another.  I have not the slightest desire to get the best of them in regard to this section.  All I want to do is to get, from some source, the information which I am convinced we ought to have before we enact this section.</P>
      <P>I am quite prepared to accept, on the Minister's authority, that this section is in the interests of the Exchequer.  I am quite prepared to accept, on the Minister's authority, that if we enact this section, the Revenue Commissioners will faithfully give effect to its letter.  All that I am worried about is that I know that no Deputy knows what the consequences of this section will be for the people who will be caught by it.</P>
      <P>The Minister finally finds himself in the position in which he says: &ldquo;If I set off the argument of one Deputy against another, can I not put this section into effect and see what will happen?&rdquo; That is what I think is wrong. I do not think you have the right to submit hundreds of relatively humble people in this State to the consequences of inquisition and taxation, the end result of which none of us knows.  We want at least to be able to say that we know what it is that we are legislating to do and it is not right to say we will pass this section and see what is going to happen.  I want to see what is going to happen before we pass the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot imagine the Minister saying that it is an unreasonable request to make that we should set up a special <i>ad hoc</i> commission to go into this section. We have that commission already <Col N="512" /> in being and it is at present examining this and cognate questions.  It is quite open to us to ask this commission to suspend the normal progress of their work, and for the time being, turn their attention to these proposals and give us an interim report with the minutes of evidence which they receive, in response to any public request they get for evidence.</P>
    <P>Armed with that, we may not come to the right decision in Dáil Éireann, but we would at least come to a decision with the information requisite to make a right decision, if we have the capacity to make it.  That seems to me to be a reasonable request.  Last Thursday, the Minister rebuked me by saying that I was of a very political turn of mind and that I wanted to draw politics into every discussion.  So far, I have not found it very rewarding to deal with questions objectively, or by the indelicate instrument of reason, because the net result of that approach is to be told by the Minister that I am trying to get the best of him, and he offsets my argument by some other argument and reaches the conclusion that the best thing to do is to pass this section.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to argue on the basis of reason and I am prepared to compromise and accept a very small concession to meet my initial demand, but if the Minister wants rational debate here and wants Deputies on all sides to give him the best opinion on matters of this character, it would be very material encouragement if from time to time he would come a reasonable distance to meet them.  I am asking him to abandon no principle, to commit himself to no undertaking, but merely to postpone the implementation of this part of the Bill until such time as it has been examined by the Income-Tax Commission and that appears to be a most reasonable request to press upon him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of keeping records, I must say I cannot see much in that.  I cannot imagine any company paying out money of which they do not keep a note.  They must keep a record of it somewhere or another.  If, say, they pay a director £5 to stand lunch to a <Col N="513" /> couple of his friends surely they have a note that they gave him that sum. If they give him £10 on another occasion, that is noted also.  All that we are asking is that they must let us know how much money they have given to so-and-so each year.  That will not be a very great burden on any company because the big companies do not give out money to a lot of their employees. Clerks and so on do not get any allowances and the number who get money in that way is limited.  There was a reference to the office boy posting letters.  These are small matters, of course, and they will be left out.  They will not arise.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Dillon came in, I said that we were coming into small matters and trying to get the better of each other.  We were losing time trying to find out who was right and who was wrong.  I did not apply that to the bigger points which were raised. Deputy Dillon raised the point that we should not put this into operation, that we should not consider this matter, until we have received the report of the commission and I dealt with that point already.  I said that it was an abuse that is on the increase and that we should not allow it to continue, let alone allow it to increase, pending a report from the commission, because I am afraid it may be some time before we get the report.</P>

If a company decided that director A's business is such that he would require a sum of £300 expenses for the year, that £300 would be returned, but if the company operated only on the basis of reimbursing the director every time he made an actual payment, then it should not be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.  A company has two directors.  Director A is paid £300 expenses.  Director B is not paid any global expenses at all, but every time director B has to incur expenses, he draws the exact sum.  He is paid the £9 18s. 0d. or whatever it is.  I understand the Minister is not interested in the case where the exact sum is drawn.  I suggest that the secretary of the company would <Col N="515" /> certify&mdash;and put in the list in accordance with Section 105 as amended by this Bill&mdash;the £300 expenses to director A and that for this company, except in respect of that £300, no other sum is payable for global expenses except the actual reimbursements of amounts paid.  That will save recording trouble and it will mean that the Minister will be able to get after the faked composite expenses, that he will get after the trickster and not hit the genuine person.</P>

      <P>That should be helpful, but the trouble as I see it is this. There is a minority of unscrupulous people&mdash;I suppose we cannot call them dishonest&mdash;who are without question paying out money to their directors and hired employees under the guise of expenses when such money should not be classed as expenses.

      <P>Suppose he is a director of the company at the same time?  I entirely agree it is fantastic that the Minister can answer all these abstruse questions across the floor of the House without the aid of an accountant.  I admit freely that it would be an abuse of the procedure of the House if I thought up all the trick questions I could under these various sections and shot them at the Minister and said to him: &ldquo;Because you cannot answer them, you do not know what you are doing.&rdquo;  I do sincerely say that with my knowledge of life in rural Ireland, I believe these sections in Part IV are going to produce a series of anomalies that will shock the Minister.  I do not believe the Minister intends this for one moment.</P>
      <P>The Minister's mind is turned on large companies who have boards of directors, secretaries, departments for accounts and all the attendant paraphernalia, whereas my care is orientated on the vast majority of small businesses in rural Ireland upon whom this part of the Act will impact.  I believe there is no satisfactory way of settling that problem, other than by conducting a prior inquiry into what the effect of this Part of the Act would be on the rural community.  I believe we have the means to get it, in so far as that is ever available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this part of the Bill is referred to a commission of inquiry and the bodies representative of the rural business community are not prepared to come in and give the commission the assistance of their evidence, then nobody has any right to complain.  But I could well imagine a commission, if they are doing their job properly, calling on R.G.D.A.T.A., and possibly on two or three firms of experienced accountants who are habitually dealing with the accounts of relatively small businesses in rural Ireland, and asking their <Col N="517" /> opinion.  Quite frankly, without information of that kind I, for one, feel myself incompetent to pass judgment on the ultimate effect of Part IV, except that, quite honestly, I believe it will produce anomalies, confusion and <Col N="518" /> embarrassment to hundreds of people in this country, which no one in this House desires and which I do not believe the Minister himself comprehends.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 22.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 14, line 12, before &ldquo;of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or in any premises adjacent thereto&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess quite candidly in relation to this amendment that I am not quite clear about the effect of Section 22 on Section 23.  As I read Section 22, it means first of all that, if a company provides a house for a manager, such house is automatically taken into account in the assessment of the manager's income.  Then I became doubtful of that because of the first sub-section of Section 23, and it is <Col N="519" /> necessary for me to jump to that sub-section to discuss the relevance of the amendment I suggest.</P>
    <P>If the purpose and the meaning of Section 22 are in relation to premises only, to mean that the premises must be included if they are put out of the company's name into the employee's name, then I have not got the same view at all.  However, as sub-section (2) of Section 22 is framed at present, if you take the ordinary house and shop combined, if there is a separate valuation on the shop as compared with the house, then the mere fact of the separate valuation would mean that there would have to be an assessment made on the director or manager who lived in the house.</P>
    <P>I am not thinking in terms of a house being bought for an employee.  I am thinking of the ordinary small country shop and house combined where the parlour is at the back of the shop and where the family live upstairs. If that business is now incorporated into a private limited liability company, the directors being the husband and wife, if there is a separate valuation for the private part of the house and the shop part of the house, then as the sub-section is drawn there must be an assessment for the private part of the house on the director concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is what the Minister intends and that is why I propose the amendment &ldquo;or in any premises adjacent thereto&rdquo; to cover the point where the business premises is, so to speak, segregated by the rating authority.  I take it that what the Minister intends there is that if a building has in it a shop and ordinary living accommodation over and behind that shop, that ordinary living accommodation does not become assessed, as it is not at the present time, but if you use the words &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; in the strict sense for the ordinary back room parlour, it might be assessed.  As far as I can find there is no definition in this Act of the words &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; themselves.  I may have missed it but I cannot find any such definition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am aware of that definition, but it is not a definition. What is meant &ldquo;by business premises for the purpose of any trade carried on by it?&rdquo; Is there a similar definition to what is, for example, in the Finance Act of 1932 in relation to rents payable out of business premises? I want to be quite clear that where there is a genuine case, as exists up and down the country, where the type of business is such that it is carried on by people living above or behind the premises or utilising a room behind the premises for the purpose of having their meals, that will not be assessable.  I do not think the Minister intends that, but I am apprehensive that it can be so interpreted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know exactly to what part of the section the Deputy is referring, but what is intended here is that if the director or employee has a house transferred to him altogether, the annual value of the house will be treated as remuneration.  If the house is owned by the company and he has the right to live in it, the annual value of the house to him will also be classed as remuneration.  There are, of course, certain exceptions under sub-sections (2) and (3) where occupancy of the house is permitted as part of the remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it that this section means that every owner of a small business throughout the country, where it becomes a company, will be assessed on a rental basis?  Let me say at once I entirely agree with the Minister that if a company buys a house and puts that house into the name of an employee or director, if the company relinquishes all ownership and control of it, that is another way of paying the employee and there should be an assessment in respect of it.  There would not be any difference whatever between the Minister and myself in that respect, but where it is desirable&mdash;I shall not put it as far as necessary&mdash;that the director or employee should live adjacent to the trading premises, and the place where he lives belongs to the company, is it proposed now for the first time to assess the occupier of those premises on a rental basis?  Under the section <Col N="521" /> it seems to me it is so proposed, and I do not think it is at all necessary or suitable for the pattern of our life here up and down the country.</P>
      <P>One has seen in recent years a substantial number of small business concerns, usually in the confectionery business, becoming incorporated.  Abutting on the street, in the front, there is a shop.  Sometimes you cannot get into the private part of the premises except through the shop.  There is not a very big trade carried on.  There are cases I know of in my constituency where there are such companies.  It is not a big trade and the family have to live over the shop, as it would not be worth while operating it on a lock-up basis.  Surely, to decide suddenly that all those people are to be assessed for the first time because they occupy the premises adjacent to the shop&mdash;over the shop or behind the shop&mdash;seems to me to be entirely unnecessary and wrong and quite out of keeping with what we should do, on the theme Deputy Dillon and the Minister agreed on during the Budget debate.</P>
      <P>I am in entire agreement with the Minister that if a company purchases a house, say, 25 miles from Dublin, a country house and land, and keeps that in its own name, and permits a director to live in it, the occupancy of that type of house should be assessed for tax purposes.  That is not the type of case I am interested in at all.  The type of case I am interested in is where the house is near the business premises&mdash;next to it, above it or behind it&mdash;and where the house of the director or employee has to be near that business premises for the purpose of ensuring that the business is properly carried on.  One cannot say &ldquo;solely&rdquo;, because the person happens to be living there as well, but the house is there for the purpose of carrying on the business.  I want to know whether such a case is to be assessed in the future or not.  If it is not to be assessed, do not mind my amendment; if it is to be assessed, we will have to deal with it in a different way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the example given by the Deputy, say, a confectionery company, where he lives in, there possibly would be a case under sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of Section 22; but, of course, I could not say.  I could not say for certain whether there would or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in thinking that the exception for annual income of £1,500 contained in sub-section (2) of Section 24, which must cover the whole part, applies only to an employee?  Supposing a director gets only £1,499, is a director not included regardless or what he may be paid?  An employee is included only if he gets more than £1,500; and I am quite clear about an employee; but a director, as I read it, is included, no matter what he gets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Other interpretations are that I am not correct, but I think this is one of the cases in which the Minister and I agree&mdash;few though they may be.  If we are correct in this, then this will affect every trifling small business in the country where there is a private company concerned.  It does not seem to me that that is right at all. <Col N="523" /> This is entirely new taxation, the Minister will agree, if that is so, because the situation always has been, as far as I understand it up to this, that such occupancy, where it is for the purpose of the trade, not necessarily &ldquo;solely&rdquo; for the purpose of the trade, provided it has got to be so for the purpose of the trade, was not subject to taxation.  Now, if I understand the Minister correctly, it is to be included. We should be clear on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>While we are on that point, I should like the Minister to straighten this out.  It seems to me that if a director is employed by the company, if he is in the employment of the company in any capacity, then Section 24 (3) applies and he must have been in receipt of £1,500 or more before the whole of Part IV applies to him.  I wonder if that interpretation is correct&mdash;if he is a director employed by the company, he must be in receipt of £1,500 or more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  The director is included, for any remuneration.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 24 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In this Part of this Act, &lsquo;employment&rsquo; means an employment such that any emoluments thereof would fall to be assessed under Schedule E, and references to persons employed by, or employees of, a body corporate include any person who takes part in the management of the affairs of the body corporate and is not a director thereof.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, in respect of <Col N="524" /> the salary that he is paid as manager, if that were only there, he must have £1,500; but in respect of his directorship, even if he is paid only £1 a year director's fees, or in fact whether he is paid any or not, even if he is paid no director's fees, I think his being a director automatically brings him within the purview.  The fact that he is a manager as well as a director seems to me to be entirely beside the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>Section 21 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...an employment to which this part of this Act applies, shall, if not otherwise chargeable to income-tax as income of that director or employee, be treated for the purposes of Rule 1 of the Rules applicable to Schedule E as a perquisite of the office or employment...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is perfectly clear that a director is brought in, no matter what he is paid.  If he is paid also as an employee, that is included afterwards.</P>

      <P>If that is so, we have at least reached this measure of agreement on the meaning of this part, that a director is in, no matter what he gets; and, therefore, the proceeds of the business are not the important thing, the size of the business is not the important thing.  We are now arriving at a situation in which, throughout the country, any small type of private business incorporated into a company is to be assessed for a new type of taxation, for the first time.</P>

    <Title>Great Northern Railway Bill, 1958&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. <Col N="525" /> The House is already familiar with the circumstances which have led up to the introduction of this Bill.  Nevertheless in order to put the matter in proper perspective, I feel I should recount in very brief outline the recent history of the G.N.R.</P>
      <P>In 1950, the then G.N.R. Company reported to the Government here and to the Government in Belfast that it would be unable to continue in operation because of its financial losses. Following protracted negotiations with the Six-County Ministry of Commerce, it was agreed in 1953 that the two Governments should acquire the railway and operate it as a joint enterprise. The undertaking of the G.N.R. Company was acquired for £4,500,000 of which we paid half.  Under that 1953 agreement, the concern was to be operated by a joint board and losses and capital expenditure were to be shared equitably in accordance with the agreed scheme.</P>
      <P>From the establishment of the joint board in 1953 up to 30th September last, which is the last date for which audited accounts are available, the total losses of the G.N.R., including interest payable to the two areas on the capital liability and on payments to meet losses and capital expenditure, have been almost £4,000,000, of which our share was £1.4 million.  Additional capital expenditure undertaken during that period was £963,000 incurred up to 30th September last, of which we met £674,000.</P>
      <P>In 1955, the Six-County Minister of Commerce, in view of these heavy losses, proposed the closure of the three cross-Border secondary lines. The G.N.R. Board were opposed to the closure of the lines on the grounds that they should not be closed until they had an opportunity of proving themselves with modern equipment and rolling stock.  The attitude of the G.N.R. Board in that instance was in accord with our thinking here in regard to railway operation as was disclosed in the recent discussions on the Transport Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government here gave formal notice of opposition to the proposed closures and in accordance with the <Col N="526" /> terms of the Great Northern Railway Acts, 1953, the matter was referred to the chairmen of the transport tribunals in the two areas and, following public inquiries, the chairmen submitted divergent reports in September, 1956. Following the receipt of these reports from the chairmen of the two transport tribunals, the Minister of Commerce in Belfast indicated his intention to proceed with the closure of the lines within the Six-County area, notwithstanding our opposition.  He also indicated the likelihood of the Portadown-Derry line, which is almost entirely within the Six-County area, being closed, but later, following discussions which were held in Belfast, he agreed to defer that step for a period of two years at least.  He indicated his intention of giving notice to terminate the 1953 Agreement after the expiration of the period of five years mentioned in the agreement, which period will expire in September next.</P>
    <P>The 1953 Agreement contained provisions under which we could have assumed full financial responsibility for the operaton of the lines in the Six-County area which are now closed. However, even if the Government here were prepared to meet the heavy cost of subsidising rail transport within the Six-County area, the termination of the agreement made that course impossible. The lines could not be continued in operation after the termination of the agreement.  Any programme of capital expenditure directed towards modernisation of the lines would, for the same reason, be impracticable. Moreover, the decontrol of road transport which has been mooted in the Six Counties would further increase the already heavy losses on those lines.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, the Government had no alternative but to accept that the lines would be closed.  The common services on the three lines in question were in fact terminated in September of last year.  The closing of the cross-Border services left no prospect of economic passenger services on the stump lines within the State and these were subsequently terminated. The merchandise services on the stump lines have been continued, however, on an experimental basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> While I have stated previously that we would have preferred to maintain an agreement for the joint operation of the remnants of the G.N.R. system, even with cross-Border services reduced to the Belfast-Dublin line, our wishes cannot prevail against the decision of the other party to the agreement. The termination of the 1953 Agreement makes it impossible, however, to continue the G.N.R. as a single separate undertaking.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for the amalgamation of the G.N.R. undertaking within the State, excluding Dundalk Works, with C.I.E. and for the definitive transfer of Dundalk Works to Dundalk Engineering Works, Ltd.  The Bill is concerned solely with the administrative arrangements required to facilitate that amalgamation and does not relate to the wider issues of transport policy which we discussed on the recent Transport Bill.</P>
    <P>Simultaneous legislation is being promoted in Belfast providing for the amalgamation of the part of the G.N.R. undertaking in the Six Counties with the Ulster Transport Authority.  Train services on the Dublin-Belfast line will continue and will be provided by arrangement between the U.T.A. and C.I.E.</P>
    <P>Lengthy negotiations have taken place between the Ministry of Commerce, Belfast, and my Department regarding the basis on which the assets and liabilities of the G.N.R. Board should be divided between the two areas.  The outcome of these discussions is contained in the draft agreement which is scheduled to the Bill and which will be executed following enactments of the legislation here and the corresponding legislation in Belfast. The agreement aims at broad equity in the division of the undertaking rather than laying down accounting details which can best be settled at operating level between C.I.E. and U.T.A.  The terms of the agreement represent to a considerable extent an unscrambling of the 1953 Agreement and the agreed scheme drawn up under it for the apportionment of losses.</P>
    <P>The approach has been that the <Col N="528" /> assets and liabilities should as far as possible be apportioned according to their location and that items in common use or of common interest should be divided equitably having regard to the needs of C.I.E. or U.T.A. in operating the parts of the undertaking falling to them.  In this way lands, premises and chattels situated or normally used in one area have been allocated to that area.  Railway rolling stock will in general be apportioned equitably, the particular units falling to either area being agreed by C.I.E. and U.T.A.  The road undertaking will fall to us in its entirety.  Stores materials and other assets and liabilities will be apportioned equitably, the particular units falling to either area being agreed by C.I.E. and U.T.A. Staff, including former staff on superannuation, will be divided on the basis of residence.  The pension funds will be divided actuarily on the basis of residence of the members.</P>
    <P>No permanent arrangement has been settled in relation to the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee which is jointly owned by the G.N.R. Board and the British Transport Commission.  The position of that undertaking is extremely complex and it is possible that separate legislation here and in Britain may be necessary in regard to it.  I am satisfied that the basis of division in the scheduled draft agreement is a fair and equitable one.  It is the result of long and hard bargaining conducted, however, in a businesslike but friendly spirit and I can recommend it to the House.</P>
    <P>As regards the Bill itself, its terms in relation to the amalgamation of the G.N.R. undertaking in the State with C.I.E. follow the same lines as the 1950 Act which provided for the amalgamation of C.I.E. and the Grand Canal Company.  Unlike C.I.E., there has been no comprehensive modernisation of the G.N.R. undertaking and much of the G.N.R. rail rolling stock and equipment is antiquated.  In the circumstances it is proposed that the amalgamation should be carried out without any increase in the capital liability of C.I.E.  This is tantamount to writing off the capital liability of the G.N.R. Board of £2,250,000 representing <Col N="529" /> our half share of the acquisition price of the undertaking in 1953 together with our share of the moneys advanced since 1953 to finance capital expenditure which by September next should amount to about £770,000.  In addition our share of the accumulated losses of the G.N.R. Board since 1953, which by September next should amount to about £1,867,000, is likewise written off.</P>
    <P>All staff resident in the State and employed by the G.N.R. Board immediately before the transfer date will become C.I.E. staff.  The compensation provisions of the Transport Bill, 1958, when enacted, will apply to transferred G.N.R. staff in the same way as they apply to C.I.E. staff.  In addition provision is made in the G.N.R. Bill for the compensation on the same terms of employees suffering loss of employment or worsening of conditions as a consequence of the amalgamation of the two undertakings.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for the preservation of the existing pension rights of G.N.R. staff transferring to C.I.E. In the case of wages staff, a due share of the pension funds will be transferred to C.I.E.  The position of salaried staff who are members of the British Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund gives rise to some difficulty.  C.I.E. cannot become a subscriber to this fund in respect of the transferred staff without special British legislation which would take probably a couple of years to secure. Similarly the transfer of the appropriate funds from that fund to a C.I.E. fund, as was done in 1947 in respect of C.I.E. staff, also required British legislation.  The Railway Clearing System Superannuation Corporation, who control the fund, have indicated their willingness to co-operate in solving that difficulty.  The position is being carefully looked into and pending a satisfactory solution, provision is made in the Bill preserving the <i>status quo</i> whereby G.N.R. staff who are members of the fund will be transferred to C.I.E. on secondment only. The G.N.R. undertaking will be kept nominally in existence for the time being to facilitate that arrangement.</P>
    <P>The House is already aware of the efforts being made to maintain the <Col N="530" /> level of employment at Dundalk Works.  We were fortunate to be able to save valuable time by anticipating the termination of the 1953 Agreement. With the consent of the Six County authorities, the works were leased to Dundalk Engineering Works Limited last January.  Provision is now being made for the definitive transfer of the works to the company.  The salaried staff at the works are at present seconded by the G.N.R. Board to Dundalk Engineering Works Limited.</P>
    <P>The majority of the salaried staff at Dundalk have general railway gradings and common seniority rights with corresponding grades elsewhere in the G.N.R. undertaking.  They will retain their G.N.R. employment and transfer to C.I.E. on the amalgamation.  If they are not required by C.I.E., and their services are dispensed with, they will be entitled to compensation, but, of course, their compensation will be abated for as long as they are employed by Dundalk Engineering Works Limited, or any other State sponsored body or local authority, in the same way as any other C.I.E. staff who become redundant.</P>
    <P>The wage grade staff at Dundalk works have already been transferred to the new company.  These staffs were recruited for, and employed solely at, the works and their future lies with the new industrial developments planned at Dundalk.  I think the House is aware of the energetic efforts which are being made by the Board of Dundalk Engineering Works, Limited, to provide continued employment in that way for all the wage grade staff transferred to the company.  While their present plans appear to provide for employment for an equivalent number of workers at Dundalk, it cannot be ruled out, however, that there may be a residue of men who are not found to be adaptable to the new skills or who, for one reason or another, cannot be fitted into the new organisation, and I have been considering that problem.  Should this problem emerge, and of course, it may not emerge, then it would be my intention to put the Dundalk Engineering Works in a position to do something by way of lump sum payments, on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis, for workers who <Col N="531" /> have been employed at the works for some minimum period and for whom non-adaptability, or other problem, raised difficulty in regard to the obtaining of employment at Dundalk.</P>
    <P>Any such payments would be of a non-statutory, <i>ex gratia</i> nature related to length of service at Dundalk Works and would cover only workers whose services cannot be utilised.  These payments would, as I said, be intended only for workers for whom employment could not be provided when the arrangements contemplated for Dundalk had been completed.  Any worker to whom employment was offered would not be included.  Problems of that character, if they arise at all, would arise quickly so that it would be clearly necessary to arrange that the lump sum payments&mdash;which would be more in the nature of severance pay &mdash;would be in operation for only a year or two.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister repeat that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said they would be in the nature of severance payments. The Bill provides for the preservation of the pension rights of former G.N.R. wage grade employees employed in the new company and an appropriate share of G.N.R. pension funds will be transferred to the new company.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of paying a tribute to the joint board which operated the G.N.R. since 1953.  Their task was not, as we foresaw in 1953, an easy one, particularly as the period was, perhaps, one of the most critical in the history of railways in this country.  We all regret the disappearance of the G.N.R. as a separate undertaking after serving the public for almost a century.  It is with very considerable reluctance that I bring this measure before the House, but, as I have pointed out already, we have no option in the matter.  I trust that the House will recognise the Bill as a genuine effort to meet in a fair and reasonable way the many interests affected by a very difficult but inevitable situation, and it is as such I recommend it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is merely a <Col N="532" /> recognition of the facts and, while we may regret that it involves the termination of the G.N.R. as a separate undertaking, it appears that there was no option available by which any other decision could be taken.  As the Bill makes provision for the division of the G.N.R., the amalgamation of the portion of it within the territory of the State with C.I.E. and the transfer of the staff and workshops at Dundalk to the Dundalk Engineering Company, there may arise certain matters of detail which can be considered on Committee Stage concerning staff employment, whether in the railway undertaking which is being acquired by C.I.E., or of the workers who are being taken over at Dundalk, or those in either case who, as a result of the decision to wind up the G.N.R., may, in consequence, lose their employment. It is unfortunate that the joint effort was not successful.  At any rate, it has been possible, through co-operation, to provide in some measure for the staff and workers employed in the undertaking and, in so far as that has been possible, the joint efforts of the representatives of the Department of Industry and Commerce and of the Ministry of Commerce in Belfast, as well as the joint board established under the 1953 Act, deserve the thanks of those concerned.</P>
      <P>It has always been my view that there are common problems on both sides of the Border and it in the interest of the people on both sides of the Border that joint efforts should be made to solve them.  The fact that it was not successful in this case is no reason why efforts should not be made, where the interests of people on both sides can best be served, to secure by co-operation the welfare of the people where a joint effort can provide a remedy for these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On two other occasions, in connection with the Foyle Fisheries and the Erne Hydro-Electric scheme, co-operation between representatives of, in one case, the E.S.B. and the Northern Electricity Board, and in the other case, the representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in the Six Counties and the Fisheries <Col N="533" /> Section of the Department of Agriculture here, resulted in worthwhile agreements that have operated to the material benefit of people whose livelihood has been improved and, in many cases, advanced as a result of the efforts made, and as a result of the joint operation of the two concerns which benefit people living on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>I have always held the view that, wherever possible, agreement between representatives of both parts of the country is essential if some of the problems common to both areas are to be surmounted.  The good of the people on whatever side of the Border they live should be the paramount consideration and although in this case the joint operation of the G.N.R., because of circumstances, has not been a financial success, it has indicated the possibility as well as the practicability of people of goodwill on both sides of the Border working together if for nothing else but to salvage what was possible out of the undertaking that operated, as the Minister said, for a century.  It is in that spirit that I believe it should be possible in the future wherever and, I hope, whenever opportunity offers for representatives from Government Departments or State undertakings, as the case may be, in this part of the country, to cooperate with Departments or statutory undertakings in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>As I said, there may be details concerning this measure which will require further examination on the Committee Stage but, so far as we are concerned, this Bill merely recognises the facts and there appears to be no option available under which any other decision could be taken.  I only hope that the experience of joint effort which has been gained in the last number of years, first of all as far back as 1950, and on a more regular basis since the enactment of the 1953 Act, will be used to the best advantage in the future.  This particular case, although not successful, is, nevertheless, one of three definite examples of the value of joint efforts by representatives of the Government here and the authorities in the Six Counties. These examples have shown that it is possible to achieve considerable progress <Col N="534" /> by co-operation and by goodwill which, in the long run, should help to solve many of the problems, if not the major problem separating the Six Counties from the rest of the country. We are more likely to see a solution of that problem along these lines than through some of the efforts made from time to time, which probably attract temporarily more notoriety but which fail to lay the firm basis for mutual understanding and mutual appreciation of the many common difficulties which affect people in both parts of the country and which must be solved if we are to make the progress we all desire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill represents the crystallisation of symptoms which have been obvious for a few years.  It was clear to me when I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce that, although the Board of the G.N.R. were most anxious that the cross-Border lines should not be closed until they had experience of the use of diesel railcars on these cross-Border lines, nevertheless, the Northern Government, for reasons of their own, overrode its representatives on the G.N.R. and insisted that they would close the cross-Border lines.  They indicated quite clearly that, no matter what the Railway Tribunal said in that respect, they would proceed with their intention to close the cross-Border lines. The result has been, therefore, that although we on this side of the Border were anxious that the cross-Border lines should be given a chance until it would be seen if they could be made economic by the utilisation of diesel railcars and diesel traction, the Northern Government had apparently irrevocably committed themselves to closing the cross-Border lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only did they decide to close the cross-Border lines, and have implemented that decision, but they have also indicated that they will close one of the two lines to Derry.  The line they have in mind to close is the line from Portadown to Derry, which serves a substantial portion of the population in Tyrone and Fermanagh. That line has been temporarily reprieved but, judging by the statements of the Northern Government and the <Col N="535" /> Northern Minister for Commerce, it is only a matter of time until that line will be closed and it is likely that the other line to Derry, within its own borders, may be closed by the Northern Government.</P>
    <P>In fact, the Northern Government have made it clear&mdash;and it is against this background that this Bill can be seen more clearly&mdash;that they thought the Six Counties was too small an area for the operation of any railways whatever.  They might have applied the same kind of thinking and have come to the conclusion that it was also too small an area for the operation of a separate Government, but that is outside the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The result is that in this portion of Ireland we have to accept, willy nilly, the fact that the Northern Government, who are road-minded and not rail-minded, have decided, not only to close the cross-Border lines, an intention to which they have already given effect, but propose to close also another cross-Border service, that is, the Portadown to Derry line which is cross-Border as to six miles in the County Donegal.  It is quite likely that the Northern Government policy will not end with that and that before we are many years older we may be confronted with the situation that the Northern Government will not want to operate a railway service even from Belfast to the Border and may try to substitute a road service for that service.  Whatever we in this House may say, the fact remains that we cannot continue these cross-Border services unless we are prepared to pay the losses on their operation.</P>
    <P>It may well have been that, given a fair trial, it would have been possible to have continued these cross-Border services by means of diesel railcars.  As I said, the technical people associated with the G.N.R. and all the directors of the G.N.R., including the Six County representatives, took the view that these cross-Border lines should not be closed until there had been an opportunity of showing whether or not the lines could be made economic by the use of diesel railcars.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that a Bill of this kind comes before the <Col N="536" /> House.  Whatever lingering hope there might have been of maintaining the G.N.R. for the purpose of operating the main line between Belfast and Dublin has been shattered by the decision of the Northern Government to terminate the agreement under which that line was jointly operated. Therefore the position of the House to-day is that the only sensible course which it can take is to agree to the merging of the portion of the G.N.R. within our territory with our existing national transport undertaking, C.I.E. The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to that decision.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Bill, and in the explanatory memorandum, that substantial liabilities amounting to £2,250,000, capital expenditure to the extent of £770,000, and revenue losses amounting to £1.8 million approximately, are to be written off.  I suppose in all the circumstances that is understandable because it is quite clear that C.I.E. are not in a position to take these liabilities on its rather delicate financial shoulders and in the Bill which has just passed through this House, we have found it necessary to provide relief for C.I.E. from some of its burdens.  Therefore, the Minister has taken the only reasonable course open to him, that is, to undertake the responsibility for these liabilities which at present devolve upon the G.N.R. Board and which could not, in the circumstances, be transferred to the Board of C.I.E., with any prospect of realisation of the liability.</P>
    <P>I note, however, that in the Bill and in the explanatory memorandum, it was stated to be the intention of the Government to provide a sum of £175,000 per annum for C.I.E. for the purpose of meeting the losses which it is believed will arise through C.I.E. operation of the portion of the G.N.R. within our territory.  I should like to know how that sum of £175,000 was arrived at.  Is that the estimate of C.I.E. of what the loss will be, or is that what the Department estimate the loss will be, having pruned down the C.I.E. estimate?  From recollection, I think the loss on C.I.E. last year was about £400,000 and how £175,000 is to meet the loss is something I should like explained?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> Does the Minister now think that C.I.E. can balance evenly, taking one year with another over the next five years, on a subsidy of £175,000 to meet C.I.E. requirements from the standpoint of operating the portion of the G.N.R. which is within our territory? I should be glad if the Minister would give us some information on that point.  As I said, the Minister is taking the only realistic course open to him, that is, to merge the portion of the G.N.R. within the State with C.I.E.</P>
    <P>That, however, does not mean that all the problems of joint operation of two now fragmented portions of the railway line can be dealt with in isolation, or one administration deal with the problem without reference to the other.  The fragmentation of the line is going to throw up a considerable number of problems for solution in the future and it is there that considerable consultation and co-operation will be necessary, if these problems are to be solved, and solved especially in a manner which will not worsen still further, the transport services on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>The position of the Dundalk workshops has been referred to but I thought the Minister would have given us a wider survey of the new Dundalk Engineering Company which is taking over the workshops at Dundalk.  With the contraction of the G.N.R. and its disappearance as a separate concern, it is quite clear to everybody that the future of the workshops at Dundalk is both grim and unpromising.  There are approximately 1,000 workers employed at the workshops and many of them have long years of service.  The great majority of them are skilled craftsmen who have enjoyed security of employment and have been paid trade union wages. Quite frankly, I am concerned about the future of those workers on their transfer to the Dundalk Engineering Company.</P>
    <P>The plant at the Dundalk workshops is a plant which is in urgent need of modernisation and that goes not merely for the machinery but for the management as well.  I do not know what the future of those workers who <Col N="538" /> will be transferred to the Dundalk Engineering Works will be.  I have a suspicion, which I hope is without justification, that there will be many human tragedies associated with the closing down of the G.N.R. works and its attempted operation under the title of the Dundalk Engineering Works.</P>
    <P>So far as I can judge, the prospects of stable employment, as regular and remunerative as was provided by the old G.N.R. works in Dundalk, do not appear to me to be as bright as they previously were.  I should like to know from the Minister what, in his view, or in the view of the directors of the Dundalk Engineering Works, are the prospects for that company. Recently I saw in the newspapers an announcement that this company was to get the sole manufacturing rights of a particular type of three-wheeler miniature motor car.  It is all right to give people the right to manufacture a thing; it is another problem to sell what they manufacture.  In an era in which there is an insatiable craze for the big and fast car, it seems to me that people are going to have a job to sell a small three-wheeler car.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the Minister has any information regarding the prospects of the Dundalk Engineering Works.  If he has, we should be told, and even if the news is not as bright as the Minister would wish, there is nothing to be gained by burying our heads in the sand and imagining the mere transfer of these workshops from the control of the G.N.R. to the Dundalk Engineering Works, will not be accompanied by pretty severe burdens, so far as a number of the workers are concerned.</P>
    <P>The ability of the Dundalk Engineering Works to continue to offer employment to the workers transferred from the workshops depends on its ability to get work in the open market and to operate the plant in a way that it will be economically rewarded, but there is now to be virtually no railway work for the G.N.R. workshops in Dundalk.  I imagine the Northern Government will keep its railway work for its Belfast workshops and that C.I.E. with the modern plant at Inchicore, will want to do the servicing for <Col N="539" /> its portion of the G.N.R., at its Inchicore workshops.  If the situation develops in that way, then I foresee that the only possibility of the Dundalk Engineering Company surviving will depend upon its ability to get into the open market, and to get their contracts at a price which will enable them to maintain employment and to compete with others who will be looking for the same type of contract.</P>
    <P>At all events, I should like the Minister to tell us what is his present assessment of the future of the Dundalk Engineering Works.  If those works are to succeed&mdash;and I earnestly hope they will, especially for the sake of those who have been employed for so long in the G.N.R. works in Dundalk&mdash;then it is vital that there should be close co-operation between the management of the new engineering works and the trade unions catering for the works at Dundalk.  I hope the Minister will use his position to impress on the directors of the Dundalk Engineering Works the imperative necessity of developing a climate between themselves and the trade unions which will be conducive to a mutual understanding of each other's difficulties and a firm resolve on the part of both to do all that is necessary to give the new works&mdash;or rather the old works under a new title&mdash;an opportunity of succeeding.</P>
    <P>In a matter of this kind where a change of employment and environment is involved, where new work will have to be undertaken, perhaps substantially different from the work undertaken in the past, one has to handle the human elements concerned with tact and sagacity.  It is there that the emergence of a co-operative climate would probably do more than any other single factor to bring about an atmosphere in the Dundalk Engineering Works which would help to mitigate many of the incipient difficulties of the new workshops.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister, when appointing the directors of the Dundalk Engineering Company, did not select any person who had some trade union background and who at the directors' table might be expected to <Col N="540" /> know the point of view of the workers employed in the firm.  Both this Government and the previous Government have given evidence in varying degree of a desire to associate trade union representation with State-sponsored enterprises, and as the Dundalk Engineering Works comes into that category, I should have thought that the Minister would have found it possible to associate with the directorate of the new company some person or persons with trade union experience and background which, I am sure the Minister will agree, can, if wisely applied, be of immense benefit when decisions are being taken at meetings of directors.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I want to mention at this stage, although it can be dealt with in more detail on Committee Stage.  This Bill provides for compensation to employees of the G.N.R. transferred or seconded to C.I.E. who, to within five years after the passing of the Act, have their services dispensed with or whose position is worsened because of the merger of the two undertakings.  It seems to me that the existing staff of C.I.E. could be equally affected by this merger, that is, that the merger could bring about a worsening of the conditions of C.I.E. staffs.  Therefore, there does not seem to me to be any good reason why compensation should not be payable in such circumstances to C.I.E. staff as it will be provided under the Bill for G.N.R. staffs who may be detrimentally affected by the merger.</P>
    <P>I think that the parallel legislation in Northern Ireland, which merges the G.N.R. with the U.T.A., provides compensation for the loss of employment and worsening of conditions of the U.T.A. staff as well as the G.N.R. staff.  If that has been done in the Six Counties, it seems to me to furnish a very cogent precedent for extending to the C.I.E. staffs here the right to compensation, if their conditions are detrimentally affected.  It is quite conceivable that a merger of the G.N.R. staff within the State with the C.I.E. staff within the State could bring about a worsening of the conditions of the C.I.E. staff.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will examine that matter between now and the Committee Stage <Col N="541" /> and that he will refer in particular to the provisions of the comparable legislation which is being introduced in the Six Countries.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I think this Bill was inevitable because of the policy of the Northern Government, and while the Dáil may tidy up some of the details, it has no option but to pass the Bill as the best way out of an extremely difficult and complex position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with a few aspects of the Bill.  First of all, I should like to say that the present Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>He is going to get more congratulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;proved himself an able diplomat when he tried to bring about a common understanding between North and South in dealing with the G.N.R. problem.  I was hopeful that the goodwill which had been established at the meeting between his opposite number in the North and himself some years ago would continue. This is a very intricate Bill dealing with the livelihood of a large number of workers.  Although the representatives on both sides of the Border have tried to hammer out an agreement whereby there will be no hardship, I am afraid that hardship will arise for these workers, who have trusted the G.N.R. Board, created homes for themselves in the expectancy of constant employment and who have spent many years working for that board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill was inevitable. The Minister has made adequate arrangements in the Bill for compensation for displaced workers and for superannuation.  Of course, each area will have to look after its own. Obviously numbers of people will become redundant.  I am worried about the fate of these people.  I understand consultations will continue between C.I.E. and U.T.A.  I hope that any misunderstandings which have occurred will be resolved. Goodwill is essential on both sides.  It passes my comprehension why there cannot be that co-operation so essential to safeguard the people concerned.  The <Col N="542" /> Minister has done everything he could to ensure co-operation, goodwill and understanding.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Norton has already pointed out, we may find ourselves up against the problem of certain people becoming too road-minded.  I sincerely hope that in that regard common sense will prevail and that the U.T.A. will co-operate with C.I.E. in an effort to eliminate any hardships that might arise as a result of any decision taken by them.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of complimenting the board and management of the G.N.R.  I have had long experience of dealing with them and all my associations with them were very pleasant.  They were most co-operative.  I wish the Minister luck in his efforts to solve this problem.  I trust he will bring it to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his speech covered the ground from 1950 onwards and gave the history of the G.N.R. to date.  We are all agreed that he has no option to introducing this Bill to bring about amalgamation with C.I.E.</P>
      <P>There are a number of points upon which I should like to get some clarification.  If the clarification is satisfactory there will be no need for me to bring in certain amendments subsequently, amendments which I was contemplating.  I should like, first of all, to refer to Part II of the Bill which relates to the transfer of the assets of the G.N.R.  With regard to sub-section (2) of Section 7 does the Minister intend to include in that section &ldquo;premises&rdquo;&mdash;that is, premises meaning private houses?  It says here that the transfer effected by these sections shall extend to all land vested in the Minister.  It does not say it will extend to land and houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further on, there is a reference to the vesting of land in the Dundalk works.  It refers only to the vesting of land and chattels.  It does not refer to premises.  I am concerned that that word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; should be omitted from these sub-sections.  Does the Minister intend to vest in C.I.E. and in the Dundalk Engineering Works houses at present occupied by the <Col N="543" /> respective employees of those two concerns?</P>
    <P>Some time ago I had occasion to ask the Minister a question in relation to this matter.  His reply was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the case of such houses occupied by employees of Dundalk Engineering Works, it is my intention that they should be transferred to that company and that the remaining houses should become the property of C.I.E.  It is for the boards of these concerns to determine the future occupancy of the houses, but I have no reason to believe that they will wish to disturb tenants who will continue in their employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am quoting from column 10, Volume 167, of the Official Report.  I should imagine that that contingency should be covered in the section or, if not in that section, then in some other section to ensure that the legal transfer of these houses will be effected to the respective concerns and that the interest of the tenants of those houses will not be in jeopardy when amalgamation takes place.</P>
    <P>There is another section which refers to actions pending or proceedings taken in relation to claims against the G.N.R. Board.  I refer to Section 9. Recently in Dundalk there were a number of such actions and the judge decided that certain workers who took action against the G.N.R.  Board suffered, as he called it, a continuing incapacity and would be entitled to some compensation by the board if they were subsequently dismissed by the Dundalk Engineering Works, with whom they are employed at present. In the judge's opinion, the fact that they are not employed at the moment with the G.N.R. did not debar them from coming against C.I.E., as it will be henceforward, in settlement of their claims.  I assume such cases will be covered by sub-section (7) of Section 9.</P>
    <P>A number of men working in the Dundalk Engineering Works at the moment received injuries while they were employed by the G.N.R.  Subsequently they went back to work and, as Deputy Norton said, they are now <Col N="544" /> employed with a more risky employer and the danger is that, if they are dismissed, they will find it very difficult to get alternative employment.  For one reason or another, they may suffer some incapacity which will prevent their getting alternative employment and they will be handicapped in that regard.  The recent court cases in Dundalk made some effort to cover such contingencies.</P>
    <P>With regard to superannuation, I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister the fact that it was the custom of the G.N.R. to supplement the existing pension of 10/- with a further <i>ex gratia</i> payment of 10/-. When the Dundalk Engineering Works took over the Dundalk works last January that practice stopped and the men who retired subsequent to January are not receiving that <i>ex gratia</i> payment of 10/-.  Could it be claimed under Section 16 (6) that this 10/- <i>ex gratia</i> payment should be restored to these men and to future cases of retiral on pension?  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The obligations, whether obtaining legally or by customary practice, of the outgoing board in respect of any existing superannuation scheme and in respect of every member of the said existing superannuation scheme shall be binding on the company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;company&rdquo; of course relates to the Dundalk Engineering Works.  If the Minister could clarify that point to my satisfaction, it would remove the necessity to put down some amendment to cover it.  There are not many men involved, but the principle is there.  The extra pension of 10/- a week should be restored.  It was given out of the goodness of heart of the G.N.R. Board and I think the Dundalk Engineering Works should continue it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the transfer of staff in general to C.I.E., there is provision under Part III of the Act.  The operatives in the conciliation grade will be offered employment by C.I.E., but the fear is in the mind of many of the workers that the offer which C.I.E. will make will not be satisfactory or suitable for one reason or another.  Many of these men are living in houses for <Col N="545" /> which they are paying instalments on loans which were obtained to buy or build those houses.  If C.I.E. offers any employee a position somewhere down the country, perhaps, he may not be able to avail of that offer.  I can see how it will affect in a substantial way the elderly men working in the conciliation grade or in the salaried grade, if they are offered a job which they cannot accept.  I am wondering&mdash;I do not see any reference to it in the Bill&mdash; whether provision could be made whereby in such a case compensation might be paid instead of the offer of employment where it was not suitable or acceptable for various reasons to an employee.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the salaried staffs in Dundalk.  Most of these men are members of the Railway Clearing House Fund.  It is a British institution and deals only with transport concerns. The intention of the Bill is that these salaried men will be transferred on secondment to C.I.E. until such time as the legislation is enacted in England to cover the pension rights of these people.  I should imagine that there would need to be joint legislation in England and here and possibly legislation in Northern Ireland.  That will take some time&mdash;the Minister said it might take two years&mdash;so we can deduce that the G.N.R. Board, as such, cannot be dissolved until such time as that problem is resolved.</P>
    <P>In relation to that problem, I should like to ask the Minister if he can say how many of these salaried staffs will be transferred to the Dundalk Engineering Works.  I am informed that the number might be as high as 30, but, as I said, the railway clearing system relates only to transport concerns, and the Dundalk Engineering Works not being such, these men will lose their pension rights, if they are subsequently dismissed by the Dundalk Engineering Works, and all they will get back, if they are dismissed, will be the contributions they paid to that fund.  Such a contingency is not covered in this Bill.  I think it should be and that some arrangement should be arrived at which would ease the minds of these people in that regard.</P>
    <P>The kernel of the Bill, as far as I <Col N="546" /> and the workers in Dundalk are concerned, is the question of compensation. The Minister mentioned with regard to the Dundalk Engineering Works men that he intended to instruct the Dundalk Engineering Works Board to pay an <i>ex gratia</i> lump sum in compensation to men who, subsequent to next October, might be dismissed by the Dundalk Engineering Works, that is, following an offer of employment by the Dundalk Engineering Works to these men which was not suitable to them or for which they were not adaptable. I do not know whether compensation will be extended or whether this Bill, either intentionally or inadvertently, does not cover men in the Dundalk Engineering Works who will be dismissed after next September just as G.N.R. employees will be entitled to compensation subsequent to amalgamation.</P>
    <P>Section 17 (2) provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This section applies only to an officer or servant who at the date of his dismissal or transfer was employed in a permanent capacity or who was, except for casual interruptions of employment, employed, whether by the outgoing board or by the board, during the whole of the preceding three years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These men in the Dundalk Engineering Works were employed by the outgoing board prior to last January and I fail to see how they are not entitled to compensation.  I am assuming the Minister contends they are not entitled to compensation in the same way as G.N.R. employees are because these men were dismissed prior to the amalgamation of the G.N.R. with C.I.E.  These men were employed at the date of their dismissal prior to last January and I suggest they are entitled to compensation.  When I mentioned that issue some time ago in this House, the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Hilliard, in reply to a question of mine in regard to the compensation for employees of Dundalk works, said, amongst other things:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards the Dundalk works which have already been taken over by the Dundalk Engineering Works, Limited, the position has already <Col N="547" /> been explained and will not be further affected by the amalgamation.</P>
    <P>Mr. Coburn: Does the Parliamentary Secretary mean by that that men who will be dismissed in September, when the amalgamation takes place, will not be entitled to compensation?</P>
    <P>Mr. Hilliard: In answer to the supplementary question, I wish to say that employees who are taken over by C.I.E. will qualify for the present rates of pensions, and so on applicable to C.I.E. employees.  Any other employees from the works who may become redundant must have a special arrangement whereby compensation can be paid to them.</P>
    <P>Mr. Coburn: The door has not been closed so?</P>
    <P>Mr. Hilliard: No.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister himself referred to this question during a debate on the State Guarantees Act in the autumn of last year.  I am quoting from the Debates of the 20th November, 1957. He was referring to the question of compensation, which I had raised during the course of that debate.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the case of the G.N.R. Company a worker is entitled to compensation only if he was directly employed upon the operation of the service that was closed.  That will involve some problems which we will have to resolve but it clearly indicates that the workers employed in the shops have not got the right to compensation and, indeed, one would perhaps doubt the value of compensation rights if they existed against the G.N.R.  Board when the board goes into liquidation.</P>
    <P>There are, however, problems and anxieties in that regard and while I should like to avoid undertaking statutory obligations, I think that it will be the general aim of all concerned to get rid of those problems and anxieties in a way which will leave no permanent discontent behind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is this quotation that prompts me to press this issue as I am doing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> I have one final quotation to make. It is from the Official Debates for the 5th December, 1957, column 1548, when Deputy Norton was speaking about the question of compensation and the position of the men in Dundalk.  He asked the Minister what the position would be in Dundalk if the company subsequently found that it had no work for one man or, as he said, for 100 men.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only thing that will happen the workman in that case is that he will lose his employment and get back his contributions?  Is that correct? Is that the position?</P>
    <P>Mr. S. Lemass: I do not want to give a yes or no answer to that. There is a number of provisions which are being examined.  The worker employed in the Dundalk works will be in the same position in every respect as he was when he was employed by the G.N.R. or would be if he were continued to be employed by the G.N.R.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Dundalk Engineering Works had not been set up last January, the men working now in the Dundalk Engineering Works would be still working&mdash;at least, most of them.  The reason I say that is that there would still be the railway maintenance work to be done in the works.  It has been done since last January by the Dundalk Engineering Works, on contract to the G.N.R. Board.  If the Dundalk Engineering Works had not been set up, that work, which was absolutely necessary to carry on the G.N.R. system, would have to be done and the men would still have to be employed to do that work.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if the Dundalk Engineering Works had not been set up in January last, we should find the position now obtaining whereby the men working in the works would be G.N.R. men at the present time and as such would be entitled to compensation or to transfer to C.I.E.  The Minister shakes his head.  I know I shall have a hard job to convince him.  I feel that we are discussing two State services, the G.N.R. Board and the C.I.E. Board.  The Dundalk Engineering Works, of course, is not a State service, although it is a State-sponsored body. We agree there.  The employees of <Col N="549" /> C.I.E. are having their years of service recognised, so much so that if a C.I.E. man is dismissed and subsequently finds employment, his compensation is not removed altogether.  If he finds employment with some other State-sponsored body, according to the Schedule to the 1958 Bill, all that will happen in that case will be that if he gets more with his new appointment than he got when he was in the service of C.I.E., his compensation will be reduced.  I think the principle is the same.</P>
    <P>There are men down in the Dundalk works who gave service for the past 40 or 50 years.  One main reason we are compensating C.I.E. employees, if they lose employment, is in recognition of their service; and we are doing so also to relieve any possible hardship which may result necessarily from such dismissal.  I do not see why we should not apply the same treatment to the G.N.R. workers, even though they are official Dundalk Engineering Works men.  They consider themselves G.N.R. men; they are still &ldquo;railway men,&rdquo; in actual fact.</P>
    <P>The Dundalk Engineering Works men are my main concern, because the official employees of the G.N.R. Board at the present time are provided for in this Bill.  There is very little provision made for the Dundalk Engineering Works men, with the exception of the transfer of their existing pension rights to the Dundalk Engineering Works Company.  I sincerely hope that there will be no need for any compensation to be paid and that the Dundalk Engineering Works Company will flourish and provide employment for its staff.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, we must remember that the Minister paid compensation to the employees of the Sligo and Leitrim line, which was affected recently.  He may say that only a small number of people was involved, about 90 of them, but the principle is the same&mdash;that these people were living in the State, that they found that their livelihood was taken away from them and they were compensated.</P>
    <P>I also stressed one point here before, when I said that the unions who had consulted the Minister about all these things before, had received legal <Col N="550" /> opinion that they were entitled to compensation.  The Minister pooh-poohed that idea and said that he could not understand how they could receive such legal opinion, that his mind was clear.  They still maintain that they are entitled to compensation and I should like to hear the Minister's views, when he is replying to this debate, as they might ease my mind in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister says this evening that the future of the Dundalk Engineering Works men employed there lies with the development of the new company. I suggest that he should think of their past service and not so much of their future.  That service was rendered all down the years.  In the case of C.I.E., in the case of the conciliation grade in G.N.R. and in the case of the salaried staff in G.N.R., that service is being recognised by the Minister&mdash;but not, it seems, in relation to the Dundalk Engineering Works men.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the <i>ex gratia</i> payment of a lump sum which he contemplated making to these men. I should like to know why that provision is not in the Bill.  I think it should be in the Bill, to safeguard it. Of course, eventually I hope there will be some provision for compensation in the Bill to cover that point.</P>
    <P>We know that when the 1953 agreement is terminated next September it will result in a substantial reduction in the volume of railway work available at Dundalk works.  Some time ago the Minister said in the House it would be the Government's policy to attract work to Dundalk and that they would not encourage or permit the transfer of work that could be done in Dundalk to Dublin.  I should like to know have there been, or will there be, any arrangements made with C.I.E. in regard to this problem, because the employees in the workshops realise it will be a great boon to them if as much railway work as possible is left in Dundalk?</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister referred to a contract system which he said might be employed by C.I.E. in regard to the work being done in the Dundalk Engineering Works.  Probably that is how it will be done, but I would ask <Col N="551" /> the Minister to exhort the C.I.E. Board to take a sympathetic view of this matter because it is of great importance. These men are specialists in this kind of work and the employment given in the maintenance of railway rolling stock is very substantial. The fact that it will be reduced after next September and also that this is a new company trying to obtain foreign orders would suggest to us that as much rail work as possible should be left in Dundalk.  I would ask the Minister to examine again the possibilities of reopening at least the Dundalk-Bundoran line.  I suggested one or two weeks ago that, especially in view of the position of Lough Derg, that particular line could be made economic and the Minister said the termination of the 1953 agreement precluded the Government from adopting the course which I am now suggesting; they could not reopen any of these lines or keep them open.  But I think that is presupposing the Northern Government will object to our running this section of line and I do not see any reason why they should object.  I see no reason why we should not approach them and try to arrange a new agreement in regard to that particular line.  I hope the Minister will keep that in mind as I think it is important.</P>
    <P>I should like to know the Minister's opinion of the future prospects of the Dundalk Engineering Works as regards obtaining work so that as many men as possible will be kept in employment. I should like to know what financial assistance he contemplates giving to this company because obviously it will require further aid if it is to have a chance of surviving.  In the competitive age in which we live, Dundalk Engineering Works will find it very difficult to obtain work in sufficient quantity and volume to maintain the present staff.  How did the Minister arrive at the agreement with the Northern Ireland Government?  I do not want to go into details, but is he liable to pay any compensation to the Northern Government for the use of the Dundalk workshops as the Dundalk Engineering Works?</P>
    <P>The Minister may laugh when I refer <Col N="552" /> to this but I have been asked to mention it.  I do so, stressing that it is the least important of the points which I am making.  Up to the present the employees of the Dundalk Engineering Works enjoy the use of privilege tickets.  While employed by the G.N.R. they had these privileges and now while employed by the Dundalk Engineering Works they still have them and I suggest these privileges be allowed to continue at least in regard to this part of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is the inevitable outcome of the decision to terminate the 1953 agreement.  It was evident in the discussion this afternoon that the decision was not based on economics but was purely a political decision by the Government of the Six Counties.  It is a pity such a decision was made unilaterally by the Six-County Government.  Deputy Norton pointed out that during his period of office, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Board of the G.N.R. agreed that, at least for a trial period, dieselisation should be tried as a possible solution to the economic difficulties of the system.  The C.I.E. Board concurred in that.  It was a pity an opportunity was not given to try the economic solution, for a change, instead of the political solution which has been advocated and unfortunately put into effect on many occasions on both north and south sides of the Border.</P>
      <P>The Six-County Government by their arbitrary and unilateral action have given a very severe rebuff to many people in this State who hoped for closer integration on economic lines between North and South.  Deputy Cosgrave rightly referred to useful examples of co-operation in the Erne and Lough Foyle fishery schemes. These gave heart to many people here to look forward to at least a basis for co-operation between the two parts of the country on economic and social lines, but this later development I think has certainly come as a grave disappointment, not to use any stronger expression, to people on both sides of the Border, who had hoped there might be closer integration not only of Government but also of industrial and other interests on both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> Some time ago&mdash;and I think on more than one occasion&mdash;the Taoiseach referred to the necessity of achieving unity of wills as a prerequisite to any integration of national territory Actions such as this by the Government of the Six Counties are a very poor encouragement to that spirit of unification which we desire in every part of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we here, the present set-up, can complain if the Six-County Government want to bring in legislation affecting their own area but I think it becomes a matter for serious concern when legislation by the Six-County Government materially affects the economic pattern in this State, particularly in the present instance in the case of rail and road transport.  There is no doubt the decision to terminate the G.N.R., as the Minister indicated in his introductory speech, has created very serious problems in regard to the economics of rail transport on this side of the Border and also in regard to existing employment and opportunities of employment in railway work in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Therefore, we have a situation where an arbitrary decision of the Northern Government has severely affected the economic interest of our people down here.  That is a serious state of affairs.  It will discourage many people here from making the effort to achieve economic co-operation in various industrial and economic spheres.</P>
    <P>In my humble opinion, the proper solution of the public transport problem in this country would have been one concern to run all public transport in the 32 Counties.  I do not think that is such an exaggerated suggestion when one considers that British railways cater for an enormous rail network and a population of 50,000,000 in the neighbouring island. The more we consider that here we have a population of a little over 4,000,000 divided, in the first place, into two Government areas and now subdivided into two separate transport undertakings, the more ridiculous the whole set-up appears.</P>
    <P>The opportunities of income to C.I.E.&mdash;even the expanded C.I.E. now taking over the section of the G.N.R. <Col N="554" /> within the Twenty-Six Counties&mdash;are seriously injured because I assume that if the argument that branch lines are essential features of the system is true, then all the features of the part north of the Border are all to be cut off now and places from Dundalk and Drogheda south are left to depend on whatever traffic feeds in from the line south of the Border.  They are to be completely cut off.  In addition, our heavy overheads and costs are now to be spread over a smaller railway system.  A smaller railway system will now have to carry greater costs. We are anxious that the existing employees of C.I.E. and the employees of the G.N.R. for whom we are now accepting responsibility will maintain employment.  If we had the same approach to the problem as the Six-County Government appears to have it might be a case of raising the axe and forgetting about the number of persons dependent on the railway system for their employment and their livelihood.</P>
    <P>The financial aspect of the whole system now becomes far more serious and a greater impost on the taxpayer of this country.  In the C.I.E. Bill which we discussed a few weeks ago the Minister outlined his plans for writing off £16,500,000 in various loans and accepting liability for loans to C.I.E., losses and certain unwanted assets.  Now, on top of that, we are writing off £4,000,000 of G.N.R.'s purchase price losses and expenditure amounting, between the two systems, to a total of £20,500,000.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. have been guaranteed £1,000,000 per year for five years to assist in putting them on their feet. That is to be increased by a further sum of £175,000 a year for a further period of five years, making, in all, a total of £6,000,000.  Speaking on the C.I.E. Bill in this House a few weeks ago, the Minister did not indicate, although he was asked the question by, I think, Deputy Sweetman, how C.I.E. arrived at the necessity for getting £1,000,000, no less, for five years. The same question now arises with the G.N.R. section.  How do they arrive at £175,000 per annum for five years?  I hope the Minister will clarify that point.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the whole question, <Col N="555" /> the Minister has endeavoured to make reasonable provision for the workers in the G.N.R. section.  A tremendous lot depends on the success of the new Dundalk Engineering Works. I join with other Deputies in wishing this Bill every possible success.  I am a little apprehensive of basing the future prosperity of the undertaking purely on assembling this new small car.  I would have thought some other types of cars, more saleable inside and outside the country, might be a better venture.  I would also have thought that, as mentioned by some other speakers, Dundalk would be recognised as a centre for construction work, maintenance work and general repairs not only on the part of the G.N.R. system now taken over but also on the part of the C.I.E. system north of Dublin and that we would have in this country three main constructional and maintenance shops&mdash;the Dundalk works under contract, Inchicore and Limerick.  They seem to be the three obvious centres where there are existing skilled staffs which every effort must be made to maintain.</P>
    <P>No provision has been made for a section of the community.  So far, nobody has raised a voice in defence of the unfortunate Irish taxpayer who will have to provide the wherewithal for all these provisions as a result of this new measure.  By and large, I think, with other Deputies, the Minister has made the best of a bad job. It is an inevitable outcome of this arbitrary action by the Six-County Government.  We are now landed with a truncated G.N.R. system which will add to the existing expense and overheads on our already top-heavy public transport system.  It does seem that if this sort of arbitrary attitude by the Government of the Six Counties continues, all hope of achieving what many of us want to achieve&mdash;a properly integrated economic effort between North and South&mdash;will not be realised.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill because I think it is inevitable.  I wanted to express my personal views on what I think has been a serious rebuff and a great disappointment to many people who, I am certain, are north of the Border as well as south of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already spoken at some length about the G.N.R.  Works during the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, I shall just make a few brief remarks now.  The two big matters which are causing considerable anxiety to the workers in the Dundalk works are (1) compensation on redundancy in the Dundalk Engineering Works and (2) the desire that the rail and road work which had already been done in Dundalk should be left in Dundalk.</P>
      <P>With regard to compensation, railway workers are guaranteed compensation on redundancy because of various factors such as closure of lines, dieselisation, and so on.  The Minister stated in this House that if certain people are found to be not suitable for particular types of work at the Dundalk Engineering Works they will be compensated for loss of employment. I would ask the Minister to consider compensating workers in the Dundalk Engineering Works up to a certain period, on redundancy.  The difficulty workers in the Dundalk Engineering Works face is that once they pass over to the Dundalk Engineering Works and are employed by that company they are no longer entitled to compensation. They fear they might become redundant in a short period after being taken over by that company.  I wonder would the Minister consider allowing a certain period for compensation after they become employees of Dundalk Engineering Works.  The Minister has already stated that road and railway repair work will be kept on at Dundalk.  It is being done by contract by the Dundalk Engineering Works for the G.N.R. and, as the Minister has stated, it is Government policy to keep it there.  I appreciate there will be certain difficulties in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the problem of employment for such a great number of men.  It is a problem of great magnitude and it is easily understandable that the men in the Dundalk Engineering Works are rather anxious about this matter. They feel that until such time as they can be assured of full employment from the various types of work which the <Col N="557" /> Dundalk Engineering Works will undertake, the repair work should remain there, and that it would be a good safeguard for their employment. As the Minister has stated, it is to be regretted this Bill to dissolve the G.N.R.  Board should be necessary.  It has never been the wish of any Government in this part of the country to dissolve that board.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that a previous Minister for Industry and Commerce refused to allow the branch lines to be closed, even when pressure was put on him to do so by the Ministry of Commerce in the Six Counties.  Of course, the fact of the matter is that our agreement with the Belfast Government will terminate in September this year and no Minister on this side of the Border would be able to keep branch lines open, once the Minister on the other side decided to close them down.</P>
    <P>With regard to the housing question, the Minister stated some time ago that houses occupied by workers in the Dundalk Engineering Works would become the property of the Dundalk Engineering Works, and those occupied by the workers on the G.N.R. would become the property of the G.N.R.  At present there seems to be a sort of tug-of-war proceeding with regard to these houses.  It seems that in certain cases if a man is working on the G.N.R., there is no difficulty in transferring the tenancy of his house to his son, if his son is also working on the G.N.R., but, if he happens to be working with the Dundalk Engineering Works, there appears to be very great difficulty in having the house transferred.  I should like the Minister to look into that.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that I have no doubt whatever that the Dundalk Engineering Works will be a success, if there is co-operation between the workers and the management, and I feel that, in the circumstances, the Minister has done a good job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I am very worried that it has been found necessary to introduce this Bill, but, knowing the conditions operating in the Six-County area in regard to transport for some years past, it did seem <Col N="558" /> inevitable that such a Bill as this would have to be introduced here.  The fact is that the Northern Government and the Northern Transport Authority were not co-operating at all in the very good agreement which was involved in the joint ownership.  It is unfortunate, however, that the situation in the North has led to this.  It has done so because the Ulster Transport Authority ran bus services which really killed the passenger traffic on the northern section of the railway.  The same applied to road freight services, so that from the very beginning it was clear, with the services of the Ulster Transport Authority and the services of private individuals up there who had their own transport to a larger extent than here the operation of the G.N.R., at envisaged by the agreement, could no continue because it was losing both passenger and road freight traffic.  The Minister, I am afraid, was compelled to do this and I suppose it is the only way out of a very difficult and very unfortunate situation, a situation for which he cannot be blamed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is true that in the case of a branch line, the Government here did prolong its life for a further year by way of paying the full losses, we certainly could not do that for the whole system.  Therefore, I think this is the best and, as a matter of fact, the only solution.  From the point of view of my constituency, and County Donegal in general, it creates a multitude of transport problems.  In the first place, it is certain that after this Bill is passed, and a similar Bill in the Six-County Parliament, the G.N.R. rail line between Portadown and Derry is doomed.  All the indications are that it will close because we see huge sums of money being spent on the construction of a trunk road to Omagh and to Derry.  Where that road crosses bridges, there are very large gaps which remain to be filled in the road programme when the line is abandoned. Then, the position in regard to Donegal will be that we will have no direct train service to the county. Goods will either have to go through Sligo by rail, be transferred to the road service there, and taken to and distributed within the county.  Otherwise, they will have to go to Portadown, <Col N="559" /> to be transhipped there to the road service and will arrive in Donegal via Lifford and Derry.  That will mean costly rehandling, longer delays in delivery and increased freights generally for goods of all classes to the county.</P>
    <P>There will be a similar and an even greater upset in the travelling arrangements to Donegal which will affect considerably the economic life of the county, especially from the tourist point of view.  It is likely to have the further effect that railway lines in Donegal which were connected at various points with the G.N.R. line from Portadown to Derry will be completely uneconomic and I can see that a request for the closure of these Donegal railway lines will be made and, if that happens, a further very heavy burden will be placed on the road system in the county.</P>
    <P>At the moment the county council has its hands full trying to maintain the main road system in County Donegal. When the closure of the Portadown-Derry branch of the G.N.R. and the railways within the county takes place, all the freight now carried by those lines, naturally, will have to go by road.  That will impose heavy burdens on the finances of our county and heavy burdens on the ratepayers. For that reason, I would urge the Minister to consider the road problem in County Donegal in a special way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>If, as a result of what will take place under this Bill, Donegal is to be catered for by road transport, the county will not be able to meet the huge sums which will be necessary for the provision of alternative transport by road and, if the Minister cannot do anything in the matter, I would urge that he should co-operate with the Minister concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister had discussions with the northern Minister in regard to the various problems which will arise from this Bill?  Has any guarantee <Col N="560" /> been given that passenger services operating to the counties along the Border will be augmented in the event of a close-down of the Portadown-Derry line?  At the moment the public travelling to Donegal use the Portadown-Derry line.  Have we any guarantee that the Ulster Transport Authority will co-operate to any great extent in providing a passenger service to connect Portadown with places like Derry and Lifford and other centres in County Donegal?</P>
    <P>For a number of years past, the present Minister and various previous Ministers and the Department have had under consideration the whole transport set-up in County Donegal.  Heretofore, the position has been that the County Donegal railways operated a rail and lorry service; the G.N.R. operated a passenger bus service, and the Lough Swilly Railway in North Donegal operated both a passenger and a road freight service.  It is envisaged in this Bill that the services operated by the County Donegal Railways and the Letterkenny Railway will be taken over by C.I.E.  That means that there will be two transport organisations catering for Donegal.</P>
    <P>I want to say at the outset that, as far as North Donegal is concerned, both for passenger traffic and freight traffic, it is very well served by a private company, the Lough Swilly Railway.  If I were sure that there would be an equally good service under C.I.E. for the remainder of the county, I would be quite happy about the transport situation in that area, but I am afraid that, in the case of a large organisation like C.I.E. and because of the fact that County Donegal is at the tail-end of their system, the county may not receive proper consideration. I was wondering whether something that has been mooted in Donegal several times, that is, an independent system for the county, based on the private transport organisation, could be achieved.  In view of all the difficulties which must be met, in view of the very localised organisation necessary to connect that county with the rest of the Twenty Six Counties and with the transport organisation in the Six Counties, such a system would have advantages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> I expect that the same conditions in regard to superannuation, redundancy and compensation as apply to the workers of the G.N.R. will apply to the workers of the County Donegal railways.  I should like the Minister to confirm that and to indicate whether it is likely that any greater amount of redundancy is likely to occur in that area, both in the G.N.R. stretch which enters Donegal at various places and in the County Donegal railways area, than elsewhere.  I think there is bound to be a greater amount of redundancy in that area than elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the arrangement between the two Governments has not worked out as satisfactorily in this case as it has in the case of the Foyle Fisheries Commission, with which I am familiar.  Given goodwill on both sides it could have; it was something that could be achieved had goodwill existed and proper arrangements made.  For instance, a factor has been mentioned which from our own knowledge did improve the efficiency and economy of the G.N.R. in the North.  That was dieselisation but it was not given a proper chance.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will bear in mind the pleas which have been made to him by Donegal and by Derry.  I am sure there will be requests to his Department from various bodies in the northern counties like Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal, and I hope the many proposals which I can see cropping up will receive his sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>One could see over the years that there could be only one result to the situation which has existed up to the present.  There is no doubt that that situation will create serious problems.  It will certainly create serious problems for County Donegal.  One is most curious to know why the Northern Government propose to close down the line from Derry to Portadown.  It strikes one as very significant and that there is an ulterior motive behind it, remembering that they propose to keep the railway line from Portadown to Belfast, via Coleraine, working.  On that line there is not, from Derry, any hinterland from which to get trade or business.  On the line from Belfast to Derry there is a <Col N="562" /> whole hinterland on either side.  I am particularly curious about the motive for closing down this line.  The obvious thing to do would be to close the Derry-Coleraine-Belfast railway, on economic grounds.</P>
      <P>There are two stations on the line from Portadown to Derry situated in County Donegal.  I wonder whether the purpose of closing down this section was because no injury could be done to the G.N.R., its rolling stock, goods or property, by the fact that these two stations in Donegal were being deprived of a service?  That aspect of the matter strikes me very forcibly.  I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce had any say in that, or whether he could interfere in any effective way in regard to that question.</P>
      <P>The net result is the creation of a situation of utter chaos for County Donegal.  The Minister has agreed to hand over the Donegal railways and the Strabane-Letterkenny railway to C.I.E.  That seems to me to be just a joke.  The terminals of these two lines are in Strabane and from Strabane they get their contacts with regard to the merchandise and passengers which they carry.  Secondly, the terminal station house, the stores and transhipment sheds are in Strabane.  Where are they to get their goods?  Does it not look obvious that you will have to close them down right away?  There are no provisions in the Bill that they are to be accommodated in the Six Counties.  It is quite clear that the net result of this, when it comes into operation, is that there must be an entire road service in County Donegal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham referred to the problem that will be created as a result of the Donegal railways, and the Strabane-Letterkenny line being handed over to C.I.E.  They must automatically die; they could not survive because of the problem of sending goods from Strabane and the various parts of Donegal.  There will be no railway to feed them.  I cannot see what is the purpose of handing them over to C.I.E.  This Bill purports to solve a problem that already existed and in my opinion it will only create a bigger mess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> One thing that strikes me is that this is a deliberate attempt to put a line around the Six Counties and create a permanent enclave there where we will have nothing to do with them.  That will be the net result of this arrangement of disconnecting and breaking up the G.N.R. and its contacts with the Twenty-Six Counties.  In my opinion it is really regrettable and the implications of it are not yet obvious.  As time goes on, they will become obvious and then we shall see where we are.  I should like to know from the Minister what will happen the G.N.R. bus service which operates in County Donegal. Is it going to come under the control of C.I.E., or will C.I.E. supply a new fleet of buses for the transport of passengers in Donegal?</P>
    <P>Much concern has been expressed about the workshops in Dundalk.  No matter what we would like to do with regard to the 1,000 people employed in Dundalk, the fact remains that they depend on the ups and downs of a commercial concern.  I regret that no provision in this Bill can be watertight in regard to the preservation of their rights.  They had an existing right that could not be interfered with.  The work they had to do was within this State.  It is gone now.  Their work now depends on world competition and they have no guarantee.  If there should be a world depression; their fate would be sealed, and that would be a very sad day for Dundalk.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what arrangement there is about the terminals of the Donegal railway and the Strabane and Letterkenny railway. It says here that there will be an agreement with the northern Minister to have some arrangement about the terminals; but even if there was an agreement, I do not see what purpose it could serve to have a terminal in Strabane because there would be no railway from Portadown to Derry.  It strikes me as a piece of a muddle and I hope it will be solved in some way. There is no good talking about goodwill and co-operation.  There is nothing to co-operate with.  There are no terminals in Strabane for the two existing railways.  Some practical steps <Col N="564" /> will have to be taken.  It is really bewildering.</P>
    <P>The Bill is merely to clean up the scrap and make an arrangement about the debris of the G.N.R., a railway which gave such great service to the whole of the North of Ireland.  It gave great service for about 60 years.  It was well run and its officials were efficient, highly competent and courteous. The marvellous thing was that in all those years they kept perfect time.  You could always time them to within five minutes or perhaps less. One regrets to see an institution of that kind pass away.  It is next to impossible to conceive of any other organisation giving the service the G.N.R. gave over the years.  I regret its passing and I still hope, although it is only a faint hope, that some organisation will be created that will give the efficient service it gave.  One cannot imagine anything more perfect than the service given by the G.N.R. in the area it served.  I feel it would be impossible to replace it, especially in my native county.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the problem will be solved only by the spending of a considerable amount of State money on the road service to accommodate the county.  That will have to be faced. It should have been faced before now. The writing was on the wall, but no substantial steps were taken to prepare for it.  In two months' time, this Bill will come into operation and it is inevitable that the two railway lines in Donegal will die and, in fact, they are as dead as dodos already.  Yet, no steps have been taken to replace them.</P>
    <P>I am curious to know what is to happen to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company.  Are they to be left hanging on as a tail-end and are they to be nobody's child?  No reference has been made to them. Under whose jurisdiction are they to operate?  Will they operate within themselves?  In that connection, I must pay tribute to them.  Over the years, and particularly during the war years when the provision of a transport service of any kind was a problem, they gave highly efficient service.</P>
    <P>We will have to face the problems arising from this Bill on some other <Col N="565" /> front some other day.  Arise they most certainly will and there is no use in shirking this issue.  I profoundly regret that the two Governments could not see their way to pull together and maintain this contact between Donegal, the Six Counties and the rest of Ireland.  The situation will seriously affect the economy of the country as a whole and must inevitably affect the Six Counties, irrespective of what they may think now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The termination of the agreement for the joint operation of the G.N.R. system must appear to be a backward step in the development of co-operation on matters of common interest affecting both parts into which our country is divided.  For that reason, apart from any more practical reason, it must be deplored.  I agree fully with the view expressed by Deputy Cosgrave that the transport problems of both parts of Ireland are practically identical in character and, because of that, joint action in relation to them was feasible when policies in both areas were in alignment. The change of outlook regarding transport matters which has taken place in Belfast has, however, forced them out of alignment, and it is as a direct consequence of that change that these problems of adjustment are now confronting us.</P>
      <P>However, it will be understood that the new arrangements will necessitate very close working contacts between C.I.E. and the Ulster Transport Authority, first, to complete the segregation of the assets of the G.N.R. and subsequently in the organisation of the cross-Border transport operations, both by road and by rail.  Indeed, I think I should say that in the discussions which have taken place so far regarding these arrangements, there has been every evidence of a desire to minimise the consequences to the public and to secure a satisfactory system of cross-Border transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton said we should assume that the line from Portadown to Derry will be closed.  Deputy Cunningham, Deputy McMenamin and others have also spoken about that line on the assumption that it is inevitable it will close.  It is true that, in <Col N="566" /> 1956, Lord Glentoran wrote to my predecessor telling him that, when considering his attitude towards these new transport proposals, he should know that it would be his intention to close down that line.  It may be that there will be some fresh thinking about the desirability of doing so, when both that line and the existing Ulster Transport Authority lines via Coleraine are in the management of the Ulster Transport Authority.  There is no likelihood of the immediate closing down of the Portadown line.  The assurance which I was given in Belfast during our discussions last year was that it would not be closed down for at least two years.  My view is that when the Ulster Transport Authority management come to consider which of these two lines should be kept open, having regard to their traffic-generating potentialities and assuming that commercial considerations will decide the question, it is not impossible that the decision will be in favour of the Portadown line.</P>
    <P>That line is important to us.  It provides the only railway link between Donegal, Dundalk and Dublin.  A considerable amount of traffic crosses over it.  It is important to the people in the Donegal area.  My feeling is that the decision to close that line, taken about 18 monthe ago, was not disconnected with the rather stupid campaign of attacks upon railway installations which was being pursued at that time, but which has since stopped.  Irritation at that very foolish campaign may have prompted the decision to close the line, particularly as a very small section passes through Donegal where some of these attacks were concentrated.  Now that that campaign has ended and the two lines will be in the management of one undertaking, and assuming, as I said, that commercial considerations will predominate, it is not impossible that that line may be saved.  But if the decision is otherwise, there is nothing we can do about it.  I take it we shall have ample notice of the decision and will then be able to examine what arrangements are possible to minimise the inconvenience to people residing in County Donegal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the reprieve <Col N="567" /> of the railways for two years, has the Minister any information from his opposite number in the North that they will be continued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>None whatever.  We have the statement that we can proceed now on the assumption the line will not be closed for two years at least as from a date in last year.  Deputy Norton appeared to think that the Belfast-Dublin line might also be closed at some stage and services on that line terminated.  I do not see that happening for a very considerable time ahead.  One does not like to be dogmatic in these matters, but, in my view, if there is one railway line in the country that it should be possible to operate economically, it is the line from Dublin to Belfast, assuming that modern equipment and modern working methods are availed of.  There is a far greater density of traffic, and a frequency of service required, upon that line than on almost any other line. Indeed, I would regard it as the line most likely to achieve a situation in which continuing losses will not be the experience, assuming, as I have said, its potentialities are fully developed and its working methods are economically devised.</P>
      <P>It is true, as Deputy Norton said and Deputy Russell criticised, that the G.N.R. system within this State has been handed over to C.I.E. without any capital liability whatsoever.  That means we are wiping out the capital we have invested in it, £2,500,000, and all the money that is due from the G.N.R. Board to the Government here in respect of advances against losses or capital invested in the undertaking since its acquisition.  I do not think any of us could conceive handing over the system to C.I.E. with a capital liability attached.  C.I.E. would not regard the G.N.R. system as an asset. Indeed, we know it has been losing money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies have asked how we came to calculate that C.I.E. would require to get its annual subvention from the Exchequer increased by £175,000 because of the transfer of the G.N.R. system to it.  I will admit that figure is rather arbitrary.  Deputy Norton <Col N="568" /> talked about a figure which he recollected of some £400,000 or £500,000, but of course that figure included interest on capital and other liabilities which are now being wiped out and the only figure we are interested in is the annual deficit in revenue as compared with working costs.  In relation to that part of the system within the Twenty-Six Counties, that deficit was £190,000 in the year ended 9th September, 1957. It is obvious that the mere fact of amalgamation will effect some economies, and it is calculated that £175,000 should therefore be sufficient to meet any deficit which will arise in the operation of that system immediately after amalgamation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>Deputy Norton asked what the prospects of the Dundalk Engineering Works are.  I cannot attempt to sketch the future of that undertaking with any accuracy and, while I am certainly not pessimistic, I do not want to appear optimistic, either.  The board of the company came to me some time ago to report how they were getting on with their plans.  They said: &ldquo;We can see daylight; we can see the possibility of being able to do the task that was given to us.&rdquo;  That is the possibility of generating enough new commercial activity in Dundalk to give employment there, equivalent to that previously available when the works were servicing the G.N.R. Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a pleasant thing for me if this problem had never arisen, if the G.N.R.  Company had just gone on operating as before and if the Dundalk Engineering Works had nothing to do except to service the G.N.R. Company, but that is not the position.  We had to deal with a problem where, because of the changes that had taken place, we <Col N="569" /> had a surplus engineering works in the country, the Dundalk Engineering Works.  It was surplus to the country's requirements in respect of engineering capacity to meet the requirements of our railway system.  We set out to meet that problem by setting up an organisation which would transform that works from a railway engineering works into a commercial engineering undertaking. The board told me that they would have much preferred to have been given four green fields.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton said that the equipment at Dundalk is obsolete.  That is very largely true.  There is some new equipment, but, in the main, it is obsolete and unsuitable for ordinary commercial engineering work.  Not merely was the equipment obsolete but the buildings which had been designed in an earlier age to meet the specific purposes for which they were required at the time are also unsuitable for commercial engineering activity.  Nevertheless, the board had reached a situation where they said they could see lined up a series of commercial activities which would enable them to fulfil the tasks given to them.</P>
    <P>If they succeed in doing that, it will be not merely a tremendous accomplishment in itself but a tremendous source of encouragement to other parts of the country where a similar effort might conceivably produce a similar result.  While there was available to them the advantage of an organised corps of workers, many of them skilled, there were no other advantages and they regarded the existence of the buildings and layout of the whole place as a disadvantage rather than an advantage.  However, we can never be quite certain that all their plans will materialise as they now conceive them.  Nothing has emerged to make them less confident of fulfilling their task, but until the final step has been taken in every direction in which they are seeking to move, they cannot be sure they will get to their goals.</P>
    <P>It is contemplated now that there will be four or five separate companies at Dundalk.  They will all be subsidiaries to the main company, but each of them will be concerned with a separate type of activity.  Consequently, <Col N="570" /> this Bill provides for the transfer of certain properties and liabilities to the Dundalk Engineering Works or its successors because changes may be necessary in that regard.  We are not thinking of a Government company. The intention is that the finances required to make possible all these activities will be secured by an issue of shares to the public suitably underwritten. We recognise that it is unlikely that at this stage the public will subscribe all the capital required to make these activities possible, but it may be that at some later period these shares will be more saleable.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that the type of organisation we are thinking about is one which will not be run directly or indirectly by the Government.  It will not be a Bord na Móna or E.S.B. type of organisation.  It will be a commercial enterprise with perhaps private shareholders in it, and certainly we hope to reach a stage at which there will be nothing but private capital in it, a situation where it will be so successful at making profits that the public will be interested in acquiring shares.  The total investment contemplated by the projects which are under consideration may amount to as much as £1,500,000.</P>
    <P>As I said, nobody can guarantee the success of the whole enterprise or of any one of the component parts into which ultimately it will be divided. A great deal will depend upon the quality of the work done at Dundalk. Part of the problem is to alter the normal rhythm of a railway engineering works to secure the output, the economy and efficiency in production which a successful engineering undertaking must have.</P>
    <P>I also want to make it clear that we are not indemnifying the Dundalk works for all time against commercial failure.  It may be that, in the future, there will be changes in market conditions or some other circumstances which may cause some contraction of the work at Dundalk, just as there may be changes which may permit of an expansion.  The normal commercial considerations will operate there as operate elsewhere, and if in the future there is a difficult situation which will cause a commercial failure or some <Col N="571" /> contraction of operations, the situation will be fundamentally no different than if it happened in relation to some other kind of works at Cork, furniture factories somewhere else or clothing factories in any part of the country. This will be a commercial enterprise dependent for its survival upon the skill of its workers, the competence of its management and its ability to find markets for its products.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the desire of workers there to have an assurance that business will be available to them from C.I.E.  That assurance has been given in the agreement which has already been made between the Dundalk Engineering Works and C.I.E. for the performance by the Dundalk Engineering Works for C.I.E. of all the work that is required in the servicing of the railways and road transport services which C.I.E. are taking over from the G.N.R.  That will represent a very considerable contraction in the amount of railway work previously available at Dundalk when Dundalk was servicing the whole G.N.R. system, including two-thirds of it within the Six-County area.  Nevertheless, it will represent a substantial block of business for the general engineering section of the Dundalk enterprise.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with some of the specific questions raised in order to save Deputies the difficulty of drafting amendments which may be unnecessary. Deputy Norton referred to the section of the Bill which provides compensation to G.N.R. staff, if they become redundant because of the amalgamation. There is a drafting error in the Bill which has already been detected.  The provision should have been for compensation to either C.I.E. or G.N.R. staff rendered redundant by the amalgamation.  I shall move an amendment to put that right.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Coburn need worry about many of the amendments he suggested.  Land certainly includes houses and the land and the houses at Dundalk will be transferred to the Dundalk Engineering Works or the G.N.R. as arranged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Interpretation Act provides for that.  There is no doubt that the transfer of the land includes the transfer of the houses on the land.  Furthermore, let it be quite clear that all the liabilities of the G.N.R. Board in our territory are being transferred to C.I.E.  That will include the liability to which the Deputy has referred, where workers have taken action for compensation for injuries.  Whatever liability the G.N.R. Board had to these workers C.I.E. Board will take over.</P>
      <P>I would not at all agree that the workers transferred to the Dundalk Engineering Works are being transferred to a more risky employer than the old G.N.R. Board.  I hope to see Dundalk Engineering Works making substantial profits.  There was not the slightest prospect of the G.N.R. Board ever making profits.  In fact, its workers must have been worried for years past about their future security in the G.N.R. undertaking because of its mounting losses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving no assurance of that sort at all, but it is quite obvious that if we had not taken in time the steps we did take to get these various activities organised, most of the workers would be facing dismissal before the end of this year because there would be no work for them, even if they got the whole of the work&mdash; which the Dundalk Engineering Works will get&mdash;that will be left in respect of the part of the G.N.R. system in our territory.</P>
      <P>Also, in so far as it has been the customary practice of the G.N.R. Board to pay a supplementary pension over and above that provided out of the pension fund to retired workers, that will become an obligation of the Dundalk Engineering Works in the future.  The Bill requires them to pay any pension which was payable either under legal obligation or by customary practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dundalk Engineering Works have had that obligation pointed out to them.  Deputy Coburn was also worried about the prospect of a railway worker on the G.N.R. system being offered unsuitable employment by C.I.E. and preferring to get his redundancy compensation pension rather than have to accept that unsuitable employment.  Whether the offer of employment is suitable or not is a matter for determination by the arbitrator set up under the Acts and the arbitrator can hold that the offer was completely unsuitable or can hold that there was a worsening of conditions which would entitle the worker to compensation under that heading.</P>
      <P>The railway clearing system superannuation fund problem has not been solved.  Discussions are proceeding with the corporation and there is every goodwill in seeking a solution of the problem.  As I said, its solution will require legislation in Great Britain. It is not by any means clear that it will involve legislation here and, in the meantime, the position of the salaried officers who have pension rights from that fund will be maintained intact by this device of keeping the G.N.R. nominally in existence as a subscriber to the fund until the whole thing can be cleared up.  The number of salaried staff at Dundalk, that is, the number of salaried officers of the G.N.R. now seconded to the Dundalk Engineering Works, is about 70 and the position is that they will all be transferred to C.I.E. on the amalgamation and will, of course, be entitled to compensation under the Bill if C.I.E. do not require their services.  What I anticipate is that such a salaried officer will be transferred to C.I.E., will get his compensation pension determined and then apply to go back to Dundalk.  He will not be drawing pension while working in Dundalk but will have assured for himself that compensation pension if and when his work in Dundalk terminates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to wages staff is fundamentally different.  Most of these salaried officers had got seniority rights over the whole G.N.R. system. They could be sent to Dublin, Dundalk or Belfast according to the requirements of the G.N.R. Board.  The <Col N="574" /> works staff were recruited for the G.N.R. works at Dundalk.  It was never envisaged that they would be employed anywhere else and they never had, under the old legislation, the right to compensation because of redundancy arising out of the closing of branch lines.</P>
    <P>I want the House to understand the problem we are dealing with here.  If a branch line is closed down or some reorganisation takes place in the C.I.E. system for the purpose of reducing the number of workers employed in it, those who are made redundant in that operation are put out of employment and they get that compensation provision on the understanding that they are never coming back into that employment again.  The compensation arrangement is to facilitate the permanent cessation of their work in transport.  In the case of the Dundalk Engineering Works, the aim is to keep the workers in employment, not to put them out of employment. Any moral obligation we have to the workers there is fulfilled when we put them into employment but I want Deputies to see the practical problem that arises there.  If a C.I.E. worker on a closed branch line draws compensation pension, goes off and finds employment with a private employer, he takes the pension with him and some of them might conceivably be better off after the closing of the line than before because they would have their wages in their new employment plus the pension from their former employment.  That would not apply if they got employment with a statutory company or a public authority but, if they got employment with a private employer, they could be in that situation.  You could not run the Dundalk Engineering Works as a commercial unit successfully if every worker had a financial inducement to leave its employment whenever he got the chance and, therefore, the arrangement that we make to deal with any problem in Dundalk must be one that will induce the worker to stay on the job because that is what the whole operation was intended to achieve.  It would be detrimental to the interests of Dundalk as well as from the point of view of the successful operation of <Col N="575" /> the enginering enterprise, if there was an arrangement under which the worker would be better off if he left the Dundalk Engineering Works by seeking and obtaining employment with some private employer.</P>
    <P>If all the plans work out, there will be enough work at Dundalk to employ all those who were previously employed there by G.N.R.  I accept, however, that there may be some number of workers there who just cannot be adapted to the new employment.  They have been doing, perhaps, the same job for so many years that they could not conceivably be utilised in any other capacity in which they may be required.  What I said was that we propose to put the Dundalk Engineering Works in funds to enable them to handle any such problem that arises on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis.  Deputy Coburn asked that the right should be statutory. The whole purpose is to make it non-statutory to enable an arrangement to be made under which that problem can be handled on an individual basis without having statutory rights established.  Indeed, when Deputy Coburn spoke about paying compensation to the wages staff there following an offer of employment, it is the reverse situation that we are thinking of.  Where there is an offer of employment, there will be no question of compensation.  The compensation will arise only where it is not found possible to offer an individual worker employment in the new system. The question may not arise at all.  If it does, it is likely to arise quickly and, therefore, the provision for that <i>ex gratia</i> solution of the problem will be a temporary one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coburn mentioned the Sligo-Leitrim arrangement.  What we contemplate would not be dissimilar in principle to the arrangement that was made there, even though the calculations might be on an individual basis. When Deputy Coburn spoke about workers employed there for 40 or 45 years, he will understand that he is talking about men who must be very near retirement age and under their conditions of employment with G.N.R. would have retired upon that pension <Col N="576" /> of 10/- a week statutory plus 10/- a week <i>ex gratia</i>, which was all that those who had retired in earlier years were entitled to receive.</P>

In so far as they apply north of the Border, it is a matter for the Ulster Transport Authority.  I do not see the slightest prospect that operators of transport concerns in other countries will recognise the Dundalk Engineering Works as a railway undertaking for the purpose of extending privilege tickets to their employees.  In any case, there is nothing we can do which could compel them to extend that privilege.  I do not know if there is anything else I need refer to at this stage.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot answer that question.  They have tendered for a number of contracts abroad but, until they themselves have made an announcement regarding the success of their efforts, I would not like to deal with it.  I have not got the information, anyway, just at the <Col N="577" /> moment.  The activities of the engineering works proper, that is, as distinct from the specialised manufacturing operations it is hoped to develop, will represent a substantial part of their activity and, of course, a great deal will depend on their ability to get contracts abroad which, in turn, will depend on their capacity to quote competitive prices.  That particular section of the undertaking will have the basic business of catering for C.I.E. needs in that section of the C.I.E. system.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In sub-section (2), page 14, line 12, before &ldquo;of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or in any premises adjacent thereto&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy Sweetman.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned consideration of this amendment, we were discussing whether this part of the Bill referred to directors, no matter what they were paid.  I think we concluded that it was clear that Part IV of the Bill does refer to a director, whether he receives any remuneration or not.  The exception included in sub-section (3) of Section 24 refers only to employees.  If a person who is a director is caught under any part of this Bill, then he is caught notwithstanding the fact that the remuneration he draws out of the concern is far less than the limit of £1,500 specified in Section 24, sub-section (3). The effect of that clearly appears to me to be that under Section 22 in towns in rural Ireland many small businesses which happen to be private companies with small capital and small fixed assets, where the directors either live over the shop or, perhaps, have a room behind the shop for meal purposes, will, for the first time, be charged a rental for tax purposes in respect of the accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> To me, that seems completely unnecessary, and to be as far removed, as chalk is from cheese, from the type of deliberate fake on which the Minister founded this Bill in the earlier discussions.  If a company operates in Dublin and a director of that company prefers, for his own convenience, to live on an estate in Meath or Kildare some 20 miles away and, for the purpose of avoiding tax on it, ensures that it is bought by the company, I can understand that in such a case the Minister would provide that such a person would be assessed on a rental basis.  But where we have&mdash;as there are throughout the country&mdash;a great number of small business people living adjacent to their work for the purpose of carrying on that work&mdash;not necessarily, or, to use a phrase we have already met, &ldquo;wholly, necessarily and exclusively living there&rdquo;&mdash;I do not think it is right and proper that they should be charged as provided in this section.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister some specific questions earlier, and as the Minister has decided to reject the method of getting the Income Tax Commission to report to us, I think the House is entitled to an answer to those questions. What is the purpose, the true meaning, of Section 22 in regard to benefits in kind?  I am not interested at this stage in what is intended or in arguing about whether the Revenue Commissioners will &ldquo;go for&rdquo; this man or that man.  I take the view already stated by Deputy Dillon that when the law is there, it is the Revenue Commissioners' duty to comply with the terms of the Act and operate accordingly.</P>
    <P>I want to know clearly from the Minister are we correct in thinking that the phrase &ldquo;in any of its business premises&rdquo; in line 11, page 14, sub-section (2) of Section 22 means, as we think, that any director, even of the smallest business concern that is incorporated, who happens to live overhead will have the value of his living accommodation added in for tax purposes, or that even if he has a room at the back of the shop which is used for private purposes, as apart from shop storage, the value of that will be taken to be a benefit in kind and assessed for tax purposes?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> If I am correct in understanding from the Minister earlier to-day that such benefits are to be included for the first time in taxation by reason of Section 22, then I think we have reached the position in which we can truthfully say: &ldquo;This is legislation gone mad.&rdquo;  Nothing in relation to the type of case the Minister mentioned earlier would justify provisions of that sort, and I think it is time the House considered whether, under the guise of a technical Bill to get over imperfections, something really radical is being &ldquo;put across&rdquo; us all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no implication. It is quite possible to argue on sub-section (1) (a) of Section 22 that it can be read as referring to a body corporate incurring expense in connection with provision for any of its directors employed by it in an employment to which this part of the Bill applies. If it is an employment to which this part of the Bill applies, it is defined in sub-section (2) of Section 24 as an employment which brings in emoluments exceeding £1,500 per annum.  It seems to me that anybody to whom this section is attempted to be applied in future will be able to make that argument and will be able to say that a director employed by a company and whose income does not exceed £1,500 a year will not come within Part IV of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman wants to know the purpose of Section 22 in regard to benefits in kind.  At present, benefits in kind are not subject to income-tax, a benefit in kind being defined as a benefit that is not readily convertible into cash.  That is the main thing at the moment.</P>
      <P>If a director gets a motor car, that is convertible into cash and therefore it would be assessable under the present law.  If a house is presented to him, the same would apply.

      <P>Quite right.  He could not sell that and therefore tax would not at present be applied.  The object is to <Col N="581" /> bring all these benefits in kind into the same category and subject to tax. The discussion has been raised particularly on the country business&mdash;as Deputy Sweetman put it just now, on the man who is living either over or behind his business, a small business in the country.  In the first place, if you take a proprietor&mdash;not a company, as the Deputy knows&mdash;he is assessed on the profits of his business.  As far as the premises are concerned, the rule at the moment is, and will remain the rule, I think, as far as this Bill is concerned, that he gets a deduction in respect of Schedule A tax on the business part of his premises.  In other words, premises are divided between the living part and the business part.</P>

To that extent, having converted himself into a company, he gets the advantage of the deduction for the whole premises.  Therefore, he has an advantage there over being the proprietor, as he was previously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is brought in here is that he pays, therefore, on the living part of the premises&mdash;but he pays under Schedule A only in respect of the valuation, not the letting value.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he pays on the valuation. What is more, he gets the advantage of the four-fourths, not the five-fourths. He is not treated very harshly. He is merely brought into line with a proprietor who is running a business on the same premises, that is, living in part of the premises and using the other part of the premises for the business.  That is as far as we have to go at the moment on that section.  I submit that the small man who lives on his premises is asked to pay Schedule A tax only on the part he lives in.  He is asked to pay only on the poor law valuation of that part and on the basis of four-fourths and not five-fourths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If the Minister will look at line 1, page 14, he will see that where these things arise under sub-section (1), at the bottom of page 13, Rules 1 and 9 of the rules applicable to Schedule E are to apply.  That has nothing to do with Schedule A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> Let me give the Minister an example. Take a small country shop the valuation of which is £10.  The valuation on the shop is £5 and the valuation on the house is £5 also.  As the position stands, the Minister gets tax on a Schedule A assessment.  I always forget whether it is five-fourths or not, but whether it is or not does not matter. The Minister gets tax of £10 under Schedule A on the valuation.</P>
    <P>As the Bill now stands the Minister will get tax of £10 under Schedule A and, in addition, will get tax on the estimated letting value of the private part of the house, less £5.  The estimated letting value of the house, the private part, will be much more than £5.  Let us say it will be £50 and it means accordingly, as I see it, the tax here will be assessed under Rules 1 and 9 of the rules applicable to Schedule E, because all these directors' emoluments come in under Schedule E.</P>
    <P>If the situation was that there was purely a charge for Schedule A, then, of course, I could understand the case the Minister is making, but, from beginning to end in Section 22, there is not one word of mention of Schedule A. The only thing in Section 22 that is mentioned in relation to any schedule are Rules 1 and 9 of Schedule E.  I do not want to weary the Minister by reading out Rules 1 and 9 of Schedule E, but nothing in Rules 1 and 9 refers to Schedule A.  That being so, it seems to me quite clear it must be in relation to the assumed rental of the private part of the house that the assessment is being raised.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from all that, we have been arguing this on the basis of the private company in the small town in rural Ireland.  I am not a bit happy that we are even restricted to that, because Section 28 in sub-section (1)&mdash; or rather, to be more accurate, in all its sub-sections, and particularly in sub-section (3)&mdash;makes the provisions of this Part of the Act applicable to individuals trading in exactly the same way as if they were a company.  Therefore, I think we may be coming back to the situation that the small shopkeeper is caught in rural Ireland, even if he is not incorporated, but that is <Col N="584" /> an argument we will have to have on Section 28 when we come down to it.</P>
    <P>As framed at present, however, there is not one word in Section 22, from beginning to end, about Schedule A. Perhaps the Minister can show me where my reading is faulty, but I cannot find one word about it.  All I can find is the reference that the tax, the benefits here, are to be computed under Rules 1 and 9 of Schedule E.  That means also it will be taken in on Schedule A, but on the assumed occupier's rentals, and for the life of me I cannot see where we are travelling in this section.</P>
    <P>It seems to me we are putting on the small shopkeeper down the country, certainly those who are incorporated, and possibly, when we come down to Section 28, those who are not incorporated, the man who has not incorporated himself into a company, an additional and penal tax.  Anybody who has experience of rural Ireland at present knows the shopkeeper in the city, in the town, and in the village is having a pretty rough time, and to me this seems the wrong time to impose a burden on him such as is included in this section.</P>
    <P>The difficulties we have had already on it when Deputy Haughey and I differed on the interpretation, and the difficulty when the Minister gets up and says it is Schedule A, when Schedule A is not mentioned here, all come back to the same point, that this is a technical Bill and the House should have had before it the report of people competent to report objectively on proposals like this, such as the Income Tax Commission at present sitting.  Certainly, the more I go into this Bill, the more fogged I get and&mdash;I do not mean this in any offensive way to the Minister&mdash;the more the Minister tries to explain what the sections in the Bill mean, the more it appears from his explanations that it means something different from the language contained in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I put this to the Minister: we are trying to pursue a discussion on this Bill as objectively as possible.  Deputy Sweetman is professionally interested and has some experience of income-tax law.  The <Col N="585" /> Minister is advised by the Revenue Commissioners and Deputy Haughey is professionally familiar with the income-tax code.  I am an ordinary legislator. The position is now reached in which Deputy Sweetman takes the view the Bill as submitted means one thing. Deputy Haughey takes the view it means something else and the Minister takes the view that it has yet a third meaning.  When the Minister expresses his view as to what he intended to convey and to effect by this Bill, Deputy Haughey's comment is he would go to the Supreme Court on that issue, believing honestly that the Bill does not mean what the Minister intended it to mean.  I do not believe any of the participants in the discussion are in bad faith.  I believe the truth is that we are all trying to speculate as to how this legislation will operate in our conditions and, no matter how hard the Minister tries, his mind must be influenced by how this legislation has operated in Great Britain in the circumstances obtaining there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to renew my submission to the House that it will not operate in our conditions as it has operated in Great Britain, or as it may be expected hereafter to operate there.  Our conditions are entirely different and I want to say, quite deliberately&mdash;and I think this submission should carry weight with the Minister, as I also have as long experience of legislation in this House as most Deputies and I believe I have given this Bill as close consideration as any other Deputy&mdash; I do not know what it will mean.  I do not believe I have at my disposal the means of determining the impact which this legislation will have on a very large part of our people, but I do believe there is available to this House, if the Minister will but make it available, the means to give reasoned judgment on these proposals, and that means is to ask either a special committee of this House, or the Income-Tax Commission at present sitting, to give consideration to this part of the Bill, with power to hear evidence and send for documents.  I mean no disrespect to Deputy Sweetman or to the Minister when I say it is hopeless to raise the kind of problems which must <Col N="586" /> occur to the mind of any Deputy in the Opposition and ask the Minister across the House what will happen in this contingency and that.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if we had a special committee of the House, or if I were a member of the Income-Tax Commission, I would expect the Revenue Commissioners, if called upon to give evidence, to have in their establishment&mdash;as I know they would have&mdash;perhaps two or three men, or maybe four, who would be between them equipped to give an authoritative answer to any hypothetical case of a reasonable character that would be placed before them in order to elicit information.  I do not believe any Minister for Finance can be expected to provide information of that character in the course of the Committee Stage of a Bill such as this, because no matter how exhaustively he had briefed himself, if he is fit for the job of Minister for Finance he ought not to know the income-tax code with that degree of familiarity, because he ought to have more important things to be troubling himself about.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister will agree with me that to launch the whole commercial population of this country into the vortex of Part IV of this Bill, without any of us in this House knowing precisely what we ourselves are doing, is to carry parliamentary irresponsibility to a fantastic length?</P>
    <P>I am obliged again to call to the memory of the House the situation in which we now stand.  It is the duty of the Revenue Commissioners, who have a quasi-autonomous status under our Constitution, from time to time to make recommendations to the Minister for Finance, whoever he may be, for legislative action which, in their judgment, will better protect the revenue. It is their duty to state the revenue point of view and it is for us in Dáil Éireann, when these proposals are submitted to the Dáil, to present the case of the ordinary people of the country. If what the Revenue Commissioners consider to be requisite for the adequate protection of the revenue, appears to us to impose an unreasonable burden on the average taxpayer &mdash;either in the size of the tax it seeks <Col N="587" /> to levy or in the method to be employed in the levying of the tax&mdash;it is for us to make the case against it.  I shall have occasion to do that, in connection with an amendment which I shall move later on, in regard to the levying of taxation; but when I come to make that case, I should have at my disposal the facts, and I should be able to communicate the facts to the House and let the House pass judgment on them.  The difficulty in regard to Part IV is that I do not know the facts; the Minister does not know the facts; Deputy Haughey does not know the facts; Deputy Sweetman does not know the facts; nobody knows the facts.  What exasperates me is that we are not in a position where it is impossible to ascertain the facts.  We have machinery to do that; and all I am asking is that before we legislate we should use that machinery.</P>
    <P>Then, when we have the facts, we may not all agree.  The Minister may adhere to his view and, with all the facts before him, he may still stand on this.  We on this side of the House may agree or disagree with him.  A decision will then be taken by the votes of the Members of Dáil Éireann. It seems to be reckless to persist in this Part of the Bill when manifestly none of us understands what it will mean.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will not accept the suggestion that it go to the Commission on Income-tax&mdash;where I think it ought to go&mdash;will he consider referring this Part of the Bill to a Special Committee of Dáil Éireann, with power to hear evidence and to send for papers? Whatever course he decides upon, will he at least deliver us from the necessity of finally passing on this Part of this Bill, when no Deputy, including the Minister, understands it?  Is that understood?  Let me recall to the Minister his yearning solicitude for a reasonable approach to his legislative proposal and let me exhort him, if he wishes to encourage such an approach, to give some signal on his part that, where reasonable representations are made, they will secure some compromise from him?</P>
    <P>I cannot for the life of me see how there can be any reasoned argument <Col N="588" /> against the simple proposition that, if none of us understand Part IV of this Bill, we should not pass final judgment upon it until we take the simple and readily accessible means available to us to secure an understanding of it&mdash; and then, with that information, give our judgment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 14, line 13, to delete &ldquo;solely&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to delete the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo;.  What I have in mind&mdash; and this reduces the case, as I read the section, to its farcical absurdity&mdash;is that a company pays a commercial traveller, not a director&mdash;to get away from the director class&mdash;more than £1,500 a year.  They pay him £1,501 a year and in the course of the traveller's business he goes down to Nenagh to sell the company's wares and travels in the company's car.  He has to have the company's car to go down to Nenagh.  When he has finished his business in Nenagh and has had his tea, on a fine summer evening, he decides to go and play a game of golf and he drives the company's car out to the golf course.</P>
      <P>As this section is phrased an assessment has to be made on him for the proportion of the car's expenses driving out to the golf course in Nenagh, because the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; is there. He has the car for the purpose of the company's business.  He must have it for the company's business but he is not going out to play golf that evening on the company's business and it seems absurd to suggest that he must operate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No, &ldquo;supplies or services provided for the director or employee and used solely in performing the duties of his office or employment&rdquo;. That is not restricted to business premises, it is &ldquo;in any of its business premises,&rdquo;.  It refers particularly to its accommodation, or perhaps, on this occasion the Minister will agree with Deputy Haughey's interpretation and not with mine.  Supposing that my interpretation of the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; is wrong and this does apply to business premises only, then I can conceive an exactly similar performance in relation to business premises.  We go back to our country shop and the back parlour. A person has a chair there to sit on, waiting patiently for a customer to come in to the front of the shop. Because it is not in the business premises if a chair is bought to sit on and rest on&mdash;or even in the business premises but is not for the business concern&mdash;it will cover the same thing.</P>
      <P>I confess that I put this amendment down believing that the business premises referred to accommodation and I am thinking in terms of services in relation to travelling.  Quite clearly what should be the law is that if a person has to have a car to travel around the country on business, and happens to be in a country town when business hours are finished, he should not be in the situation of having to clock up a proportion of his time as being pleasure and to go down for tax assessment.</P>

      <P>Am I correct in my recollection that the Minister said in his introduction to the previous amendment that he differentiated between the transfer of a house, or a motorcar, to an employee and the transfer of the user of the house or the motorcar to the employee?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only repeating what I thought the Minister said.  He said that the user of a house was not readily convertible into cash and was not liable to be taxed and that the same applies to a car.  If it becomes the property of the employee it becomes a service that is a benefit that can be converted into cash and is taxable, but if the company retains the ownership of the car, but gives the use of it to the employee, inasmuch as that is not readily convertible it is not taxed.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Sweetman's reference to Section 2, he must recognise that this is to exempt the director or employee under certain circumstances and only in a business premises.  If it were not in the Bill it might imply that a managing director supplied with an electric fire for his office might have that regarded as an amenity on which he would have to pay tax.  The same would apply to the employment of a typist and so on. This is put in to cover points of that kind, where he has accommodation, supplies and services on the premises itself and they are used, of course, solely in the performance of the duties of his office.  That would be exempt from tax.  When you read it that way the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; is necessary.</P>

The question arose on the issue of the use of ministerial cars.  The practice in England is that a British Minister can use a Government car if he is driving on Government business, and you have the absurd situation in which you will see a British Minister travelling half way down Whitehall to his office and then solemnly clambering out of the official car and getting into his private car, going around the corner to the Chelsea Flower Show, coming back and then clambering back into his official car.</P>
      <P>Both the Minister's Government and our Government examined this question. We came to the conclusion ultimately that unless you wanted Ministers to undergo a <i>crise de nerfs</i> day after day the only rational way of dealing with the situation was to say that if a Minister is granted the use of a State car, he can use it as if it were his own car while a Minister and when he ceases to be a Minister he cannot use it at all.  But we cannot put on any man the obligation of settling a case of conscience every time he steps into a ministerial car.  You are creating such a situation in regard to a man's everyday affairs by declaring that something shall be solely used for the purpose of his business and if it is used for any other purpose he is liable to be taxed.</P>
      <P>Is it seriously asked that if a man is dictating business letters in the morning and remembers half-way through the proceedings that he wants to pay the gas bill and asks his secretary to type an envelope and send a postal order to the Gas Company or to the E.S.B., he breaks the law if he does not return the typist's time as something that is taxable?  Is it seriously argued that if after business hours he is waiting to go to the theatre and puts his feet up, reads a novel and turns the electric radiator on to keep him warm between the time the office shuts and the time he goes to take his wife out, he is under a moral obligation to inform the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> I know the Minister is inclined, as any rational man would be, to regard these things as a <i>reductio ad absurdum.</i> Of course, they are.  But you have no right by law to create dilemmas every hour in the day about which conscientious people may have scruples.  I was reading to-day in the paper that a man laying bricks in Moscow has just become entitled as remainder man under the law in the City of Dublin.  He has announced that not only has he changed his surname but that he has a conscientious scruple about enjoying an income under the will or becoming the owner of any property.  People have a right to be scrupulous if they want.  They may be so conscientious that they may not reconcile themselves to minor infringements of the law.  I agree that you cannot expect the law to be drafted to meet the exceptional citizen, but you can demand that the law will be drafted in a form in which it is possible to conform to the law. We have no right to enact legislation here which is of a character that nobody can possibly conform to it no matter how anxiously they try.</P>
    <P>Again, I am putting it to the Minister that the evidence of these problems, as they arise here to-day, highlights the fact that this part of the Finance Bill is not the kind of legislation that ought to be undertaken by this House without adequate prior inquiry.  No Parliament in the world has done it.  Am I not right in that?  Legislation of this kind has been introduced elsewhere but in each case it has been consequent on the report of a Royal Commission or a corresponding body which has had power to send for people and documents and to take evidence.  We are trying to legislate without the benefit of that prior precaution. I am as certain we are doing wrong as I am that I am standing here.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly certain that out of this piece of legislation there will grow events in the forecasting of which Deputy Haughey's words are prophetic. Case after case will come to the Supreme Court for decision <i>ex post facto</i>, and if that happens it will be our fault because we shall then have <Col N="595" /> shoved over on to the unfortunate individual taxpayer the task of elucidating the meaning of the law by seeking interpretation from the courts at appalling expense and in the knowledge that the Minister, supported by the Revenue Commissioners' technical advice, is at this moment in direct conflict with his own colleague, Deputy Haughey&mdash;both of them, apparently, have given careful consideration to one aspect of this Part of the Bill&mdash;and that a person in Deputy Haughey's position would have a conscientious duty to advise a client to instruct counsel and go to the Supreme Court on that issue.  As far as I understand the situation, the Revenue Commissioners, having recommended this form of legislation to the Minister, would have a conscientious duty on their part to advise the Minister&mdash;I am wrong, they would have a duty not to advise the Minister but to go to the Supreme Court without reference to the Minister to try the matter out.  That appears to me to be wholly wrong.</P>
    <P>We ought to be in a position here to say that the law is as clear as it is possible for us to make it and, if there is any ambiguity in it, that between now and the Report Stage the Minister would insert whatever words were requisite to give clear expression to the purpose I had in mind.  We are not doing that and we are not able to do it because we do not know the conditions in which these sections will apply, and there is no means of finding out as we are at present situated.  We ought not to allow that situation to continue.  We ought either to set up a special committee of this House, which we can do under Standing Orders, and refer this part of the Bill to it, or we ought to refer it to the Income-Tax Commission and then legislate in the light of their report.</P>
    <P>Question: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendment negatived.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> In sub-section (3), page 14, line 18, to delete &ldquo;business&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with sub-section (3) of this section.  Sub-section (3) excludes from the operation of this section certain things provided they take place in business premises. The purpose of my amendment is to exclude those things if they take place in premises owned by the company concerned.  The sub-section appears&mdash; I use the word &ldquo;appears&rdquo; deliberately because it is a difficult sub-section&mdash;to exclude taxation on accommodation where there is a general practice in the trade to have certain people concerned in the type of business living on or adjacent to the place in which the trade is carried on.  As the section is phrased, it strikes me you cannot have any exclusion at all.  If you have living accommodation in portion of the business premises, when that accommodation is used for living then it is not business.  As it stands, it seems to me the sub-section is contradictory.</P>
    <P>We have discussed earlier on this section the position that arises in relation to living overhead in a shop.  Let us consider the case of a trade which requires constant tending.  In malting the temperature has to be maintained at the same level the whole time. Maltsters throughout the country always have someone living where the malting takes place because a continuous eye must be kept on the temperature. That is a practice that has gone on for a great number of years and, as far as I can understand, this section of the Bill, it is a practice which the Minister purports to exclude under sub-section (3) from the penal assessment made in Section 22.  As I see it, the living accommodation in that case is not in the business premises.  It is either over them or adjacent to them, but it is not in them.  The business premises is the actual malt house.  So long as you leave the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; in line 18 this exclusion means nothing at all.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, what the Minister implies in the section&mdash;he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;is that where it is the custom of the trade to have a man living in, the value of that living in, because it is a custom of the trade, <Col N="597" /> would not be taken into account.  The trade must be carried on in business premises strictly so construed and I do not think the living accommodation would be so construed by a court as being part of the business premises in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is afraid that living accommodation near the business might not come under this.  If we were to agree to the amendment suggested by him, I am afraid that it would make it far too wide.  There is some difficulty.  The aim undoubtedly is, as the Deputy says, to exempt where a man lives on the business premises because it is the custom of the trade.</P>

Therefore, as the bank manager is paying no rent, the two sub-sections seem to me to be contradictory.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will at least sympathise with an uninstructed legislator who reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that, except where the reference is expressly to premises which include living accommodation, &lsquo;business premises&rsquo; does not include so much of any such premises as aforesaid as is used wholly or mainly as living accommodation for any of the directors of the body corporate or for any persons employed by the body corporate in any employment to which this Part of this Act applies.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I read that, it means that where the bank manager does bank business, that is, interviews his clients or passes cash across the counter, that part of the premises is business premises, but when he shuts the door and goes up the staircase which ordinarily adjoins the business premises, to the dining-room floor and to the bedrooms above it, it becomes the part of the building which is referred to in this Bill in lines 9, 10, 11 and 12 in Section 27 on page 17 in the following terms:&mdash;&ldquo;So much <Col N="599" /> of any such premises as aforesaid as is used wholly or mainly as living accommodation for any persons employed by the body corporate in any employment to which this Part of this Act applies.&rdquo; Yet the Minister, having looked at that, says that, in his judgment, that does not apply to a bank manager who lives above a bank.  If the Minister's interpretation is correct, then the words used in this section have a meaning which they have in no other context across which I have come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me Deputy Sweetman is right.  The proviso to Section 27 (1) says: &ldquo;except where the reference is expressly to premises which include living accommodation&rdquo;. The reference in Section 22 (3) is just such a reference because it is a reference to premises which include living accommodation.  Therefore, the living accommodation of the premises referred to in 22 (3) clearly comes within the proviso to 27 (1) and if it does&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;business premises&rsquo; does not include so much of any such premises as aforesaid...&rdquo;&mdash;Section 22 (3) is a clear contradiction.  It talks about living accommodation and business premises and as that is defined it is excluding that living accommodation.  I think that does bear further examination.</P>

      <P>Assuming the Minister's interpretation is correct it means that the bank manager will not be assessed but that the poor small shopkeeper across the road, who is in an infinitely worse financial position than he is and, in fact, has to wear rubber soled shoes in case the bank manager <Col N="600" /> would hear him going past the door, call him in and put him on the mat, will be assessed.  Surely that is the reverse of intelligent legislation.  We had a long discussion about the small shopkeeper who has turned himself into a company and runs a small confectionery shop and lives over the shop. The result of our discussion in that respect was that the Minister told us that he would be assessed on a proportionate Schedule A basis for his living accommodation and that he would have to pay income-tax on it.  The bank manager who lives in better premises over the bank will not, according to the Minister, be assessed.</P>

      <P>Take the case of a small company operating a grocery shop in Stradbally employing a person who is made a director of the firm, as the Minister knows, is commonly practised. He lives on the premises over the shop, and across the street the bank manager lives on the premises over the bank. The bank manager is not charged on any part of his income except his salary.  There is no fictional addition to his income for the purposes of income-tax in respect of the rental of the house in which he is living over the bank, but the manager of the grocery shop across the street who is a member of the board of directors of the small business, because he lives over the shop, has a fictional rental put upon the part of the premises in which he lives by the Revenue Commissioners which is added to his wages or salary and income-tax is levied upon him in respect of it.</P>
      <P>Do we mean to do that?  Is that the purpose of Dáil Éireann?  Do we think it is expedient, fair or desirable to do it?  We ought to clarify our minds on that.

At the moment&mdash;and this has been so for a long time&mdash;when a bank manager is living on the bank premises, he is <Col N="602" /> exempt from income-tax, as far as his housing accommodation is concerned.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This cock will not fight. The first person to mention the bank manager in this context was the Minister for Finance&mdash;that, in that case, clearly a bank manager would not be liable.  It was he who introduced that.  I do not know that bank managers are in any more affluent circumstances than their average customer.  The Minister is not so far removed from the county of his origin as not to know that, even in his lifetime, he has seen, in towns like Wexford and Enniscorthy, a change take place.  In his youth, 90 per cent. of the businessmen in both those places were proprietors: I do not think it would be an exaggeration to say that to-day more than 80 per cent. of them would be incorporated.  I believe that incorporation resulted&mdash;partially, in any case&mdash;on the advice tendered to them by their accountants, to meet modern conditions.</P>
      <P>It has been, and I think is still, the practice, and it is a good practice, a practice we should be concerned to encourage, where employees in a business in rural Ireland have been with that establishment or whatever it is, for the greater part of their lifetime, that one should say of such people, when they have been 25 or 30 years working in one place, that the time has come when they ought to be made directors.  It gives them a status, it gives them a security that they otherwise would not have.  As far as I can understand this legislation, if that preferment is given to them and if their ordinary terms of employment have traditionally consisted of a salary plus a right of residence on the premises, they are now to suffer a serious tax liability which they did not carry heretofore. I do not believe that was anticipated; I do not believe it was intended; I do not believe that is what Dáil Éireann wants to do; and I have the horrible feeling that we are being manoeuvred into a position in which, unless we are all prepared to stand up and cheer for that proposition, we are to be accused of engaging in political chicanery and manoeuvring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone who knows conditions in rural Ireland knows that a bank manager does not own a bank, that a bank manager is not a banker, that he is an <Col N="604" /> employee of a bank and is in no sense to be accepted as, in normal circumstances, more affluent than his businessmen customers.  No case is being made that the Minister favours the rich to the detriment of the poor.  The case being made is that this part of this Finance Bill is like a bull in a china shop: it is designed to abate abuses, but, in the process of controlling certain practices which nobody wants to see permanently enshrined or made sacrosanct, we are to knock about and harass and persecute a whole category of persons in rural Ireland who should not be subject to that kind of annoyance from their own Legislature.</P>
    <P>If the Minister says to me: &ldquo;Make proposals, then, to avoid that&rdquo;, my answer to him is that I am not able to do so, because I have not got at my disposal the information requisite for that purpose; but I will gladly collaborate with the Minister in doing it, if he will collaborate with me in getting the necessary information through either of the devices which I have proposed to him.</P>

      <P>We will have enough time between this and to-morrow.  I am glad to hear that the Minister is going to examine it, in the time available to him.  I find it difficult to understand exactly the significance of the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; there.  It seems to me that we have not discussed adequately at all the case of the premises. I instanced that of a maltster who has to be next to his malting, so as to be able to keep an eye continuously on the temperature.  Is it intended that the sub-section will cover the case of his living accommodation?  That accommodation is part of what the Minister and I might call &ldquo;The Maltings&rdquo; as we drive by.  Is it the business premises <Col N="605" /> or is it not?  As the sections stands, I am inclined to think it is not, and that literally &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; there means nothing more than if I rig up a camp bed on my office floor and when half-past nine in the morning comes I fold up my bed, hide it away and then that place becomes my office.  I do not think that is what the Minister intends, but there is a possibility that the section could be so interpreted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret having to raise this matter so late at night, but having regard to the nature of the Minister's answers to my Parliamentary Question and my supplementary questions to-day, I have no option.</P>
      <P>I am not basing this case on argument but on facts, and because it is necessary to show the facts I think it essential to say now that the Minister is already aware, through his Department, of my efforts to draw attention to these facts.  In my opinion, caretakers have not been getting even the agricultural rate appropriate to Group C which applies to most of the country. If it is the practice of the Minister for Defence to decide that such caretakers are to be paid in accordance with the minimum agricultural wages rate in all areas, one would imagine that these men would not be paid less than the minimum rate for men doing comparable work.  In fact, in basing the rate of pay to be given to these men in such a way, the Department is condoning a practice which automatically has as its foundation in the fact that the agricultural rate is based on what the poorest farmer in each area can give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I ask the Minister if it is the policy of the Department of Defence to say to caretakers in different areas that the rate will be only the rate which the poorest farmers in these areas can give?  I am sure the Minister must be aware that in all these areas it is true to say that the farmers are paying a higher rate than the minimum prescribed <Col N="606" /> by the Agricultural Wages Board, the rate tied down by the Minister's policy.  The policy of the Minister for Agriculture is such that any man working on a State farm is not alone getting a higher rate than the minimum prescribed by the Agricultural Wages Board but a rate higher than paid by the farmers in the area. It is wrong to suggest than the agricultural workers employed on State farms are doing more technical work than workers on other farms.  That is not true.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Department of Agriculture would seem to show that the Department is a good employer, but that policy does not seem to extend to the Department of Defence. In the Department of Lands there is the same policy as in the Department of Agriculture, and I am sure the Minister knows as I know that the rates paid by the Department of Lands to forestry workers are much higher than the minimum prescribed under the Agricultural Wages Board.  May I then ask if it is suggested that these caretakers are to get less than the lowest possible rate as defined by law?</P>
    <P>Apparently the Minister believes&mdash; we differ, of course&mdash;that these caretakers cannot be considered to be agricultural workers.  How are they classified?  They are not glorified caretakers with no work to do.  I know the areas of which I speak and I know areas outside Cork.  I know the conditions of employment of these caretakers and I know that they include a certain amount of work to be carried out by the caretakers.  Part of that work includes, not only cleaning in relation to buildings, but cutting grass, removal of noxious weeds and cleaning footpaths.  Surely that could not be classified as industrial work?  If it is not, I would like to know what it is.  I cannot find out.</P>
    <P>I tried to work on the type of insurance stamp given to these workers. The Minister may say it is an industrial stamp but again we differ because of the amount deducted from the men's wages.  I can give concrete proof of a case in point.  The agricultural wages rate in Cork for Group B is £5 per week less 1/7 for stamp.  I think we <Col N="607" /> would be entitled to say then that a caretaker in that area should get £5 less insurance stamp.  But he is not getting that.  One caretaker in that area gets £4 17s. 6d. less 1/- for light and insurance and his net wages appear to be £4 14s. 8d.  If the wage rate is based on the agricultural rate in the area, the employee of the Department of Defence is not getting even that agricultural rate.</P>
    <P>As the Minister seems determined to adhere to the rate paid by the Agricultural Wages Board, it would be well to state clearly what that rate is.  The rate fixed in the Group B area is £5, less insurance stamp, for a 50-hour week, but in the case of the employees of the Department of Defence the caretakers are paid less than the agricultural rate, and not for a 50-hour week but for what we may call a timeless week because, while they may not be called on duty, the fact is that under the terms of their employment they must be available any time in the 24 hours of every day of the seven days of the week.  Yet the Minister tells us they are being paid the agricultural rate.</P>
    <P>If that were true, these men should be getting more than they actually get &mdash;which is less than the minimum rate for agricultural workers&mdash;because they are working so much more than a 50-hour week.  Surely that disposes of the Minister's claim that these employees are being treated fairly in being paid the rate fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board in the areas in which they work.  Furthermore, if we are to base a claim on the Department of Lands in that area in County Cork, the wage rate for these workers&mdash;for the lesser number of hours, of course&mdash; is £5 10s.</P>
    <P>Surely it must be admitted either that the Minister is wrong in suggesting that these men are getting even a minimum or else that he is unaware of the fact.  I can quote a letter from the Minister's Department which may perhaps throw a little light on this subject. The reference number is 2/96468 and the letter, which came from the Minister's office, is dated 2nd December, 1954.  For the Minister's benefit, I shall read this short letter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" />&ldquo;I am desired by the Minister for Defence to refer further to your letter of the 14th July, 1954, regarding&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;an employee&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;who is employed in a civilian capacity under this Department as civilian caretaker of military lands ...and to state that arrangements are now being made for the payment to this employee with effect from the 29th October, 1954, of an allowance of 14/- per week over his basic rate. Payment of this allowance will, however, be subject to review in the event of any reduction in the present area of lands&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;in question.  That shows that, in one instance alone, the Minister in 1954 realised that an employee was being paid a lower wage rate and was not being treated fairly.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Minister.  Perhaps his answer, which, in my opinion, was not correct, was not meant as such.  I do not believe he would wish to mislead in relation to his reply.  It is a pity that, when preparing his reply for to-day, such information was not available to him.</P>
    <P>It was admitted by the Minister's predecessor on 2nd December, 1954, that the basic agricultural wage rate in regard to a caretaker was not sufficient, in view of the fact that he was working so much more&mdash;seven days a week&mdash;than the employee who was governed by the Agricultural Wages Board rate.  I do not wish to labour this fact.  I would be satisfied if the Minister would indicate he is prepared to examine the whole situation.  I would hope for that and wish for that. If that should be the case, perhaps the Minister would realise it is very bad for the Department of Defence to be out of line with the policy of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that these caretakers have certain advantages in the way of housing and light.  He knows that I know that they are being charged for light.  He may say they have the advantage of housing.  I can answer that by saying that if caretakers were not using some of the houses in our forts, the houses would <Col N="609" /> become derelict.  It is an advantage to the Department of Defence and to the Minister for Defence that at least one of these houses is occupied and kept in proper repair and condition by an employee of the Department.</P>
    <P>Should the Minister still draw attention to the housing accommodation available, I can reply that, in the case of a local authority worker in these areas, as well as getting approximately £1 per week more, as well as the employee of the Department of Lands working in forestry getting approximately £1 a week more in most instances of local authority houses, each is costing in these cases roughly 1/- or 1/6 a week.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to examine that situation and, in particular, to consider why it was estimated by his predecessor that one caretaker was entitled to an allowance of 14/- per week over his basic rate because of the extra hours worked by him.  If it is so in one case, the entire position requires reconsideration.  The number of these employees is small and a favourable review of their position will not break the Department or the Government, no matter what Government is in office.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's predecessor was right to give an extra 14/- a week to a caretaker under such conditions and circumstances, I wish that the Minister's approach would be such that, after closer examination, he would follow in the footsteps of his predecessor which, in this instance, would help the employees concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to review the wages of all caretakers in the various barracks, forts or other establishments under his control.  From my information and from what I know, they are very badly paid.  Now that the matter has been brought to the Minister's attention, I have no doubt that he will review these wages which in some cases are £4 10s. 0d. and £4 12s. 6d. per week and see that justice is done to these men and their families.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply to-day, the wages paid to barrack caretakers have been fixed for some considerable <Col N="610" /> time in accordance with the minimum rates laid down from time to time for agricultural workers by the Agricultural Wages Board.  That has been the case since the wages were fixed in 1947, which was just after the Emergency period.  These wages were fixed by an inter-departmental wages advisory committee and, in fixing them, they had regard to what other workers in the areas were paid.</P>
      <P>In spite of what Deputy Desmond has said, nobody who really knows what these caretakers have to do could regard their duties as very onerous. I suppose it was for that reason that it was decided to relate their wages to the minimum rate recommended by the Agricultural Wages Board.  When I answered to-day, in reply to a statement by Deputy Desmond to the effect that these people were in fact doing agricultural labourers' work, I took it that what Deputy Desmond meant to convey was that they were working on the land, the same as farm labourers. I now see he had something different in mind.  I did not mean to convey that they were doing industrial work. While the wages are low, they are not quite as low as Deputy Desmond and Deputy T. Lynch would have us believe because there is the perquisite of free quarters.  A deduction is made in respect of that perquisite, but it is very small.  In Dublin county borough and county, and in the urban district of Bray, the deduction is 3/- per week and in other areas, 2/6 per week.  I have made a rough calculation of the effect of that in regard to a caretaker employed here in the Dublin area, and I find that the wages paid to him, allowing for the perquisite of a free house, would be roughly equivalent to a wage of £7 a week being received by a man living in a house in one of the new housing estates on the outskirts of the city, who had to travel into the city to his work.</P>
      <P>I am not endeavouring to say that these people are highly paid, but I just want to point out that this perquisite of free quarters is a consideration and, when a realistic value is attached to that, and it is added to the wage, they are not as badly paid as Deputy Desmond and Deputy Lynch made out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> With regard to the specific case mentioned by Deputy Desmond in which an increase was given, that was given, as the letter said, because of extra duties which had to be performed in that case.  The mere fact that the Miniter at that time awarded this increase in one specific case is, I think, definite proof of it.  I have been exhorted to follow in that Minister's footsteps, but I am quite sure he, at that time, investigated other cases and decided, that, while there was good cause for awarding the increase in this specific case, there was not the same reason in others.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to say that I agree these people are not paid very high wages and I will undertake to examine the position to see what can be done.  However, I am not giving an assurance that there will in fact be any increase, because I have to have regard to the nature of the work done by them and to the wages paid generally. <Col N="612" /> There has to be some differential between caretakers and other workers employed by the Department who do work of a more onerous and, possibly, more skilled nature.  I have not gone into that question yet, but I will look into it and see if, without doing away with the differential between different clases of workers, something can be done to increase these people's wages.</P>
    <P>My information about the wages paid to agricultural workers on State farms is in accordance with the reply I gave to Deputy Desmond's supplementary question to-day, that is: the reason they are paid in excess of the minimum rate is that the quality of work done by them is looked upon as being higher than that of the normal agricultural worker.  In conclusion, all I can say is that I shall look into the question.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 25th June, 1958.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state the weekly rate of wages required as at mid-May, 1958, to equal (a) the farm workers' wages and (b) the dairy workers' wages paid by the Portrane Mental Hospital, County Dublin, with effect from 28th May, 1956.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is phrased in somewhat ambiguous terms.  If he means what rates of wages, in the case of the employees mentioned, would correspond at mid-May, 1958 to those paid since the end of May, 1956, due allowance being made for the increase in the meantime in the cost-of-living index figure, the answer is £6 9s. 1d. and £7 0s. 0d. a week respectively.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate, however, that the adjustment of wage rates by reference solely to the cost-of-living index figure and without regard to the many other important considerations which have to be taken into account in determining such rates would be highly inflationary and would lead ultimately to reduced standards of living and to increased unemployment. The recognition of this principle by industrial employers and workers generally was an underlying factor of the national wages agreement arrived at in September, 1957.</P>
