There was disagreement and the Vote was called.  Deputy <Col N="315" /> Dillon objected to the Vote being taken.  He called a division and then it was found it was too late to take a division as it was after 10.30.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind what the Minister said.  I am only concerned with what the House decides.  The Minister has the idea that he can run this House and everybody in it.  No Minister has the right to presume that. It is normal if the Minister asks the House to agree that two Estimates be taken together and it is sometimes allowed to be done but I really submit that if the Minister says: &ldquo;I am going to take two Estimates together&rdquo; and nobody objects that is not a binding decision of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite common practice for a Minister to address the House on his main Estimate and have the other Estimates called one after the other and very frequently a very short debate takes place on one of the minor Estimates.  I opened the debate last night by saying &ldquo;No, no, no&rdquo; and that concluded the proceedings.  I now want to resume&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait now; I am making a point of order.  Stay sitting down now.  The Minister manifestly thinks he has a right to trample on the House if he wants to, but I am claiming the right of debate in the House, no more than that, and I confidently look to you, a Cheann Comhairle, to keep the Minister in his place so that he will submit to the ordinary ordeal that every Minister has to submit to, and that is free debate in this House even when the Minister does not like it.</P>

      <P>In the course of my opening remarks on the External Affairs Estimates I first of all moved the motion for the Vote on External Affairs and then I moved the Vote for International Co-operation.  I moved both motions.  At the conclusion of the debate, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle called on the Minister to conclude.  I concluded, and when I had concluded the Leas-Cheann Comhairle put the motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am putting the Vote now.</P>

      <P>So far as the Book of Estimates is concerned, very little need be said as to the method of arriving at the amount to be provided for broadcasting each year and of showing it in the book as these two matters have by now become well established and have taken a routine form.  Briefly, the amount in sub-head A is equal to the estimated receipts from licence and sponsored programme fees, with a small additional amount for other receipts. The sum, which amounts to £529,000 this year, is used for programme operation. In sub-head B, provision is made for the purchase of equipment and the sum, which is defrayed by the Exchequer outside the fees, is arrived at each year in consultation between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  For the coming year, the amount provided specifically for equipment in the B sub-head has had to be curtailed to £1,000 because of the general need for economy in expenditure.</P>
      <P>The receipts from licence fees estimated at £429,000 represents an increase of £9,000 on the Estimate for the previous year, which is a much smaller increase than used to take place in former years.  The number of licences is of course approaching the maximum ever likely to be reached.  The receipts from sponsored programme fees have settled down at a fairly steady figure of a little over £90,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although this Estimate covers only sound broadcasting, I think Deputies will expect me to make a reference to the newer medium of television which is at present the subject of a good deal of public discussion. The general public, who are the potential viewers, are showing a very good sense of proportion in this matter.  They are not pressing for the <Col N="321" /> early setting up of Irish television because they are aware of the formidable financial problem involved in it.  On the other hand, general proposals have been made by some groups to be permitted to establish and operate television in Ireland as a commercial venture.</P>
    <P>Inherently, there must be a difference of outlook in television between commercial operators and public service operators.  The commercial concern must aim at the largest audience at the lowest cost that will hold them.  A public service administration is expected to provide programmes that will portray national character or provide for national needs&mdash;say, national dramatic productions or programmes in the Irish language&mdash;although generally they are of the more expensive type and some at least have only minority audience.  We have, therefore, the problem of trying to reconcile the financial and commercial interest with the public interest requirements.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Government has appointed a commission of distinguished people with widely divergent interests to assist us in arriving at a solution of this complex problem. I have formally opened the proceedings of the commission and the members have now settled down to work.  I know the Government and the country will be grateful to them if they can propose an arrangement which will safeguard our national dignity and culture in our television service, while giving to the commercial interests their rightful opportunity of a reasonable return for any money they may invest in a television project.</P>
    <P>This is all I propose to say about television for the moment and I shall turn to the service of Radio Éireann for which this Vote is being provided.</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree with me that the standard of the national broadcasting service is high and has shown continuing improvement within the limitations of its resources.  Radio Éireann is now doing more enterprising programmes and is attracting a greater proportion of Irish listeners.</P>
    <P>From the past year's activities, one might easily select examples of the sort of programme which, a few years ago, Radio Éireann would scarcely <Col N="322" /> have been able to undertake, at least with such frequency.  I allude to, for instance, the Lourdes Centenary Year programmes, which are not yet concluded, and for which a team of three officers took a specially designed recording van to Lourdes.  There is the crop of new programmes from the new centre in Cork, which are offering a pleasant element of variety in the general schedules.  Again, for the Tercentenary of Father Luke Wadding, O.F.M., Radio Éireann, in addition to finding many programmes at home, sent its own commentator to Rome.</P>
    <P>In sport, commentators went to Cardiff, Wembley, Manchester and New York to bring international games to Irish listeners.  As a particularly striking example of what increased resources have enabled Radio Éireann to do, I might mention the very extensive coverage for its own programmes and for those of the B.B.C. provided in connection with the meetings in Dublin of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting has unique and powerful advantages as a medium for the diffusion of the Irish language, whether this be done to serve the people of the Gaeltacht or to spread the language in the rest of the country; and Radio Éireann programmes offer striking instances of the employment of this resource.  The currach races of Tóstal-time, which are the Gaeltacht people's own achievement, and which bring great numbers from all the Gaeltacht areas to meet in competition&mdash; these are given ample coverage every year.  Mobile-recording teams go to every Gaeltacht area, on mainland and island, to carry back to the studio microphones the stories, songs, instrumental music and debates of An Rinn, Aran, Rann na Feirsde, Cúl Aodha and Dún Chuinn.</P>
    <P>The latest example is the Gaeltacht magazine programme, &ldquo;Meascra Muimhneach,&rdquo; which comes from the new Cork centre, and in &ldquo;Fadhbanna Gaeilge,&rdquo; a weekly discussion feature, native speakers who have added scholarship to initial mastery of the spoken language, try to solve the problems of listeners who are interested in the finer points of Irish speech <Col N="323" /> and writing.  Finally, I do not overlook such continuing enterprise as the Thomas Davis Lectures&mdash;I am glad to see that the important series on St. Patrick has now been given the permanence of print&mdash;the public concerts given by the symphony orchestra in Dublin and elsewhere, and the collaboration by Radio Éireann that has made possible the successful opera seasons in Dublin and Wexford.</P>
    <P>Now, however, that we are preparing for a new Irish television service, we must look carefully at our national sound broadcasting service and make sure that it will be equipped to do its part of the job that we expect sound broadcasting and television together to do for the country in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that however much faith we may place in Irish television, there can be no question of abandoning or neglecting Irish sound broadcasting. Even in the countries where television is most highly developed, sound broadcasting is still flourishing and great effort and considerable expense are being devoted to it.  In Britain, for instance, where television is within range of 98 per cent. of the population, the importance of sound broadcasting is still considered to be so great that heavy expenditure has been undertaken in the last few years to provide coverage by the new method of very high frequency transmission, so as to compensate for the deterioration of medium-wave reception.</P>
    <P>The broadcasting service there has changed but has not been diminished: the changes have been criticised in England, but the fact remains that there are still three separate programmes broadcast and there has been no reduction in broadcasting hours.  In the United States too, where television is even more highly developed than in Britain, sound broadcasting has changed but still flourishes, and sales of sound receivers still rise.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, we cannot expect television to replace sound broadcasting. Even when the television service becomes nation-wide, we cannot hope that everybody who now has a broadcast receiver will be able to have a television set, which must always be <Col N="324" /> more expensive.  Nor is it likely that Irish television will for a long time be able to do all that Radio Éireann has tried to do in the way of reflecting all aspects of national activity all over the country and encouraging Irish writers, musicians, speakers and actors. Television programmes are very much more expensive to produce than sound programmes&mdash;the overall cost of an hour of television in England is about six times the cost of an hour of sound broadcasting&mdash;and the complications of producing them are very much greater, Consequently, even countries very much richer than ours have to import a large proportion of their television programmes so that the high production costs can, as far as possible, be shared out among several users.  The less rich the country, the smaller is the proportion of programmes produced locally, and of primarily local interest.</P>
    <P>Television is an incomparable medium for conveying entertainment and information, but it encounters far more practical difficulties than does sound broadcasting in its choice of things that it can convey.  Outside broadcasts in television, even from Dublin theatres and concert halls, would involve very expensive equipment, great preparatory labour, and a considerable number of highly-trained technical staff.  Some small-scale studio programmes can be produced fairly simply and relatively cheaply, but, of course, the temptation for a small-scale service is always to take ready-made programmes from other television services, or ready-made films.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that an Irish television service can hardly set out to replace sound broadcasting and do the job that Radio Éireann is trying to do now.  We shall still need our national sound broadcasting service, not merely for those who cannot get television or cannot afford television sets, but also for those who have television, to bring them what television inevitably cannot bring.  Looking objectively at our present broadcasting service, one can see that in spite of any progress it has made in the last few years, it is still badly under-equipped for the work it ought to do.</P>
    <P>I think Radio Éireann is the only <Col N="325" /> national broadcasting service in Europe that has no broadcasting building but depends for its studios on scattered makeshifts: converted offices in the General Post Office, two halls in Dublin, neither of which was designed for broadcasting, and only two studios that were built as broadcasting studios.</P>
    <P>I do not think either that there is any other national broadcasting service that has not even one alternative programme but broadcasts only a single programme and that for only part of the day.  There is simply not room in this single, limited programme for all that Radio Éireann wants to do, and should be doing, for all its listeners with all their varying tastes, with all types of music and speech in both Irish and English.</P>
    <P>Worst of all&mdash;this single programme cannot even be adequately heard over the whole country.  Although we have installed three new transmitters in the last five years, our transmissions can no longer compete successfully in the more remote areas with the ever-increasing interference from stations abroad.  The same situation applies in many other countries, and by common consent they are resorting to very high frequency transmission as the only means of giving good reception of their own programmes to their own people. Very high frequency transmission supplies the answer, but of course it is expensive as a complete new network of transmitters is required.  To embark on this system would be a formidable undertaking, but I think we cannot indefinitely permit a situation in which residents in parts of County Wexford, for instance, are getting or will soon get three British sound programmes on very high frequency and two British television programmes, whilst they cannot listen satisfactorily to Radio Éireann at night.</P>
    <P>I have dwelt rather fully on the deficiencies in Radio Éireann's present resources in order that we may not forget all about sound broadcasting when the excitements of television come in.  You will see that to provide a studio building and a new transmission system would involve heavy expenditure over and above the proceeds of the present licence fees and <Col N="326" /> the fees for sponsored programmes. That money is not available at the present time when there are so many other calls upon the public purse for vital and immediate things.</P>
    <P>It is one of the burdens we have put on the new commission to recommend the relations that should exist between a television service and the Radio Éireann sound broadcasting service. We hope that the deliberations of the commission will help us in considering how the deficiencies.  I have mentioned from which Radio Éireann is still suffering can best be overcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, first of all, on behalf of not only this Party but, I am sure, the Opposition and the House as a whole, that we were all extremely sorry to hear of the illness of the Minister, and I would ask the acting-Minister to convey to him our hopes for his most speedy recovery? Deputy Ormonde had not been Minister for very long before he had to absent himself and we hope he will soon be back among us again.</P>
      <P>I must confess that I found the speech of the Minister difficult to follow in certain circumstances, that is to say, if I was not aware that the Government do not know their own mind about anything.  But it really does seem that we are going beyond the beyonds when the Minister cannot remember for five pages of his speech &mdash;and may I think him for his courtesy in circulating his speech?&mdash;to be consistent. The Minister somewhere about page 2 of his statement, having referred to the inception of the Television Commission, said that that was all he was going to say about television. He forgot his own policy to such an extent that practically all the rest of his speech covered nothing but television.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances in which the commission has just been set up, I do not propose to dwell at any length on the television aspect.  I would have liked the Minister to give us something more definite in terms of actual £.s.d. as to the likely cost of such a service, both in relation to capital cost and in relation to maintenance.  The Minister did mention that it was about six times that of sound.</P>

      <P>In Britain.  I do not know whether that figure referred to capital cost or to programme production cost.  It would help the House and the general public to appreciate and understand the problem, if some more detailed figures were given.  I am sure the Minister and his Department have costings for a television service, both capital and production costings, not merely for Britain but for America and other countries as well.  Had that information been available to the House, it would have been of assistance.</P>
      <P>I take it from the last observations made by the Minister that there is no immediate plan for dealing with the new buildings on the Stillorgan Road. When I was over on that side of the House, I have a recollection of Deputies on this side saying that there was only one thing needed to get that building going and the proper facilities made available, and that was to get rid of Deputy Sweetman and his colleagues and put them over here. Apparently, the position now is that that was just another of the gross misrepresentations by Fianna Fáil during the election campaign and here in this House.  Indeed, we shall soon reach the situation in which it will be impossible to catalogue these misrepresentations because they are so numerous.</P>
      <P>In relation to broadcasting generally, I am a bad person to give an opinion because I listen very infrequently.  I may listen to the news, to &ldquo;To-day in the Dáil&rdquo; and occasionally to sporting events, and it would not be fair, therefore, for anyone to take my listening experience as typical of what is required.  I will say, however, that during the past three or four years, and even during the past year, despite the fact that we have the Government we have, I have heard less criticism of Radio Éireann than I heard in bygone years.  That may be due to improvements that have been effected by the Radio Council.  I cannot say whether or not that is so, because I have not sufficient knowledge, but the fact remains that I have heard far less criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Radio Council and <Col N="328" /> Radio Éireann generally, the main significant event during the year was the disgraceful behaviour of Deputy Neal Blaney when he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Perhaps even more disgraceful was the attitude adopted by the Taoiseach in promoting Deputy Blaney for his misbehaviour. So far as I am concerned, I accept without question that any Minister is at any time entitled to criticise any body, voluntary or otherwise, or council set up to deal with any aspect of affairs connected with his Department. That is the prerogative of a Minister and it is in the public interest that he should have that right.  It is equally vital, however, that, before there is any criticism in public of any body, particularly a body doing voluntary work, the people affected should be given an opportunity in private of hearing the Minister's views and of answering them before the Minister holds them up to public odium.  The manner in which Deputy Blaney so far forgot himself was most reprehensible, most unfair to the Radio Council and was only exceeded by the manner in which, contrary to the public interest, such a gross breach of public faith was commended by the Taoiseach in promoting Deputy Blaney to the higher Department of Local Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this Estimate is entirely different from the debate we have had on other Votes inasmuch as we cannot express a Party view on many of the aspects of broadcasting and we are, therefore, confined to expressing personal views.  I should like to join with Deputy Sweetman in asking the Minister to convey, on behalf of my Party, our very good wishes for the speedy recovery of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  As Deputy Sweetman has said, he was only a very short time here as Minister, but I think everybody will agree that he was one of the most approachable Ministers, both publicly and privately. That was different from the treatment we have got from many Ministers here, particularly in relation to answers to questions and in debate generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I say to the Minister who has introduced this Estimate this morning <Col N="329" /> how refreshingly different it has been to hear him introducing this Estimate as compared with the treatment meted out to the House by the Minister for External Affairs?  At least the acting-Minister in this instance gave views and made comments on the activities of Radio Éireann and the possibility or probability of television in the near future, so unlike the disgraceful treatment of the House by the Minister for External Affairs on his Estimate.</P>
    <P>There is not much one can say on television at this stage.  Neither is it desirable, since the Minister and the Government have appointed a very representative commission to inquire into the possibility of television.  It seems to me that that commission will be meeting for a very long time to come because the terms of reference are such, and in some cases so contradictory, that it will take them a long time to make recommendations in accordance with the desires or wishes of the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>It seems from the action of the Minister in setting up the commission and from his comments this morning that it will be a long time before we can have a television station here.  Deputy Blaney, when Minister, did great harm by some of the comments he made about television.  A few weeks after his appointment, he went to some northern county and gave the impression that television was right around the corner.  I would not be so much concerned about the viewing public as I would be about the traders.  I can honestly say from my own knowledge that traders have approached me to ask when was the television station to be established because they were interested in stocking their shops. They continued asking for months until we had a reasonable and sane statement from Deputy Ormonde, who replaced Deputy Blaney as Minister. Only then did they realise that television was not the urgent necessity Deputy Blaney told the country it was. Consequently, they were not as concerned about stocking their shops with television sets and accessories.  Deputy Blaney did a great deal of harm, but, thank God, that has now been repaired and there is a sane and logical approach to the question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> Many people must wonder if television will be a blessing or the contrary. We can control the censorship of books and films, but unfortunately we have no control over the two television programmes we get at present from stations in Britain.  To say the least of it, if we had control, some of them should be banned.  They are certainly a source of corruption to many of our young people.  I do not say that young people deliberately seek out these programmes, but parents have discovered that when certain plays and programmes are on from these stations, the television set just has to be turned off.  That is no blame to the Minister and I do not know what he can do about it.  I think I would be safe in assuming that if we had an Irish television station, we would have programmes that would not offend anybody, young or old.</P>
    <P>As far as Radio Éireann itself is concerned, I do not propose to change the line I have taken in the House ever since I became a member.  I am always prepared to give full credit and as much praise as I can to Radio Éireann. As I said, this is not a Vote like Industry and Commerce, Social Welfare or Agriculture which can be judged as it stands.  When people come to talk about Radio Éireann, there immediately comes to mind Radio Luxembourg, the B.B.C.  Light Programme, the Third Programme and the various other programmes available on the dial.  We have to appreciate that our resources are very much limited, and particularly so as far as Radio Éireann is concerned.  They, above all, have to cut their cloth according to their measure.  They have only a certain amount of money at their disposal, but it must be agreed that, with the resources they have, the programmes presented are very acceptable.</P>
    <P>I do not say that every single programme is acceptable to everybody every time.  For instance, I cannot bear céilidhe music.  It is described as a form of culture, but I cannot listen to it.  That does not necessarily mean I would like to see it abolished entirely. I am sure the majority of people in the House like it, though I do not.  I do not condemn Radio Éireann for that reason.  I like the majority of programmes <Col N="331" /> and the Director, staff, Comhairle and artistes are to be highly complimented on the productions from Radio Éireann during the year.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word about the sponsored programmes.  The Director has some control over all the programmes, apart from the sponsored programmes.  I should like to know has he any control over sponsored programmes. There are some very admirable sponsored programmes, but I do not want to mention a whole lot of names.  However, I should like to mention particularly the Irish Hospitals Sweepstake programme, which is an admirable programme.  But in some of the other sponsored programmes we get a very bad type of music.  We get that from 1 o'clock until 2.30, with a break in between for the news and topical talk.  While I would not ask the Minister or the Director to impose a strict form of censorship, at least they ought to demand a certain standard.  I know there are people in this country who want to hear skiffle groups and that we have many rock 'n' roll fans; but I do not think the public in general want that type of programme.  If people want skiffle groups, rock 'n' roll and hot music, there are many other stations on the dial to which they can turn.  I have no objection to their likes and dislikes in respect of music, but Radio Éireann, at least, should demand a certain standard in musical and other programmes.</P>
    <P>I have asked here on previous occasions that the lunch-time programme commence at 12.30.  I did so for a very good reason.  The majority of workers, certainly in the provincial towns, go home to their lunch at 12.30.  They arrive home about 20 minutes to one.  They take 20 minutes or half an hour for their lunch and go back again to the job.  I do not see what advantage there is for them to have the lunch-time programme start at one o'clock.  Another stupid thing about the lunch-time programme is to have it continue until 2.30.  What sort of listening public is there from about a quarter to two until 2.30?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>She could not care less about Radio Éireann at that stage.  I have raised this matter many times and never got a satisfactory answer. The Minister should inquire into the possibility of having the lunch-time programme commence at 12.30 and if they want to continue until two o'clock or 2.30, well and good.  In the rural areas, the experience is the same. Most rural workers have a lunch-time break from 12.30 to 1.30 and they derive no advantage from having a programme commencing at 1 o'clock.</P>
      <P>There is another matter I wish to raise.  I know it is not a function of the Minister, but I am sure matters brought up during this debate are taken notice of by the Director and the Comhairle.  It is that greater use ought to be made of the Radio Éireann Light Orchestra.  I referred already to skiffle groups and rock 'n' roll.  Maybe I am getting old.  The Minister mentioned the symphony orchestra.  I am told that one has to be educated in listening to the symphony orchestra. I do not think the majority of Members could endure the symphony orchestra for a whole hour.</P>
      <P>We get too much of the symphony orchestra and not enough of the light orchestra.  All praise and credit to the symphony orchestra.  What the Minister said is right as far as the symphony orchestra is concerned, that they have co-operated and helped to a very large extent in making successful the musical festival in Wexford and the operatic season in Dublin.  It caters for a certain type of person.  But, if we want, and I think our intention should be, to try to get people away from canned music, hot music, real jazz music to decent music, the proper medium is the Radio Éireann Light Orchestra.  One cannot go from bread to caviare with one quick jump.  If it is the desire of the Minister and the Comhairle to get people to appreciate and enjoy reasonably good music, not heavy music, it ought to be done through the medium of an orchestra such as the light orchestra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been noted, at least since we have known him as a Minister, <Col N="333" /> as a staunch supporter of the Irish language.  He has made certain changes in the Department of Defence in that respect and to-day he referred to the use of the Irish language on the radio.  I hope that at some time in the future we can have a full and frank discussion in this House on the question of the revival of the Irish language, so that, as I have said in another debate, we can try to get some common front on that subject.</P>
    <P>I do not think Radio Éireann does as much as it could do to help the Irish language.  I say this, as one who lives in the Pale.  If it is true that Radio Éireann devotes a great deal of time to programmes in the Irish language, it is equally true that these programmes are entirely for the benefit of those who know the language well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that I do not know any Irish; I know some Irish. I have tried to listen to even the news in the Irish language and some of the other Irish programmes, and I have not a clue.  I am not particularly stupid as far as Irish is concerned, as I got quite an amount of it in school and can converse in the language in a kind of way.  Radio Éireann does nothing for me or people like me, as far as the advancement of the language is concerned.  If there could be simpler programmes and if the speaker did not assume that we all knew the language fluently, we would get on much better. If the speaker spoke more slowly and repeated phrases in a different way and plugged these phrases, there would be some advancement.  The Irish programmes that I have listened to are merely for the benefit of those people who are fluent in the language or who are resident in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>People have different tastes and likes.  Some people come to me and say: &ldquo;Why do you not raise in the Dáil the question of this programme and have it on more frequently,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Why not have this other programme scrapped?&rdquo; That probably would not represent the viewpoint of the general public and, therefore, I do not advocate such things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the bad reception <Col N="334" /> of Radio Éireann in Wexford at night.  I have been in the Dáil for 13 years and this question has been mentioned by Ministers for 13 years and there does not seem to be an improvement. I am informed that West Cork or some parts of Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;are in the same predicament, that it is practically impossible to hear Radio Éireann well at night.  The Minister mentioned it, but did not suggest that anything would be done or that it was possible that anything could be done.  I was rather amused at the way in which he mentioned it.  He seemed to begrudge us the very good reception we had of the British sound programmes and television programmes.  Of course, such is not the case.  The Minister, through his engineers, should make a special effort to ensure that Radio Éireann will be well received at night in Wexford because the most important programmes are on at night&mdash;the news, sports results, musical programmes and that type of programme.  We do not get them or, if we do get them, the reception is bad.</P>
      <P>Once again, I would ask the Minister to convey our good wishes to Deputy Ormonde and to convey to the Director and staff of Radio Éireann and the Comhairle our congratulations on the fine way, having regard to the circumstances, in which Radio Éireann has been run for the past 12 months.</P>

    <P>I should like to say that I agree with the other speakers who have said that the programmes on Radio Éireann have improved during the past year or two and that they are satisfied that those in charge are doing their best to improve the programmes and to produce more diversified programmes for people of various tastes, as an improvement on what we used to hear and criticise in the past.  It is indeed a pleasure to be able to say that every effort is being made, I believe, in that direction and that those in charge are taking steps to find out the public need and to cater for it.  They are successful to a commendable degree, and it is indeed a pity that programmes cannot be heard clearly by people living among the mountains, particularly those on the other side of the mountains of West Cork, Kerry, Wexford and such places. The transmissions there should be studied, and if Radio Athlone does not strike these places well, more use might be made of stronger transmitters in Dublin or Cork.  The difficulty might be overcome in that way.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister say also that an effort will be made to provide alternative programmes so that the people will not be dependent on one station and one programme only.  The stations in Dublin and Cork are weak at present and cater only for a very limited area, but I presume, until the buildings the Minister has in mind have gone ahead, it will not be easy to provide what is desirable here in Dublin.  The station in Cork is now nearing completion and we are hoping to have the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs opening it in the near future.  We trust it will be such that it will serve the needs of the southern province, at any rate, and <Col N="336" /> perhaps have more extended scope throughout the country.</P>
    <P>A public meeting was held in Cork some few years back seeking to ensure that when that station is established and working, the light orchestra would be transferred to the South, that is, the orchestra praised so highly by Deputy Corish.  That was found entirely impracticable when we discussed the matter with those responsible for broadcasting from Radio Éireann and we then requested a chamber orchestra with a personnel of 20 and this was considered too costly and also turned down.  In the meantime, as the Minister is aware, we have lost through a tragic fire the principal musical centre of our city by the burning of the Opera House and we have built the School of Music, incorporating Radio Éireann studios with a limited hall, but at the same time a centre, that, with the City Hall, might help in the meantime to cater for the South.</P>
    <P>It is a great loss indeed that the Opera House is not available and we are looking to Radio Éireann to help out in the difficulty, until that Opera House can be rebuilt by giving us what is now proposed, a string quartette at least, which can help by incorporation in the symphony orchestra in Cork conducted by Professor Fleischmann. This will help to some extent, perhaps, in giving broadcasts from the studio and also in raising the standard and teaching of music in the southern centre generally.</P>
    <P>We hope to be able to get some concessions in that way from Radio Éireann for the second largest city in this part of the State, for a city that has a good name for musical talent and appreciation of symphony and music of high standard.  The station is being used at the moment to some extent for folklore and national activities of various kinds.  We appreciate that it is not sufficient to go on that line only and we only hope that the Minister and the Comhairle and those associated with the Minister will be able to let us know by the time the station is to be opened in a month or so what they are able to do for us by way of supplementing the programme, particularly <Col N="337" /> on the musical side, because there is a good deal of local talent for drama and song and so on.  That is something we look forward to with interest and we hope the Minister and Comhairle will be able to help us in that respect.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, our broadcasting service should be such that anybody listening to it would know he is listening to a broadcast from a distinctive nation, with its own culture and language, and even though music is international and even though many things broadcast are of advantage, educationally and otherwise, I hope our radio will never lose its character of being a good standard national broadcasting station.</P>

      <P>I join with those who have spoken before me in extending our felicitations to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I hope that his illness will be of short duration and that he will be able to resume the duties on which he had only commenced in that Department.  There is no doubt that, but for the change made in this Ministry, this would be an extremely hotly-discussed Estimate and the method by which the Government was relieved of the embarrassment of Deputy Blaney as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was certainly an extraordinary one, the method of promotion.  But it definitely relieved the Government of the extreme embarrassment he was causing them at that time.</P>
      <P>The new Minister has not been long in that office and consequently the acting-Minister could not be expected to make anything very positive in the way of a statement concerning Government policy in relation to wireless broadcasting.  In fact, it would be an extraordinary thing in these days if any Minister in the Government made a clear statement of Government policy in regard to any Department, but in so far as we could glean from the introductory remarks this morning, the Government, as might be expected, are concerned in relation to the future of television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have set up a commission, the personnel of which is certainly to be commended, and they have taken on the task of reporting on the advisability <Col N="338" /> of a television service and the type of service that would best suit this country's needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to refer, quite truthfully, to the difficulties which listeners to Radio Éireann have in many parts of the country.  There is no doubt that the radio provides a very great majority of our people with entertainment and information.  It is a medium that is now more used than any other medium in existence.  It has brought entertainment and information to the most remote parts of the country, to old and infirm people, to young and middle-aged people.  If it is within the Government's financial resources to improve the facilities of that medium, the sensible thing to do would be to perfect it and so ensure that the people who wish to listen to Radio Éireann will be provided with more listening time and that they will have an opportunity to listen without interruption.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that in parts of this island listeners can get clearer reception from Britain than from the home station.  If he could possibly do it, not only should he direct our programmes to listeners in this country, but he should try to direct them to the very many Irish nationals now resident in Great Britain and who are so anxious to be kept in touch with affairs in this country.  It would help very considerably in maintaining in them interest and love for their native land; it would help them considerably in the exigencies which they may have to meet in a foreign land.</P>
    <P>Surely it is not beyond the bounds of possibility to give to our people in Britain a reasonable chance of getting news from home and of listening to Irish programmes.  However, in the first place we want to satisfy our people at home.  I agree with Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Corish and Deputy MacCarthy that there is a distinct improvement in the quality of the programmes over the last couple of years but it is the engineering difficulties to which I refer.  In that respect, West Cork must be taken into account as well as Wexford.</P>
    <P>In relation to the programmes transmitted <Col N="339" /> from Radio Éireann I would suggest that the station, in its desire to cater for all interests, does spread itself over a very wide field and does produce exclusive programmes of interest to only a very limited portion of our people.  In many cases these people are well provided for by the theatres and other facilities that are available in Dublin.  The reaction among people who have no interest in these programmes is to switch on to another station.  If we could assess what are the desires of the people in general, we should devote the greatest possible time to catering for the general interest.  In that respect I would strongly support Deputy Corish in his remarks about giving more time to our own light orchestra.  If we did so we could wean away many of our young people who are to-day attracted to a type of music which is not complimentary to our Irish character.  You will not wean them away by providing a type of music which people have to study for some time before they get a liking for it.</P>
    <P>While I commend Radio Éireann on the content of many of its programmes I do think that we should be provided with a more frequent news service and that the news should be more condensed. The custom has grown in many countries to give summaries of the news at frequent intervals.  I think it would be well worth looking into that system.  People cannot devote the time which is necessary to listen to a long summary of news from different parts of the world.  It is, of course, only right that news of international importance should get priority on occasion but quite often people are anxious to hear news of affairs within our own country.  They feel frustrated when they have to wait through a lengthy description of something that is happening far away and in which they have no great interest.  I think that, in the broadcasting of news, we should try to get many more items into the programme and get them in in the shortest time possible.</P>
    <P>While we compliment our announcers on their ability as linguists and on the amount of research which must go into <Col N="340" /> the preparation of many of our items, it is an extraordinary thing that our Irish announcers, reporting on events in this House, are not even aware of the identity of people who occupy Ministries in this Government.  That does not happen very often but it should not happen at all.  I am glad that Radio Éireann has facilitated those who are interested in public affairs to the extent of providing them with reports on Dáil proceedings which have been very fair to all sides and which are very helpful in promoting more interest in the administration of Government services here at home.</P>
    <P>The political broadcasts at election times are listened to by very many people and the Director has done very well in his effort to cater for the various Parties and interests in these broadcasts.  I think it is regrettable that we have not advanced to the stage where we can discuss the various measures going through this House in the form of round-table discussions such as are broadcast in other countries.  It would help considerably in promoting a better understanding of politics in this country if we had such a round-table discussion.  At Budget time we have the opinions of various people but I think it should be possible to get representatives of different interests at a round-table discussion of measures going through the House. Surely it would provoke a much more interesting discussion if the representatives of varying views could sit across from each other at the one table and by way of point and counterpoint bring their views home more forcibly to the listening public.</P>

      <P>Would you want the Ceann Comhairle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Ceann Comhairle would care to take part.  At any rate, it is not beyond the capabilities of the people we have in this country to occupy the chair at such a discussion without danger to life or limb.  Without a doubt there has been a distinct improvement in the variety programmes from Radio Éireann.  If I may say so, the Cork contributions in that respect have been <Col N="341" /> quite prominent and have brought about an increase in the listening public to variety from Radio Éireann.</P>
      <P>The Minister made reference to what Radio Éireann should be doing. I suggest that before the Government direct their attention towards the provision of a television service in this country they should seek to extend the hours of listening of Radio Éireann and improve the reception.  I think it is very discouraging and careless on the part of many people to require the authorities to carry out the extensive investigations they have to carry out in order to ensure that the licence is paid.  If good value can be got for 17/6 it can be got for one year's listening in the country.  If there was more cooperation among the people in that respect less expense would be involved in ensuring that the revenue would be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>With regard to television, people are apt to judge the merits of an Irish television programme by the standard of the television presented in other countries.  In that respect, I wonder are we being realistic?  Do we realise that the advertising potential in this country is nothing like what it is in countries which have television services? It has been suggested that we could provide in this country a television programme which, in relation to the capital cost, would not entail a charge upon the Exchequer.  That would indicate that the intention would be, with suitable safeguards, to give it to some commercial interest, some company that would be formed to finance it from advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can recall attending a demonstration in Dublin of the type of programme which we would get if we had that type of television service in the country.  I must say that while the promoters were very fair in presenting the programme, which they said was the type of programme we could afford to have, it was anything but encouraging. It was the type of programme which, if it were put on the screen in a country cinema, you would have a number of people leaving their seats.  There is attached to the very idea of television a glamour which is inclined to attract people without <Col N="342" /> knowing what they will be asked to look at.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to suggest that there is another aspect in regard to the provision of television in this country which must be considered and that is the inducement it would offer to very many families to incur debt in relation to the provision of television.  There are people at the moment whom we may regard as being incapable of paying the rent of houses.  The rent has to be subsidised by the State.  We hear about economic stringency.  Certainly, the dairy farmers of Munster who are required this year to take 1d. less a gallon for their milk would not view with very much sympathy any proposal in regard to something that is glamorous&mdash;something it would be well we could have if we could afford it.</P>
    <P>We know that our people are not quite as down to earth in regard to many of these things as other people. Very often expense is incurred which families cannot afford and to-morrow or the next day they rush to public representatives to save some of their hospital expenses or they require the State to meet many of the necessities which any family should be prepared to meet.  The State is asked to provide these services.  That is reflected in the growing volume of the Estimates in this House.</P>
    <P>Then we sometimes come up against a situation where the Government cannot get the people to save and give to the Government or industry the amount of capital which the Government and industry require.  In those circumstances, the fact that the Government would be saved the capital cost of establishing a television station would be of little significance compared with the charge on the economy at large, if many thousands of people were to embark upon the expenditure of considerable sums of money on the setting up and fitting of a television station.</P>
    <P>In this country we have a distinctive way of life.  We have a neighbourliness which would to a very great extent be affected by the introduction of television. We can realise the boon which television would be to a people who <Col N="343" /> in the normal sense do not mix very well, people who would like to live within their own homes and not meet the neighbours except when necessary. In this country we look at things differently.</P>
    <P>If people are leaving the most remote parts of rural areas that is not because they cannot get entertainment, whether in the form of dancing or cinema shows.  There is hardly a home in the country which has not a radio set and in such circumstances the Government would do well to exercise care in any step they take in relation to the provision of a television service. I realise that people, particularly along the east coast, in Dublin and in the northern counties, where they have already installed television sets, are naturally desirous of having an Irish television programme.  It would be well if we could afford to provide that service. These are questions into which the commission will inquire.</P>
    <P>I conclude by again asking the Minister to ensure that, whatever the Government feel they and the country can afford in relation to television, first things will come first; that we will maintain and improve the standard of the Radio Éireann programmes; that we will extend the time during which it is possible for people to listen to such programmes; that we will improve the transmissions if at all possible and that in improving them we will not forget the very large population of Irish people now resident in Britain who are so desirous, if at all possible, to hear about progress from home.</P>

      <P>With regard to this Estimate and that discussed last night anyone who wants to know about politics to-day need only take the statement made here in regard to economy and the coolness with which Ministers come in here introducing increased Estimates and the &ldquo;take-it-for granted&rdquo; attitude of the people across the way.  In this Estimate there is an increase of £18,000, although £13,000 was spent on equipment last year and only £1,000 this year.  This money is being spent on what we call <Col N="344" /> amusement.  I do not think anyone can look on wireless broadcasting as anything else but amusement at the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We farmers do find a certain amount of amusement in broadcasting especially when we listen to the weather forecast for farmers and fishermen every night.  It can only be excelled by the joker in the Hospitals Sweepstakes programme when he gives out the three dead certs for to-morrow. There is about the same amount of accuracy in each.  I deplore the situation where you have definite statements made in connection with economies, particularly in public services, and then you have Ministers coming in here with increased Estimates. They tell the people down the country, especially the local authorities, of the need for economy.  It is about time this economy started on top.  There are a few things we can very well do without even in the broadcasting system.</P>
      <P>As regards the statements that were made by Deputy Sweetman and by Deputy O'Sullivan respectively, I consider Deputy Blaney's attitude to have been absolutely correct.  It is about time that some Minister of State told some of these gentlemen exactly where they got off.  I believe the Government were right in promoting him for it.  The attitude I deplore in regard to all the Estimates we have met so far is that there is a tendency to cut down the income of those who are producing and to increase the income of those who are not producing.</P>
      <P>On the question of the general programmes from Radio Éireann, I have read a few times that if music is played out in the stall it will induce the cows to give more milk.  I think it would relieve our Minister for Agriculture of a large portion of his headache as regards the butter subsidy at present if some of the Radio Éireann programmes were taken out to the stall and played to the cows.  It would be sufficient to stop them from giving milk and thus relieve the Exchequer to a certain extent of the necessity to subsidise butter.</P>

      <P>I am only answering a comment made by Deputy O'Sullivan. Another point on which I would disagree with the Deputy is in connection with his comment that because a man is living in a subsidised house, say, a labourer's cottage, he should not have a television set.  He pays taxes when he buys tobacco, and everything else; I take it he pays his licence fee and he is as much entitled to his television set as any other gentleman in business or in any other occupation.  There are people in this country who unfortunately, and fortunately for many of us, have to live in subsidised houses, houses built by the local authorities and on which the State pays a subsidy. Generally in those cases when you root out the cause of the subsidy having to be paid, it is not the unfortunate fellow who is living in the subsidised house who is to blame but those who are responsible for monopolies and rackets.</P>

      <P>I certainly say that teachers have already got far too much.  In drawing up the programme for Radio Éireann consideration should be given to what that programme is replacing in Irish life.  The light programme takes the place of what used to be the ordinary fireside chat in the country 20 or 30 years ago.  For that reason, the programme presented should bear some resemblance to that mode of living.</P>
      <P>Since, apparently, it is not possible to make recent national history a subject in our schools, perhaps we could have a little more of it on Radio Éireann.  That would be good for the young people.  It would certainly be better than some of the things they are hearing.  I do not wish to say any more except to call the attention of the House to the fact that, despite the cry for economy, every Estimate coming before this House shows a considerable increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Deputies who wished the Minister a speedy return to health.  In the short time he has been in office he has impressed both sides by his helpfulness and his courtesy.  I trust that we shall soon see him back again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, too, to compliment the acting-Minister in not following the unfortunate precedent set by the Minister for External Affairs last night. At least, the Minister this morning made an effort to justify his Department's policy and give some indication of what it is proposed to do during the coming year.  He might have followed the Minister for External Affairs' example, however, in making his speech available to other Deputies as well as to Front Bench Deputies. <Col N="347" /> Not so many Deputies sit here listening to Ministers introducing their Estimates and it should not cost a great deal, even in these restricted times, to provide a few more copies for those Deputies who take the trouble to come in and sit here listening to the debate.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister and his officials have considerable difficulty in trying to meet the views of our small population, a population with very diversified tastes.  I have a certain sympathy with the efforts made and I should like to join with others in saying that there has been a considerable improvement in the standard of broadcasting. It is difficult to supply programmes on a par with outside stations.  Everybody, including myself, has his own pet ideas as to the type of programme they would like to have.  One must have regard to the realities of the situation and I admit that there must be some restriction on the variety of programmes which can be broadcast.  I would prefer to see the hours restricted rather than extended, as has been suggested, with the quality of the programmes of as high a standard as possible.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Radio Éireann Light Orchestra.  I should like to see money spent to encourage Irish musicians to become a part of our orchestra.  If we cannot get Irish musicians of a sufficiently high standard, then I should not hesitate to get the very best we can afford from outside.  A good national orchestra is a tremendous advertisement. It appeals to everybody irrespective of personal idiosyncrasies.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to examine the possibility of establishing a studio in Limerick.  I am cognisant of the fact that financial considerations colour the plans of his Department. References have been made here to the desirability of bringing our broadcasting closer to the people.  We are a small country and it is desirable that we should try to make the people feel that Radio Éireann is in a particular way their own national broadcasting station.  For that reason, I should like to see a studio in my own city catering <Col N="348" /> for the South and West and giving an opportunity to local talent.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to a feature which I consider one of the best in our programme.  It is certainly one of the most original.  I am sure the cost of it is very small.  I refer to the feature known as &ldquo;The School Around the Corner&rdquo;.  I have nothing but the highest praise for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact I did.  I was highly amused.  That is an excellent feature.  I am sure it is not outside the competence of the Minister and his officials to devise other ways in which we could get good value from our own people at very small cost.</P>
      <P>Most of the discussion to-day has centred around Radio Éireann.  I notice in the Estimates we call it &ldquo;Wireless Broadcasting&rdquo;.  I should like to say something about the other side, namely, Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of television, I suppose we shall have to await the report of the commission before the matter can be discussed further.  Will the House have an opportunity of discussing the report before a decision is taken to implement it in whole or in part?  I hope the commission will issue its report soon.  It is very obvious to anybody coming up here from the country that the number of television masts is growing every week.  If we do not get our own station into operation as soon as possible, listeners will have become so used to outside broadcasting programmes that our own will have very little appeal for them.  Unlike other commissions, I hope this commission will get down to its job and present its report to the Minister as quickly as possible; and in turn, I hope the Minister will give the House an opportunity of discussing the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like Irish television to have a distinctly Irish bias.  In saying that, one must have regard to the fact that <Col N="349" /> we are living in the mid-20th century. One cannot disregard the fact that nowadays people, particularly young people, digest and absorb what is described as outside culture.  We live in close proximity to England and we are closely connected with the United States of America and the Continent, and that proximity is bound to have its effect on our own way of life.  The proper way of attacking it is not to ignore it and shut ourselves out, but to recognise it is there and bring Irish and Irish traditions out into the market place where they can survive in modern conditions and circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is another feature the Minister might consider introducing again.  Like Deputy Corish, I speak as one whose knowledge of the Irish language is extremely limited.  That feature is the one known as &ldquo;Listen and Learn.&rdquo;  I think it was on twice previously.  It might be reintroduced again.  It is an extremely popular feature and it served a very useful purpose.  I would like to ask the Minister to consult with his officials about the possibility of its reintroduction.</P>
    <P>One of the functions of our broadcasting service here which might be extended is its use for educational purposes.  In this country, we cannot, apparently, afford to endow our university and secondary education to the same extent as outside countries. It is worth considering the use of the broadcasting system to bridge some of that gap which we cannot fill, due to lack of financial resources.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the present Comhairle on the efforts they have made to improve the programmes. I should hope they will continue their efforts.  I would rather concentrate on quality than quantity, and I would prefer a much shorter broadcasting time but higher quality programmes. That is the only way we will survive in this very competitive arena of the air.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to express my regret at the absence of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs because of illness.  Like other speakers, I sincerely hope we shall see him back in the House in <Col N="350" /> perfect health to carry out the good work we expect from him.</P>
      <P>It was rather unfortunate that there were such changes in this ministerial post during the past 12 months.  As a result, there was little or no continuity in the programme of improvement of Radio Éireann we had hoped to see carried out.  Various speakers made suggestions for the improvement of the programmes, but they all admitted, as I admit, that since the setting up of the Comhairle, some improvements have been made.  If the demands of the Comhairle could be met&mdash;and I hope they eventually will be&mdash;I am sure we could cater for all tastes, as far as that is possible.  Of course, you cannot please everybody with a programme.</P>
      <P>Some southern Deputies referred to the fact that the Radio Éireann programmes are not clearly received in the distant parts of the South-West.  We have that grievance in South Kerry, especially the people living on the far side of the mountains.  If one of the Comhairle's demands were put into operation, it would bring about satisfactory results in that respect.  They have asked to have several transmitters throughout the country, instead of the one we had originally.  I think the Minister stated we now have five.</P>
      <P>As the Minister stated, the studios are entirely unsuitable.  They are really only offices.  There are four or five of them in the city and they are really only makeshifts.  Previous Ministers referred to them in the same way.  It is to be hoped that, when the financial position improves, studios will be erected which will be suitable for the proper production of programmes. Another demand made was that a second network should be established. All the deficiencies we suffer from in that way are due to lack of money.  It was also asked that instead of the single transmitter we had originally and those that have been added to it, we should have several shortwave transmitters operating throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the lack of money.  It will be a long time before the commission set up in connection with television will issue their report.  There are many people who would not be <Col N="351" /> interested in television one way or the other because of the immense costs involved, and there are other reasons why television may not be so suitable in this country.  Some Deputy suggested that instead of expending this immense sum of money setting up a television station, it should be devoted to the improvement of Radio Éireann.  That would be in the near future, and then in the distant future, if the country so desired and finance was available, a television service could be established.</P>
    <P>In connection with a television service, the Minister stated: &ldquo;The Government and country will be grateful to them&rdquo;&mdash;the Commission on Television&mdash;&ldquo;if they can propose arrangements which will safeguard our national dignity and culture in our television service.&rdquo;  I should like to add to that &ldquo;Our Catholic and Christian outlook.&rdquo;  That is what we have to be careful about.  I do not want to dwell any longer on television. There will be time enough to do that when we have the commission's report. Like other speakers, I wish them well in their difficult task. I hope their findings will be such that the people of the country will accept them in their entirety.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated also that Radio Éireann is a means of diffusion of the Irish language.  A good deal has been done in that way, but, as Deputy Corish stated, the Irish programmes are suitable only for those who have a thorough knowledge of the language. I have often heard speakers here say that a very good method of propagating Irish would be to install radios in our schools.  It is a very good idea, but there are difficulties ahead.  First of all, surely the teachers would not be expected to supply the radios? Certainly, if the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were to supply them, it would cost an immense sum.  Even if they were installed, there would not be sufficient school time to devote to radio programmes.  The school programme is already overloaded.  The minimum time would be half an hour.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Radio Éireann could devote one hour, not nightly, but, say, three times a week, at a time when children <Col N="352" /> and others would be at home, to lessons in Irish.  They could have a teacher and children having certain degrees of knowledge of Irish.  Lessons could be given in oral Irish, grammar and various subjects which could be followed by children and parents. There could be simple lessons at the beginning, increasing in difficulty from week to week and year to year.  A suitable time might be from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.  It might be difficult for Radio Éireann to give time for such a programme but I would go as far as to suggests that, instead of closing down at 11.30, the station could remain open until 12 midnight, as most stations in Britain and on the Continent do.</P>
    <P>I think the people in general are very pleased with the programmes and appreciate the improvements that have been made.  The acting-Minister condensed a good deal of useful information in his statement.  Let us hope that in the very near future, when the financial situation will allow, all the necessary improvements can be made in Radio Éireann so that there may be Irish programmes to improve the national culture, the Irish language and so on.  I hope that will be the position.</P>

      <P>The Estimate for Wireless Broadcasting provides an opportunity for discussion of the proposed national television service.  I am rather surprised that speakers on the other side of the House should make the statement that the Government have still no policy in regard to television.  If anything proves that we have a policy, it is the fact that we have set out to do something positive about television.  It is a very vexed question and a very formidable undertaking. The fact that a commission has been set up to examine this very important project is an indication that the Government has no intention of shelving their duty in this matter. The terms of reference of the commission are very comprehensive and their investigation will take some time. I expect that the Minister, who addressed the first meeting of the commission, made it clear that the Government expects a report at the earliest possible moment.  Years ago, it <Col N="353" /> was typical of commissions of inquiry that there was considerable delay in producing a report.  I am not competent to say whether in the past such delay was inevitable or not but we were used to that practice.  That position has improved in recent times.  For instance, the commission set up to inquire into the transport problem reported within the shortest possible time.  I have no doubt that that will also apply in this particular instance.</P>
      <P>The provision of a television service is a very involved business.  I think it is accepted by both sides of the House that such a service will have to pay for itself and, in order that that may be possible, it will probably be necessary to have it operated on a commercial basis.  When a service of that kind has to be operated on a commercial basis the Government has not the same degree of control with regard to the direction of policy as they would have in a service that was operated entirely as a State service and financed entirely by the State.  If commercial interests are brought into the project for the purpose of giving it the support which, owing to financial stringency the State is not in a very good position to give at the moment, it is obvious that such commercial interests will be entitled to certain reasonable facilities and that the Minister, eventually, will have a very difficult job in that he will be between two stools.  In that position it is very difficult to prevent oneself from &ldquo;coming to the ground&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It was very wise on the part of the Government to set up the Commission of Inquiry and I want to congratulate the acting-Minister and the Minister, Deputy Ormonde, who, unfortunately, cannot be with us to-day, in the choice of personnel of the commission.  We are all very pleased that the personnel were drawn from various interests, different political affiliations, etc.  No better body could be got to deal with this very complicated question.  I wish the commission every success in their deliberations and sincerely hope their report will not be too long delayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I have made it sufficiently clear that the Government has a policy with regard to television.  The Government must, however, cut its cloth <Col N="354" /> according to its measure.  I am quite sure that if the people on the opposite benches had been on this side they would have been far more conservative than we are on this matter.  Television has made substantial progress in Britain, Europe and the United States of America, but it was not until a few months ago that anything positive was done about it in this country.</P>
    <P>We are told that the capital cost alone of television is six times the cost of a sound system.  If that is so, I am inclined to think that the cost of programme production and maintenance will be terribly high.  I submit that there is a certain amount of loose thinking about the necessity for this country to embark on television programmes. This very modern service has certainly made considerable strides in the neighbouring country, but it is not because it is accepted in the neighbouring country that we should rush into it.  We have a distinct way of life and we should follow that pattern as much as possible.  This country is not as fortunate as other States; we have not got the opportunity for self-development that many other countries, who have fairly well perfected their television service at present, got.  It is natural to expect that there are many problems here, social and economic and otherwise, which, from our point of view, it is more important for our people to solve.</P>
    <P>I think we are in too much of a hurry with television and we are showing disappointment which should not exist because it has not been provided up to now.  We have carried on pretty well socially and economically up to this, and, if we have to wait for television for another while, I do not think it will do us any harm.  I shall leave the question of television there.</P>
    <P>Regarding broadcasting in general, I think it is one of the most difficult sources of entertainment&mdash;if we call it such&mdash;that any State or individual could be asked to provide.  One has to try to please the entire population of the country and, in some way or other, every citizen will criticise and endeavour to take a certain amount of interest in the national broadcasting system.  I feel this medium of entertainment <Col N="355" /> and information and the other purposes it serves is one of the cheapest that any Government service provides.  The licence for an ordinary radio was 10/- in 1938; by 1948 it had increased to only 12/6 and the current rate is 17/6.  So far as that is concerned I think there is no cause for complaint; the service is provided at a very nominal figure.  The intention there I take it is that the poorer sections of the people would be able to enjoy the amenities of the radio.</P>
    <P>Somebody reminded me there is quite a lot of money outstanding in arrears of licences.  I am rather surprised to know that because I am aware that the Post Office engineering people check up on that part of the work very efficiently.  Their method of approach to a person who has not paid his licence is something I am inclined to commend them for.  When it is discovered that a licence is not paid a very diplomatic reminder is sent out.  If the person concerned fails to respond, after some days, he gets a second reminder and as far as I understand unless the situation becomes impossible and the licensee will not renew the licence no prosecution will be instituted.  I think that is the proper course because most people&mdash;I would say 99 per cent. of those who have radio sets&mdash;licence those sets and if there is any slip-up I think it is not deliberate.  Where there is non-compliance it is obvious action must be taken to secure the renewal of licences.  I am merely making the point that for an annual payment of 17/6 this organisation gives a very good return.</P>
    <P>With regard to the variety of programmes, I suppose it is natural there would be quite a lot of criticism, some undoubtedly constructive, and I would even say that part of what is deemed to be destructive is not deliberately destructive.  Each of us has his own idea as to what lines a programme should follow and, as I said earlier, when providing anything in the line of entertainment it is almost impossible to get any degree of unanimity.  Those of us who have experience in engaging dance bands for social functions in the <Col N="356" /> country know that well.  I think we would be looking for far too much here if we tried to bring about a situation in which everybody would be pleased.</P>
    <P>Criticisms were made during this debate of some views expressed by the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Blaney.  I believe Deputy Blaney was quite correct in giving what he regarded as an honest and factual statement in regard to a matter on which he was questioned at the Fianna Fáil organisation's Árd-Fheis. Deputy Blaney did not rush into the Árd-Fheis deliberately to make a statement to attack anybody. A resolution was on the Clár dealing with this subject and the Minister made a fair statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As regards the Radio Council, it is certainly a very efficient organisation but it is quite natural that criticisms will be levelled at that body from time to time.  The persons on the Radio Council are quite big enough to take those criticisms and I would assure them that the general criticisms from listeners are offered in a very genuine spirit and for the purpose of trying to help and co-operate with the council in bringing about any improvement that might appear to listeners to be necessary.  There is no suggestion that because these opinions are sent in in letters to the Press or because Deputies make criticisms in the Dáil it is intended to hold up the Radio Council to any form of public odium or in any way belittle the work they are doing.  I think we are fortunate to have such very able men on that assignment and that we can rest assured that as far as they are concerned they are putting their best into it and endeavouring, to the best of their ability, to do the job assigned to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points I am very anxious to make in regard to the radio service and I am glad of the opportunity of putting these matters forward for the Minister's consideration. The musical and entertainment side of <Col N="357" /> the radio programmes is such that very little improvement could, I think, be expected.  Whether that improvement is possible or not, I rather feel that at the moment the line of direction has become a bit top-heavy.  In a country such as this, where our agricultural industry means so much in the lives of the people, a good deal more time should be given to broadcasting agricultural subjects.  I know that we have various programmes and agricultural talks, but what I feel is necessary in this case is the allocation of a definite time per day to a discussion of agricultural subjects.  Perhaps it would be better to have this time allocated at night when most people who work in agriculture are free to listen.  I suggest to the Minister that a half hour, or an hour at night, at about 8 o'clock, should be allocated for talks on the various aspects of our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>We should link up the various centres throughout the country where important debates on agriculture are taking place, so that these debates could be broadcast to interested listeners.  That would be a far more effective way of meeting the requirements of our farmers than having occasional talks lasting for a quarter of an hour, half an hour or an hour at a time.  Talks can, however, become rather monotonous and it would be better if we could give our listeners at stated times a broadcast of exchanges of views.  That would be a distinct service to the farming community.</P>
    <P>A panel of competent speakers should be drawn up and these speakers should be given an opportunity of coming on the air in these talks I refer to.  It is a big advantage, in any radio programme, if you know that a particular item is to come on the air at the same time every night.  Many people find it difficult to keep track of the time a casual programme is being broadcast.  Like the news which comes on at 10.15 p.m., we would all look forward anxiously to half an hour of special discussion in connection with the many problems facing our agricultural industry, if we knew the time at which to expect them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> Broadcasts of such a nature are much more important than any political broadcasts, even broadcasts on the Budget.  Unfortunately, people interested in the agricultural industry have not always the same opportunity of getting knowledge through the medium of circulars and memoranda as other people have.  They can get the information over the radio more effectively than by any distribution through the medium of written documents.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that the basis of the advancement of the Irish language through the radio should be reconsidered.  I agree with other speakers that most people who have only a little knowledge of the language, or no knowledge at all, are right in their complaints that those who speak the language over the radio are far too advanced and are of no assistance to the person anxious to acquire a knowledge of the language.  What we want is a &ldquo;Listen and Learn&rdquo; programme. There is such a means, through a book, which has become a very effective medium and which has given a knowledge of the language to thousands of people.  We could use the radio for a &ldquo;Listen and Learn&rdquo; programme. No matter what adjustments we have to make and no matter what commercial revenue we may have to drop, the language is of sufficient importance to warrant half an hour of such a programme every day at a fixed time.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity of making that point to the Minister.  It is one of the most important factors which we could contribute to our effort to bring the language to people anxious to learn and speak it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I regret the reason for the absence of the Minister, and I hope that he will soon be restored to good health.  There is one thing that both the Minister and the acting-Minister can be assured of, that is, they have the services of a very efficient staff to assist them in their administration of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to take advantage of the Minister's temporary incapacity to raise any awkward matters, beyond bringing to his notice some matters I <Col N="359" /> have complained of for years.  In his opening statement, the Minister referred to the encouragement given by Radio Éireann to Irish musicians.  My complaint is that we have too many non-nationals receiving higher salaries and emoluments than the Irish musicians. I refer to the fact that within the last month we had three very brilliant musicians selected by the London Symphony Orchestra, and I was told that if they had had foreign names they would probably have been employed by Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government achieved something when he criticised Radio Éireann.  I am satisfied that the Comhairle is dominated by a city outlook. I notice that, in the Estimate, which is very cleverly prepared, there is no segregation of the cost of the symphony orchestra.  The Comhairle is limited by the city mentality in what they put over the air for the country in general.  I want to remind the Minister that the Irish people in general are the taxpayers and that there are more people in the country than those who depend on the symphony orchestra, which is in no way a national orchestra.  I was assured that foreigners would be employed only on a temporary basis and that they would not displace any Irish musicians.  As a matter of fact, I think the number of foreigners has increased.  Our Irish musicians should get every encouragement and should be afforded every chance of being employed by Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to a statement given over the B.B.C. on St. Patrick's Day.  It was from a script prepared by somebody in Radio Éireann.  The existence of a shamrock was denied.  There was no shamrock in the country because the ground had been ploughed up by tractors.  Nobody could credit that any Irishman would prepare such a script for a foreign station.</P>
    <P>I wish to compliment Radio Éireann on the very elaborate and fair reports they give in regard to sport of all kinds but in regard to some of the sponsored programmes I object to the fact that so many of the requests are for songs of the rock'n'roll type.  We <Col N="360" /> should devote some of our time to our fine national songs instead of propagating foreign music which is not music at all.  We should not use Radio Éireann for that purpose even in the case of requests.</P>
    <P>We have got to consider that there are people, not all of whom are teenagers, living in the country outside of Dublin who are anxious to listen to some of our good old Irish songs.  We ought to have fewer requests for foreign music.  That matter should be considered by Radio Éireann. I should like to ask the Minister to suggest to the Radio Éireann authorities that we should have fewer foreign musicians.  I believe we are spending a great deal of money on the symphony orchestra, and if you had a plebscite I have no doubt that a very large percentage of the people would vote against the expenditure of such a huge amount of money to suit a small section of the people.  I do not deny their right to have it but we should not spend so much money in order to meet their wishes and deprive the poor man who may possess only a battery set from having the music he likes.</P>
    <P>We have got to consider the man in the country.  In the summer-time, plays are broadcast at a time when men are working in the fields.  When they come back from work, they want to have some recreation other than listening to jazz music until 10 or 11 at night.  Suitable programmes should be put on for the men who have to work all day in the fields so that, when they return home, they can listen to some more suitable programme than the symphony orchestra.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look into this matter of the script prepared for St. Patrick's Day.  If it was prepared by somebody in Radio Éireann, he should at least ensure that we will not have a repetition.  With regard to the news, it is all right for the city folk to have the news at 6.30 p.m. with a repeat at 10 p.m., and again have it at 9 in the morning and at 1 p.m. All that, I should point out, has appeared the evening before in the newspapers.  All the news which is heard the previous evening at 6 o'clock is again heard the following day.  That <Col N="361" /> is a matter which Radio Éireann should consider.  I am endeavouring to offer helpful criticism.</P>
    <P>I am associated mostly with the people in the country and we are paying a considerable sum of money towards Radio Éireann.  I do not intend to go into the question of television because we enjoy such a position that we have television sets in most houses.  We have had very good reception there for the past four or five years.  People will take advantage of television and forget about Radio Éireann.  I mention these points so that the Minister will draw the attention of the powers that be to them. We should try to facilitate our Irish musicians and have them employed by Radio Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>My chief reason for speaking in this debate is to bring to the notice of the Minister and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs the very bad reception which we in West Cork get from Radio Éireann.  I asked a question last year on this very important matter.  In the Official Report of the 28th November, 1957, at column 1275, I asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he is aware that widespread dissatisfaction exists in West Cork at the unsatisfactory reception of Radio Éireann signals there, and, if so, whether he is prepared to consider the establishment of a booster station, or the operation of similar equipment, in the West Cork district to improve reception.</P>
      <P>I certainly got a very long and enlightening reply from the former Minister but nothing has since been done.  In the reply, Deputy Blaney, the then Minister, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The West Cork area is one of a number of areas in Ireland where reception of the Radio Éireann programmes is admittedly not satisfactory...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At the end of his reply, which is a very long one, he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;During the past two years an extensive survey of ways and means to improve the coverage of Radio Éireann has been carried out by Radio Éireann engineers.  I understand that the engineers are agreed <Col N="362" /> that the most satisfactory solution of the problem would be to install and operate a number of V.H.F. (very high frequency) transmitters to cover the parts of the country where reception from the present transmitters is not satisfactory.  The capital cost of such a scheme would, however, be very high and the annual costs of operating the stations would also be substantial. Examination of the problem will continue so that a scheme will be ready when money will be available for carrying it out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am wondering what progress has been made since in carrying out any scheme to improve reception in West Cork.  There is a certain forecast every night after the news for the benefit of fishermen and farmers.  I represent an area where 95 per cent. of the people are farmers and fishermen.  In one island off our coast which is in the Gaeltacht, nine miles from the mainland, Cape Clear, the reception is shocking.  The people there depend chiefly upon the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Something must be done for those people.  Over all West Cork our people are paying their wireless licence fee the same as the people in Dublin, the Midlands and elsewhere who are getting perfect reception.  Those people along the coast are subsidising the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to provide a good service for everybody but themselves.  I wonder how long the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are going to continue in this fashion, taking money for a service which they are not giving in the constituency which I have the honour to represent.</P>
    <P>I merely want to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister once again and to voice a protest against the delay in his Department in bringing about an improvement in reception which is so vital and important to the farmers and fishermen along the coast who are deriving their living from those two very important industries. It must be important when Radio Éireann gives this broadcast every night but, unfortunately, it is of very little benefit.  Because of all the interruptions we cannot make out what <Col N="363" /> they are saying.  It was said by one member of the Skibbereen Urban Council at one stage that the noise was like that of a combine harvester. It has not improved since.  As a matter of fact, I think the position has worsened.</P>
    <P>When I read in the paper a fortnight ago of a very important commission set up for the provision of television in this country and when I thought of the vast amount of money it was going to cost the taxpayers of this country, I wondered if people realised that the position is so bad down the country that we have not got proper radio reception in our areas.  The first essential step is to provide at least that reception and it can be done when, as the former Minister said to me, money is available.  I do not know how long it will take before the money is available but I sincerely hope that, at least, the matter will get attention at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>Having mentioned reception from Radio Éireann in Cape Clear, I should also point out that I got a complaint from that island about the reception there on the telephone.  There are times when the islanders cannot make out at all what the people on the mainland are saying to them on the telephone. That is a matter which should be looked into by the officers of the Department.  It is a small thing but it concerns the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Small things count in the long run.  I have nothing further to say.  I have brought the points before the Minister and his Department and I sincerely hope that something can be done about them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many Deputies I feel sure, I get very little opportunity of listening to Radio Éireann programmes but when I do get the opportunity I listen in.  One aspect of our programmes which worries me is the singing of Irish and Anglo-Irish ballads.  To me at any rate the thing is absolutely appalling at times.  Our ballads from a big part of our tradition, culture and history and they require individual treatment.  When I hear some of our ballads of the marching type sung in waltz-time it worries <Col N="364" /> me.  I would ask the broadcasting section to look into the question of the treatment of some of these good old songs.</P>
      <P>I noticed many times that the people singing these songs seem to think that they can change the words to suit themselves.  I do not mind their changing the words if it is part of a play where some person has to sing a song but when they give us a rendering of an old ballad they should stick rigidly to the words written by the person who originally composed the ballad or song.  I comment on that matter in the hope that the question will be examined if possible.</P>
      <P>I often wonder whether the Department have power to deal with interference in regard to reception.  I do not know enough about the matter to determine whether they have or not or whether their power is limited to asking people to take certain measures which will relieve neighbouring houses of interference by machines or factories and such like.  Many complaints are made to me in regard to interference which disrupts the programmes.  If the Minister has not the power to deal with the obvious causes of interference he should seek that power.</P>
      <P>As far as television is concerned, I am not a bit worried.  In fact, from what I have heard and read about it, I think the longer there is delay in providing us with it the better it will be for ourselves.  At the same time, since a great number of people would wish to have it and since they are entitled to have it if they wish, I hope, when it is introduced, we shall have the best possible service.  Some Deputy suggested that we would be able to regulate the programmes which the people would receive.  I hope that is so, but relayed programmes will come in and our people will have to put up with them.  I hope that the question of the relaying of programmes from outside will be fully considered by the commission which is sitting before they make recommendations to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider the question of keeping our Radio station open until <Col N="365" /> 12 midnight.  Most people are out until 11 p.m. or 11.15 p.m.  They may be at the pictures or even in the pub and cannot get home until 11 p.m. or after that hour.  They are just in nice form to sit down and switch on the wireless but they cannot get Radio Éireann programmes at that time.  People like to hear the news and like to know what is happening in the outside world.  They do not like waiting.  In fact, nobody likes waiting.  I suggest that the Minister should consider leaving our station open until 12 o'clock.  British and other stations are open until 12 o'clock.</P>
      <P>With regard to television, a very large number of people purchase television sets.  They can get them on a weekly payment basis.  We may be losing a lot of revenue.  They will sell their old set but they will not bother to take out a licence.  It is important, therefore, that not only should we expedite the findings of the Television Commission but that we should also make our programmes so attractive that people will want to continue listening to the wireless.</P>
      <P>In case the Minister does not know, many people look on Radio Éireann programmes as a kind of ham programme. There is an old saying that one man's meat is another man's poison.  What I might think is a good programme, some rural person might think is a bad one, but so far as the people in the city are concerned a very large number of them just listen to the news and, perhaps, to the Sweepstake programme.  They then turn to the B.B.C. or Radio Luxemburg.  If those stations could jam their programmes and were not capable of reception here very few people would bother getting a licence.  We must make our programmes worth listening to.  I am aware of the need for educational programmes, but we can overdo that.  In America the programmes are all commercial and big business.  They know how to go about things.</P>
      <P>With reference to the use of Radio Éireann during election time, may I say that during the last election each of the Parties was granted an opportunity to speak to the public at large, but no opportunity was given to Independents to speak.</P>

      <P>No.  There is a certain point of view in regard to which Independents could be said to be in full agreement, and that is the need for Independents.  Leaving aside their particular line of policy, there could be agreement among the Independents as to the selection of an Independent to speak.  I hold there is always need for Independents.  We have not to think of what someone else is thinking. We just have to think for ourselves. Party members have to think of what their Whip will say or whether they might be letting down somebody on their side.  We do not have to think along those lines.</P>

      <P>In some cases it is a pity, but in most cases it is a good thing.  It is strange that when there is need to judge between people it is always an Independent that is selected. We have a certain point of view and we should be granted the opportunity of speaking when it is given to the different Parties.  It is bad enough for Independents to be boycotted in the Press, but to be boycotted on Radio Éireann is going a little bit too far. During the last election not only was my name not mentioned on Radio Éireann but it was not mentioned in a certain newspaper from the beginning to the end of the campaign.  Independents should be given the opportunity to put a certain point of view which would be common to all of them. The peculiar thing about Parties is that the leader is an Independent because the Party accepts his leadership. They do not dispute his viewpoint. Take the Taoiseach.  Who disputes what he says?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to radio licences, there are people such as old age pensioners and people suffering from certain afflictions who have no income besides their pensions.  They should be granted free licences.  We should lose little by it.  Such people might be tempted to obtain a radio on the hire-purchase system but they might not be able to afford the licence fee.  Furthermore, <Col N="367" /> the same fee should not be required for battery sets as main sets. There is too much expense attached to getting batteries charged, and so on. The people who rely on battery sets are people in out-of-the-way places who should be encouraged to listen to the radio.  There should be a reduction of at least 5/- in their fee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to thank members on both sides of the House who expressed good wishes for the speedy recovery of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Ormonde.  I think I can say I am now looking forward to spending a shorter period as acting-Minister than I thought would be likely at first.  I have very good hopes that Deputy Ormonde will be back sooner than we expected.</P>
      <P>I also thank Deputies generally for the manner in which they have approached this debate.  A number of helpful suggestions were made and, generally speaking, the approach was of a constructive nature.  That is, of course, apart from the personal attacks made on Deputy Blaney, in regard to the period he held office as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  To me, at any rate, these attacks did not ring true and they seemed to have been introduced purely as a means of bringing any kind of controversy into the debate.  I do not believe the people who made the attacks thought for one moment that Deputy Blaney had spoken on any matter that was not within his competence as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I do not propose to follow the line which some Deputies attempted to lay down for me.  Instead I shall deal with some of the practical points raised in connection with the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criticism was made of my opening remarks in that early on in the speech I said that I did not propose to say any more about television and that subsequently it was mentioned quite a good deal.  That, I suppose, is a legitimate criticism, but my further remarks in connection with television were for the purpose of demonstrating that, in spite of the probable imminence of the introduction of a television programme <Col N="368" /> here, it was still necessary to pay a considerable amount of attention to the sound broadcasting system.  I could not very well make those points without making some reference to television and to what the situation would be when television came.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the setting up of the commission to advise the Government with regard to the establishment of a television programme was well received.  One or two Deputies, I think, did try to paint the setting up of that commission as an indication that the Government could not make up its mind in this respect.  However, those very same Deputies would be very critical, indeed, if the Government had made a decision on this important matter without taking reasonable steps to secure the views of the different groups in the community who are concerned with the provision of a television service.  We would have been subjected to very grave criticism had we, in fact, taken a decision without taking these steps.</P>
    <P>The composition of the commission, comprising as it does representatives of very widely differing interests in the community, is an earnest of the Government's desire to secure the widest possible advice on this important matter.  Certainly I think it a good thing that we have taken these steps. Every group concerned in the matter can put its views before the commission. Indeed, I am sure that some of the views expressed here today will be given serious consideration by the commission and will, in fact, prove helpful to that body in its deliberations.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies expressed the opinion that it will be a long time before the commission reports.  I do not think it fair to start off on that assumption. The commission has only just been set up and we should at least give it a chance to prove itself.  My information is that they have got down to work very quickly and are displaying a considerable amount of energy in approaching their task.  I hope that the commission will report in a reasonable time.  The initial signs are good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not set them any definite time limit, but they intend to complete their task&mdash;I know that&mdash; as soon as possible and I do not think it fair for some Deputies to condemn them before they have started.</P>
      <P>The views expressed generally in the debate in relation to the standard of the programmes were for the most part favourable.  I found the approach very reasonable.  Deputies seem to appreciate that it is not possible in a single programme to satisfy every taste.  There was, however, a keen appreciation of the efforts that are being made to cater to some extent for all tastes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman asked me to clarify a point with regard to the estimate I gave in relation to the cost of providing television.  The position is that the estimate I gave of its costing six times as much as sound broadcasting refers to the actual programme cost.  That is the estimate at the moment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish suggested that it would be a good idea to open the lunch time programme at 12.30 instead of 1 o'clock.  I shall have that matter examined but, in the listener research that was carried out some time ago, there was no demand for that particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish also asked if there was an effective control over the type of material broadcast in the sponsored programmes.  In theory, at any rate, the director has complete control but, in exercising that control, he has to recognise the fact that these people are paying heavy fees.  The reason they do so is to ensure that their programmes will be listened to by the largest possible number of people. There cannot, therefore, be too rigid a control and the director cannot be too strict in imposing control.  I know that he does try to exercise continuous pressure on those responsible for these programmes with a view to getting them to improve the standard and to maintain that improved standard once he has succeeded in getting it.  I think the criticism of the sponsored programmes was a little bit severe.  Some of them are quite all right.  There are some, however, of which few of us here would approve.  At the same time, <Col N="370" /> we must remember that these people are paying big fees, and we must allow them to choose the type of programme which they believe will achieve results for them.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the programmes in Irish and the view was expressed that these programmes cater only for those who already have a competent knowledge of Irish.  Some Deputies expressed the opinion that it would be desirable that more programmes in Irish should be devoted to beginners and to those who are not so competent in order to bring their proficiency to a higher pitch.  I can understand that viewpoint but the time, of course, at the disposal of the director is limited.  We have the Gaeltacht areas and, throughout the country generally, we have people who wish to have such items as the news given in Irish.  It is desirable that we should cater for such people.  Listening to good speakers will have a good effect even on those who are not so proficient.  If they listen consistently, they are bound to improve.  There are, of course, other ways in which people who desire to improve their knowledge of the language can do so.</P>
    <P>I was glad that so many Deputies referred to the &ldquo;Listen and Learn&rdquo; programme.  Judging by the debate to-day there appears to be a fair demand for a repetition of that programme or one of a similar nature. That feature was obviously a popular one.  I agree it is desirable to use the radio in every way possible as an instrument to promote the more efficient speaking of Irish.  That is one suggestion to which I am sure the director will give very close attention.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the praise that was given to the orchestras.  Some Deputies asked for a greater utilisation of the light orchestra in radio programmes. My information is that that orchestra is actually working to full capacity at the moment.  It is on in three programmes a week.  The importance of it and its outstanding merit are appreciated by the Radio Éireann authorities.  I might mention here that the light orchestra is being given the honour of providing the concert to mark the opening of the new Cork studios next June.  That, in <Col N="371" /> itself, is evidence of the importance that is attached to it.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies elaborated on my opening remarks regarding the difficulty of receiving Radio Éireann programmes in certain parts of the country.  Naturally, there were demands that this matter should be attended to as soon as possible.  I outlined some of the difficulties in my speech, the difficulties due to the geographical position of the areas concerned. To get over them, the position is as was explained in the reply to the parliamentary question which Deputy Wycherley read out.  It can be got over only by the provision of very high frequency radio and that will be a very expensive business.  The financial position at the moment simply does not permit of it and the provision of very high frequency must wait on capital becoming more freely available. Certainly it is a matter which is regarded very seriously by the Department and the authorities in Radio Éireann, and I can assure Deputies that it will be dealt with as soon as it is possible to do so.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na rúdaí ar thagair an Teachta Mac Cárthaigh dóibh go gcaithimid rud éigin a dhéanamh i dtreo is go mbeidh cláracha Radio Éireann le cloisint go soiléir, go mór mhór i gContae Chorcaighe.

    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan was the first to refer to the news broadcasts and other Deputies referred to them also.  I think these references illustrate the difficulty of satisfying everybody in this respect. Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out that he <Col N="372" /> thought there should be more frequent news broadcasts and that they should be more condensed.  Shortly afterwards, another Deputy expressed the view that there were too many news broadcasts already and that one or two fairly detailed news broadcasts would be sufficient.</P>
    <P>That is the type of problem the authorities in Radio Éireann have to solve&mdash;to try to reconcile these two different viewpoints.  I feel they have made a fairly good job of reconciling them.  We had people here claiming that the too frequent repetition of news broadcasts would prove irritating to the listeners.  On the other hand, we had the request made by some Deputies for more frequent news broadcasts.  The present system is fairly satisfactory all round.  The view that obtains at the moment is that more frequent news broadcasts would not be very well received.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moloney and some other Deputies referred to the desirability of having more frequent broadcasts dealing with agricultural matters and that these should be at more regular intervals.  The position at the moment is that there are three regular agricultural features per week.  I do not think that is too bad, considering the difficulty with regard to time and the fact that only one programme is available. It is generally accepted that the main function of the radio is to entertain people and, while we do try to make the programmes instructive as well, we cannot go too far or the programmes will not be listened to at all, or certainly not to the extent we would like. There may be a case for giving the programmes generally a greater agricultural bias.  That is one of the suggestions I will ask the director to look into.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett referring, I think, to the symphony orchestra, said there were too many non-nationals in it.  I find it hard to believe that the people responsible for recruiting that orchestra deliberately gave preference to non-nationals.  In tackling the establishment of a symphony orchestra, it is natural they should have had in mind the establishment of an orchestra of the highest possible standard.  Seeing <Col N="373" /> that it was a matter of such cultural importance and widespread interest, I do not think we can blame them if they have taken in a certain number of people who are not nationals of this country, provided that the qualified persons responsible did not think there were suitable native musicians available to fill the posts in the orchestra.  Generally speaking, I am in agreement with the idea that, where possible, preference should be given to our native musicians.  I should be very surprised if that idea is not the predominant one in this case.</P>

      <P>I do not think so. In regard to most things, you have always got people who are capable of doing the job.  As I say, I do not know much about this myself, but I feel there is not much point in setting up a symphony orchestra, unless we can set up a really good one.  If it was the case that, for particular posts, there were not musicians of sufficiently high standard available in the country, I do not think there was any great fault in going outside the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know of any individual cases.  If Deputies have cases where they think non-nationals were employed unnecessarily, I shall be glad to look into them.  I imagine that the idea was to render a service to music in Ireland.  It may be that the bringing in of some outstanding musicians to the orchestra would have a good effect generally in raising the standard and Irish musicians would not, I imagine, greatly resent the bringing in of outstanding musicians in that respect.  However, generally speaking, I favour the viewpoint that as far as possible, we certainly should employ our own musicians, provided they are of sufficiently high standard. I do not know of any case in which that has not been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not dealt with all the points <Col N="374" /> raised.  There were a number of suggestions made which I consider well worth looking into.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,604,260 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 &amp; 46 Vict., c.74; 8 Edw. 7, c.48; 1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5, c.26; the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1953; No. 45 of 1926; No. 14 of 1940 (secs. 30 and 31); No. 14 of 1942 (sec. 23); No. 17 of 1951; etc.), and of certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
      <P>The net Estimate for 1958-59 amounts to £8,840,260, being a gross total of £9,367,798, less Appropriations-in-Aid of £527,538.  It does not, of course, include provision for the recently announced increase in Civil Service remuneration.  The net provision represents an increase of £176,760 on that for 1957-58.  As, however, the justification for the Department's existence is the services it sells to the public, expenditure is meaningless except when considered in conjunction with its revenue.  Actually, the yield of postal, telegraph and telephone revenue payable to the Exchequer is estimated at £8,350,000 for 1958-59, which is an increase of £350,000 on the 1957-58 figure &mdash;an increase appreciably bigger than the increase in expenditure originally estimated for.  I may also say that, on a commercial account basis, the Department has made a small profit in 1956-57 for the first time for many years&mdash;and expects to make a bigger, though still a modest one, in 1957-58.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> However, I will return to the financial position later on.</P>
    <P>Looking through the sub-heads of the Estimate, the more substantial variations&mdash;those of £10,000 or more&mdash; occur on the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sub-head A (3)&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances (Provincial Offices).  The decrease of £29,000 arises mainly from staff savings secured by reorganisation of the telegraph service and by revised postal arrangements.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E (5)&mdash;Conveyance of Mails by Air.  The increase of £30,000 is due to increased traffic, which, of course, is reflected in increased postal revenue.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (1)&mdash;Stores.  The increase of £26,000 is due to a number of items which include the greater incidence of motor van replacements, increased price of petrol, smaller user for telephone development and the fact that reserve stocks are not available for drawing upon as was done last year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (2)&mdash;Uniform Clothing. The increase here is £20,000.  In 1957-58, reserve stocks were drawn on for part of the year's requirements; this cannot be done this year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I (1)&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowance (Engineering).  Provision for new posts and normal increments are the two most significant factors in the increase of £24,000.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K&mdash;Engineering Materials. The decrease of £33,800 is mainly due to increased telephone capital relief, partly offset by an increase of £10,000 in the provision for replacement of motor transport.</P>
    <P>Sub-head L (2)&mdash;Contract Work.  The decrease of £15,000 is mainly due to smaller expenditure on heating, lighting and telegraph equipment.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M&mdash;Telephone Capital Repayments. Money for development of the telephone system is provided by issues from the Central Fund.  These issues have to be repaid by annuities extending over periods not exceeding 25 years.  This sub-head contains full provision for the annuity payments to <Col N="376" /> be made, during the year.  The increase from year to year&mdash;the present figure is £100,240 more than 1957-58&mdash; is a natural consequence of the expansion of the telephone system&mdash;an expansion which in its turn leads to increased revenue.</P>
    <P>Sub-head N (1)&mdash;Superannuation Allowances, Pensions, etc.  The increase of £14,500 is due mainly to an increase in the total amount of annual pensions payable.</P>
    <P>Sub-head O (2)&mdash;Civil Aviation and Meteorological Wireless&mdash;provision and installation of equipment and operating and maintenance charges, rent, etc. The increase of £16,000 provides for the replacement of the instrument landing system at Shannon Airport and increased maintenance costs.</P>
    <P>Sub-head T&mdash;Appropriation-in-Aid. The decrease of £18,070 in receipts is the net effect of a number of decreases and increases the biggest single item being the fall of over £20,000 in receipts for the sale of old stores, which is ascribable to a fall in the prices of non-ferrous metals.</P>
    <P>Mail services operated satisfactorily during the past year.  On the closure of part of the G.N.R. and of the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties' Railway, suitable alternative arrangements were made for the conveyance of mails by road transport.  The volume of letter traffic in 1957 increased slightly compared with the previous year but the fall in parcel traffic which has manifested itself in recent years continued. Exactly the same trends were noticeable in the 1957 Christmas period.</P>
    <P>The general reorganisation of postal services in rural areas was continued. A six-day frequency of delivery and a better standard of service were provided in the head office districts of Bantry, Ennis and Naas and in parts of the Carlow, Limerick and Mallow districts.  Reorganisation of the balance of the Carlow, Limerick and Mallow districts and of the final section of the Waterford district will be completed shortly.  It is hoped to commence work during the current year on the remaining five districts which have yet to be reorganised.</P>
    <P>Special postage stamps were brought <Col N="377" /> out during the year to commemorate the centenaries of John Redmond, Tomás Ó Criomhthain and Admiral William Brown and the tercentenary of Father Luke Wadding.  There will be two commemorative issues this year, one marking the centenary of the birth of Tom Clarke, first signatory of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, and the other the centenary of the death of Mother Mary Aikenhead, foundress of the Irish Sisters of Charity.</P>
    <P>Public telegraph traffic has continued to decline but at a diminishing rate. During the past 12 months, the number of telegrams handled was 2,080,000 odd, which was 47,000 or just over 2 per cent. less than the figure for the preceding 12 months.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of the service has progressed further.  The principal change involved, namely, the replacement of morse point-to-point working by a modern teleprinter automatic switching network between the main centres, based on a telegraph automatic exchange at Dublin, is now virtually completed.  The telephoning of short-distance messages directly from originating to delivery office has also been extended.  The two measures have enabled a large amount of the expensive retransmission work at intermediate centres to be eliminated. The fall in the level of traffic in conjunction with the new techniques have already made it possible to reduce the operating staff by 180, or roughly by one-third, and further reduction will be effected within the coming year.  In addition, the full time delivery force has been reduced by 158 or about 44 per cent.</P>
    <P>Delivery of telegrams represents a very difficult problem in small towns and rural areas where the number of telegrams, in many cases only a few a week, does not warrant the employment of a full-time messenger.  The normal alternative of delivery by casual messengers on a fee basis is not a very satisfactory system, but it is the best that can be devised without incurring exorbitant delivery costs. The question of improving the position is, however, receiving constant attention.  More extended use of motorcycles <Col N="378" /> at larger centres is proposed and experiments are being carried out in certain areas to determine to what extent certain kinds of non-urgent telegrams can be delivered in batches or by next post without disadvantage to sender or addressee.</P>
    <P>The measures of reorganisation which have been effected and the increase in charges have reduced the telegraph loss substantially&mdash;from £378,000 in 1954-55 to £195,000 in 1956-57, the latest year for which audited figures are available.  But the loss is still heavy and every effort will be made to reduce it still further.</P>
    <P>The one bright spot in this picture is the telex service, which still continues to grow.  During the year 28 subscribers were added to the network, bringing the total to 63, which is over four times the number with which the service started little more than two years ago.  The total telex traffic during the year amounted to some 72,000 messages.</P>
    <P>Growth of the telephone service was well maintained during 1957.  Local calls at 95,750,000 and trunk calls at 14,500,000 showed increases of 4 per cent. and 5 per cent. over the corresponding figures for 1956.  Almost 9,000 new subscribers' exchange lines were installed, which was little short of the previous record figure, despite storm damage in the early months of the year and the effects of capital restrictions.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are already aware, the telephone service, in common with other services which look to the Exchequer for their capital borrowings, has had to reduce the amount of capital works that it would otherwise undertake.  The best use of limited capital is being made to provide for subscribers' installation work and for necessary extensions of the exchange and trunk system.</P>
    <P>There has been no falling off in the demand for telephones.  Applications received in 1957 for new and removal telephones at 9,600-odd were greater than ever before and recent figures show no evidence of any slackening in this respect.  The bulk of the increased <Col N="379" /> demand is for residence telephones which, as compared with five years ago, is up by 70 per cent. over all and more than 100 per cent. outside the Dublin area.  The number of waiting applicants for telephones at the end of February, 1958, was 3,400, of which 1,450 were in course of being provided with service.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, telephones are being provided with little delay in the central city business area, apart from some isolated &ldquo;pockets&rdquo; of difficulty which are dealt with as they arise.  Over a large part of the Dublin suburbs also, there is little delay in providing service, but there are some areas where there is difficulty in providing lines, mainly because of shortage of underground cables.</P>
    <P>Outside Dublin, telephones are installed fairly soon after application at the larger centres where the plant position permits, but, in general, it is not practicable to deal with individual applications as they arise.  In order to secure the highest rate of connection, a planned programme is in operation for clearing waiting applications on an area basis.  This means that once an area has been cleared, construction staff cannot be sent to that area again for a fairly considerable time and subsequent applications, even those which do not require much work, must go on the waiting list.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, exceptions must be made for certain priority applicants, such as doctors, but it is necessary to keep such exceptions within strict limits, if the engineers are to be allowed to proceed with their planned clearance programme without frequent diversion of staff to attend to isolated new applications.  Apart from this, the general body of waiting applicants are entitled to expect that exceptional treatment will not be given to particular applications without very good reason.</P>
    <P>Forty-one new telephone kiosks were erected in 1957 and about the same number will be provided this year.</P>
    <P>In 1957, over 8,800 miles of trunk circuits were added to the trunk system, and at the end of the year trunk circuit mileage was some two and <Col N="380" /> three-quarter times greater than it was ten years ago.  During the coming 12 months over 8,000 miles of additional trunk circuits will be constructed throughout the country.  The bulk of this will be obtained, not by erecting additional wires, but by fitting three, six and 12-channel carrier equipment which enables additional conversation channels to be obtained from existing wires.  Returns show that over the greater part of the year some 86 per cent. of trunk calls are connected within five minutes and over 96 per cent. within 15 minutes.  The remaining 4 per cent may, of course, cover much longer delays in particular cases.  However, the routes on which long delays occur are known and they are receiving priority attention.</P>
    <P>The exchange services were improved during the year by the conversion to automatic working of 12 manual exchanges, including Limerick, Sligo, Drogheda, Naas and Longford, and by the extension and/or modernisation of over 100 other exchanges.  The conversion of Galway exchange which has been in hand for some time will be completed later this year.  Because of capital restrictions further conversion of manual exchanges to automatic working is being limited for the present to cases where manual operation cannot be continued without undue difficulty or deterioration of the service, or where automisation will show substantial savings or other advantages.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to Deputies to know that the range of dialling facilities is being gradually extended. Bray, Greystones and now Naas subscribers are able to dial trunk calls themselves to Dublin subscribers; later this year, Dublin subscribers will be given the facility of dialling to subscribers at these and other exchanges outside the Dublin local fee area.  The experiment whereby Athlone subscribers have been able to dial to Dublin, Cork and Waterford automatic areas themselves has worked very satisfactorily to date and the question of extending it is being considered.</P>
    <P>Long distance dialling by Athlone <Col N="381" /> subscribers has been in operation since March, 1957, and that was the first time that subscribers in any town in these islands were able to dial over such a distance.  I mention that as an illustration of the point that while we must naturally draw heavily on the experience and experiment of other bigger and wealthier countries in determining what we can do in the telephone service, we need not necessarily lag far behind them in putting new techniques into operation; as in this case we may even be in front of some of them.</P>
    <P>While the extension of trunk dialling on a national scale is something we can only plan for at this stage, it is important that the planning should be on the right lines.  The Department has accordingly availed of the facilities offered by the United Nations' Technical Assistance Scheme to secure the services of a foreign expert for a limited period and I am glad to say that a distinguished engineer from the Netherlands' Post Office is now in Dublin working with and advising my engineering staff on the problems involved in the eventual conversion of our whole local and trunk telephone system to automatic working.  The technical assistance scheme has also been availed of to send two of our own engineers abroad to study this and certain other specialised branches of telecommunications.</P>
    <P>Post Office Savings Bank deposits during 1957 amounted to £15,143,000, a decrease of £149,000 on 1956; withdrawals amounted to £14,513,000, a decrease of £178,000.  Estimating the interest for the year at £1,828,000, the total balance due to depositors at 31st December, 1957, was £76,000,000 approximately as compared with £73,500,000 at 31st December, 1956.</P>
    <P>Deposits by Trustee Savings Banks during the year amounted to £604,000, a decrease of £169,000, and withdrawals amounted to £586,000, a decrease of £104,000.  The balance to credit of the banks, including interest, at the end of the year was approximately £11,750,000.  Appreciable withdrawals were made from the Post Office Savings Bank and by the <Col N="382" /> Trustee Savings Banks for reinvestment in the National Loan, Savings Certificates and Prize Bonds.</P>
    <P>Actual sales of Savings Certificates in 1957 at £3,244,000 were £920,000 down on last year's record but still were higher than in any other year. Repayments of principal and interest totalling £2,663,000 were £289,000 less than the previous year's total of £2,952,000.  The amount of principal due to Savings Certificate holders at the end of the year was £21,792,000. At the instance of the Savings Committee, a new inducement to save was introduced on 2nd December last in the form of Savings Gift Tokens. Issued in denominations of £1 and 10/- and incorporating a greeting in the design, these tokens are valid for deposit in the Post Office Savings Bank or for the purchase of Savings Certificates; they are not exchangeable for cash.  Sales of these tokens during December amounted to close on £2,000.  This is a reasonably good response to something new that will naturally take some time to become established with the public as a new method of gift giving.</P>
    <P>The only significant addition to the long list of other services given by the Department was the sale of Prize Bonds.  Our post offices throughout the country played a big part in this, being responsible for just under 35 per cent. of the total of the three Prize Bond issues to date.  As a whole, there was little change in the other services though the increased popularity of newspaper competitions was responsible for a large jump in the number, though not the value, of postal orders issued.  A melancholy factor is the unabated decline in the number of dog licences sold.  This decline has marched step by step with a rise in the number of wireless licences.  Perhaps it is cause and effect.</P>
    <P>Last year, new post offices were provided at Athenry and Cootehill and the reconstruction of Kilkenny Post Office was completed.  Work is in progress on the erection of new post office and telephone exchange buildings at Galway and Letterkenny and on automatic telephone exchange buildings <Col N="383" /> at Dundrum, Stillorgan Road (Dublin) and Skerries.  Reconstruction or improvement works are in progress at Loughrea, Castlebar, Nenagh and Donegal Post Offices.</P>
    <P>During the coming year, it is expected that work will commence on new post offices and telephone exchanges at Droichead Nua and Youghal, new telephone exchange buildings at Ennis, Cork City, Kinsale, Midleton and Walkinstown and new district sorting offices at Crumlin and Churchtown.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made in considering the proposals for the new central sorting office at Dublin and the way is now clear for the preparation of the contract drawings by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The number of staff specifically provided for in the Estimate, 16,064, shows a reduction of 363 on the number for the previous year.  As against this, a lump sum provision has been made under sub-head I (1) to cover the employment of additional men on telephone development work.  It can be taken, however, that the net reduction in staff employed will be over 200.  The reduction is mainly in the postman, post office clerk and telephonist grades and is due to the telegraph reorganisation and revised postal arrangements.</P>
    <P>The departmental council set up under the Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration scheme continues to do much useful work in fostering good relations between the Department and the staff.  During the year, the council dealt with a variety of subjects including up-grading claims, the launching of a new staff suggestions scheme and the treatment of redundancy arising from the telegraph reorganisation and the closing of railway telegraph offices. Of 11 subjects on which discussions were completed, agreement was reached on eight and part agreement on one.</P>
    <P>The staff suggestions scheme is open to all members of the staff and replaces an older scheme which was confined to the engineering and stores branch grades.  Under the new scheme, awards may be made to members of the staff for suggestions related to the <Col N="384" /> improvement of organisation or methods of work.  The response to the scheme has been encouraging and to date a total of 352 suggestions have been received.  Of these 70 have already qualified for award and 155 are still being examined.</P>
    <P>Working methods and organisation in the Department are under continuous review with the object of increasing efficiency and reducing costs. To take one instance, the telephone accounts sections are now run on a mechanised system, the particular arrangements adopted having been decided upon after careful trials of a number of alternatives.  We are able to prepare accounts more speedily under the new system; in addition it has given us staff savings of the order of £20,000 a year.  In another sphere new arrangements for registration and filing of documents in the secretariat have effected considerable savings in accommodation and furniture.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the Department's working during 1956-7 resulted in a small profit&mdash;£30,891, to be exact. This is appreciably better than the forecast given by the then Minister when the Estimate was being discussed last year; in point of fact, that forecast underestimated the amount of postal revenue we would receive.  However, it is pardonable to err on the right side.  For the year just ended, we expect to make a somewhat bigger profit, but it will be some time before a firm figure is available.</P>
    <P>The circumstance that a profit has been made in each of the last two years, even though modest in comparison with the size of our operations, stands out as a happy contrast to the rather dismal picture of the losses incurred in each of the previous nine years from 1947-8 to 1955-6.  For that transformation, all my predecessors are to be congratulated.  The balancing of the Department's accounts has been one matter on which successive Governments have seen eye to eye; all have taken the line that the money to pay for the running of the Department must come from those who use its services and not from the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the increases in costs that we have had to contend <Col N="385" /> with, our charges are reasonable by contrast with other European countries and our standards of service can stand similar comparisons.  Two factors which have helped us in maintaining charges at a lower level than might have been otherwise possible are the steady increase in postal and telephone traffic and the unremitting efforts to find more efficient ways of doing things in all branches of the Department.</P>
    <P>The recent increase in Civil Service pay has, however, introduced a new factor into the situation.  I have not yet had time to study the position closely; but it seems clear that there is not enough margin in the present profit level to absorb the extra expenditure. That being so, ways and means of redressing the balance in the accounts must be found, since, as I have said already, no Government could accept the idea of asking the taxpayer to subsidise the Post Office. Since I have not had an opportunity to go into all the factors involved, the most I can say, at this stage, is that the situation caused by the recent increase in costs must receive most serious consideration.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I should like to express my appreciation of the zealous and efficient service given by all grades of staff during the past year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, on this occasion, just as on the last occasion when we were discussing wireless broadcasting, to congratulate the acting-Minister on his very clear statement on the work of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  As some Deputies stated to-day, there is a big contrast between the way he, as acting-Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, produced his Estimate and gave all the details as far as he possibly could, so that Deputies would clearly understand the position, and that of another Minister. In fact, the Minister has given such detail that, so far as I am concerned, and I am sure so far as other members of this House are concerned, there is very little to be said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs is certainly decentralised.  Its impact is felt throughout the whole country, even in the very remotest <Col N="386" /> areas, because there you have the post offices, the sub-post offices, the postmen, established and unestablished. It is the one service which the people of this country like very much and against which they can have scarcely any grievance.  Especially is that so since the daily delivery of mails was brought into operation.  I believe that in all areas&mdash;with, perhaps, very few exceptions&mdash;that service is now being given by the Post Office.  The people living in rural areas receive the postman with open arms, except perhaps when he brings had news about a bill they owe.  He brings the news from their children and their friends and also a great deal of local gossip, if he has the time.  For that reason, the Post Office has done very well in introducing the daily delivery of letters.</P>
    <P>In spite of all that extra work, no extra postmen have been appointed, but those already in the service got more work to do and have longer hours and, therefore, their pay was increased. That gave them more or less a living wage.  In spite of all the increased services, there is a profit, as the Minister says, of £30,891.  Great credit is due to the Department over the past ten years.  All the past Ministers continued to improve the mail delivery service.  After all, it is only right that persons who live in remote areas, in pockets among the mountains, principally in the South and West, should have their mails delivered to them each day.</P>
    <P>I suggest that an extension of the telephone service in rural areas is very desirable, for remote glens among the mountains.  There are many of those in my constituency and if a priest or doctor is urgently required it is necessary to travel&mdash;walk, cycle or hire a motor-car&mdash;to the nearest post office.  Telephone services have been introduced in many of those remote areas and I am sure it must cost a good deal.</P>
    <P>There is one area in my constituency, adjacent to the famous Gap of Dunloe, where there is a valley and the nearest post office in either direction is about 12 miles away.  The local people must travel, year in and year out, over very difficult and very high roads, to get to <Col N="387" /> the post office or to contact the priest, the doctor, or whomsoever they require.  The Board of Works and An Bord Fáilte have in the past nine or ten years requested the Department to set up a telephone service there, in a house called the Toll House.  It is central, in a large valley or glen at the head of the upper lake, where the tourists leave the ponies and take the boat to go back to Killarney.  Tourists have expressed surprise that such a service is not available.</P>
    <P>It would be costly to provide it, but the number of tourists who would make use of it and the benefit it would confer on those living in that vast mountain valley would make it pay eventually. So far as I know, it is the only place in my area which requires such a service.  In other areas, perhaps not so remote or not so costly, telephone provision has been made.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the setting up of a scheme of conciliation and arbitration. That, of course, is beneficial. There is one section of postmen to which I should refer, the auxiliary postmen.  They are, in official language, &ldquo;unestablished&rdquo;; and when they reach pension age, they leave the service without a gratuity or pension of any kind, so that a postman who has given faithful and efficient service for 40 or 50 years finds his position much disimproved when he retires.  During his period of active service, his wages were very low&mdash;and they are still too low.  If any servants of Government Departments deserve to be treated well, they are our postmen, whether they are city, town or rural.  I speak especially on behalf of the rural postmen.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it would be fair to speak of the type of uniform used by postmen.  It may be comfortable, but somehow I have always thought it is not the right type.  Perhaps some steps could be taken to improve, not only the material of the garments, but also the colour.  I do not suggest they should be dressed in green.</P>

      <P>That would not be distinctive enough.  I come now to the pay <Col N="388" /> and emoluments of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.  They have to perform manifold duties.  They deal with the distribution of the mails, their reception in the morning, distribution to the postmen for the various areas, the mails coming back and so on.  They have to deal with the public during the whole of a long day.  They have to deal with people coming for dog licences.  I notice in the Minister's statement that that number has declined, although I would say there are more dogs in the country now than ever before.  They have to deal with radio licences, telegrams and telephones. They have very long hours and many peculiar duties to perform.  They work from 8 or 8.30 in the morning, sometimes to as late as 6 o'clock in the evening.</P>
      <P>We have heard at various times that the salary they get&mdash;if it could be called a salary&mdash;is very meagre.  It has been put forward that such people will have some other sideline because there will be a shop attached to a local post office; but so far as I can see, these people are so busy that they cannot do that because they could not attend to the shop side of it and it would not pay them to hire an assistant.  Post office staff, especially those to whom I have referred, auxiliary postmen and established postmen, too, and sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, deserve an increase in their remuneration. In fact, it is rather unfortunate sometimes that one reads of postmen getting into trouble.  I must say, however, that it is only a very small percentage who do get into trouble and it is perhaps very hard to blame them in some cases when they may have big family responsibilities and may be tempted to do something wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not, of course, have any pity for a postman who does something wrong because of gambling or drinking, but for people in Government Departments, and especially those in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, who are scattered all over the country in the cities, towns and the remotest rural areas, who are working efficiently and to the satisfaction of all sections of the people, provision should be made for an increase in pay as soon <Col N="389" /> as possible when the financial stringency has passed away.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to pay a tribute to the courtesy which people have always received from sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses and their staffs and from postmasters and postmistresses, too, as well as those who deliver the mails, telegrams and everything connected with the service. Even when the staffs are very busy, the people have received nothing but the greatest courtesy from the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to say that I deeply regret the fact that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has been stricken with illness so soon after his appointment to the position.  I should like to express to him my very sincere sympathy on the trial through which he is passing and I ask the acting-Minister to convey that expression of my sympathy to him.  I am sure the whole House will regret that this new and promising Minister has been afflicted with a disability which has temporarily rendered him unable to discharge his official duties.  We all wish him well and hope that he will soon be back again.</P>
      <P>I was intrigued by a sentence or two on Page 12 of the Minister's speech, as circulated.  I should like to find out from the acting-Minister what is intended by this comment.  It is certainly beyond me.  The statement reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A melancholy factor is the unabated decline in the number of dog licences sold.  This decline has marched step by step with a rise in the number of wireless licences. Perhaps it is cause and effect.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>How anybody came to associate dog licences with wireless licences, I do not know.  I do not know whether it is a regret that the revenue from dog licences has shown a decline, or whether it is a comparison between the music of dogs and the music of our national radio service, but surely it has some meaning.  I should like the Minister to tell us what economics it is sought to demonstrate.</P>

      <P>It baffles me and I thought it would baffle the acting-Minister. To turn to the Estimate proper, I must congratulate the Minister and the Department on the surplus on the year's working, that is, the year 1956-57.  I should like to bracket with that observation congratulations to the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Mr. Keyes, in whose control the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was during that period. Last year, the then Minister prophesied that there would be a deficit on the year's working, that is, on the year 1956-57, of £146,000.  That gloomy prognostication has happily been falsified by the facts, because, instead of a deficit of £146,000 on the account of that year, the Minister is able to announce that in fact there was a surplus of £30,000 that year.  The estimate of the deficit therefore was, in fact, out by something less than £180,000, comparing the accounts to-day with what it was believed the accounts would contain when that prophecy was made last year.  That is a very satisfactory position, especially in view of the continued development of the Department's services and the constant expansion of existing services so as to provide the public with a still better service of tele-communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech refers to the growing efficiency of the Post Office services.  I have been in many countries over a long period of years and I can say that, for size and population, the tele-communication service of this country in general compares very favourably, and the charges in many instances more than favourably, with the services and charges in other countries throughout the world.  It is true that we cannot provide the mammoth services of highly industrialised countries, but if you get down to a minute comparison of our services and <Col N="391" /> charges with the services and charges of any country that could be regarded as being reasonably comparable with us, the comparison will not be to our disadvantage and in a great many cases will be to our advantage.</P>
    <P>In that respect, I think, notably, the telephone services stand out as a brilliant example of development, particularly in recent years.  We have now a phone service of which all citizens are entitled to feel proud.  It is true that you may get the occasional person who complains about getting a wrong number, never considering whether he may have contributed something to that result by not asking for the right number or by dialling a number other than the one he intended to dial.</P>
    <P>When one has regard to the millions of trunk calls that go through, the millions and millions of local calls accurately made every minute of the day, I think it is cause for congratulation that we have developed a telephone service of which the country can really feel pround.  The fact that in recent years the speed of answering for trunk calls has improved out of all recognition, compared with 15 or 20 years ago, is another reason for congratulation. Generally speaking, the Post Office, which is usually a modest and shy Department, so far as its achievements are concerned, is entitled to feel proud not merely of what it has been able to do as regards post office services generally but of what it has been able to do in a particular way in developing the telephone service.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say, on page 13 of his speech, that the Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme continues to do useful work in fostering good relations between the Department and the staff, and that during the year a variety of subjects were discussed through the medium of that machinery; that agreement was reached on eight of the 11 subjects so discussed and that part agreement was reached on one subject. That is a commendable record and there is no doubt whatever that a continuance of that kind of relationship is <Col N="392" /> bound in the long run, not merely to improve the conditions for the staff, but to engender a new spirit of cooperation and understanding and an appreciation of the need for promoting the greatest possible measure of efficiency in the service, paralleled by the promoting of the greatest possible measure of contentment among the staff.</P>
    <P>I think the conciliation and arbitration scheme has wrought a magnificent change in the relationship between the Department and the staff.  Consultation has now been substituted for conflict, suspicion and misunderstanding and I hope, so far as the Department is concerned, it will play its part in ensuring there will be a continuance of that general atmosphere and that desirable climate for the continued operation of the conciliation and arbitration machinery.</P>
    <P>On this Estimate last year, I raised the question of redundancy in the Post Office clerk grade in consequence of telegraph reorganisation brought about by the virtual abolition of morse work, particularly in the Central Telegraph Office and by the substantial fall in telegraph traffic.  I understand that the problem of redundancy has been dealt with to some extent during the year, in the Central Telegraph Office, but that there is still a redundancy of staff in that office, the disposal of which presents a problem to the Department, on the one hand, and to the staff on the other.  The staff feel they may be uprooted and transferred elsewhere to their own disadvantage.  I understand the redundancy problem is represented by in or about 30 redundant officers, that is, officers who are not normally required on the establishment, but who, of course, continue to work from day to day because other officers have been switched elsewhere to take up the sag in the redundancy.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister last year, and I want to repeat the suggestion this year, that it should be possible in the entire Civil Service to absorb the 30 redundant officers, not necessarily the redundant officers in person, but it should be possible to lift 30 officers out of the Central Telegraph Office and place them in some of the other <Col N="393" /> Government Departments.  By spreading them over all Government Departments, no Department would be asked to take a large number of them, although, of course, they are all very efficient officers, but they need not impact seriously on the staffing of other Departments.  If that were done, the redundancy problem would be brought to a happy conclusion from the point of view of the Department, and I am sure the staff would welcome a solution of the problem along these lines which would cause a minimum of disturbance, so far as they are concerned.  I should like to know whether that aspect of the matter is being examined, as the Minister promised it would be, during the year and, if so, has the Minister any hope of finding a solution to the problem along these reasonable lines?</P>
    <P>The question of the provision of post office buildings was referred to in the Minister's speech on page 12, where he refers to the fact that progress has been made in considering proposals for the central sorting office in Dublin and added that the way is now clear for the preparation of contract drawings by the Office of Public Works.  Anything that moves in the direction of eliminating the present distillery-cum-sorting office in Dublin is to be commended and, I take it, this statement by the Minister is an indication that some progress has been made during the year.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he could say how long, approximately, it will be before the drawings have been prepared by the Board of Works and when it is expected it will be possible to invite tenders for the erection of the buildings on the new site in Dublin?  This is a matter which has been discussed here over the past 30 years or more, and I do not want to go into further details now, but I hope the Minister will give us some target dates and that he may be able to say when it is likely the contract drawings will be completed, so that tenders can be invited for the work.  Even if some of us do not live to see the erection of the new sorting office, at least we shall be able to leave this earth with a timetable indicating when it would be completed, <Col N="394" /> if we had lived long enough to see it.</P>
    <P>On the question of Post Office buildings generally, the Minister referred to the fact that some new buildings were erected during the year and that others were renovated, that others had some structural alterations carried out to them.  All that is commendable, but as the Minister must know&mdash;certainly his Department would know&mdash;there are many offices throughout the country which are utterly unsuitable for use as modern post offices.  They provide inadequate space for the public and inadequate accommodation for the staff to discharge their onerous and exacting duties.  There is a big back-log of reconstruction and renovation work to be undertaken and I am afraid that at the rate at which work is progressing, the new problems in respect of buildings will supervene on those which are already there.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Post Office has worked out any plan whereby they hope, within a period of years, to overtake arrears of work in this respect or whether they are working to any time-table which would indicate that we can see the end of the problem within an ascertainable period of years.  Perhaps in that connection the Minister would give us some information as to what the Department's policy is and when it is likely that this matter of providing adequate premises will be dealt with in a planned and systematic way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the House will have seen, in the last few weeks, reports in the newspapers indicating that there is considerable public apprehension in Thomastown, County Kilkenny, and in Abbeyleix, County Laois, regarding the reduction of the status of the post offices in these two towns. The local people are naturally aggrieved that the status of these two offices are being reduced and that in future, instead of having offices owned by the State and staffed by efficient and competent regular staffs, they will have to be content with premises provided by a sub-postmaster or a sub-postmistress wherever these people can get accommodation.  In the future, they are to be denied the services provided by trained, experienced and competent Post Office officials.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear to the people in these two towns that, in future, they are to get a service which is less efficient than the service they have been getting in the past.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs will not contend that the services provided in a scale-payment office are nearly as good as the service provided in offices manned by trained and competent post-office officials.  I would like to ascertain what is behind the Post Office policy in that respect.  Is there any reason why these permanent staffs should be interfered with?</P>
      <P>The present status was enjoyed by these offices away back in the British régime, and the people of these towns have enjoyed the present services for 35 years under an Irish Government. Now at this stage, the Post Office has made up its mind to reduce the status of these offices and to give the townspeople concerned an inferior service to that which they now have.  What is the reason for that?  Is the reason to save money at the expense of the local people in the towns concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staffs in these offices will, when their status has been reduced, be transferred elsewhere.  The Department is well aware that when you transfer people from their home towns, <Col N="401" /> where they have lived and have friends, to places where they have never lived and have no friends you cause considerable dislocation in their domestic arrangements.  Where the transfer involves a married man moving his family and furniture, the effect is much more serious.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Post Office is going to provide at Abbeyleix and Thomastown a second-class service for the townspeople in these areas.  No one will say that the service in a scale-payment office is comparable with the service in a post office owned and controlled by the Department itself.  I should like to ascertain if it is intended to embark on a policy of deliberately down-grading offices in order to save money and to provide inferior services for the people concerned.  Are Thomastown and Abbeyleix the harbingers of what is yet to come?  Are many more offices scheduled for down-grading in this way?</P>
    <P>I should like to ask whether the Post Office has any intention of up-grading offices from scale-payment status so that they will be controlled and staffed by the Post Office itself.  Many of the scale payment offices, particularly in towns of a population of 3,000 and upwards, are now being staffed on a unitary basis, on the scale payment basis, and not by regular Post Office staff, although the volume of business is possibly equal to the volume in other towns, not staffed by regular Post Office staff, although the volume of business at some of these offices is possibly equal to the volume of business in other towns where the offices are staffed by regular Post Office personnel.</P>
    <P>I should like to get to the bottom of the policy in this respect.  Is this just a stab at Abbeyleix?  Is it a stab at Thomastown?  Is it part of a general policy to be pursued in the future and is there to be any countervailing advantage from the point of view of up-grading scale payments at offices where that up-grading would be justified?  I am sure other Deputies who represent the constituency in which these towns are situated will have something to say on this matter. <Col N="402" /> There seems no reason why, when the status of these offices has withstood the British administration, has withstood 35 years of Irish administration, they should be selected in the year 1958 for a reduction in their status, which means, as I said before, giving the public a less efficient service than they have now and than they have had up to now.</P>
    <P>I wish also to make reference to a question which has been raised in this House on a number of occasions and which I understood during the past few years was the subject of examination, if not by the Post Office Department alone, perhaps jointly by that Department and the Department of Finance.  I refer to the question of pensions or gratuities for auxiliary postmen.  As the House knows from previous discussion on the subject, an auxiliary postman may serve the Post Office for 40 or 50 years.  He may be required to leave the service and he has no right&mdash;I underline the word &ldquo;right&rdquo;&mdash;to a single penny gratuity or a single penny pension from the Post Office Department.  It is true that if he is reduced to a condition of penury and if he is in financial prostration, he may appeal for a grant from the Minister's special fund, but if his income&mdash;either because he has an acre or two of land or because he has a son and daughter who help to keep him in the winter of life&mdash;reaches a certain level, which is a low level, the Post Office do not pay as much as one farthing pension or gratuity to that man for 40 or 50 years' service.</P>
    <P>I had thought in recent years there was a disposition to recognise that that was something that called for redress.  I understood the matter was under examination during the past two years or thereabouts.  I should like to ascertain from the Minister if he could now say what stage has been reached in this examination of the position of auxiliary postmen, and whether there is any likelihood that a scheme will be introduced in the reasonably near future which will provide a pension or gratuity for those officers who have served the Post Office and the community for a long number of years, and who because of <Col N="403" /> the auxiliary status which they have, unfortunately are denied the right of pension which is possessed by established officers.</P>
    <P>I am sure there would be goodwill on all sides of the House to do something for this class.  There are aproximately 2,500 of them employed throughout the postal services to-day. I am sure also that neither those whom they serve daily nor this House, which is ultimately responsible for their employment and conditions of service, could reasonably grudge the payment to them of a pension or gratuity in recognition of their long and faithful service.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to let me have some information in respect of the points I have raised.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my colleagues, I should like to join with Deputy Norton in offering my sympathy to the Minister on his illness and to wish him a speedy recovery. I hope we shall see him back in the House in a short time and I would ask the acting-Minister to convey our good wishes to him for a speedy recovery.</P>
      <P>I wish to say a few words on the telephonists in the various exchanges in this country.  I should like to congratulate the majority of them and to criticise a minority of them.  The acting-Minister is the Minister for Defence and in the Army we have certain standard phrases for conveying to people words of command and intentions. I only wish that could be superimposed on the staffs of our telephone exchanges.  If possible, the Minister should draw up a book of standard phrases which would be used by the staff of all telephone exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In certain countries abroad where I had the privilege of travelling, I was very much impressed by the responses which I received from the various exchanges which I rang up to make inquiries.  In America, I noticed that the first response I got was: &ldquo;Can I help you, sir?&rdquo;&mdash;a very encouraging inquiry.  If you ring up some of our exchanges here and make an inquiry as to the number of a certain subscriber, <Col N="404" /> you are told: &ldquo;Have you not got a directory yourself?  Could you not look it up?  A friend of mine quite recently told me he wished to ring up his girl friend in Zurich.  He rang the local exchange and said he wished to put through a personal call to Miss So-and-So in Zurich, and the reply was: &ldquo;Could you not get one nearer home?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>She happened to be an Irish air hostess who was in Zurich.  She was a local girl.  However, I am suggesting that there should be some standard phrases in the various exchanges and that these standard phrases should be bilingual for Irish-speaking districts.  Again in this country of welcomes, I notice that if your time has expired, you are generally told: &ldquo;You must dry up or we shall cut you off.  We are sorry.&rdquo; Surely there is some other phrase which could be used.  It is all right for us because we understand, but visitors are not impressed.  The Minister should adopt in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs the same method as he adopts in his own Department, that of standard phrases to convey intentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period when Deputy Everett was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, at the request of Deputies from the West and North West, including Donegal, we had installed on our islands radio telephones.  They were a tremendous advantage to the islanders occupying these outposts on the Atlantic coast.  Unfortunately in recent years these telephones are not securing <Col N="405" /> the service they should.  Sometimes they are broken down for weeks and no effort is made to repair them.  The engineering section of the Department should endeavour to keep up the good work inaugurated by Deputy Everett and the late Deputy Keyes.  If they do that, they will be doing a considerable service for our islanders.</P>
    <P>I should like to support Deputy Palmer in his plea for the establishment of telephones in isolated rural areas.  He mentioned the famous Gap of Dunloe.  There are many Gaps of Dunloe throughout the country, one of them spelled with a &ldquo;g.&rdquo;  There are two areas in Dungloe in my native county.  I refer to Dunlewey with a vista of the Poison Glen, a vista second to none in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Birmingham tweed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Birmingham tweed manufactured in Dunlewey and sold abroad as Birmingham tweed.  It would be a very good thing if we could have a telephone installed there and another at the top of Loughanure, at Lettercagh.  I am sure Deputy Cunningham and others know isolated pockets, too, and the installation of telephones in these pockets would be an advantage to tourists, to locals and to those who require either medical or spiritual assistance in an emergency.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton referred to the reduction in status of certain post offices. That reduction is evidence of the exodus from the country.  Emigration is the cause of that reduction.  This is the first Department which has admitted that, and that reduction in status will continue until we stop the flow of emigration.  It is only now we are beginning to feel it and it is only now that this Department has pinpointed the situation by reducing the status of various post offices throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the recruitment of temporary postmen.  I would appeal to the Minister to change the present system.  If a temporary postman is required, he is recruited from the local labour exchange.  Irrespective of whether the applicant is literate or <Col N="406" /> illiterate he is offered the post.  The only qualifications are that he must have a large family and be drawing a certain amount of unemployment assistance. If he does not take the post, he is immediately disqualified for unemployment assistance.  I know men absolutely illiterate, who have accepted posts as temporary postmen simply because they were afraid they would lose their unemployment assistance. They could not afford to wait until such time as their cases were investigated. They are going around delivering the post.  They meet somebody on the crossroads who tells them who the recipients are and where they live.  I am not exaggerating.  I know men in Fintown who cannot write their names and they have been offered posts as temporary postmen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Shame on it!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Shame on the system, rather, which has left them in that position.  These were unfortunate men who had to migrate when they were very young.  They are not literary geniuses who can read and write bilingually.  I would appeal to the Minister to refrain from this method of recruiting temporary postmen and adopt some other method. Let some other standard be the guide rather than the number of children they have or the amount of unemployment assistance they are drawing.</P>
      <P>I should like to appeal also for more letter boxes in rural areas.  Deputy Keyes made a very serious effort as Minister to rectify the lack of letter boxes in various parts of the country. In my opinion there should be letter box outside every school in rural areas. The schoolchild is very often the family messenger and, when letters have to be posted, they are given to the children on their way to school.  As some Deputies know, the local teacher is very often the scribe for his parish.  He is sometimes the secretary of a political organisation.  He would find it most convenient to have a letter box outside his school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was in the national school it was a blessing that we did not have a letter box because I always got off <Col N="407" /> half an hour earlier on Friday to post the master's letters.  I was the only child in the school with a bicycle and I looked forward to Friday because I got home half an hour earlier.  Had there been a letter box outside the school I would not have got off.  It would be an advantage nowadays to have a letter box.  I do not think the cost of providing it would be very high. There are isolated pockets in which there are letter boxes but they are never used.  They were erected in the old days to satisfy the secretary of some Fianna Fáil Cumann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>They were erected in places where they would be most serviceable in his time.  A good few were removed from these isolated pockets by Deputy Keyes.  I am referring to the bad old days before the present Minister had anything to do with it, when Fianna Fáil held out the promise that they would erect letter boxes for certain people.  That was before even I came into politics. Some of the boxes are still in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in the days before the schoolteachers switched over to another political Party.  I understand that we are at the moment in process of erecting a new post office in Letter-kenny. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that an automatic telephone exchange is also erected there.  In Tralee, and other towns, the central exchange for the whole county is now centred in one area.  We know the advantage that is to subscribers.  When the Minister comes to finalise the plans for Letter-kenny I appeal to him to incorporate in them an automatic telephone exchange and when finances are available, I hope we shall segregate the telephone exchanges from sub-post offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present in many parts of rural Ireland the sub-post offices are located in business premises for the want of a better place.  So also is the telephone <Col N="408" /> exchange with the result that, if you want to make a telephone call from one of these sub-post offices, every customer in the grocery shop or the confectionery shop, as the case may be, is listening to the call.  It is bad enough to see the little girl in the exchange listening in to what you are saying, as she can often do through the glass in the telephone box, but it is too bad when the public are aware of the private conversations conducted in these isolated rural exchanges.  If the Minister can see his way to pay any attention to the suggestions I have made, it will be for the benefit of the Department in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an Estimate of over £8,000,000, a comparatively high figure for this Department.  This is not a Department in regard to which one can have heated discussion, but it is a very important Department in our economy.  There is a matter I want to bring to the Minister's attention and I would be glad if he would attend to it as expeditiously as possible.  It is a matter which I condemn and about which I have received many complaints in the past few months.  It is the discrepancy between the rate of progress in regard to the installation of telephones in the provinces as against Dublin City.</P>
      <P>I have received very many complaints recently with regard to the delay in the installation of telephones in my own constituency, particularly in Dundalk and the surrounding area. I have given details to the Minister himself and he very courteously and kindly undertook to look into them.  I am glad to say I have met with a small measure of success in regard to one case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of reasons for stressing this matter.  When a telephone is installed in any business premises or private house we can describe it as an investment in production. Generally speaking, it is business people who apply for these telephones. If they have not the use of this essential modern amenity, it means their business will be greatly retarded and they will be in an unfair position as against their competitors. <Col N="409" /> I hope the acting-Minister will do what he can to level up the rate of installation as between the provinces and Dublin City.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the rate of progress in the provinces when introducing the Estimate and said he hoped to have many of the cases attended to fairly soon.  I know of one particular case of a person with a small business situated on a main road between two exchanges.  Over 12 months ago this person made application for a telephone and he has not got it yet.  That is one of the cases I mentioned to the Minister himself and I am glad to say that attention will be given to it very soon.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate there is very great difficulty in regard to the installation of telephones generally, especially in rural areas.  As the Minister pointed out, the system is to appoint construction gangs who go around each area and install these telephones, something akin to the methods used in the rural electrification scheme.  I sympathise with the Minister but I want to point out to him that there is a great discrepancy between the rate of progress in Dublin and in the provinces.  That is neither fair nor just.</P>
    <P>One of the explanations given to me for so much attention being paid to Dublin City is that when housing schemes are being built the cables which are required for the telephones are laid in advance of the housing scheme.  Some people were inclined to condemn that procedure.  Obviously that procedure must be adopted because it would be very wrong to build the houses first and then rip up the roads and pathways which had been concreted in order to put down the telephone cables.  I do not accept that explanation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate as well that, due to the financial exigencies of the present time, progress must necessarily be fairly slow.  The Minister pointed out that 9,000 extra applications had been dealt with last year.  It would be very interesting to find out what proportion of these 9,000 relates to Dublin as against the provinces.</P>
    <P>I am doubtful about the necessity <Col N="410" /> for these commemorative stamps which are issued occasionally.  I do not know what the cost is but I know that from time to time stamps are issued to commemorate patriots, religious figures and so forth.  That is all very laudable in itself but, if the cost is exorbitant, I do not think there is any need to issue so many of these stamps so often.  If we could confine ourselves to issuing certain stamps for a longer period of time, it would make for better economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse the remarks of those Deputies who urged the Minister to pay attention to the erection of sub-post offices where they are very urgently required, especially in the built-up areas.  Over the past number of years many of our towns have grown out of all proportion with the result that quite a sizable portion of the population are very much handicapped because they have to travel great distances to avail of the post office services.  I would exhort the Minister to be as attentive as he possibly can in this matter.</P>
    <P>I have nothing else to say except to add my voice to those of Deputies who expressed the hope that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will have a speedy recovery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I wish to associate myself with the good wishes to the Minister for a speedy recovery and hope that he may soon be restored to take charge of his Department.</P>
      <P>I was very interested to hear from the Minister's opening statement that for the past two years a profit has been made by the Department.  That was very different from what I felt would be the case before I heard the Minister's statement.  I thought that the Minister would make the case that there had been a big loss for the past number of years and that, therefore, economies would have to be made.  That case has been put up by some of his supporters in Kilkenny, with the result that in one of the principal towns of County Kilkenny, the status of the post office has been down-graded to that of sub-post office.  It is difficult to understand the mentality of the Minister's advisers in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> In Thomastown, a site was purchased a year or two ago for the erection of a new post office and that was considered a proper course to take.  Recently, a notice appeared seeking applicants for a sub-post office.  Thomastown is one of the most progressive towns in the country.  Outside the town there is one of the principal stud farms in the country and a very large flour industry. In recent months the people there have shown their enterprise by establishing a cattle market the cost of which was between £12,000 and £15,000.  That is no mean effort on the part of people of a town of the size of Thomastown.  The farmers in the hinterland are very enterprising farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be very well advised to re-examine this matter.  If there had been losses in the post office service which necessitated pruning, there would be some case but, as the Minister has said to-day that there is a reasonable surplus&mdash;it may not be a very big amount&mdash;there is no reason why that post office should be reduced. Thomastown has had a principal post office since the service was first established. There is even more reason for such a post office now than there was formerly because of the fact that the post office carries out many more functions. Children's allowances, old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions are paid through the post office.  People do not like to have to go to an ordinary business house or huckster's shop to get the payments to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>There is also the consideration that people buy prize bonds through the post office.  When they do so, they have the confidence that the people behind the counter are paid civil servants and are bound to secrecy.  A person who buys prize bonds likes to feel that nobody knows that he has done so.  To have this service carried out in an ordinary shop changes the whole position. The people in Thomastown who have had a first rate service since the post office was established are to be given a second rate service.  They will not have the trained and competent staffs that they have enjoyed up to the present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> The Minister mentioned that a new central sorting office was to be established in Dublin.  Is Dublin to be regarded as the whole country?  Is all the surplus money to be devoted to the development of the post office in Dublin rather than in the country?  Is this Government again showing that they are controlled from Dublin, that they are the complete Dublin Government who do not mind whether they denude the country of Civic Guard barracks or post offices?  Is that what the people of the country are to believe, that they are being ruled by people who are resident in Dublin and have a Dublin outlook?</P>
    <P>The Government may talk about decentralisation. Some of the post offices in the country should be up-graded rather than that the ordinary post office should be down-graded.  The people in Thomastown held a very representative meeting.  Every class and creed was represented.  Everybody there supported the plea that, not alone should the status of the existing post office not be reduced, but that the new post office which was envisaged a couple of years ago should be erected. That would be a great addition to the town.</P>
    <P>I have not received any complaints about the post office service in general.  I am very pleased that a new post office has been erected in the City of Kilkenny but the staffing there at times is not adequate.  Sometimes there are queues there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It had better be fortified, now that you have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We had better hold on to it.  I would appeal to the Minister and the Government to get away from the Dublin outlook and from the idea of erecting a central post office and a central sorting office in Dublin and, if there is a surplus, to devote it to towns like Thomastown. The status of a town is reduced when the status of the post office is reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the Minister is not here to listen to my appeal.  I know the acting-Minister will convey it to the Government.  I would have preferred to have had the ear of the Minister so <Col N="413" /> that I could try to change his mind, that he would see my point and would not take the action proposed.  The matter has not gone very far and I appeal to the acting-Minister to bring the points I have raised before the Government and ask them to allow the status of this post office to remain unchanged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to the voices of Deputy Crotty and Deputy Norton in appealing to the Minister to continue unchanged the post office in Thomastown.  It is not in my constituency but I travel through Kilkenny a good deal and a number of people from the area have approached me.  In addition to the complaints about Thomastown, there is a definite rumour current in Callan, a neighbouring town to Thomastown and a very important town in County Kilkenny, that they are to suffer a similar fate. I do not know whether that is correct or not but, if it is correct, I would equally deplore it.  As Deputy Crotty has said, the status of a town is governed by the status of the post office.  Thomastown and Callan are good rural towns and the people there are entitled to as good service as the people in cities or more important centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with my own constituency, there is a rumour of an alteration in the system of delivery of mails in the Ring district of Dungarvan, County Waterford.  I understand that the delivery by the postman in Ring and Old Parish is to cease and that some arrangement is to be experimented with whereby a motor car, on contract, will take out the mail and the driver of the car is supposed to do a certain amount of delivery in Ring and Old Parish.  The general feeling amongst the residents is that that type of delivery will worsen the position. They have not had exceptional facilities up to the present but it is feared that whatever facilities they have had will be reduced.  This is a Gaeltacht area, and a good deal of the correspondence will be addressed in Irish.  It is questionable whether the contractor&mdash;who would probably be based on the lowest amount he charges for delivery&mdash;will be capable of conducting the business, <Col N="414" /> due, perhaps, to his want of knowledge of Irish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be a revenue-producing Estimate.  This should not be a spending Department.  I am glad that, as the result of the reorganisation initiated some years ago, we got that position in 1956-57, and it has been accelerated in 1957-58.  I should like the Minister to make clear in his reply how much of the reorganisation has been concluded. Is it clear that the entire Post Office reorganisation will be completed during the current financial year, when the small areas to which the Minister referred are tidied up and the other five districts are tackled?</P>
      <P>We all know there is still considerable improvement possible in the service. One of the factors which will ease the possibility of that improvement is the fact that in recent years more has been done to county roads. That has made communication better in more remote areas.</P>
      <P>In relation to the telegraph service, the Minister indicated the possibility of considering whether motor-cycle delivery from a larger office would not be better than the existing method of delivery of telegrams on a casual fee basis.  We saw in the newspapers some time ago a little disturbance in reference to the use by a postman of an automatic method of conveying himself.  Regardless of that individual case, has the Department considered whether reorganisation might not effect economies, if it were accompanied by larger delivery areas with automatic conveyance by autocycle or scooter?  I agree it would not be a feasible proposition until the county roads had opened up the hitherto more inaccessible areas.  There has been considerable improvement in county roads in many counties during the past ten years, particularly during the past five years, and it might be possible to effect a more efficient service in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible to assess the exact effect in future of the revenue-producing capacity of this Department without knowing the effect of the recent <Col N="415" /> increase in Civil Service pay on this Vote.  The Minister touched on that point.  I appreciate that he has not had the time to consider it completely, but surely he could give us a global figure of the amount involved, so that we could set that off in our mind's eye against the sum of £350,000 by which he estimates Post Office revenue will be increased in 1958-59.  We will have an opportunity next week for a more full discussion on the results of the 1957 Budget; it seems perfectly clear that one of the results has been possibly the elimination of the increased contribution made by this Department, to put it no higher than that.</P>
    <P>I am a very innocent man and I do not know what the phrase &ldquo;packet service&rdquo; means.  The nearest I can get to it is that the boats going across the Channel used to be called the British and Irish steampacket service.  Would the Minister oblige by giving some indication of what is involved under sub-heads E(3) and E(4) particularly the latter, where the increase is £950?</P>
    <P>Included in this Estimate is an increased sum of £30,000 for the conveyance of mails by air.  I should like to know whether that is more than compensated for by increased revenue for the carriage of mails by air, or whether it has been a switch of carriage from sea or rail to air.  The natural result of the expansion of air services would be that we would have to pay more for their carriage in that way.  I should like to know how the traffic is to be divided in the coming year&mdash;whether it is a question of switching traffic or whether it is new traffic, or increased air traffic which will be offset by increased revenue.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I (1) in the engineering establishment shows a fairly substantial rise.  I am talking of the Estimate as printed, before any question of recent adjustments comes into account.  I should like to know whether that is the effect of increased personnel or increased cost of existing personnel. Allowances come in here.  I am not clear whether that means subsistence allowances or some other type of allowance referable to a man's domestic status.  I take it also that <Col N="416" /> engineering establishment's charges are entirely separate from the ordinary engineering charges in respect of work arising under the Telephone Capital Acts.  I assume that work arising under those Acts is charged to the capital account as well and that engineering services are not charged to the current account, while the work itself is charged to the capital account.  It is a point on which a little lucidity might assist.</P>
    <P>There is a pretty substantial increase also to the civil aviation and meteorological services, particularly in sub-head O (2).  As I understand the position, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have to provide services under that sub-head for other Departments. Is that increase, therefore, offset in another way by increased appropriations-in-aid coming from somewhere else?  If it is, we can deal with the matter on the Vote for another Department.  If it is not so offset, I should like to know the cause of the increase.  I have a sort of recollection that there was an arbitration under the Civil Service arbitration code in relation to some of the officers and perhaps that accounts for the difference.</P>
    <P>The acting-Minister and almost all his predecessors, and, I have no doubt, all Ministers for Finance from time to time, have been upset by the continued loss on telegraph services.  The telegraph services were in the unhappy situation that, the more telegrams you got, the higher your losses.  In most services, if you are able to increase your traffic, you will be able to decrease your loss.  Unfortunately, in relation to our telegraph services, the reverse has been the case.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in the last Government, Mr. Keyes, commenced a fairly thorough reorganisation of our telegraph services.  The fact that the loss has been reduced to the sum the Minister mentioned to-day is due in no small degree to the course adopted by him and the plans initiated by him at that time.</P>
    <P>In relation to overseas cablegrams, apart from the general ordinary delivery rate there are separate and <Col N="417" /> cheaper rates for night letter telegrams and week-end letter telegrams.  Some sort of similar arrangement could be made available here.  We could have some sort of arrangement by which it would be possible, after one had missed the post to any distant part of the country in the evening, to send a telegram which would be picked up at the post office delivering mail to the address concerned and that such telegrams would be delivered not as a telegram but as an ordinary letter.  It would cover, in such a service, the case to which reference was made&mdash; congratulatory telegrams or perhaps telegrams of sympathy which are not urgent to the extent of delivery within a matter of an hour or two.  The more the telephone service is expanded, the less will be the need for telegraph services, but there will always be some need for them and they will have to be put on some basis, while providing the service that is indispensable, to ensure that the loss to the Exchequer is not more than we can afford.</P>
    <P>I have always been interested in the question of philatelic sales.  If the Minister looks up the records of his Department, he will find that I was examining the possibilities of that matter with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs just before Mr. Keyes and I left office.  I want to give this warning to the acting-Minister.  I have great respect and admiration for the tradition of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in regard to the manner in which they approach problems in their ordinary field but, on the question of philatelic sales, they have a complete and absolute blind spot.  They seem to be obsessed with the idea, and I hope the Minister will not allow himself to be obsessed with the idea, that the prestige of this country would be injuriously affected by our expanding our possibilities for philatelic sales.  I disagree now in that regard just as I disagreed with it in minutes which the Minister will find in the records of his Department.</P>
    <P>Many countries get a very substantial revenue from philatelic sales and, in so doing, they do not in any way injure or adversely affect their prestige.  Certainly, they do not affect it in any way that would harm us here.  If, in 1927 <Col N="418" /> or some other year, somebody made a ruling that we could not risk injury to our prestige by expanding philatelic sales, that is no reason why we should ignore a possible opening for further revenue in 1958.  The main thing philatelists want to know when any new issue is printed is the amount that will be printed of that issue.  They want the assurance that, if the issue is withdrawn on a particular day, the rest of the blocks that remain will not still be kept and further stamps dribbled out as other people apply later on.  If they are dribbled out at a later date, after the issue has gone out of general use, the Department make something small out of it, but it is a case of being penny wise and pound foolish.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to build up any philatelic value for stamps, unless, from their very first day of issue, philatelists know the number of stamps that will be printed and know for certain that, after the issue is withdrawn from circulation, it will not again be available, so that, from the withdrawal period onwards, a scarcity value will commence. If they are not assured in advance that there will be that scarcity value after the issue has terminated, they will not bother to buy the stamps during their period of issue.  If they receive that assurance, I have no doubt that the immediate revenue the Minister receives from dribbling out stamps after they have gone out of general use would not be lost as the stamps would then be bought before the issue had terminated.  I would particularly ask the Minister to endeavour to provide a new approach to the whole system of philatelic sales and encourage methods by which we, like other countries, can achieve something substantial from them.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Department or the Minister himself have ever examined the figures available for what other countries make out of such sales. I know one very small country that makes a very substantial sum every year out of sales in that regard.  Surely, if they can do it, we should not spurn or despise that method of raising revenue.</P>
    <P>Might I say a word on the subject of telephones?  I understand and appreciate, of course, that by reason of the <Col N="419" /> extension of the telephone network it is inevitable that sub-head M in the Book of Estimates will rise year by year. The inevitable result of increased capital expenditure from year to year is an increase in the amount of the annuity necessary to repay that capital. There are some anomalies in relation to the telephone service which I would like to have explained to me.  Why, for example, is it dearer to telephone at the same hour of the day from Dublin to London than it is from London to Dublin?  Why is it dearer to telephone from Dublin to Paris than from Paris to Dublin at the same hour of the day, allowing, of course, for exchange conversion? It seems to me that it is peculiar our system of charges should be based on some methods other than those of the place with which we are in contact.  There used to be very much greater delay in telephoning from here to the Continent than there was from the Continent to here, but I must say I am very glad to be able to state that seems to have been cleared up, and one is almost able to get a no-delay service nowadays which is entirely satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The cross-Channel and continental telephone service here is, I think, based entirely on a two-tariff period charge, the dearer charge running from 8 o'clock in the morning to 6 o'clock in the afternoon, and the cheaper tariff operating from 6 o'clock in the evening to 8 o'clock the next morning.  I presume that in relation to cross-Channel and continental trunks there is a round-the-clock service by the operators in the exchanges of Dublin.  If I am right in that and it would not mean additional staff, would it be possible to arrange a system by which there would be a three-tariff period charge?  During the peak hours charges would be higher, with secondary charges slightly lower during not quite so peak hours and the third a much cheaper charge, during the time staffs have to man the exchanges but in fact would be doing nothing.  I am talking at the moment purely of places like Dublin and, perhaps, Cork.  Something like that might assist to expand revenue because that cheaper type of telephone call would be more likely to be a domestic one <Col N="420" /> than a business one which would have to be made during the peak hours.  It would also have the effect of easing peak delays even more, and might at the same time assist to expand revenue.</P>
    <P>In relation to the installation of telephones, I do not think there is enough frankness by the Department. If a telephone cannot be installed for a period of three to six months, because the engineering unit has left an area in the country, it seems to me that what is done at the present time is a delaying process.  It would be far better to say frankly that the squad has left the area and will not be back there until next July, or whatever the date is.  Everybody would then know the exact position.  Equally, it would be better if reasons were frankly given, such as the lack of underground cable or the lack of accommodation on a switchboard, and if some approximate date were given for the time when the service could be made available.</P>
    <P>I know it is traditional on the part of civil servants not to give any more information than they can possibly avoid giving, in case they might get into trouble at a later stage.  I can understand that but, in relation to a business such as this which has so much to do with the outside public, I would urge very strongly that a date should be named and there should be the frankest expression of view as to why there had to be delay, and when that delay could be obviated.</P>
    <P>I am not clear, arising out of a question I put to the Minister here, what exactly is meant by his statement that there would be a hold up in the provision of a semi-automatic exchange. I appreciate he was grossly misquoted at that time but I should like a little more information than was available in the Minister's speech. How is the sum of £1.5 million on telephone capital account to be spent this year?  Is it to be spent on the provision of new trunk circuits between one place and another in the country, or on the provision of new exchanges and new equipment?  Is the Minister able to tell us what proportions and what type of equipment are to be acquired?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" /> I cannot understand, maybe because I am very dense, why when you have two automatic exchanges reasonably near each other, like the one in Naas and the one in Maynooth, you cannot simply connect those two automatic exchanges.  Why is it necessary for a subscriber on the Naas exchange, as I am, to ring my operator in Naas who then rings Dublin and the Dublin operator in turn rings Maynooth? When two exchange areas are ten or 12 miles apart something should be done to obviate that and connect up the two automatic exchanges in the same way as it is possible to telephone from Naas to Kildare, which is very roughly the same distance.  I do not know how long the Minister wants to conclude.  Would 40 minutes be enough?</P>

      <P>The boon of having automatic exchanges in rural areas is a real one and I am glad to see that in the new works proposed by the Board of Works, there is provision for a new telephone exchange in Droichead Nua.  However, I am very disappointed to hear from the Minister that it will not be in service until the end of 1959, when it is proposed that all the work concerned on the building will be completed this year.  It would represent a reasonable chance to have a bloc in County Kildare, Naas, Kildare and Droichead Nua areas, all there together, particularly having regard to the very many industries which there are in that area, which would find it very much easier to obtain their requirements automatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it the intention, in relation to the policy of installing automatic exchanges in an area such as, shall I say, Naas, to merge in from outside the smaller rural exchanges which exist at present?  I know what is being done in the Naas area, when a place like Kill for example ceases to exist, but is <Col N="422" /> the general policy all over the country to be the same as that&mdash;that we shall have one automatic exchange area in, shall I say, a radius of about ten miles, serving that radius of ten miles rather than have the old system of an exchange serving perhaps only three to four miles, dotted around by much smaller exchanges?</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is going to be the Minister's policy in that respect in the future.  I appreciate that the Minister has been only a very short time acting for his colleague in the G.P.O.; I appreciate also that I am throwing questions across at him just before he is about to reply.  If, therefore, he is not in a position to deal specifically with any of the questions I have addressed at him, I shall be perfectly happy if he gets his private secretary to drop me a line in the usual way.</P>

      <P>Again I thank Deputies who expressed their good wishes for the Minister's speedy recovery.  I shall certainly convey their good wishes to him.  I also wish to express thanks for the method in which the debate was approached by Deputies generally.  There were some points of difference.  Some Deputies, for instance, were not of the same opinion as Deputy Sweetman and myself with regard to the desirability that the Post Office should not alone pay its way but should be a revenue producing Department. Some Deputies made the point that once we made any little profit there should be no question of further economies. However, I shall come to that later.  I cannot say that I have very much to complain of in the debate.  I shall deal with as many points as I can at the moment and I can assure Deputies that any other suggestions made will be looked into in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Palmer raised the question of the desirability of giving gratuities and pensions on retirement to auxiliary postmen.  This is an old bone of contention I am afraid there is no way that that could be done at the moment. At any rate, I am advised that before anything could be done, new legislation would be required.  Of course it could <Col N="423" /> deal only with people in similar positions in the service as a whole and the promotion of such legislation would be a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>A question was also raised about the multitudinous duties of sub-postmasters. The case was made that their pay was not sufficient.  This matter is at the moment under consideration by the Conciliation Council.  The case has been made that an increase in pay is justified and it is receiving consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton and a number of other Deputies raised the question of the reduction in status of two Class Six offices in Thomastown and Abbeyleix, where it is proposed to abolish existing sub-post offices run by the Department and substitute for them scale pay subpost offices.  It was in dealing with this question that some Deputies expressed views contrary to those expressed by myself and Deputy Sweetman with regard to the desirability of always being on the look-out for economies which can be effected without bringing about any deterioration in the service provided.  I really do not think a good case was made for the retention of the present status of these post offices.</P>
    <P>The Deputies who spoke on the matter seemed to be mainly concerned with the prestige of the two towns concerned or there was at the back of their minds a vague fear that there was to be a second-rate service provided under the new conditions.  I am advised that that is by no means likely.  The officers of my Department are convinced that a perfectly satisfactory service will be supplied under the new system and, since a considerable economy will be effected, I think we are quite justified in doing it, particularly when there is no injustice to be imposed on anybody as a result of the change-over.</P>
    <P>We have had, on the one hand, criticism because economies have not been achieved and here, when economies are being achieved without doing harm to anybody, I think it unreasonable that we should be criticised. There are much bigger towns doing substantially more business than the <Col N="424" /> two towns concerned, with offices of this scale payment type and these offices are providing a very satisfactory service.  Examples of these are Portarlington, Newcastle West, Ballyshannon, Mountmellick and Buncrana. We are quite satisfied that the suboffices in Abbeyleix and Thomastown will be able to give a fully satisfactory service also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is badly advised about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where Deputy Crotty gets that idea or on what he bases his assumption that the service will be of a lower standard than that which is there at the moment.  Does he mean that I am badly advised in saying that there was a satisfactory service in the towns I have mentioned?  There is no reason, if a satisfactory service can be provided in larger towns where more business is done, why a satisfactory service could not be given in this area.</P>
      <P>A question was raised as to whether this was the beginning of something that is to become widespread, in other words, whether it is a programme for the down-grading of a number of post offices in rural towns.  There is no such programme and there has been no decision to re-grade any other post office, either up or down, at the moment but the attitude of the Department is, and I think it is a very proper attitude, to keep the situation under review all the time in light of the volume of business done.  If it appears desirable to re-grade any post office, even in order to provide more efficient service or effect desirable economies, that decision must be taken in the light of the existing situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Another point made in the same connection was that this <Col N="426" /> indicated a leaning towards the city, as against the country, and the proposal to build a new central sorting office in Dublin was cited as another example of that mentality in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Anybody who knows the conditions in the Pearse Street sorting office knows this is a very urgent proposal and certainly, if the work starts in the coming year, it will not be before its time.  It is also a fact that considerable economies have been made in the cost of postal services in Dublin within the past two years.  The second postal delivery has been cut out in a number of areas and this was objected to by some people.  Economies have been effected in Dublin as well as in other places.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell had some observations to make about the standard of courtesy among telephonists in different exchanges, and, although he prefaced his remarks by saying that the discourteous are in a minority, the trouble is that his speech or his subsequent remarks gave the impression that discourtesy was pretty widespread. Considering the number of queries that come to these operators, I do not think the introduction of standard phrases, as he suggested, would be likely to get over that difficulty.</P>
      <P>He raised some other points which I shall undertake to look into, such as the maintenance of radio telephones on islands around our coastline, and his contention that the present system of recruitment for temporary postmen has occasionally resulted in the appointment of persons unable to read or write.  I find that hard to credit, that people would not be able to read addresses on envelopes and would be taken on, but I shall look into it.</P>
      <P>Regarding the provision of letter boxes and phones in rural parts, everything possible is being done to expand the service in that way.  As I mentioned, 41 new kiosks were erected last year and approximately the same number will be erected this year.  Provision of these amenities is limited by the availability of money for the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> Deputy O'Donnell also asked for an assurance that an automatic telephone exchange would be provided in the new post office in Letterkenny.  I am afraid that will not be done at present; there is only a small number of subscribers in Letterkenny, and it is considered that the installation of an automatic exchange is not urgently necessary there; but a modern manual exchange will be installed in the new building and considerable improvement should be effected due to this new exchange and improved trunk service, and I think local requirements should be adequately dealt with in that way.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies also dealt with the rate of progress in the installation of phones in the provinces as compared with Dublin and the implication again was that more attention was given to city areas than to rural areas.  That is not a fact.  In my opening remarks, I explained the difficulties in dealing with individual applications in rural areas.  I said that we must have a planned programme of working and must deal with areas, and, when the squad working in a particular area moves out of that area into another area, in accordance with their programme, even though there may be only a small amount of work to be done in the area they have just vacated, it would not be practicable for them to come back and do that work, thereby disrupting their programme, except of course in the case of the priorities I mentioned.  I suppose that leads to the impression that these things are not being dealt with expeditiously, but I do not see any prospect of doing it in any other way.</P>

      <P>Since I have been in the Department, I would not think there was any of that lack of frankness Deputy Sweetman mentioned.  I find that people who write in are told what their prospects are.  Several people who have written to my office were given a reasonable estimate of the length of time it will take to provide them with a service.  If it is three months or six <Col N="428" /> months or, in some cases, as long as nine months, they are told what the position is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Coburn made a point regarding the issue of commemorative stamps.  He appeared to think that was a costly project which was not justified.  I was pleased by the remarks of Deputy Sweetman with regard to philatelic sales.  I think that these commemorative stamps pay their way and I certainly will look into the suggestions the Deputy made in that respect.  I fully agree with the point of view that the Post Office should, as far as possible, be a source of revenue and if revenue can be got in that way, I do not think it takes from the status of the country in any respect.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Kyne that I will look into the point he raised in connection with the proposed change of the postal service in Ring, County Waterford. I do not know anything about it myself and I think it was only a rumour, as far as Deputy Kyne was concerned.  However, I will see that the area does not suffer in any change that may be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a number of other points raised by Deputy Sweetman, some of which I can deal with now.  He raised the question of the reorganisation of postal services throughout the country.  The position is that, when the five main head office districts have been completed, that reorganisation will be finished.  These may be started in this year, so that the reorganisation should be completed within about two years. That is the reorganisation programme already decided upon, but we will be on the lookout for other possible improvements and greater efficiency, wherever it can be obtained.  A service such as the postal service is something <Col N="429" /> in which perfection is never achieved. It will always be possible to effect improvements and we can always be on the lookout for suitable places in which to make improvements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman also raised the question of the increased amount provided for posting by air.  There will be a profit in that respect.  The amount which it is expected to collect by means of air posting, less ordinary postage, should bring increased revenue from air mail, after the air mail companies have been paid for their services.</P>
    <P>To some of the other points raised by Deputy Sweetman, I am not in a position to reply at the moment.  I will adopt his suggestion of replying by letter in respect of those.  I do not know whether the suggestion for a three-tariff position in regard to trunk calls would be worth-while, but I will have it looked into.</P>
    <P>I do not know the answer to the complaint that Naas and Maynooth have to go through Dublin to get in touch with one another.  I feel sure that there is a technical difficulty there, and, if it is possible to have it solved.  I will ask the engineering staff to do it.  I do not think there is anything else of great importance to be dealt with.  There were a number of other points raised and I will have them looked into.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>On to-day's Order Paper, I asked the Minister for Lands:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he is aware that By-law No. 495 of the Ballyshannon district, dated 3rd April, 1958, takes from the salmon fishermen of Ballyshannon and district the right which they established after lengthy and costly litigation in the Erne fishery case to fish in the tidal waters of the River Erne; and, if so, if he will take immediate steps to annul the said by-law, and to restore to the fishermen the rights given to them by the Supreme Court of Justice of Saorstát Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For generations, the estuary of the River Erne was the exclusive fishery right of individuals in the town of <Col N="433" /> Ballyshannon, many of them absentees. Shortly after the establishment of this State, a number of the fishermen decided to contest the right of these absentee landlords to the exclusive fishery in the tidal waters and estuary of the River Erne.  That case was one of the most lengthy and costly cases in the annals of our Irish courts.  After many years of litigation, the Supreme Court decided that the public had the right to fish in the tidal waters of the estuary of the River Erne, and, ever since, some 30 crews were engaged there during the fishing season in the netting of salmon.  In addition, the local anglers exercised the rights conferred upon them by the courts to fish for salmon and sea trout in the River Erne.</P>
    <P>Thirty crews with an average of five persons per crew, in all over 100 people, were engaged in this progressive fishery.  In the year 1945, an Act was passed by the Oireachtas, known as the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act, 1945, which gave to the E.S.B. the right to harness the River Erne. Section 15 of that Act gave the E.S.B. the right to acquire the fisheries on the River Erne and Section 18 gave to the fishermen and to all those engaged in the fishing trade the right to compensation, should the E.S.B. decide to acquire the fishery.</P>
    <P>The E.S.B. proceeded to harness the river and, in doing so, they naturally destroyed the fishing beds on the lower reaches of the river.  They also destroyed the fishpasses, as they had to do, in order to harness the river, but they never acquired the fishery in the tidal portion, and the fishermen continued to fish there.  In or about the year 1951, on the switch-on of power in the River Erne on one particular night, thousands of salmon were found lying in the river bed, left high and dry when the water was diverted from the main river to the artificial channel.  That switch-over took place without any notice whatsoever to the local board of conservators, and, as one of the inspectors admitted on oath during the hearing of evidence at the recent inquiry, thousands of fish were actually taken out of the river bed.</P>
    <P>A submarine aqueduct was made to <Col N="434" /> enable the fish to go up the river and the smolts to come down the river, but no provision whatsoever was made for the safe transit of kelts from the upper reaches of the river to the sea.  During the course of the taking of evidence at the commission, it was admitted that on a number of occasions smolts were destroyed in the machinery.  It was submitted also that all sorts of crude devices were used for the purpose of forcing the kelts to come down this aqueduct.  It was also admitted that the beds had never been properly seen to since the fishery was taken over and it was further admitted that, by Order of the Minister on 23rd March, 1954, a few short months before Fianna Fáil went out of office, the Minister's predecessor made an Order enabling the E.S.B. to erect a weir without a fishpass and to take therefrom salmon. That is the only weir I know of in which there is no fishpass and this Order was made on 23rd March, 1954, and came into force on 29th March, 1954.</P>
    <P>Out of the traps erected under this Order, thousands of salmon were taken each year and sold commercially by the E.S.B.  The E.S.B. took no steps whatsoever to ensure that there were proper spawning beds on the lower reaches of the river.  In addition, they took no steps whatsoever to ensure that a hatchery would be established on the River Erne, so that, ever since 1951, as a result of the accumulation of these four incidents: the spawning of the fish without proper beds, the erection of an aqueduct which is not suitable, there being no provision for smolts to get down the river and no provision for kelts to get back to the sea and no provision for the establishment of a hatchery, the fishery has declined from 1951 until the present day.</P>
    <P>This year, on 12th March, at the behest of the Minister, an inquiry was held to inquire into the decline of the fishing on the River Erne and further to inquire into what steps could be taken to improve the fishery there.  I and some colleagues of mine, on behalf of the fishermen and those engaged in the trade, pointed out that were the <Col N="435" /> weir removed, a proper hatchery erected, a proper aqueduct, conduit or pipe-line established for the fish to pass up, and proper spawning beds reestablished there, the fishery would improve, and that, whether it did or not, it was one of the first steps the Minister should take as an experiment, to see if the fishery would so improve.</P>
    <P>That inquiry lasted for two days.  A number of witnesses for the E.S.B., the Department of Fisheries, the fishermen and those others engaged in the trade, gave evidence.  Despite that and despite the amount of time that was required to transcribe the notes of the evidence given, despite the amount of time required to study the facts and to study the various suggestions made, the Minister on 3rd April made an Order prohibiting the taking of fish from the estuary of the River Erne.</P>
    <P>During the course of evidence at that inquiry, it was admitted on all sides that anglers did not injure the fishery in any way.  Notwithstanding that every person had agreed that legitimate angling did not interfere with the fishery, the Minister prohibited angling in the estuary of the River Erne.  By virtue of that Order, by one stroke of his pen, the Minister annuls the decision of the Supreme Court of Saorstát Éireann and wipes out the rights established by those fishermen during the lengthy litigation to which I have referred.  Furthermore, he throws out of employment all the fishermen engaged in fishing by netting and otherwise on the lower stretches of the estuary.</P>
    <P>Ballyshannon is a dead town, unfortunately. There is no employment there.  Economically and otherwise, it is the bearna baoil to the North and it should be the endeavour of all concerned to retain in employment those few people who have permanent employment there.  Apart from these fishermen being thrown out of employment, there is the further fact that the E.S.B. have never acquired the fishery under Section 15 of the Electricity Supply Act of 1945.  Not having put Section 15 into effect, Section 18 does not arise and no compensation <Col N="436" /> whatsoever will be paid to these unfortunate fishermen and those others engaged in the trade, following the Order of the Minister.  If the board had compensated the fishermen, I could understand his making the Order which he has made, or were he to accept the advice tendered to him by me and others, namely, to try to improve the fishery without in any way injuring the fishermen, then I could understand his later making an Order prohibiting fishing.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Brennan, yesterday asked if the Minister would compensate these fishermen for the losses which they have sustained as a result of the Order he has made.  The reply he received was &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I suggest to him now that he should make a request to the board&mdash;and that he should annul this Order until such a request is replied to&mdash;to implement Section 15 of the 1945 Act and to implement Section 18 and compensate those fishermen for the losses which they have sustained, until such time as the fishery is improved.  One can visualise what will happen, say, in three or four years' time, when the fishermen are off the estuary.  The board will acquire the fishery and the fishermen will then seek compensation. For what?&mdash;for their loss of finance which they had not possession of for three or four years, a claim for something which they had not got.  The Minister's Order will be trumped up against them and it will be said: &ldquo;Sure, you had no fishing rights then. They were taken away from you by the Minister for Lands in the year 1958.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is very bad policy.  It is a dangerous thing to do.  We want all the men we can possibly retain in rural Ireland, particularly men who are engaged in seasonal employment, as these fishermen were.  Goodness knows, it is difficult enough to find employment for them, but when the Minister does what he has done, thrown 30 crews out of employment by one stroke of his pen, it is time we protested and protested strongly.  I support my colleague, Deputy Brennan, when he asks the Minister to compensate them.  If the Minister is going to take away their <Col N="437" /> rights, at least he should compensate them for the loss and the injury which he has done to them.</P>
    <P>A very small portion indeed of this river is in the Twenty-Six Counties. The remander of it is in the Six Counties.  We are all aware of the fact that as a result of the action of the Six County Government, through the Erne drainage scheme, a considerable amount of damage was done to the fishery on the upper stretches through pollution and otherwise.  The Minister is now ordering the unfortunate fishermen of Ballyshannon and district to assist him in undoing the damage done by the E.S.B. and those who carried out the Erne drainage scheme.</P>
    <P>We are still in the early part of the season and it is not yet too late to annul this Order.  I beg the Minister to annul the Order, to compel the E.S.B. to establish a hatchery on the river, to rake the hatching beds, to establish a proper conduit or pipeline to enable fish to go up the river, to leave a free gap in the weir, to compel them also to ensure that smolts have access to the sea from the upper stretches and that kelts will have a proper conduit or pipeline to reach the sea.  If he does that, in three or four years' time, if the fishery has not improved and the Minister seeks an Order such as he has made now to abolish netting and angling in the estuary, he will have the full support of the House and of the fishermen.  But, until that is done, a cruel blow has been struck to the fishermen in Ballyshannon.</P>
    <P>The Erne was famous&mdash;I think in Europe&mdash;for its spring fish.  Fish averaging 18 to 25 lb. were caught there each year by the thousand.  But, since the development of the hydro-electric scheme, spring fish are not known to run there.  In other words, it is not over-netting.  It is a result of the direct action of the E.S.B. which has prevented the running of the large spring fish on the river.  It is not due to the action of the fishermen and the Minister should not victimise or penalise the fishermen, fishermen who were already victimised on a former occasion by the present Minister when he asked them to pay 2d. per lb. on all fish exported before 1st June and 1d. per lb. on all fish exported after <Col N="438" /> that date.  That, in itself, was a very heavy penalty.  The licence duty which they paid was a heavy one.  The art of fishing is a dwindling art.  For pity's sake, do not wipe them out completely. Leave them that little employment in Ballyshannon, and annual this Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I could have listened with more sympathy to Deputy O'Donnell if he had not concluded his speech with a reference to the salmon export levy.  The facts are that salmon development in this country requires more, and not less, working capital to fortify it and to develop it.  The Deputy introduced what I might describe as a rather cheap political gibe in dragging that matter in.</P>
      <P>The position is that it was naturally with reluctance that I had to issue this Order.  The evidence was overwhelming. None of the measures suggested by Deputy O'Donnell would be sufficient, by itself, or be quick enough by itself, to bring about a restocking of this river.  The evidence showed that the average number of fish caught in the Erne at this particular point were 10,000 per year pre-war.  The number had gone down to some 1,240.  The evidence showed that the number of crews had gone down from some 30 to 40 to a total of 30 to 42 men and, according to the uncontradicted evidence, the average income per man after paying his licence was £25 per season, out of which the expenses of the boat and gear had to be paid.  It was as a result of this tremendous decline in the numbers of fish, in the strength of the crews and in the income available to the surviving crews that I felt obliged to make the Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should make it perfectly clear, and Deputy O'Donnell should know it as a lawyer, that I have not extinguished the right of fishing.  I have merely made use of Section 91 of the 1842 Act, which will appear in its consolidated form when the Consolidated Fishery Bill reaches this House, and which enables the Minister in charge of inland fisheries to carry out all sorts of restraints with a view to preserving the salmon fisheries of this country.  In fact, one might say that half of the immensely complicated body of statutes <Col N="439" /> governing salmon fisheries is in the nature of acts of restraint enabling the Minister to shorten the season without any compensation and to do all sorts of other things in restraint of fishing. He has the widest possible power to reduce the number of salmon taken under all sorts of varying circumstances with a view to preserving stocks.</P>
    <P>I should add in this connection that the E.S.B. has agreed to maintain completely open the weir at Cathaleen Falls.  They will no longer take any fish while this Order is in operation. We have been having conversations with the E.S.B. to see what part they can play, beyond what they have done, in the regeneration of the fisheries.</P>
    <P>This particular fishery was the subject of legislation under the Fisheries Tidal Waters Act of 1934, and Orders made under it as a direct consequence of the Supreme Court action.  Under that Act the Minister takes under his command, so to speak, the operation of the tidal water fisheries.  Under that Act he can establish special licences in compensation for the original rights; he can provide by-laws for sanctuaries in the tidal waters; he can insist on the provision of returns of all the fish caught.</P>
    <P>The Act was designed with a view to making it clear to the fishermen that there were special circumstances which necessitated proper control of this fishery and the result of the temporary restraint of the right which remains, as established by the Supreme Court, will be that, I hope, the fishery will be revived as soon as possible, that enough fish will pass up to restock the river and that, in as short a period as possible, the remaining crews will be able to add to what, as far as I could see from the evidence, was an addition to some other income they had.  Some evidence was given which suggested that that average figure might have been greater in the case of certain individuals, but no one challenged the statement made that there were only 32 to 40 men left operating at different times in the tidal waters and that their average income worked out at £25 per head, after paying the licence and whatever <Col N="440" /> annual costs of depreciation might arise, for the maintenance of their boats and to meet other expenses. The actual fishing had declined to a truly pitifully small figure.</P>
    <P>As far as the E.S.B. is concerned, I would draw the attention of Deputy O'Donnell to the observation both he and Deputy Brennan have made as to the part the E.S.B. has played in this matter.  It is up to Deputy Brennan and Deputy O'Donnell to make such representations as they think fit to the E.S.B.  My own belief is that the E.S.B. take a reasonable view of these matters, and I should say in that regard that I will certainly give this promise to the two Deputies concerned. If the E.S.B. try to take advantage of the position, as Deputy O'Donnell has suggested, and decide to take over the tidal water fishery at a later date when this Order has finally been repealed, I would regard it as a direct definite injustice if they did refuse to take into account, when considering compensation, the value of the fish that have been taken for some considerable period before the restriction was exercised by me.</P>

I want to make that clear.  The Deputy is making suggestions of a kind which have no advantage.</P>
