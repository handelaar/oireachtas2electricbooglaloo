      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will define the posts, occupations, employments or professions the holding of which could not reasonably be regarded as interfering, or being incompatible, with the full or proper discharge by him of the duties of his office.</P>

      <P>The principle involved, which has been stated in this House a number of times, is that which is alluded to in the Deputy's question, namely, that no member of the Government should engage in any activities whatsoever that could reasonably be regarded as interfering, or being incompatible, with the full and proper discharge by him of the duties of his office&mdash;for example, acting in a position such as a company directorship carrying remuneration.  Any specific question that might arise in a particular case would be considered in the light of this principle.</P>
      <P>It would not be practicable to enumerate or to define the posts, occupations, employments or professions the holding of which would be compatible with the full and proper discharge by a member of the Government of the duties of his office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply, would the Taoiseach state whether or not it was compatible or whether or not it was interfering with the duties of a Minister or Taoiseach to hold, while Taoiseach, the controlling directorship of the <i>Irish Press?</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to quote the Taoiseach's own words at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fhe is where he said it would be necessary for everybody in Fianna Fáil to take off their coast to win this Referendum?  Does he intend to resign his part-time job as Taoiseach and take over the controlling directorship of the <i>Irish Press</i> in order to sway the Irish public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, would it not be more respectful to Parliament if the reply stated &ldquo;if and when the Bill passes this House&rdquo;?  Perhaps the Taoiseach would answer that question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is understood, I think.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Mind you, I do not think it is and I think the Taoiseach might have made that gesture to Parliament even though he has an absolute majority.  Strong Governments, you know, can get too strong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think <Col N="574" /> there is any need for such an exceptional procedure as that suggested by the Deputy.  The proposals in the Bill for the amendment of the Constitution will be debated in the two Houses of the Oireachtas and will then be submitted by Referendum for the judgment of the people as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the major local authority in Ireland, at any rate, one of the leading local authorities, Dublin Corporation, has already given an adverse decision, will the Taoiseach not consider giving all representative bodies an opportunity of expressing their opinion on his action?  I say advisedly &ldquo;his action&rdquo; because, as I can see the position, it is entirely the Taoiseach's wish to abolish proportional representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think it appropriate that his reply should be that this Bill will be submitted for consideration by both Houses of the Oireachtas and then to a Referendum?  Surely there ought to be in a stated reply of the Taoiseach, &ldquo;if passed by both Houses, then submitted to a Referendum.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not think that for the sake of preserving the esteem of the people for this Oireachtas, its right to reject legislation proposed by the Executive should be recognised by the Taoiseach in a formal reply to a question of this kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

In December, 1957, the Government authorised C.I.E. to increase this reduced pension to 12/- per week.  The responsibility for proposing amendments to existing C.I.E. superannuation schemes rests on the C.I.E. Board.</P>

In the case referred to by the Deputy I have concluded that duty should be remitted in respect of all goods imported prior to the end of May last and I have made a recommendation to the Revenue Commissioners accordingly.</P>
      <P>The grant of duty-free facilities for imports by the firm after May will depend on whether they are in a position to satisfy me that Irish manufacturers cannot reasonably meet their requirements.  This question is at present under examination.</P>

I submit that that <Col N="586" /> is a matter of grave importance to Deputies.

It has been customary, where there are dates and figures, to allow the form of answer which has been given by the Parliamentary Secretary on my behalf, that is, &ldquo;With your permission, the necessary particulars will be given in the Official Report.&rdquo; I am not contending that this is a firm precedent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Chair's comments on the situation, these questions which are answered by circulating the replies in the Official Report are preceded, at their introduction, somewhat as follows: &ldquo;With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate the reply in the Official Report.&rdquo; I take it that these words have some meaning besides mere verbiage?  I take it that it is an accepted rule of the House that your permission, as Ceann Comhairle, is necessary before that procedure is adopted?  Have these words any meaning besides mere verbiage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the custodian of the rights of Deputies in this House, <Col N="588" /> surely the words &ldquo;With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle....&rdquo; give to the Ceann Comhairle the right to say: &ldquo;I give my permission to have the question answered in that way&rdquo; or &ldquo;I withhold my permission to have the question answered in that way&rdquo;?  The fact that these words are used while the Ceann Comhairle is in the Chair implies an acceptance of that responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I direct the attention of the Ceann Comhairle to Standing Order No. 35, paragraph (2), which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If in the opinion of the Ceann Comhairle any question put down for oral answer is of such a nature as to require a lengthy reply, the Ceann Comhairle may, at the request of the member of the Government to whom the question is addressed, direct that the answer be furnished in the Official Report of the Debates.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does that not clearly indicate that the Ceann Comhairle will consider the reasonableness of a request by a member of the Government to be excused from reading an unduly long reply?  If the Chair thinks the Minister's request is well-founded, in relation to the length of the reply, the Ceann Comhairle may grant the permission but, if he does not think the request is well-founded, he ought to refuse it.  Is that not true?  Furthermore, on the grounds that the answer is of such a nature as to require a lengthy reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider introducing amendments to the Prize Bond scheme (a) to enable the prize money in respect of a winning bond to be paid to the personal representatives of a deceased holder who died within the month preceding the draw, and (b) to enable the draws to be held more frequently than twice yearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards (a) of the Deputy's question, may I explain that under the present scheme Prize Bonds are not transferable in any circumstances? The person who signs the application form at the time of purchase remains the owner until he cashes the bond or dies.  The prospectus provides that on the death of the holder of a bond his personal representatives should apply to the Bank of Ireland, Dublin, for repayment.  After the owner cashes the bond or dies, the bond is in principle no longer eligible to participate in draws for prizes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary, however, for the purpose of determining what bonds participate in a particular draw to have a critical date.  This is laid down in the prospectus as the commencement of the month in which the draw is held. Bondholders who have cashed their bonds or died before that date are not eligible for prizes.  Bondholders who cash their bonds or die after that date are eligible for prizes.  I cannot see that there would be any particular advantage in fixing the critical date as a month before the draw rather than the commencement of the month in which <Col N="594" /> the draw is held.  Whatever date is selected there are bound to be borderline cases.</P>
    <P>I may add that where a Prize Bond is purchased in two names jointly, for instance in the names of a husband and wife, the bond becomes the sole property of the survivor on the death of one of the holders and continues to participate in future draws until it is cashed or the survivor also dies.</P>
    <P>Where a bond is drawn for a prize and it transpires subsequently that the owner had died before the critical date the value of that prize is not surrendered to the Exchequer but is awarded to the next bond drawn at the same draw.  The prize that bond had drawn passes to the next bond in due order and so on.  The last prize on the list passes to the first bond on a reserve list of numbers drawn at the conclusion of the draw proper to provide for this contingency.</P>
    <P>As regards (b) of the question, the expense involved in having more than two draws a year would not be warranted by the volume of investment in Prize Bonds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not reconsider the original regulation made in respect of a bondholder?  I am sure the Minister is aware that the reason for that regulation was to prevent making bonds transferable with the administrative cost that the setting up of a scheme for transfer would involve.  I think the Minister will find that would not apply in the case of death alone.  I think he should, therefore, reconsider the matter purely in death cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this measure is to give the people an opportunity of considering the present method of election of members to Dáil Éireann and considering whether it should not be changed.  For that, a <Col N="614" /> Bill must first be passed or deemed to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If such a Bill is passed, then the people will have an opportunity of considering this matter as a single issue, and I, from such experience as I have had over the years, am satisfied that it is in the public interest that they should be given that opportunity.</P>
      <P>The proposal in the Bill is roughly this: to substitute for the provisions which prescribe multiple constituencies and the single transferable vote provisions for single-member constituencies and a single non-transferable vote. The Bill will also provide for a commission consisting of seven persons, three to be selected by the Government and three by the Opposition, with a chairman to be appointed by the President after consultation with the Council of State.  Decisions made by the President in such circumstances are, of course, not on the advice of the Government.  The scheme of constituencies decided on by the commission will be final unless it is amended by a two-thirds majority of Dáil Éireann. There may be some incidental or consequential amendments, but that is what the Bill will be in essence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not usual to oppose the First Reading of a Bill introduced by a member of the Government.  Deputies of course have not yet seen any copy of the Bill and have no detailed knowledge of the proposals for constitutional amendment intended to be comprised therein. Nevertheless, the subject matter of the Bill has quite recently been debated at the annual convention of the political Party of the Government, and its objects widely publicised.  We, therefore, have pretty accurate knowledge of what is intended to be achieved by this measure.  With such knowledge, we think it essential that we should at the earliest opportunity emphasise our implacable opposition to the achievement of that intention by taking the unusual course of voting against the First Reading of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill aims to amend the Constitution in a drastic, if not revolutionary, manner.  There was no mention of <Col N="615" /> these proposals during the course of the last general election campaign.  It is a very grave matter to amend the Constitution, so grave that the Constitution in effect itself contemplates that no change should be effected, unless the people have twice considered it and twice approved of it&mdash;once on the election of a Government committed to introduce the Bill to effect the change, and once again after the matter has been fully debated in the Legislature.  The intention of this Bill is at least an infringement of the spirit of the Constitution.  There has been no widespread public demand for such radical changes.  The proposals are ill-timed, unjustified and may cause very grave damage to the national interests.</P>
    <P>At a time when every section of the community is looking for economic betterment and reduction of the burdens of taxation and a concentrated effort by all Parties to secure remedies for the pressing problems of unemployment, under-employment, agricultural and industrial expansion, increase of export trade and at least some easement of the continued growth in emigration, it is not fitting that the minds of the people should be distracted, and their energies diverted to changes in the electoral system for which there has been no public demand.  In any event, such changes should not be proposed except in a calm atmosphere and after dispassionate examination of the problems involved, and widespread and objective discussion, so as to inform the electorate and enable them to express an intelligent decision.</P>
    <P>The present proposals can only be discussed in the atmosphere that has been created of political passion and partisanship, and in circumstances where the discussion of radical changes has been forced into the arena of Party political policy, and to the support of which appeals have been made to purely party political allegiance, and personal loyalties.</P>
    <P>The proposals are ill-timed also because of the prevailing conditions of apathy, disillusionment and cynicism, and a torpid political electorate.  In fact they are designed to exploit that apathy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> The proposals are unjustifiable because in effect they aim at depriving reasonable minorities in the country of fair representation.  They are intended to put the political power of the people into the hands of the major political Party sponsoring them.  The aim of the proposals is the glorification of the power of that Party.</P>
    <P>The present system has worked reasonably well for 36 years, and has provided stable government of a type desired by the people from time to time.</P>
    <P>The present system is based on tradition going back to Arthur Griffith, even prior to the foundation of the State.  The system was included in the Partition Act of 1920 in the hope of giving minorities their just share of representation.  The principles of proportional representation were embodied in the Constitutions of 1922 and of 1937.  Nothing has happened which justifies a major alteration.  It is a just and traditional system, and ought not lightly to be interfered with.  The principle of proportional representation must be an essential feature of a united Ireland.  Instead of endeavouring to change the Constitution in the ways proposed the Government would be performing a greater national service if they were to endeavour to strengthen the constitutional guarantees by making an amendment of the Constitution even more difficult than it now is.</P>
    <P>The system of proportional representation was designed to give reasonable protection to minority interests in the State, and not merely the interests of religious minorities.  Minorities deprived of constitutional means of furthering their interests may well turn to extra-constitutional means, and may well endanger the security of the State as at present established.  For these reasons, we intend to oppose the First Reading.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, when I was interrupted, one of the reasons why the House ought not give approval to the passage of this Bill is that it puts the Taoiseach in a humiliating position.</P>
      <P>It compels him to swallow, regurgitate and re-swallow the many statements he made in condemnation of the Six-County Government when it abolished proportional representation. It compels him to thoroughly masticate and swallow all the tributes he previously paid to the basic fairness of proportional representation and to his own determination to continue to use that method of parliamentary election no matter what the pressure was for the adoption of other methods.</P>
      <P>Now the Taoiseach comes along at a time when his Government have the largest majority in the House and he asks Parliament to give him power to pass a Bill which is quite unnecessary in the light of the powers the Government have.  His Government have an overall majority of substantial proportions and, in those circumstances, it is clearly unjustifiable for the Taoiseach to seek to secure from Parliament powers which clearly are not warranted in order to enable the Taoiseach and his Government to do the things which they promised to do at the last general election and which so far have not made their appearance for the benefit of the people.</P>

      <P>I was saying that proportional representation has the support of all sections of the people because it permits substantial minorities to secure representation in Parliament.  It is good business from our point of view, if Parties with a previous history of opposition to constitutional action merge, to be able to say to them: &ldquo;Look, convince a substantial minority of the people that your policy is sound and you have a right to enter Parliament and use Parliament as a sounding-board to attract more adherents to your Party.&rdquo;  If proportional representation goes that will not be possible.

      <P>As I said earlier, I would have been finished 20 minutes ago were it not for the interruptions from the Government Benches and, in particular, the interruptions from the arch-interrupter, the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I want to say that at a time when it is more than ever necessary to unite the efforts and enthusiasms and goodwill of the nation to deal comprehensively in a radical way with the many problems which confront us&mdash;problems of a declining population, large scale emigration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am merely mentioning that at a time when unity is so necessary in relation to our main objectives, in order to secure and harness the goodwill of the people, it is rather regrettable that the Government should seek powers from this House to introduce legislation, the only effect of which will be to split the people in two, putting them on each side of a fence, and that at a time when there are vital problems awaiting solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that this discussion, and particularly the behaviour of the performers <Col N="628" /> on the Government Benches, will induce the people to realise what lies ahead for them if by any chance they are lured or snared into voting for the abolition of P.R.  I believe it will be possible to awaken the people to a sense of realisation of the dangers that lie ahead.</P>

I believe the people can be awakened to the dangers that lie ahead.  We have had a rather prolonged discussion on this motion for the First Reading.  I hope every Opposition Deputy will express without limit of time his opposition to the Second Reading of the Bill. I hope the public will be warned of the dangers which lie ahead and I hope that when the vote on the Referendum is counted the Government will get what they deserve, namely, a first-class hiding on this measure to rivet the Fianna Fáil Party in power at the expense of all the people.  This is a Bill to put Party above the nation, Party above the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is getting off to a very bad start because it appears that this is only the thin end of the wedge.  Every single speaker so far has been interrupted and points of order have been raised merely for the purpose of interruption, in order to give us a taste of what the future will be if the Bill is passed by the country.  It is a Bill to extinguish small Parties, the Minister for Education said, to wipe them out.</P>

      <P>The Bill, in my opinion, is a Bill to muzzle all opposition, to wipe out all opposition, particularly to wipe out small Parties and to prevent even the larger minorities from having a voice inside the House.  That is one of the reasons why I am opposing it.  I believe that a second reason behind the introduction of the Bill is that Fianna Fáil want to have an overall majority in the House, without any opposition, so that they can do exactly what they want.</P>

      <P>I intend to be very brief.  This Bill clearly shows that the Taoiseach, if he is the originator of the idea behind the Bill, is following closely in the footsteps of Northern Ireland and Britain and that he must be a very close admirer of their methods.  We know what has happened in Northern Ireland, that one Party has got into power there over 20 years and that the people have failed to dispossess them.</P>

I believe that another purpose of the Bill is to divert public attention from the terrible condition in which the country is at the present time.  Will the Taoiseach tell us what is wrong with P.R.?  No Government more than his has gone out of power and wrought turmoil in the country by calling a general election at a time when he had a working majority behind him in the House.  He has done that on several occasions.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of this Bill is to confirm and give the force of law to two Orders which have been made, under Section 9 of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, relating to trade practices affecting the supply and distribution of grocery goods and provisions.  The first of the two Orders in question was made by my predecessor in December, 1956, and the second Order, which is an amending one, was made by me last July.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Fair Trade Commission held a statutory inquiry in 1955 under Section 7 of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, into the conditions which obtain in regard to the supply and distribution of grocery goods and provisions and that the commission subsequently furnished a report of the inquiry describing the conditions obtaining in the trade and indicating that, in the view of the commission, certain practices existed which interfered unfairly with competition and operated against the public interest.  To facilitate the House, I propose to give a résume of the commission's report and of the recommendations which the commission made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> The report shows that a substantial proportion of home manufactured grocery goods and the bulk of imported goods reach the retail trade through wholesalers.  On the other hand, the larger retailers tend to buy direct from the manufacturers, while multiple shops generally obtain their supplies direct from manufacturers and brokers.  The proportion of goods supplied by manufacturers direct to the retail trade tends as a whole to increase, particularly in the Dublin area where most manufacturers are located. Certain home-produced proprietary goods are distributed on the basis of straight quantity terms which are available to all traders, that is to say, the bigger the order the lower the price to everybody.  However, the terms are generally such as to ensure that only wholesalers, multiples, or retailers buying collectively, can earn the highest rates of discount.</P>
    <P>A few home manufacturers of proprietary goods differentiate between terms to wholesalers and terms to retailers by quoting separate prices without additional quantity terms, but, in respect of a wide range of home-produced goods, manufacturers also provide for a scale of quantity terms for retailers.  The commission's report indicates that, except in the case of jam, there was no evidence of collective price or collective margin fixing for home-produced proprietary goods. The Irish Jam Manufacturers' Association had, however, a common list of trade prices for the jams and marmalades produced by members, a common standard of qualifications for the grant of trade terms, a common classification of traders for the grant of these terms and also uniform quantity discounts. Retail prices were not fixed by the association.</P>
    <P>At the time of the inquiry, there were two associations of retail grocers &mdash;the Retail Grocery, Dairy and Allied Trades Association (R.G.D.A.T.A.) and the Cash Grocers' Association. Members of R.G.D.A.T.A. were expected by their organisation to maintain retail prices fixed by manufacturers and wholesalers and approved by the association.  The association aimed to secure what it considered to be fair profit margins for members <Col N="641" /> and opposed what it regarded as unfair reductions of such margins. R.G.D.A.T.A. regarded as unfair such forms of trading as co-operative societies for consumers, &ldquo;stamp trading,&rdquo; travelling shops and retail trading by muncipal bodies.  The Cash Grocers' Association has a relatively small membership.  It maintains that the individual retailer should determine his retail prices on the basis of the net cost of the goods to him having regard to such factors as demand and rate of turnover.</P>
    <P>At the time of the inquiry, there was only one general wholesaling association, the Association of Wholesale Grocers, Importers and Distributors. There was also a number of associations concerned with particular commodities, such as butter, tea and salt. Most of these associations had, at one time, collectively fixed selling prices to retailers but had discontinued the practice for a considerable time prior to the inquiry.</P>
    <P>There also existed at the time of the inquiry a number of trade associations representing manufacturers of jam, cocoa, soap, candles, polish, etc.  In addition, the Irish Food Manufacturers' Federation included among its members the producers of a variety of different commodities.  Most of these associations at one time or another engaged in the collective fixing of prices, but, with one exception, had discontinued the practice for a considerable time previously.  The practices adopted by the Jam Manufacturers' Association, to which I referred earlier, constituted an outstanding case of collective price fixing.  There was also evidence of consultations between individual manufacturers in respect of the price of cheese and margarine.</P>
    <P>Out of 34 manufacturers who gave evidence at the inquiry, six followed the practice of suggesting or recommending prices at which wholesalers should sell to retailers.  Twenty-seven of the 34 manufacturers indicated in one way or another the prices to be charged by retailers for their products. While most manufacturers had no well defined procedure for the enforcement of their suggested prices, many of them had, on occasions, either at the instance <Col N="642" /> of R.G.D.A.T.A., or on the complaint of individual traders, requested price cutting retailers to maintain prices. Some of these manufacturers had stopped supplying certain retailers who declined to comply with their requests. While the associations of manufacturers and individual manufacturers who gave evidence supported retail price maintenance in principle, the associations and many of the manufacturers were prepared to concede that in certain circumstances some reductions of prices might be allowed.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned earlier, the principal association of retail grocers&mdash; R.G.D.A.T.A.&mdash;expected its members to maintain retail prices fixed by suppliers and approved by the association. The means adopted by R.G.D.A.T.A. to enforce its policy consisted principally of requests to suppliers to withhold supplies from &ldquo;offending&rdquo; retailers and requests to members not to buy from suppliers who refused to discontinue supplies to such retailers. Manufacturers were asked to cut off all supplies even though their own products might not be involved.  If wholesalers continued to supply price cutters, R.G.D.A.T.A. took steps to have supplies to the wholesalers cut off by the manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Some time prior to the inquiry, R.G.D.A.T.A. had made very strenuous efforts to enforce its policy in relation to resale price maintenance in the Dublin area.  Members were instructed to maintain prices of proprietary goods; to deal only with wholesalers or other suppliers who refrained from supplying traders engaging in what the association regarded as unfair trading practices; and, in particular, to refrain from dealing with such firms as the Dublin branch committee might name from time to time.</P>
    <P>A list containing the names of 26 retailers was circulated to the manufacturers concerned requesting them to ensure that their proprietary goods were sold at the recognised prices by retailers on the list.  It was indicated that if the goods in question continued to be sold at prices other than their recognised retail prices, members of R.G.D.A.T.A. would find it impossible to compete at such prices and would <Col N="643" /> have to discontinue stocking those lines. In the event the efforts of the association did not prove very successful. Various discussions were held by R.G.D.A.T.A. with manufacturers' and wholesalers' associations early in 1955 but very little was achieved thereby.</P>
    <P>The commission's report indicates that in 1954 a co-operative society entitled Allied Dublin Merchants Limited (A.D.M.) was formed by a number of Dublin retailers to conduct a wholesale grocery business.  Membership of A.D.M. was open only to traders who were members of R.G.D.A.T.A.  Sales were made mainly to members at cost plus a flat rate of surcharge to cover expenses.  The Wholesale Grocers' Association opposed strongly the granting of wholesale terms to A.D.M. and some of the principal brokers refused to deal with the society.  A number of manufacturers refused to accord wholesale terms to A.D.M. and these manufacturers appear to have been influenced largely by the refusal of wholesalers to recognise A.D.M. as a wholesaler.</P>
    <P>I come now to the conclusions and recommendations of the commission. So far as resale price maintenance is concerned, the view of the commission is that the practice, whether enforced collectively or by individual suppliers, operates against the public interest and should, subject to certain conditions, be prohibited.  The commission point out that, if the prices of proprietary goods are effectively maintained, the pressure of price competition is apt to fall with increased severity on goods the prices of which are fixed at the discretion of the retailer.  Packaged and branded grocery goods are attractive to shopkeepers other than grocers and this attraction is heightened when the goods bear indicated or fixed retail prices.  The existence of branded price-maintained goods tends to lead not only to the opening of new grocery shops but to the distribution of such goods through outlets outside the grocery trade.  Hence, in the opinion of the commission, resale price maintenance is a factor making for an increase in the number of outlets.  The price cutting of branded goods in the <Col N="644" /> grocery trade in recent years stems largely from a basic maladjustment of costs and margins which arises primarily because of the effect of price maintenance in raising the margins on proprietary goods relative to those on goods the prices of which are not maintained.</P>
    <P>The commission point out that a trader may expand his business by improving or extending the services he provides, including not only credit and delivery but also variety and range of stocks and amenities generally.  However, it is also possible for a trader to increase his business by reducing the services he provides if by so doing he can offer an alternative inducement to his customers in the form of reduced prices.  In the opinion of the commission, it is not fair to deny the consumer some compensation in prices where goods are paid for and taken away rather than delivered on a credit basis.</P>
    <P>In the view of the commission if, instead of price competition applying to an ever-narrowing range of &ldquo;free&rdquo; goods, its scope were greatly extended by the abolition of resale price maintenance, the pressure of price competition, by being more diffused, would tend to be less severe on particular groups of commodities.  Intensive price competition, if it did occur, might be expected to constitute a transitional phase only and the trade would quickly adjust itself to the new situation.  In the view of the commission, there was every likelihood that the independent trader would maintain his position in the trade.</P>
    <P>The commission indicate that evidence at the inquiry made it clear that a comprehensive system for the collective maintenance of resale prices might have been successfully established which, by eliminating price competition in proprietary goods, would have raised further the prices of those goods in areas where competition previously existed.  The groundwork would have been laid for an extension of the practice to its furthest practicable limits.</P>
    <P>A policy of trade boycotts by an association as a means of maintaining resale prices is, in the commission's <Col N="645" /> view, undersirable and could operate unjustly to the detriment of particular traders.  The maintenance of resale prices by an individual supplier would result in an undesirable rigidity of prices which, in the opinion of the commission, would not be in the public interest.  If such maintenance received legislative sanction, it would probably be adopted more widely and practised more effectively than before. If individual resale price maintenance were permitted, a strong association of traders could induce first one manufacturer and then another to increase margins.  Restrictions, once established, tend inevitably to lead to further restrictions, whereas the abolition of price maintenance would allow competition to act as a check to the extensive expansion of margins.  The commission consider that competition at both the wholesale and retail levels is beneficial and should not be hindered by the maintenance of prices at either level.</P>
    <P>The commission recommend that certain safeguards should be provided against the contingency that extreme price competition might arise for short periods in the larger cities.  They propose, therefore, that a supplier be allowed to withhold supplies from a retailer who resells a branded product at a price equal to or less than its price to retailers before the deduction of any quantity discounts.  Where there is no trade discount, but only a scale of quantity discounts, it is proposed that a supplier might withhold supplies if the retailer resells at a price equal to or less than the price to retailers of the minimum quantity prescribed in the scale.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure flexibility, it is proposed that the commission may, if they think fit, require a supplier to substitute for the wholesale price of his product as defined the average price charged to one or more classes of retailers in one or more areas.  The commission also propose that a supplier may withhold goods from a retailer who advertises or displays a lower price in conjunction with the supplier's suggested or recommended retail price, provided that if the supplier affixes a price to the container <Col N="646" /> of the product the retailer may, within the premises where the product is exposed for sale, display a price less than the supplier's price.</P>
    <P>The commission also recommend that a supplier should be free to withhold goods from a wholesaler who refuses to cease supplying a retailer who resells a branded product at or below the wholesale price or advertises the supplier's suggested retail price in conjunction with the retailer's own price.  It is envisaged that a supplier would have to notify the commission of the withholding of supplies in any of these cases and that the commission would have the right to review the action taken.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the question of trade terms, the commission point out in their report that quantity discounts should, as accurately as possible, reflect economies accruing to the supplier from supplying goods in quantity.  The commission are of the view that there is nothing unfair or undesirable in the integration of wholesaling and retailing functions. Reasonable grounds were advanced by witnesses for distinguishing between different classes of wholesalers in the terms afforded by manufacturers and the commission see no objection to the adoption on an equitable basis of such distinctions by a manufacturer in the light of his own particular distribution problems.</P>
    <P>They recognise, however, that a retailer may seek wholesaling status primarily to secure higher discounts for his retail business and they suggest, therefore, that manufacturers should consider allowing wholesalers' terms only in respect of goods resold to other retailers.  Subject to fairness to all concerned, the commission consider that the terms to be allowed to co-operative wholesale societies and to multiple shops, having regard to their relative size and the functions they perform, should be left to the discretion of the individual supplier.</P>
    <P>With regard to co-operative societies such as A.D.M. to which I have referred, the commission point out that, because of the risk attendant on their voluntary nature, the functions performed by such bodies are more <Col N="647" /> characteristic of wholesaling than are those of a multiple shop firm.  In the commission's view, there appears to be no valid justification for refusing to supply them on grounds related largely to the consideration that they represent a novel form of trading.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps mention at this stage that, after the report of the public inquiry had been presented to the then Minister, the commission became aware of a concerted movement on the part of certain suppliers to grant unfavourable trade terms to certain co-operative societies.  The commission subsequently made fair trading rules under the provisions of the Act prescribing that, subject to certain conditions, these co-operative societies should be allowed at least the most favourable terms available to a multiple shop firm not more than one-fifth of whose purchases of a supplier's goods were for resale to independent retailers.  The commission have made it clear that they are prescribing a minimum status and they have emphasised that this should not be taken as indicating the maximum permissible status for such bodies and that they would not consider it unreasonable for any manufacturer to accord such a society the best wholesale terms even if they were not available to multiple shops.</P>
    <P>The commission state in their report that there was no evidence that entry to the trade at any level was limited or controlled by collective arrangement or that membership of a trade organisation was made the condition of the supply of the goods.  Nevertheless, the commission deem it prudent to recommend that control of entry to the trade should not be exercised by any association or group of suppliers or traders.  The commission also consider that it is contrary to the public interest for any organisation to take action to prevent development of new methods of trading.  With regard to the attitude adopted by R.G.D.A.T.A. towards certain co-operative societies, the commission conclude that collective action to exclude a co-operative society from trading at any level constitutes a restraint of trade which is unfair and operates against the public interest and <Col N="648" /> they recommend that it should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>The commission consider that the collective fixing of prices and margins is not in the public interest, and they recommend that such arrangements should be prohibited.  It is the view of the commission that, in a small market such as ours, partial or total removal, by concerted action, of price competition is liable to lead to stagnation, by removing a stimulus to the development of more efficient methods of production or distribution.</P>
    <P>With the object of removing the abuses which exist and restoring conditions of free and fair competition in the trade, the commission recommend in their report that an Order should be made prohibiting the particular practices which are considered to be harmful to the public interest.  They recommend that, subject to the adoption of safeguards against the contingency of excessive price competition, resale price maintenance should be prohibited and that it should be made possible for retailers to determine their own selling prices in the light of their own operating costs.  They recommend also that there should be a prohibition on the collective fixing of suppliers' and wholesalers' selling prices, and that it should be unlawful for a supplier to withhold supplies from any trader on the grounds that he is or is not a member of a particular organisation or association or because his name does not appear on an &ldquo;approved&rdquo; list.  The commission recommend furthermore that no trade association should be permitted to coerce a supplier to withhold supplies from any person and that no association should be allowed to prepare or publish lists of &ldquo;approved&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-approved&rdquo; persons which are likely to restrict entry to the trade or to be used as a basis for regulating or influencing the supply and distribution of grocery goods or the terms and conditions on which the goods will be supplied.</P>
    <P>There are, finally, two recommendations by the commission regarding the imposition by individual suppliers of terms and conditions for the acceptance of orders.  Firstly, it is recommended that there should be a prohibition <Col N="649" /> against a supplier exercising unfair discrimination in respect of the supply and distribution of the goods. Secondly, it is recommended that a supplier should be permitted to impose conditions covering such matters as the size and frequency of orders.  The only reservations are that these conditions should be reasonable, that they should be applied equitably to all persons seeking supplies and that, where the commission so require, they should be filed with the commission.  The commission do not consider that a supplier should be prevented from advertising or specifying a maximum resale price for a branded product or from withholding supplies from traders who sell at a price in excess of such maximum price.  Any such specified maximum price should not, however, be binding on traders as a minimum price.</P>
    <P>I gave careful consideration to the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission and I came to the conclusion that the commission were fully justified in making the recommendations which are contained in their report.  I am satisfied that it is contrary to the public interest that competition should be restricted by the operation of arrangements for the enforcement of resale prices.  I consider also that it is wrong that vested interests should, by a policy of trade boycotts or otherwise, attempt to enforce resale prices or to prevent the supply of goods to any trader or influence the terms and conditions on which the goods will be supplied.</P>
    <P>The Order which was made in 1956 by my predecessor was designed to give effect to the recommendations contained in the report of the Fair Trade Commission.  As Deputies are aware the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, provides that an Order of this kind shall not have effect unless and until it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The necessary Bill to confirm the 1956 Order was not introduced because my predecessor decided to leave the matter over until after an event due to take place in March last year.</P>
    <P>As a result of a study which I made of the Order, I came to the conclusion that it required amendment in <Col N="650" /> some respects to render a number of its provisions more equitable.  I accordingly made an amending Order which involves three main amendments in the original Order.  Firstly, it will permit a trade association to bring to the notice of a supplier any case in which a retailer resells a branded product at or below a specified wholesale price or sets out to contrast his own lower price with the supplier's recommended price for such a product.  I should like to emphasise, however, that an association availing of this provision will be prohibited from exerting any pressure whatever on the supplier to withhold supplies from, or otherwise discriminate against, the retailer.</P>
    <P>The second amendment is designed to make it clear that a supplier or a wholesaler, or a combination of wholesalers, may divide customers&mdash; that is to say wholesalers or retailers &mdash;into different classes for the purpose of applying, to the acceptance of orders for goods, different terms and conditions to each class.  The effect of this provision will be that individual suppliers and wholesalers will be free to classify their customers in accordance with the functions which they perform or the quantities of goods which they purchase.  It may be observed that combinations of wholesalers, not being trade associations, will be permitted to do the same thing.  The object of this is to facilitate the formation of what are known as voluntary chains of retailers.</P>
    <P>These voluntary chains are formed by one or more wholesalers entering into an agreement or arrangement with a number of retailers under which the retailers make all their purchases of selected products from the wholesalers concerned and the wholesalers in turn accord special trade terms to the retailers and co-operate with the retailers in such matters as joint advertising. I understand that this form of trading has developed in certain continental countries, and I am of opinion that its growth in this country should not be discouraged.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that the classification accorded to any wholesaler or retailer will be capable of being reviewed by the commission and, if the <Col N="651" /> commission are of opinion that the classification is unfair, the supplier will be obliged to make whatever alterations the commission may require.  The third amendment effected by the Order which I made last July is designed to permit an individual manufacturer to adopt a schedule of rates of discount prepared by a trade association of which he is a member and to relate quantity discounts for a particular product to the total purchases of that product made from all manufacturers who are members of the association.  It will, however, be unlawful for any association to coerce a manufacturer into adopting any such schedule of rates; and the commission will be entitled to review any schedule of rates prepared by an association and to require the association to make whatever alterations the commission see fit.</P>
    <P>Since the Orders were published, it has been represented to me that they are unfair to certain sections of the trade and that they will, when confirmed, have adverse effects on the trade as a whole.  It has been represented, for example, that the Orders favour the large trader at the expense of the small and that, with the growth of competition, the tendency will be for the small and medium sized trader to be eliminated.  It is claimed that the Orders interfere in an unwarranted fashion with the rights of traders to combine for the purpose of protecting their interests.</P>
    <P>With regard to these criticisms, I must point out that in their report of the public inquiry the Fair Trade Commission adverted to the argument that the abolition of the maintenance of resale prices would lead to the elimination of the small independent trader.  Having examined the matter in all its aspects, the commission came to the conclusion that in the long run there was every likelihood that the small independent trader would maintain his position in the trade.</P>
    <P>As regards the right of grocers to combine for the protection of their interests, I would like to point out that there is no objection to their exercising that right, provided they do not act at the same time against the public <Col N="652" /> interest.  I want to make it perfectly clear, however, that the Government will not tolerate action designed to maintain artificially high profit margins in relation to food products purchased by every household in the country.</P>
    <P>It has been represented to me that under the Orders it will be possible for large wholesale-retail combines to use their special position to drive small traders out of business.  It has been suggested that, by working on their wholesale margins only, these large firms will be able to sell retail at a lower price than the small grocer can buy from wholesalers.  The amending Order which I made last July provides that the Fair Trade Commission, on its own initiative, or following a complaint, may investigate the terms and conditions imposed by suppliers or wholesalers and, if the commission think that these terms and conditions are unfair, they may direct the supplier or wholesaler concerned to make whatever alterations in the terms and conditions may be considered necessary by the commission. I am perfectly satisfied that this provision will enable the commission to deal with any complaints of inequalities in the buying power of grocers of different classes.</P>
    <P>It has been strongly urged that resale price maintenance at the retail level should not only be permitted but be made enforceable by law, or, alternatively, that the law should provide that all retailers must take a minimum margin of profit on wholesale prices. I must make it clear that I reject both of these proposals.  I think that the case for resale price maintenance in the grocery trade has been very thoroughly demolished by the Fair Trade Commission and I agree entirely with the commission's view that this practice is contrary to the public interest and that it should be prohibited. I am satisfied also that the notion of a legal mark-up on wholesale prices is completely impracticable. I cannot conceive of any system to be enforced by law which would work and which would be fair to all concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill which is now before the House is the Confirmation Bill which <Col N="653" /> is necessary to give the force of law to the two Orders which have been made.  In the case of Confirmation Bills of this kind, the arrangement is that the Orders which it is proposed to confirm are not capable of being amended by the House but must be accepted or rejected as they stand. The matters dealt with in the present Orders have been the subject of a detailed public inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission and the evidence and views of the commission are set out very fully in their report.  I recommend that the House should approve of this Bill which, on enactment, will, I trust, put an end to unfair restrictive practices in the grocery trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary for me to say that we in Fine Gael believe the future of our country depends on private enterprise.  The system, however, cannot hope to work unless it is enterprise and enterprise can only exist where there is full scope for free competition.  In those circumstances, it appears clear that there is a necessity for some Order such as that before us in this Bill, the original Order and the amending Order.</P>
      <P>The Act of 1953, as the Minister said in his concluding remarks, does not permit of the House amending in any detail any of the Orders made.  We have to accept or reject the Order <i>in toto.</i>  As I have said, it seems clear that there is a case for the Orders and in those circumstances there is no possible line to take on this, except to accept the Bill, since we are prohibited by the form of the legislation from considering whether or not we would wish to make detailed adjustments here or there.  Therefore, while accepting the principles of the Bill, I should like to make one comment on one aspect which the Minister mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it could be said to be true&mdash;and it might be inferred from the Minister's remarks&mdash;that there is an unduly high profit margin in the grocery trade.  Any experience I have of the profits in that trade&mdash;and the Minister will concede, I am sure, that in the course of my business I would come across such from time to time&mdash; makes it clear to me that the margin of profits on which those in that trade <Col N="654" /> have to work is a very modest one indeed. I do not think that it would be right for anyone to get an impression, from the Minister's remarks in relation to an unduly high profit margin, that one can accept that there is such at present.  If, however, he merely intended to say that in the future he could not accept a position in which the effect of an association's actions would be to create a system of an unduly high profit margin, then I could accept his remarks.</P>
    <P>I am not a bit sure that, over our whole field of industry, taking it as a whole, we have not in the post-war period allowed too small margins for the write-back and build-up of future reserves and future expansion.  True, there have been individual cases in which the profit margin which has been taken has been wholly irrational and wholly unjustifiable, but they are only the individual cases and quite the exception to the rule.  I think it is accepted almost by everybody that the pattern of Irish industry is so bound up that the reserves for future development come from the industry itself rather than from outside it.  They can come from the industry itself only if there is an adequate margin to enable future development to be built up and an adequate margin, in fact, therefore, to provide savings to go into future development.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is an entirely different thing from stating that people should make unfair and unjust profits and it is an entirely different thing from saying that they should batten or be allowed to batten on the community. There should be a recognition of the fact that, in relation to the grocery trade, for example, the provisions of the Health Acts mean that there has to be a substantial amount more now&mdash;and there will be, in the future&mdash;sunk in that business; and that the only method in which many of the small shops up and down the country can get the money to carry out the Health Act requirements is from their profit margin.  While no one wants it to be too big, at the same time, anyone who examines any grocery business at present will certainly not find that the margin of gross profit is one that is excessive.</P>
    <Col N="655" />
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am&mdash;and I feel I probably will be&mdash;a voice crying in the wilderness in this connection.  At the same time, I feel that there is an opinion which I share and which should be clearly expressed in this House.  It has been conveyed to us by the Minister that the Fair Trade Commission has reported, first to his predecessor and then to himself, in some detail; and he has quoted from that report.  To my mind, and probably to that of any ordinary layman, that report is the most unadulterated nonsense. It does not conform with the facts as known to the ordinary man in the street and when it gets involved in technicalities, it is quite incapable of being understood by any ordinary man.</P>
      <P>When we look at the original Order, it would seem that the first preconception&mdash;and I am convinced it was a preconception&mdash;by the Fair Trade Commission was that resale price maintenance was an offence against the community. Now, where they got that idea I do not know.  They seem to feel that it is a well-known practice of business people to keep prices as high as they can and thereby to keep profits equally high; whereas, in actual fact, any business man knows perfectly well that profit comes much more readily from an increased turnover than from an increased profit margin on a small turnover. All economic pressure on any business man, therefore, is to keep his prices at the lowest possible economic level, in the hope of increasing his turnover thereby.</P>
      <P>The Fair Trade Commission have insisted that resale price maintenance is against the public interest and thereby they have shown themselves to be years out of date in their whole conception. It was tried in Great Britain and has been completely reversed now, without any opposition from anyone. Resale price maintenance is now enforceable there and it is enforced strictly by the courts.  That could not be the case if it were so improper and so much against the public interest. The Labour Party in Great Britain would have raised a row long ago if it had been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of a conservative <Col N="656" /> capitalist manæuvre; this is a matter of ordinary common sense if we are to have any trade stability at all.  It is a matter of common knowledge that ever since the Fair Trade Commission interfered in the grocery trade, there has been a horrible mushroom growth of small, cut-price shops which has acted very much against stability of trade generally, against stability of employment in the trade and to the detriment, in many cases, of the customers.</P>
    <P>I have received repeated complaints, not from shopowners or business men but from the customers of ordinary retail grocery establishments, who have complained that their own suppliers, their own retailers, are being put out of business by shops into which these people are not prepared to go.  They say: &ldquo;We have always dealt with reputable establishments where there is a proper standard of cleanliness, a good standard of service, where we know the quality of what we buy is good, as we always knew it.&rdquo;  Quite a number of people also feel that they have a responsibility towards those who actually serve them in the shops and they like to know that the staff have proper hours of work, proper conditions of employment and full trade union wages.  In spite of constant denials, there have been frequent cases, known to the ordinary man in the street, where full trade union wages are not being paid in cut-price shops, where excessive hours are worked and where proper precautions are not taken for the preservation of food in good condition.</P>
    <P>All this mushroom growth of cut-price shops has, I am convinced, reacted against the public interest.  It has upset the trade; it has undoubtedly given rise to breaches of normal business practice.  This price-cutting is not, as was suggested to-day, caused by any maladjustment of profit margins. That is another fanciful suggestion of the Fair Trade Commission for which they give no justification whatever. The Fair Trade Commission have now recommended that nobody should sell goods in grocery shops at, or below, cost.  If anybody can make sense out <Col N="657" /> of that, he is a better man than I am because one does not have to be much of a business man to know that to sell at, or below, cost is no fun and it certainly means that one has no future as a business man.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission are now trying to interfere with the discounts to wholesalers and co-operative buying organisations.  This completely unqualified body sets out to advise business men who have been in the trade for years and years and tells them how to adjust their discounts and their margins.  I wish that people would interfere only when they know what they are talking about and would try to understand the evidence put before them.  From what I have seen, the Fair Trade Commission always start out with a preconceived idea and treat evidence with the utmost contempt, except where it happens to fit in with their preconceived ideas.  I am absolutely convinced&mdash;although the Minister is not&mdash;that there is a grave danger that this interference by the Fair Trade Commission may make it possible for favouritism to be shown to the large, as against the small, concern.</P>
    <P>This whole business has led to dishonest practices of all sorts, some of which were actually revealed before the Fair Trade Commission at the inquiry.  Evidence was given that some cut-price shops were marking up the prices of articles showing increased prices, then striking the prices out and saying: &ldquo;Our special price is...&rdquo; and quoting low prices, when in actual fact, they were selling at the retail prices recommended by the manufacturer. To my mind, that is damnably dishonest.  The attitude of the Fair Trade Commission was that that was perfectly fair trading practice. That shows, I think, the complete confusion of thought behind the whole thing, when the Fair Trade Commission can almost recommend that a man should describe his shop as a cut-price concern when he is not cutting prices; can almost recommend that a man can say: &ldquo;The ordinary price of the article is 5/-; my price is 4/-&rdquo;, when in actual fact the standard price of the article is 4/- If that is <Col N="658" /> what they feel fair trade is, I must part company with them altogether.</P>
    <P>The incomprehensibility of the two Orders makes it essential that the Fair Trade Commission remain in operation for a very long time and I cannot escape the suspicion that that may have been in their minds all along, that they are making work for themselves by producing a recommendation which is impossible to understand. Even if we regard the amending Order &mdash;I realise that this cannot, of course, be amended in any way; I just wish to refer to it to illustrate my point&mdash;it states in paragraph 4 that the principal Order is amended as follows: &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Order a supplier may...&rdquo; and at the end of that paragraph, it says: &ldquo;provided that the conditions are applied without any discrimination to all persons purchasing or intending to purchase, such goods from that supplier.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is &ldquo;unfair discrimination&rdquo;? Can one have fair discrimination and unfair discrimination and who is to say what is fair and unfair?  We go back to the Fair Trade Commission again. They are keeping themselves in a job and while they are trying to make up their own minds&mdash;because I am perfectly sure they do not know and will never know&mdash;the trade will remain in a state of chaos.  They have said in several cases: &ldquo;provided this is not unfair.&rdquo;  Legislation, if it is to be just, must be capable of being understood I, for one, do not understand it.</P>
    <P>I object very strongly to the attitude of the Fair Trade Commission.  I think they have disregarded evidence which was submitted to them; I think they have interfered quite unwarrantably in a trade which was getting on very steadily.  I think there was every evidence to show there was adequate competition already without encouraging and positively fostering this price-cutting racket.  That is what it is.</P>
    <P>Eventually the Fair Trade Commission say that even if there is some dislocation, it will probably sort itself out in time.  What a pious hope!  That is what it comes to.  In the meantime, small businesses are to be put out of business, employees put out of employment and no good will come of it one way or the other.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> I am most disappointed with the manner in which the Fair Trade Commission have acted in this matter, but it is typical of the way they have approached all other matters which have arisen.  They have been in action a long time: they produced the original Order in 1956, two years ago.  Nothing has happened since except that the original Order now has to be amended. I know perfectly well that the Order will require further amendment and further amendment again.  It is just what happened with the price control legislation.  We had a Prices Advisory Body, a Prices Commission and eventually the whole thing had to be wound up.  Thank Heaven for that, because it was quite impracticable.  The same thing will happen eventually with the Fair Trade Commission.  It will become completely befogged in its own incomprehensibility.</P>
    <P>I wish we could build up more public opinion.  I know I am very much in a minority on this at the moment, but I hope people will eventually see the writing on the wall: once unqualified people with prejudiced minds and preconceived ideas start interfering in a very technical matter, they inevitably make a mess of it, and they continue to make that mess even messier by producing amending suggestions or recommendations to the Minister.  On, and on, and on the mess goes, providing employment for a small group of civil servants and causing untold damage to a perfectly legitimate trade serving the community in a reasonable and economic way.  This legislation will, I am afraid, cause damage not only to the trade but to the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true to say that there is no trade in which there is a greater degree of competition than the grocery trade.  Per hundred or per thousand of the population, there must be a greater number of grocery shops as against any other shops.  That alone guarantees an adequate degree of competition.  It does more; it even guarantees that there will be quite a degree of unfair competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grocer suffers to a greater degree <Col N="660" /> than other traders in that his customers are growing fewer and fewer, due to emigration and considerable unemployment. Undoubtedly, the greatest number of grocers are the small and medium grocers.  They cannot be maintained as a unit in the distribution system, unless they have a fair opportunity of earning a fair profit. They cannot stand up to competition from the chain store or the firms in a position to purchase in bulk and retail at less than the normal or recognised retail prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the small and medium grocers.  I do not think the Bill as outline by him will be sufficient to guarantee their position, unless there is some method by which unfair competition can be investigated and arrested quickly.  The mere statement that the Fair Trade Commission can, on its own initiative, institute an inquiry is not sufficient, unless that inquiry can be made quickly and effectively.  Unless the fact is recognised that a large section of the grocery trade is of its very nature dependent upon fixed prices for branded commodities&mdash;fixed prices that are not unfair prices&mdash;the small grocer must continue to suffer.  More and more of the products which the grocer sells are being packed and sold at fixed prices.  These are not unfair prices.  They are open to very clear investigation.  Both the wholesale prices and the retail prices are easily obtained.  The bigger concern, the chain store, can buy in bulk, package in whatever size packet suits them, and sell in a smaller unit at an apparently lower price, giving the impression of equal or better value, as against the small grocer who has to sell whatever the wholesaler or manufacturer sends him.</P>
    <P>Some degree of price maintenance must be recognised if we intend to maintain the medium and small grocer. If we want the grocery trade to develop in the same way as it has developed in Great Britain and the United States, where you have supermarkets and very large stores, well and good.  Then, the best thing is to forget about the medium and small grocer and not have any competition of any kind.  If it is our intention, <Col N="661" /> however, to maintain the small and medium grocer, then we must give him an opportunity of getting a fair price.  I do not see how that can be done, unless there is some recognition of price maintenance.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy mentioned that the small grocer suffers from yet another disability, namely, lack of capital.  He cannot buy and store in anticipation of a rise in prices.  He cannot take advantage of quantity discounts.  He must buy at the recognised wholesale price and sell at the recognised retail price.</P>
    <P>In considering the question of a fair price, there is also the question of a just price.  A cut price is not a just price.  The individual who cuts prices finds some other way of compensating himself.  He either underpays his employees or goes out of business, leaving a trail of damage after him and probably a trail of debts.  Since so much of the goods are now packaged under recognised reputable brands, carrying fixed retail prices that can be easily investigated, some degree of price maintenance must of necessity exist in the trade.  The mere fact that there are so many grocery shops and a declining number of customers guarantees adequate competition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Russell's remarks in relation to the state of the grocery trade generally.  There is no other trade in which there are so many people engaged, both proprietors and employees, and there is no other trade in which so many people will be affected by this Restrictive Trade Practices Order.  Anybody who knows the trade and conditions generally realises that grocers are not getting a fat living.  Price maintenance must be recognised to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Small grocers are obliged to compete with travelling shops which leave the goods at the consumer's door, possibly not in as good condition as that in which they could be obtained in the shops.  These travelling shops do not provide livelihoods for others.  It is a general complaint in many country towns that, because these travelling shops have little obligation in the matter of payment of rates on premises <Col N="662" /> and the ordinary expenses of maintenance and depreciation, they have the added advantage that they can compete unfairly with those who provide amenities for their customers and livelihoods for their employees.  If the competition becomes too keen and reasonable price maintenance is not recognised, we shall eventually find ourselves with self-service shops in which a still smaller number will get a livelihood.</P>
    <P>I do not find myself fully in agreement with the remarks of Deputy Booth because I feel that he was very much in favour of the maintenance of vested interests, regardless of the purpose for which the Fair Trade Commission was set up as a referee between the consumer and those who supply goods.  I consider that reasonable regulations are desirable to ensure that the public interest will be properly recognised.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal to be said in favour of genuine competition.  When the public are obliged to suffer by price cutting, that is the time when those who implement the regulations should interfere.  They should interfere at that stage to ensure that there will be no lowering of the standard of service or the standard of goods supplied, as a result of unfair price cutting which obviously is a type of price cutting which would not be regarded as a normal business activity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will agree with Deputy Sweetman that in the grocery trade as a whole, in respect of the whole range of commodities sold in that trade, unduly excessive profits are not being made.  It is also true to say that a well-run grocery business will not do too badly.  The point which I think the commission wanted to emphasise, however, in relation to the practice of resale price maintenance is that the effect of permitting it is to concentrate competition on a narrowing range of products, the products that are not so controlled, which are in that sense free, and that the net result, in their view, would be bad for the established grocery trade.  The normal suppliers of those products would be subjected to intensive competition in that range, whereas the sale of branded packaged and price fixed goods could easily <Col N="663" /> develop outside the normal grocery shop and become established in other types of shops, increasing the number of retail outlets.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Rooney has misunderstood the Order to some extent. It is not proposed to prohibit a manufacturer from indicating to the retailer the price at which his product should be sold.  What it is proposed to prohibit is the withholding of supplies from that retailer if he sells it at a lower price, provided that price is not less than the wholesale price.</P>
      <P>Deputy Booth, I think, was allowing his general prejudice towards the Fair Trade Commission to upset his judgment in regard to this Order.  In this field, whatever about other fields, it is quite obvious there was an organisation of traders who set out to maintain the level of prices for the products they sold, to increase the margins they were getting on those products, by the process of ensuring that any trader who did not sell at the fixed prices would be refused supplies not merely of those goods but of all goods and effectively put out of business.</P>
      <P>Whatever the present views of the leaders of that organisation may be regarding that matter the body at the time the inquiry was held were vigorously pursuing that policy of boycott to the extent of endeavouring to ensure that no manufacturer would supply goods to a shop which was selling any branded goods at less than the manufacturer's price.  That is obviously an undesirable practice.  It is not true to say that the Fair Trade Commission went out to foster the cut-price racket. What they were endeavouring to do was to stop the price-fixing racket.  If one has to choose between these two rackets from the point of view of which is the least undesirable from the point of view of the public interest, I do not think many of us would have difficulty in making a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter that Deputy Booth should take note of because his information regarding it is wrong.  It is perfectly true that the British Restrictive Practices Act permits an individual manufacturer to retain resale price maintenance, to compel <Col N="664" /> the retailer to sell at a price fixed by him, by means of a court injunction. It is also true that that has been a complete fiasco.  May I quote for Deputy Booth's information from <i>The Economist</i> of July 5th an article headed &ldquo;Prices Unmaintained&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The most interesting thing, however, has been the attitude of manufacturers towards the cut-price shopkeeper since the Restrictive Practices Act was passed in 1956.  Under the Act, individual firms were given the legal right to enforce their own resale prices and many people feared that this power would be used widely enough to stifle retail competition. In fact, quite the reverse has happened. Most manufacturers are glad that the final selling price of their goods should be lowered and have decided that it is neither desirable nor practicable to sue a shopkeeper for selling to the public cheap.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of the failure of that provision of the British Act, assuming conditions operating there are the same as conditions here, it is quite obvious that there would be little advantage to be secured by retailers by permitting a similar system of individual resale price maintenance here.  Indeed, all the indications are that the effect of this Order will be beneficial to the trade and will help to restore in it that competitive element which was there before the war but which was driven out of it very largely because of our price-fixing arrangements during the war.  It is perfectly true that when we had these price control measures, applying only to the most essential goods, the margins allowed to traders were often very low indeed and traders were in effect told that in so far as the margins were not enough to enable them to make a decent profit on the sale of those goods, they could make up for that by increasing the margins on the goods that were not controlled.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of that system over a number of years distorted the situation in the trade and it is only by the enactment of an Order of this kind that you can really get them back into a competitive condition.  There will <Col N="665" /> always be the trader who will try to get increased business by cutting prices.  I want to say about the price cutter and the assumption that he is necessarily a public enemy, or at least an enemy of all decent traders, that if the price cutter, as he is so described, can make a reasonable profit and get a reasonable livelihood from his operations, then he is not a price cutter at all; he is selling at what is a fair price having regard to his operating costs.  If he is not making profits, he will soon be out of business.  The situation which is developing in Dublin is that there are far more of the price-cutting shops closing down than <i>bona fide</i> grocery establishments.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that in a trade of this kind in which so many people participate some firms will always from time to time seek to increase their own business by giving the public better value.  I do not think that is a menace to the grocer at all.  The real menace is the draper and the hardware merchant or other people who have not normally been selling grocery goods but occasionally buying large consignments of some particularly well-known brand of products and selling them out at a loss and thus disturbing the ordinary rhythm of the trade.  The Order does, in fact, ensure that the legitimate traders can be protected against that device and, I think, that could be, in the course of time, a far greater safeguard to them than the dubious provisions of the British Restrictive Practices Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to continue the Exchange Control Act, 1954, for a further four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> Before the war, when sterling was freely convertible into any other currency, this country could at all times rely on using sterling so as to make payments or transfer money to any country.  The restrictions on sterling transferability which have been in operation in varying degrees since 1939 suspended this facility and made it necessary to husband our receipts of dollars and other non-sterling exchange and to control our sterling payments to all non-sterling countries.</P>
    <P>The emergency legislation which gave power to operate this exchange control was replaced in 1954 by the Exchange Control Act.  As it was hoped that the need for exchange control would pass, the Act was expressed to terminate on 31st December, 1958.</P>
    <P>In general the Act provides for the control of</P>
    <P>(a)  payments to and payments on behalf of persons resident outside the sterling area,</P>
    <P>(b)  dealings in gold and foreign exchange,</P>
    <P>(c)  dealings in and the export and import of foreign currency securities and unregistered securities,</P>
    <P>(d)  dealings in sterling area securities on behalf of persons resident outside the area and</P>
    <P>(e)  the export and import of currency notes.</P>
    <P>The Act also provides that goods exported to a country outside the sterling area must be paid for in appropriate foreign exchange within six months.  It empowers the Minister to specify the foreign currencies which must be sold to a bank.  Finally it continues the powers given in the earlier emergency legislation to require the deposit of foreign currency securities and unregistered sterling securities.  While it has not been necessary to bring these latter powers into operation since 1954 it is desirable that they should be retained lest the need for them should again arise.</P>
    <P>General exemptions and permissions are given by way of Ministerial Regulations under the Act.  In addition <Col N="667" /> special permissions are granted in individual cases.  Already in 1954 the control had been considerably relaxed and since then the scope of the exemptions and permissions has been further extended.  At the present time, while capital transfers are allowed only in special circumstances, all classes of payments of a non-capital nature are authorised in full with one exception. The exception is expenditure on holiday travel outside the sterling area where there is a limit&mdash;though a generous one&mdash;of £100 per adult per annum over and above the cost of travel tickets.</P>
    <P>In recent months, the outlook for sterling convertibility on current account has been favourable, but, unfortunately, there are no grounds for hoping that convertibility on the capital side is in sight.  Indeed circumstances might arise which would cause a setback in the progress which has been made.  As Deputies are aware, virtually every country in the world outside the dollar area has still to operate a system of exchange control.  For these reasons, it is necessary that the Act should be continued.  The Bill proposes a further period of four years, but I can assure the Dáil that if circumstances permit at any earlier time, steps will be taken to have exchange control abolished without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us must, unfortunately, agree that in the times in which we live, at the moment the extension of this Bill is necessary.  As the Minister has said, the form of exchange control had been simplified before 1954, and was still further simplified in that Act, and under the delegation that was made, under that Act, to the banks in certain circumstances. I hope that if and when opportunities for further delegation arise, pending a complete abolition, the Minister will not hesitate to take advantage of those opportunities.</P>
      <P>This might be an opportunity to launch into a much wider field in relation to the European Payments Union and otherwise, but I think that perhaps until the free trade negotiations crystallise a little more, it would be wiser to leave that alone.</P>

However, this is the only section on which I think I can introduce the matter.  There are certain other things for which a licence from another Minister is required.  Am I to understand that it is visualised that these licences from another Minister will be made more readily available to people in Shannon than elsewhere?  I <Col N="670" /> have in mind licences for certain classes of agricultural imports, for example.  The Minister for Agriculture has certain licensing powers.  I want to try to discuss this matter in a general way, without going into an individual case, if I can do so.</P>
      <P>It seems to me entirely wrong that a licence should be refused under similar circumstances for an importation.  It seems to me entirely wrong, for example that a licence by the Department of Agriculture should be refused, under similar circumstances, for an importation into Leinster and granted for an importation into Shannon.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. The purpose of this Bill is to continue the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956, which is due to expire on the 19th February next. Under that Act, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is empowered to prohibit by Order the exportation of industrial goods save under licence issued by him.  At present, there is a number of goods subject to export control under the general Control of Exports Order which was made in 1958 under the powers conferred by the Act.  Orders made under the Act have a life of 12 months only and require to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  A resolution annulling an Order can be a passed here at any time during the currency of the Order.  The time has not yet come when the export controls may be dispensed with.  Accordingly, it will be necessary to continue these powers for some further time and that is why this Bill is being moved.</P>
      <P>The need to maintain these powers to control export in certain cases arises from the importance of conserving for the benefit of home industry some raw materials which are continuing to be or which possibly may become in short supply.  Consequently, this Bill is to enable us to fulfil our international commitment to prevent strategic materials which may not be exported from other countries into Iron Curtain countries from being sent through this country.  In other words, our aim is to secure that this country will not be used as a base through which such materials may be sent into these Iron Curtain countries from third countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aim of the Bill is to have immediately available a means of dealing with the situation which would arise in the event of the development of an international emergency of any kind in which the country might be <Col N="673" /> drained of essential materials before corrective legislation could be passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps mention that the possibility of maintaining export controls of this sort in a Free Trade Area is one of the matters discussed at the Paris negotiations and in connection with which we have been seeking the possibility of preserving these powers for a period.</P>
    <P>The number of goods subject to export control has very substantially been reduced but, in respect of those to which it still applies, it is important that it should be maintained.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the absence of alternative proposals Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, as there is no surplus of home-grown wheat, there is no justification for the retention of the levy of 5/9 per barrel imposed to finance the losses on disposal of surplus home-grown wheat, and that any such levy collected in this cereal year should be refunded to the growers forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be no harm to remind the House of how this levy first came to be applied this year.  In July last, this House passed a measure empowering the Minister for Agriculture to set up a board, known as An Bord Gráin, whose function it would be to collect the levy on all wheat.  The purpose of the levy was to dispose of our surplus wheat.  The fixing of the amount of the levy was to be arranged in consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for <Col N="674" /> Agriculture.  Early last August it was announced that the levy for this year would be 5/9 a barrel.  Early in September, as a result of the very bad weather in the earlier part of the year and the continued bad weather right into the harvest, it was found that this year's wheat crop would be of very, very poor quality and that the yield would be very, very low.</P>
    <P>It was found that the majority of millers were refusing to purchase the wheat that had been offered as millable wheat.  A very serious situation arose early on in the harvest.  As a result of that, negotiations took place between the millers, the Department of Agriculture and the National Farmers' Organisation who were speaking for the growers generally.  An arrangement was worked out.  The millers agreed to purchase all sound wheat and that any wheat which was not found suitable for milling would be transferred to the grain growers to be sold for animal feeding.</P>
    <P>As a result of that arrangement, the millers were empowered to import wheat for every barrel of Irish wheat which they had on their hands.  When this arrangement was made, it was discovered that it worked anything but satisfactorily because the millers rejected any wheat they liked.  There was no inducement for the millers to buy the wheat and say it was millable. Practically all the wheat offered to the millers during that period was rejected as millable wheat.</P>
    <P>Representations were made to the Minister at that time and to his Department with regard to what was happening.  I am sure the Minister and the Department knew well what was happening.  As a result of that the floor price was agreed at 63/6 and the wheat was to be purchased.  The effect was that the millers saw to it that all wheat, no matter what the condition of it was, would make no more than 63/6.  If it was found that wheat was in fair condition they found methods of getting the price back to 63/6.  The levy was deducted from that, which brought the price back to 57/9.  All growers knew that was the price that was being offered for wheat.</P>
    <P>It had a very disastrous effect on <Col N="675" /> the wheat position.  The farmers never faced such losses or such a disastrous time on account of the very serious situation.  The Minister should have come out and made the millers have a percentage of Irish wheat.  If the Minister had insisted upon there being a percentage of Irish wheat in the mixture, whether it was 15 per cent., 20 per cent. or 25 per cent., a market would have been immediately created for this wheat.  The millers would find it necessary to buy Irish wheat and that they would have to have this percentage in their mixture but they were left with a free hand.  If they found that the wheat they bought was not suitable for milling they could hand it over to the Grain Board and they would get in exchange imported wheat.</P>
    <P>That is what happened as a result of that agreement.  It was a very bad agreement because the millers just did what they liked.  Every grower in the country is aware of that.  That was a situation which need not have arisen. The result was that the amount of wheat taken over by the millers as millable is very, very low altogether. The Minister gave a figure of 20,000 tons up to the 1st November.  That shows how the thing worked and how little wheat was taken by the millers as millable.  They rejected practically everything that came along.  It is only natural they would do that.  I need scarcely go into the question of the losses sustained in the harvest this year.</P>
    <P>This time 12 months, all the harvest was in and there were over 440,000 tons of millable wheat in the stores.  This year we have 20,000 tons.  Those figures make one realise the losses of the agricultural community this year.  In this motion we are asking that the levy of 5/9 be refunded to the growers.  We think it a very reasonable request.  In the beginning the levy was introduced simply to deal with surplus wheat.  We are far from having a surplus of wheat.  The amount of imported wheat will be very large.  Our request is that the levy should be returned.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that the estimate in respect of the amount of all types of <Col N="676" /> wheat, millable and unmillable, will be around 200,000 tons.  The levy would work out at something like £500,000. To substitute Irish wheat, the millers will be importing approximately 250,000 tons of foreign wheat and there will be a saving to the country on that wheat over Irish wheat of something like £11 a ton.  The Minister gave a figure here to-day. He said the price of imported wheat varied from £24 to £27 10s. per ton. Even if we take the figure of £27 a ton and take the price of £38 per ton for Irish wheat on the mill floor last year, there will be a saving of £11 a ton. On 250,000 tons, that will mean wheat the Grain Board will have to convert into animal feeding&mdash;around 150,000 tons.  The loss, at £9 per ton, is estimated at around £1,350,000.</P>
    <P>There is no problem as far as meeting this levy is concerned.  It is not needed.  The money is there to meet it without any hardship on anyone. Due to bad weather and low yields, the farmers have had tremendous losses.  Every grower is expecting that, in the circumstances, this, and something more, will be done.  The Minister has a duty to the growers.  He has failed in that duty.  He kept away from some of those conferences when he should have been there to see that the growers' interests were protected. As a result, the millers had a completely free hand.  In such a disastrous year, there was a responsibility on the Minister to see to it that the growers were treated properly.  They were not treated properly and they had very serious losses.  We are asking the House to see to it that at least this 5/9 per barrel will be refunded to the growers.  It is a reasonable request and I hope it gets the proper support here.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="677" /> The case put forward by Deputy Hughes is one put forward by a practical farmer who understands the enormous difficulties and the seriousness of the situation, as far as this year's harvest is concerned.  The income of the farmer has been tremendously reduced because of the abnormal weather conditions, probably the worst weather conditions in 120 years.  We do not put the responsibility for the bad weather on the Government, but we draw attention to the fact that the purpose of the levy of 5/9 per barrel was clearly indicated in this House.  It was stated, and a guarantee was given, that this levy would not be collected, unless there was a substantial surplus of home-grown wheat.  It is now clear beyond doubt that there is no surplus of wheat and there is a bounden duty on the Government to refund this 5/9 per barrel to the growers.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party do not put down this motion for fun or for the purpose of soliciting any additional support.  They do not wish to take advantage or make propaganda of the deplorable conditions in which the farmers find themselves.  The Minister and his Department should be aware that the losses the farmers have suffered this year are unknown to anyone except themselves.  Those who have everyday dealings with the small farmer know quite well that he now finds himself in the position that he is unable to pay for the seeds and manures he obtains, that he is unable to pay his shop debts and that those who took conacre for crops now find themselves unable to pay for the conacre because the crops did not yield a sufficient financial return.</P>
    <P>There is very clear evidence that for the first year many years, local authorities and county councils have had to give special concessions to rate collectors for the closing of the rates. In many areas throughout the country, rate collectors are finding it extremely difficult to get prompt payment of rates, not through any deliberate fault of the farmers themselves but because of the difficult position in which they find themselves.  The fact that the Government now stick their hands down deep into the trousers pocket of <Col N="678" /> every wheat grower and extract from it unjustly and unfairly 5/9 per barrel represents only a small proportion of the extraordinary embarrassment the wheat growers have undergone this year.</P>
    <P>What have the Minister and his Department done to safeguard the small and big wheat grower alike from the highway robbery being carried on by the millers, as far as the moisture content of this year's wheat crop is concerned?  Is it not true to say that this year has been a year in which the millers have taken extreme advantage, a year in which they have grown fatter and richer while those who supply the wheat have grown thinner and poorer?  Is it not a fact that the farmer had no defence even though he knew he was being &ldquo;done&rdquo;, even though he knew he was being fleeced and knew quite well that the millers had taken advantage of the bad year? The farmer knew he was not being paid for the quality of the wheat he was bringing into the mills, that he had no redress whatever, no sympathetic advice or guidance from the Minister and his Department, no question of a direction or an expression of sympathy.</P>

      <P>I quite agree that the only matter referred to is the question of the levy.  There is not a single farmer here to-day who voted for Fianna Fáil in the last general election but voted in the full knowledge of the solemn pledge by Fianna Fáil that there would be a profitable and bountiful price per barrel for wheat.  That is what we want to bring out in this motion, whether the Fianna Fáil Party were sincere in addressing the wheat growers at the last general election, <Col N="679" /> whether they were sincere in criticising the wheat policy of the former Minister for Agriculture, whether they were sincere when they said the Fine Gael Party were out to destroy wheat growing and that the Fine Gael Party had no sympathy with the wheat growers. We want to show by this motion that we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to keep to the motion and in asking the House to adopt it I want to issue a challenge, if I may, to the Fianna Fáil Deputies who represent my constituency and who have in the past expressed such great sympathy with the growers of wheat.  This is a golden opportunity for them to support this motion if they are sincere in their expressions of sympathy for the wheat producer and if they are convinced that the Minister for Agriculture is not acting in accordance with his rights in standing over the fact that 5/9 per barrel is to be or has been taken unfairly and without any justfication from the pockets of wheat growers.</P>
      <P>I, and I am sure every Deputy from a wheat-growing constituency who has his name to this motion, would like to hear from the Minister what justification he has for holding on to this levy. Will he tell us why he intends to hold on to it since there is no subsidy on home grown wheat.  Now that the levy has been taken, what steps does he intend to take to see that it is refunded to the growers?  I should like to know if the Minister is aware of the serious plight of the wheat growers and that the acreage of wheat is likely to be negligible next year because even though the Fianna Fáil Party put a heavy burden on wheat growers a few months ago I have a feeling that the last straw was this levy giving a free hand to millers whereby the farmers will be robbed right, left and centre as they have been this harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recommend the motion to the <Col N="680" /> House in all honesty and seriousness. I recommend it because I believe there is a moral and legal obligation on the Government to refund this money that has been taken under false pretences. I hope that when this motion is accepted the Minister for Agriculture will take the necessary steps to see that the millers are ordered forthwith to refund the 5/9 per barrel which they have wrongly and unfairly extracted from the farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition would not be doing their duty if they did not put down this motion which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the absence of alternative proposals Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, as there is no surplus of home-grown wheat, there is no justification for the retention of the levy of 5/9 per barrel imposed to finance the losses on disposal of surplus home-grown wheat, and that any such levy collected in this cereal year should be refunded to the growers forthwith.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is a very reasonable motion and I am surprised that not one of the 75 members of the Fianna Fáil Party have offered to speak to it to-night.  If they feel the Government are entitled to take this 5/9 out of the farmer's pocket we should like to hear their side of the argument.  There is no necessity to go deeply into the position of the farmers.  I suppose we have had the worst year in living memory, with the result that not alone had we reduced yields but practically no yield of millable wheat from this harvest.  The Government estimated we would have 400,000 tons, but in reply to a question we have the information that the likely intake is only 25,000 tons of millable wheat.  That shows that the wheat harvest is practically non-existent this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill proposing this levy was brought in we opposed it.  The Government have been calling, and rightly so, for more production particularly from the agricultural community. It is agreed that the farmer is the man carrying the whole burden of the balance of payments.  Without his exports we would have no money to pay for imports.  The farmers <Col N="681" /> have increased production in response to the Government's appeal and while they were doing so this year they got a very hard knock, not due to Government policy, or anything like that but to the weather.  Several farmers asked: &ldquo;Could it be otherwise?&rdquo; Week after week we were discussing surpluses, whether they were surplus eggs, surplus butter or surplus wheat. The present Government have been talking surpluses since they came into power, and the present Minister instead of encouraging farmers to produce, has stated he is not in favour of guaranteed prices for any crop.</P>
    <P>This year has proved beyond yea or nay that the farmer has to put up with many hazards from the time the wheat goes into the ground, between various diseases, pests and so on.  It involves great trouble and care to bring his crop to the threshing stage. Everybody thought that, due to the extremely bad conditions this year, the Government would be sympathetic especially when they asked the people to produce a certain amount of grain. I do not think any farmer neglected his duty this year.  The best farmer was in the same position as the man who was not too particular about harvesting and farmers were able to secure very little return.  I met several farmers who told me during the harvest that they would be very lucky if they could pay for the seeds and manures they put into the ground.</P>
    <P>If the Government thought there was to be a bumper crop when they brought in this wheat levy, the least they should do in present circumstances is to hand back the levy.  A very prominent member of the Fianna Fáil Party stated that it could be tested in court whether the Government were entitled to take this levy when there is no surplus.  It was brought in solely for the purpose of disposing of the surplus wheat which it was estimated by the officials of the Department of Agriculture we would have this year. We had no surplus this year and therefore I ask why this levy is being retained.</P>
    <P>In my county, this levy means a considerable amount of money, even to the average farmer.  It means £50, £60, or £70 to a very normal farmer in my <Col N="682" /> county, which is a very large wheat-producing county.  I am not going back on the by-election or the general election, in which promises were made that the farmers would get not alone the same price as was given by the former Government but an increased price.  The people feel that a little gesture would be the proper thing this year, that is, that the amount should be handed back.  It was collected for a particular purpose.  It is no longer required for that purpose and therefore it should be handed back.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, not alone has the wheat crop been disastrous this year but the barley crop has been affected.  I understand that in some parts there was a fairly reasonable yield in barley, but it is much reduced. We know that potatoes were practically non-existent.  In my county, people growing wheat in order to fertilise the land went in for a great acreage of peas.  It turned out to be a completely disastrous crop and the farmers did not get in, in most cases, to cut them at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not surprising that in an agricultural country like this, the Government Party cannot maintain even a quorum in the House on such an important motion?  They are not interested in the farmers at all.  Are they not interested in the bad harvest of this year?  Every person, whether living in Dublin or elsewhere, has felt the effect of the bad harvest; yet the Government are not prepared to give even a quorum to the House to discuss this motion and hand back the money taken from the farmers by false pretences&mdash;false pretences in that this money was alloted for the purpose of disposing of surplus grain, of which there is none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another question which I should like to ask now and which quite a number of people are asking.  Why did we dispose of what was supposed to be surplus wheat in storage last year?  Why did the Government subsidise the disposal of that grain to the extent of £250,000 or £500,000?  Why did we export very good quality grain <Col N="683" /> to England at £17 to £19 a ton, while asking our own farmers to pay £24 to £26 a ton?  Of course, the answer will be that we had no storage.  Was any effort made by the Government to find storage for that corn?  I have never heard of any genuine effort throughout the country to find storage.  That corn, which was very good quality corn last year, was all dyed by Fianna Fáil for export to Britain.  At that time, there was plenty of storage.  Even if it had to be made into flour or other things, they could easily have stored it.</P>
    <P>The Government are very favourable to other interests, whatever about the farmers.  As a matter of fact, I asked a question to-day about the importation of biscuits, the quality and value; and I got the answer.  In a supplementary question, I asked whether the biscuit manufacturers were subsidised by the Government to the extent of 20/- to 30/- per sack of flour which they turned into biscuits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I bring this up.  Even last week, a question was asked about the amount spent on improvement of the marketing of farm produce.  Such improved marketing would have a bearing on this question of levy and could be done out of the £250,000 which the Government earmarked when they first came in and out of which they have spent so far only a very small sum on the marketing of agricultural produce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, I feel that the Government were very offhand with other people and the least they could do now is hand back the money taken from the farmers.  When the farmers sent in their miserable bit of wheat, after this terrible harvest, this money was abstracted from their accounts and shown on the bill.  The Government had not the courage, in the first instance, to declare a price for wheat originally, so that the people might know where they stood.  Then they came along in July or August and announced that a levy of 5/9 would be made on the price given the previous year.</P>
      <P>I would ask the supporters of the Government, especially from the wheat-growing areas, to support the farmers now, to support us in our endeavour to give back to the farmers that which has been taken off them by the Government.  The farmers got a raw deal everywhere, in every crop&mdash;and not alone in crops but in milk and in cattle prices.  Everything they had to deal with was affected; yet the Government just sit there and do nothing. I heard from a member of a deputation that attended on the Minister for Agriculture and the Taoiseach, that the Taoiseach seemed to be very sympathetic but that the Minister was in no way sympathetic.  I feel that the reverse should have been the case.  The Minister should be the man to fight hard for the farmers, so that they might get a reasonable living from the land&mdash;the Minister, and not the Taoiseach&mdash;but I heard that the reverse was the case and I was very surprised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Government and the Taoiseach at least to restore this 5/9. We understood a fortnight ago that the Government were not alone giving <Col N="685" /> back the 5/9 but they were paying 7/6 per barrel; and we were very disappointed that that was not the fact. In all fairness, the Government should do this.  I do not say &ldquo;compensate,&rdquo; as they could not compensate properly for the bad harvest this year; but they should give at least some little encouragement to the agricultural community by handling back the 5/9.</P>
    <P>Coming from County Kilkenny, I know what was said in the by-election and in the general election about the price of wheat and I know what was said at every crossroads about these things.  I am not dealing with them now.  I know that no farmer in County Kilkenny ever thought that not only would there be no increase in price but the 5/9 would be taken from every barrel produced.  Wheat was scarce this year; yet the Government were not prepared to soften the least bit; but we hope that, at the end of these four hours, we may have done an amount of good and that the Government will then hand back this money taken from the farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this motion.  It is worthy of note that within this present harvest year, this is the second debate we have had on wheat.  In both debates, we have been dealing with the deliberate actions of the Government.  The first debate we had was brought about by the fact that they had not fixed the price of wheat.  Now we find ourselves debating the point that the Government are taking off every barrel of wheat the farmers deliver or sell, the sum of 5/9.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to trace to the House the simple origin of this levy.  A Bill was introduced here solely for the purpose, as we were told at the time, of marrying the surplus wheat, which had to be sold at a loss, to the anticipated return of wheat from this harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should have been obvious to the Government, and to the Minister for Agriculture and his advisers, that the position this year would definitely be different from that of other years.  Had <Col N="686" /> the weather changed even within the harvest period it was likely that the yield of wheat would not be as big as anticipated.  We on this side of the House understood the position to be&mdash; if we could understand anything from the information we got from the Government, who were in a position to approach their advisers and have intimate contact with all concerned in the industry&mdash;that the Government were budgeting for 400,000 tons of wheat, and anything over and above the estimated yield of last year's harvest, 370,000 tons, would mean a surplus of wheat of which they would have to dispose at a loss.</P>
    <P>It should have been obvious to the Minister and his advisers in or about the month of July, that there would not be much of a surplus of wheat.  In spite of that they carried on with the sales, selling this wheat on a foreign market at £18 a ton.  It may interest the House to know that the merchants handling the wheat in Wexford were not allowed ship it from Wexford. They were told it had to go to Dublin because it would be exported in big ships and these ships could not get into Wexford Harbour.  That meant that another 30/- a ton transport charges was put on to the loss.  It was not exported in big ships but in small ships which could have gone into Wexford Harbour and saved that 30/-.</P>
    <P>That was the mess created around the whole question of this 5/9 and An Bord Gráin, a body set up by the Government.  I am sure the Minister has heard the old proverb: &ldquo;It is the straw that broke the camel's back.&rdquo;  This is the straw that is breaking the farmers' backs.  The Minister, if he knows anything, knows about the tillage counties, or if he has forgotten them, he will find them on the record.  They are the counties in which Fianna Fáil won the seats.  If he has any interest in them and in the people who live in them he knows, or he should know, the condition they are in.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand how one could open a paper during the harvest season when people were standing up to their ankles in mud and slush trying <Col N="687" /> to save their crops and find that somebody in the Department of Agriculture had said that &ldquo;things were not too bad after all and would turn out all right.&rdquo;  Yes, they turned out all right for those running this body but the farmers are paying and paying through the nose for the muddle created by the Government.  That is the sort of policy put before the country this year.</P>
    <P>Let us be fair.  Perhaps it was the most difficult harvest in 100 years, but has there been any realistic attempt made to meet the situation? Some years ago there was a difficult harvest and the people worked day and night; there was co-operation between everyone; there was no levy and no cutting down on the price.  That harvest was cleared and the millers were forced to take the grain and mix it with a percentage of imported grain and they produced the bread because they were forced to do so.  This year we have the ridiculous situation obtaining in which the farmers are getting 63/6 less the levy, less the price for sacks.</P>
    <P>The man who takes the wheat finds it is unmillable.  He has the final decision; he rules the destiny of An Bord Gráin and, I believe the Department of Agriculture and the Fianna Fáil Party and the town members belonging to it, while the unfortunate country members have to sit in silence.  The miller gets a bag of wheat and says that it is unmillable and <i>ipso facto</i> he is allowed to import a barrel of wheat. He imports it; why not as he is going to get it cheaper?  Who is paying for the cheaper wheat which the miller is getting?  It is well for Fianna Fáil to brood on these facts and to remember them.  When Fianna Fáil Deputies are going through their constituencies and are told that by the people who put them here they should think on these things.  It is the truth.  The millers can buy all the foreign wheat they want. This Government says to them: &ldquo;You take the wheat and pass it to An Bord Gráin and we will give you the money. In return you have permission to import all the foreign wheat you want.&rdquo; Is that the policy of this Government? <Col N="688" /> Is it right and is it just?  Is it honourable or, in fact, is it legal&mdash;I doubt it &mdash;for the Government to take 5/9 off the farmer?</P>
    <P>According to a reply to a parliamentary question which I asked last week we shall import 375,000 tons of wheat and we have estimated for approximately 25,000 tons of millable wheat.  When the Minister gets up to reply, and I hope he will reply, perhaps he will tell us who decided that there were only 25,000 tons of millable wheat in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>If the reply is the millers, then every Deputy, whether a dyed-in-the-wool Fianna Fáil Deputy or not, knows that is the truth.  A further question I would ask the Minister is, if it is the millers, was there any check on the millers?  The answer I think is no.  There again, is that not crystal-clear proof of the setup at the moment, whatever tripartite agreement there is?  I have a letter here from the Department of Agriculture, signed by a responsible official, which says that there is a tripartite agreement between the farmers, the millers and An Bord Gráin that they get 63/6 a barrel, less 5/9.  Furthermore, I was told when I complained that the prices were less this year than last year, or any of the preceding years, that the prices were the same as when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>I wonder if some Fianna Fáil Deputies would like to speak.  Mind you, I do not blame them for being silent.  As I said in a previous debate they have my deepest sympathy.  They went around the country and espoused a policy which suggested that all was to be lovely in the tillage areas and that there would be 82/6 a barrel for wheat.  What answer have they got now?  There is nothing for them to say. The simple, sad fact is that it is one of the most complete sell-outs there ever has been, that the Department of Agriculture, the Minister and his official advisers control the whole wheat arena.  There is no justification in the world for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister rises, will he tell us what is going to happen to the 5/9? <Col N="689" /> What is the 5/9 for now?  Is it to balance the sales of wheat?  If it is to balance the sales of wheat, An Bord Gráin, which was voted into existence by this House, must have a responsibility to the Irish public.  The Irish public are the wheat growers, the wheat-growing farmers of Ireland. What test has there been that this wheat which they will sell at a loss is unmillable except simply that it is sent back to them by the miller?  I should like to know these things from the Minister.  If the Minister can get up and justify that, there is some justification for retaining this sum of 5/9.</P>
    <P>We put down this motion and we had the sympathy of every wheat grower in Ireland; we probably have the sympathy of the Minister's colleagues because they must feel just as unhappy about the situation as those who grew the wheat.  It is a sad thing to say that this year we have had two debates on wheat, one occasioned by the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party had not the courage to fix a price for wheat.  It had not the courage, when faced with the situation, to reduce the price, if necessary.  This Party, when in conjoint government with other Parties as an inter-Party group, kept the price of wheat 15/- above the world price.  The Fianna Fáil Party had not the courage to do that; they produced this farcical Gilbertian situation in which nobody knows what is hap-on. Now nobody knows what is happening, except one thing, that the Irish farmer is being dictated to by the millers who are in complete and absolute control of the destinies of the farmers who grow wheat.  Is it the function of the Minister for Agriculture in an agricultural country to allow that unhappy state of affairs to arise?</P>
    <P>One last point I want to stress is the utter confusion that exists in transactions between merchants and farmers&mdash;in fact, I might almost say the breaking of relationships between farmers and merchants which have endured possibly for generations in my county.  I am sure Deputies Hughes and Crotty will think no worse of me if I claim that we are the premier wheat-growing county in Ireland.  At the moment, if independent grain merchants buy wheat from the farmers and <Col N="690" /> give a fair price, the price according to this document which is supposed to represent the same prices as obtained when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, and if that price is about 63/6 these independent grain dealers find they are tied hand and foot.  In other words, if they have not sacrificed themselves entirely to the millers, when they try to sell to the millers, they will be told: &ldquo;You have given too much for that; all we can give is 63/6.&rdquo;  If they try to deal directly with An Bord Gráin, they can get no information as to whether they can sell the wheat to them or not.  The result is they have the wheat on hands and cannot sell it.  The Government have not yet taken a decision.</P>
    <P>I asked that question last week and the Minister for Finance, in the absence of the Minister for Agriculture, told me that no definite decision has been taken.  The position is that an independent dealer who has been dealing with farmers for a long time and possibly whose father dealt with the same farmers, both parties finding the relationship satisfactory, with the farmers buying the manure from the merchants and the merchants taking their grain as a <i>quid pro quo</i> and giving fair prices&mdash;such a dealer is no longer in a position to give satisfactory prices because behind him stands the avenging angel&mdash;the miller&mdash;sanctioned by the Minister for Agriculture, I suppose, and the Department, and no doubt applauded by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The millers are the final arbiters of any prices given for wheat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Since this discussion began, it is rather extraordinary that four Deputies on this side of the House have had to rise one after the other to speak to the motion.  In view <Col N="691" /> of the flood of representations that came unanimously from very many county committees of agriculture throughout the country, we had expected that this motion would provide the Minister for Agriculture with an opportunity to come in early in the debate and say: &ldquo;Very good.  That is a reasonable thing.  It is completely in line with representations I am getting that this levy should be refunded.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We had another fear that this matter would be held to be <i>sub judice</i> and that we would not be permitted to discuss it in view of the fact that a Fianna Fáil Deputy is engaged in court proceedings against the Minister for Agriculture in order to ensure that this levy will be returned.  No matter what happens here tonight, presumably those proceedings will continue, but apart from that, we are dealing to-night with the imposition of this levy of 5/9 which was imposed under circumstances which warrant recounting.  We opposed this levy and put down a motion because we vigorously objected to it from the first day.  We were opposed to it in principle.  We knew it was intended in the first place merely to cover up the fact that the Government wished to reduce the price of wheat, but wanted to create a situation so complex that it would be very difficult for the growers to know just how much they would be cut for their wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We then had the flash announcement in the papers that the price paid in 1958 would be the same as for the 1957 crop and then there would be deducted this levy of an unknown amount.  When the motion was discussed in the House, the amount of the levy was not known, but if we go back on the Dáil Reports we find that in practically every single line the Minister brought in the case for the levy.  His was the major contribution on the Government side and indeed there was very little interest shown by Deputies representing grain-growing areas on that side of the House, just as is the case to-night.  The Minister then said the levy was needed to save the Exchequer from the impact of meeting the cost of subsidising surplus <Col N="692" /> wheat.  There was no case made by the Minister or by anybody that there was any ground whatever for the imposition of the levy, except to meet the contingency of an exportable surplus.</P>
    <P>We made it clear then, as we do now, that whether or not there was an exportable surplus of whatever magnitude, if we had been in office, we would not have resorted to this system of applying a levy and creating An Bord Gráin setting up administrative machinery which in itself would involve quite heavy expense.  We claimed then, and we are now proved right in the event, that the board was a cover-up for the Government.  They wanted to reduce the price of wheat. They wanted to save the Exchequer. The way in which they did it was by setting up An Bord Gráin and creating an atmosphere of confusion, telling the farmers they would get the same price as in the previous year but they might impose a levy in order to meet the cost of an exportable surplus.  We also had the position that, if the levy was not sufficient, An Bord Gráin was given authority by Act of the Oireachtas to borrow to meet the cost this year.  Next year, the levy would be adjudged to make up for the deficit incurred.  We wrote that into the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Now there is no exportable surplus. There is a deficiency and, notwithstanding having written in that provision to guard ourselves against the possibility of the levy not meeting the cost of an exportable surplus, we have the extraordinary situation wherein the Government persist in extracting the levy.  The wheat grower is given a price for his wheat.  Then there is a little subtraction done and 5/9 per barrel is held back.  For what purpose?  There is no argument any more.</P>
    <P>We are not putting the Minister for Agriculture in any difficulty with the Minister for Finance.  He does not have to go to the Minister for Finance for one penny piece as a consequence of refunding this levy.  On an analysis of the figures he gave here today at Question Time he will have a saving of over £2,000,000 on the cheaper, drier, imported <Col N="693" /> wheat.  Yet he persists in maintaining the levy.  We said, when this levy was introduced, that the principle in it was bad.  We are of the same opinion still; it is a bad principle to fine a producer for producing too much.</P>
    <P>This is a strong Government.  It cannot be said that it is being twisted this way or that, as would be said if there was an inter-Party Government over there.  Surely this strong Government can make a decision.  It made no decision.  It hid behind the facade of An Bord Gráin.  This strong Government insists on maintaining that expensive set-up.  For what purpose?  Is it in order to pass on to them responsibilities which would in the normal course, if they were not there, rest fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Minister?  Are they to be the unfortunates to whom the millers will direct wheat that the millers consider unmillable?  Let them hawk it around and dispose of it.  The good imported wheat will come directly to the big mills and all the time the expenses will be mounting up.  All the time the growers will be called upon to fork out 5/9 per barrel.</P>
    <P>What encouragement is there to the farmer in this levy, the farmer who even in this year in the worst weather conditions for over 100 years grew and harvested wheat?  In the past we have heard Fianna Fáil back benchers railing against the man who exploited the wheat price, who took conacre to grow wheat having never laid an eye on the land.  It was said he was the man who brought all this trouble down upon us.  They wept for the unfortunate small farmer who harvested and husbanded his own crop, protected it from the elements and from vermin, and brought it in good condition to the mill.  To-day, we have that unfortunate small farmer called upon to contribute 5/9 per barrel on the wheat he harvested and saved under appalling weather conditions to create a fund to which all and sundry might have recourse notwithstanding the fact that the Minister has an unexpected fund by way of the saving made on imported wheat from which to draw.</P>
    <P>Are we being unreasonable?  We are <Col N="694" /> not asking the Minister to give back anything special remembering the fractional return from his outlay under the appalling circumstances of this year.  But even if we did, we would still not be unreasonable.  In the past we have had experience of the State, local authorities and the people themselves coming to the rescue to alleviate the plight of others less fortunate.  We had experience of that in the Shannon flooding.</P>
    <P>Here, we have a situation in which our grain growers were very adversely affected.  There are sections of our community&mdash;the rules of the House do not allow me to refer to them specifically&mdash;and when a crosswind blows upon them there is an immediate import levy.  Steps are taken by way of Order here within a matter of minutes to protect them from the impact of this crosswind.</P>
    <P>The people affected in this matter are those who actually elected the Fianna Fáil Party to Government. They are responsible for that Party being in Office.  The people they elected are sitting over there.  There are eight or nine Deputies who were elected to this House solely on the issue of 80/- to 82/6 per barrel for wheat, provided a Fianna Fáil Government were returned to Office.  We had the spectacle of a Fianna Fáil Deputy, a shadow Minister, coming in here admitting that he had said during the Kilkenny by-election that Fianna Fáil would give 80/- per barrel; it was good policy on the platform: &ldquo;Of course, we promised that.  We are in office now and we do not have to give 80/-.  We will put them in the situation where they will have to get out a pencil and paper and make calculations as to what they will get.&rdquo;  The wheat growers did not know the last time wheat was discussed in this House what they would get.  But they know now.  The postman will call and present them with their little <i>billetdoux</i> in black and white.  The small farmer, who never had a combine, will pay £30 or £40 by way of levy this year, and the people who supplied them with the seed are howling for their money.</P>
    <P>In that situation how can those <Col N="695" /> Deputies, who have as good, or perhaps a better, claim to represent these people than we have, sit mutely over there and allow one after another of those of us on this side of the House to get up and speak, without intervening and saying whether we are right or wrong?  They have lost interest in the people to whom they should be so grateful.  They represent these people who have been hit so hard by the imposition of this levy.</P>
    <P>From the beginning we opposed this levy.  Now, we are asking for only a fractional return of the millions coming in a result of our own bad harvest. The Government have these millions to play around with and the least the Minister should do&mdash;it should have been done weeks ago&mdash;is to allay the doubts, the fears and the unrest in the minds of the wheat producers.  He mentioned that the price next year will be the same as the price this year. Let us hope it will not be the same as the price the farmers got this year.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister persist in collecting this 5/9 per barrel although he never at any time suggested that there was any argument to be advanced in favour of the levy other than that it was needed to meet a situation in which there would be an estimated large surplus?  The Minister produced facts and figures showing the difficulties he had to meet as a result of a large carryover of wheat, as if his predecessor had not to meet them.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is not a surplus of wheat.  Yet, the Government persist, despite the fact that ordinary reason would indicate that removal of the levy is something that should be done without a day's delay.  It is something that the section of the community affected deserve because of the losses they have had to meet.  If any other section of the community suffered the reduction in income that unfortunate people are suffering in various aspects of agriculture, there would be riots in the country.  The farmers are a reasonable body of men.  At least, they are reasonable when Fianna Fáil are in office. From many quarters and from many people of different political opinions <Col N="696" /> there is a united call to the Minister. That call came long before this motion was tabled.  The farmers claim that there is no case for the imposition of this levy in the circumstances of this year and ask for a refund.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, we felt it desirable to pinpoint in the Dáil, the premier authority in the country, the case that is being made in so many agricultural circles.  We are doing so without embarrassing the Government financially.  We say to them that as time goes on and as growers realise how they were let down, despite the very good services that so many of them render in the election of this Government, and that the Government persist in exacting this levy, how will they react to future appeals for increased production?  Will not they laugh in the face of any public man, any representative of the Department, who will say to them that it is in the interests of the country, as well as in their own interests, to produce more?</P>
    <P>Production was secured to the point reached last year in wheat, bacon, milk and very many commodities only because the farmers knew in advance the prices they would get for their products.  That was the incentive that secured the level of exports we enjoy. In face of that contribution from the basic producers, this Government pig-headedly persist in exacting a levy which was originally imposed to meet a situation which is very far from the existing situation.  It cannot be suggested that there is now existing anything approaching the situation visualised by the Minister.</P>
    <P>We opposed the levy then and we oppose under any circumstances the whole principle of the levy but, in the existing circumstances, is there any man on the opposite benches who would dare condone the action of this Government in persisting in exacting the levy at a time when they are getting a windfall of over £2,000,000 by reason of the fact that they can secure cheaper and drier wheat abroad?</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, we have tabled the motion and appeal the House to pass it so as to bring home to the Minister, more forcibly than committees of agriculture have been able, that the minimum requirement <Col N="697" /> of the people who are affected is a refund of this levy and that, in fact, they expected much more and were told not a fortnight ago by people who are sitting behind the Minister that not only would they get a refund of the levy but, in addition, 7/6 a barrel. They have been let down so many times that if the Minister persists in this matter he will be doing damage which it will be very difficult for anybody succeeding him to rectify.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons I participate in this debate is that I represent a tillage county, County Louth, which engages in mixed farming and, therefore, the question of wheat is of vital interest to the farmers there.  I put my name to the motion because I recognise the plight of the Irish farmers and particularly of the Louth farmers at present.  Every effort should be made to alleviate their lot and to make it a little easier for them in the present season.</P>
      <P>In a normal year wheat production is about 450,000 tons, the value of which is about £13,000,000.  Only about half of that yield is expected this year.  There has been a 50 per cent. reduction in the yield.  That means that we have produced 250,000 tons, to the value of about £6,500,000.  That means a loss of £6,500,000 to the farmers this season.  It is a very formidable figure. It behoves all of us to do what we can to redeem the situation.  This year the acreage is up on last year's acreage by 12,000 acres.  To offset that, the yield is down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous speakers have referred to the legal position in regard to the imposition of the wheat levy.  As already said, it is very interesting to recall the original functions of An Bord Gráin as it was when set up some months ago.  Its function then was to impose a levy on the whole surplus yield of wheat, if there was an exportable surplus, but everybody must now admit that at present we find no exportable surplus.  We have been told that there have been only about 25,000 tons of millable wheat accepted by the millers this year for conversion into flour.  Therefore, it would seem that the Minister has gone beyond his <Col N="698" /> powers in directing An Bord Gráin to deduct this levy.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the recent action of the wheat growers in East Cork.  It would appear that they are endeavouring, as best they can, to prove their case that the levy cannot be legally imposed.  That question, of course, is <i>sub judice</i> and we cannot enlarge on that point.  I believe that it was Deputy Corry who asked the Minister last week under what Act, and by what authority, did he get his powers to impose this levy.  The Minister replied that he got his powers under Wheat Order No. so and so, which set up An Bord Gráin, to deduct the 5/9 per barrel on exportable surplus wheat. The Minister enlarged on his answer by saying he was confident he was in the right, that he had very good legal advice and was prepared to abide by that advice.  I should have imagined that if the Minister needed powers to deduct the levy, in present circumstances, he would have to come to this House to get such authority.  He had to come here originally to secure endorsement of the Bill setting up An Bord Gráin.  I feel that the Minister must abide by the terms of that Act, and that board should not have power to deduct this levy, when, in fact, there is no exportable surplus.</P>
    <P>It is very significant to observe the attitude adopted by the National Farmers' Association in this matter. When An Bord Gráin was set up, they had perforce to agree with the Minister's action in that regard.  They said, in effect, that it was more or less the best of a bad bargain.  They criticised the method of election of the board members, but they were prepared to carry on as best they could.  However, they made it clear that they were by no means in favour of the levy being deducted this season.  Their attitude has been made evident in a resolution which was passed some time ago at a meeting of the national council of that very important body.  At that meeting, they condemned the action of the Government in the misapplication of the wheat levy which, in accordance with the wheat Order, should have been deducted solely for the purpose of disposing of millable wheat in excess <Col N="699" /> of 300,000 tons.  Again, they said all the farmers who have had wheat accepted as millable are adamant that the levy should not have been deducted when the quantity of millable wheat fell short of 300,000 tons.</P>
    <P>Those views show conclusively that there is much discontent amongst the farming community, and this motion has been put down in an effort to persuade the Minister&mdash;if he can be persuaded&mdash;to do the right thing in this matter.  I have not read or heard of any reaction on the part of the Taoiseach, the Minister, or the Government as a whole, to the attitude of the National Farmers' Association with regard to this wheat levy.  It was stated by a previous speaker that a deputation from the National Farmers' Association met both the Taoiseach and the Minister and discussed this question.  Beyond the Taoiseach assuring the deputation that he would give their views his most sympathetic consideration, we have heard nothing, and we await with interest some definite announcement.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of this matter which we could discuss all night. We could refer to the hardships suffered by the farmers as a result of the very bad weather which they experienced this year, but we would be going outside the ambit of this motion, if we were to mention such points. Therefore, I shall do my best to restrict myself to the terms of the motion.  The motion, in its first phrase, reads: &ldquo;In the absence of alternative proposals,&rdquo; and I am sure the Fine Gael Party would be agreeable if it saw any hope emanating from the Minister in the form of alternative proposals.  They do not see any such hope from that source and they ask, therefore, that the levy be removed and not deducted this year.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, the farmers in my constituency have suffered grievously this season, not only with regard to the deduction of the levy, but also in regard to the very small prices which they received for wheat before the floor price of 57/9 was announced on 7th September. Those farmers in Louth who harvested <Col N="700" /> their wheat early in September had to sell it at prices, in some cases, bordering on 40/- a barrel and they have not been recompensed to the same degree as other farmers have.  It is a fact that in the Ardee area, in particular, 12,000 barrels of wheat were sold at prices from 38/- to 48/- per barrel and I should like to know from the Minister if there is any likelihood, or possibility, of these unfortunate farmers being recompensed in some way.</P>
    <P>This question was discussed at the recent meeting of Louth Committee of Agriculture, and it was stated that no records were kept by the respective buyers of this wheat.  It is very hard to accept that explanation, or that excuse. It would be a poor businessman, or poor seller, who did not keep some kind of record of prices.  Some time ago&mdash;I believe it was during the recent debate on the motion of no confidence &mdash;the Minister said that his scheme in relation to the floor price of 57/9 would be made retrospective for the stocks of wheat which were held in the mills.  I would ask him to go a little further and try to do all he can to help the people to whom I have referred. The local N.F.A. are trying to do all they can to help these cases, and it would be helpful if the Minister could hold out some hope for them.</P>
    <P>We have only to read the daily Press to realise the furore which is being created throughout the country at the present time.  There is a reaction throughout each county, throughout the various committees of agriculture, throughout the local branches of the N.F.A. and other agricultural bodies, a reaction which augurs very badly for the agricultural industry during the coming season.  Various epithets and descriptions have been applied to the position.  It has been stated that the tillage farmers of Ireland are being thrown to the wolves, that the millers are dictating policy and that wheat is fetching a lower price than blackberries.</P>
    <P>All these expressions of opinion are proof of an evident fact that there is much discontent throughout the country as a whole.  It is the duty of the Minister to do what he can to ease the position.  One alternative proposal which I think would meet with <Col N="701" /> universal approval would be for the Minister to announce some scheme of loans in respect of the coming season whereby farmers would be in a position to pay their merchants the bills they incurred in respect of fertilisers, and so on.</P>
    <P>Now that the price of wheat has been announced for the coming season&mdash;it seems it is to be the same arrangement as obtained during the present season&mdash;I would ask the Minister to make an announcement with regard to the type of wheat the millers will accept.  I have in mind now one kind of wheat.  This present season, most of the winter wheat was rejected by the mills.  I do not know, if it was because of the variety of the wheat&mdash; it was mostly Capalle&mdash;that such action was taken by the mills.  In my own county, practically all the winter wheat of the Capalle variety was rejected by the mills.  Louth farmers are now very anxious to know whether that set of circumstances will recur next year.  They have their land ready for sowing.  The land has been ploughed on many farms.  They want to know the best sort of wheat to sow this year so that they will not be caught napping next year when they come to sell their wheat to the mills.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  I did not think the Chair would allow me to go as far as I have gone.  I should like again to emphasise that we here are of the opinion that the Minister has no legal right to deduct this levy.  An Bord Gráin was set up specifically to deduct a levy if there was an exportable surplus of millable wheat.</P>
      <P>Last week, the Minister referred to the effect of the climatic conditions which were so terrible this past season. We do not blame the Minister for that. It was an act of God.  We cannot control that.  However, the Minister can control the matter of the levy.  In this year, above all years, the Minister should be munificent.  He should extend a generous gesture of goodwill and genuine help to the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> Deputy Corry's name seems to be cropping up in this House, but we must refer to him because it was he who asked the question as to why the levy was deducted.  I forget the Minister's reply, but he did not give the reason why the levy was being deducted at the present time.  Now that we are about to have a wonderful plan from the Government involving the spending of over £200,000,000, surely the Government cannot give as an excuse for not deducting this levy that they would have no money.  They are talking not in millions but in hundreds of millions, and surely the farmers could get a little piece of that huge sum.</P>
    <P>We must remember that this year there will be a grave shortage of fodder.  There will be a grave shortage of hay as a result of the bad weather.  In turn, that will mean that many farmers will have to sell their cattle.  They cannot hold them if they cannot feed them.  They will have to sell their cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. First of all, I want to draw attention to the awful weather we had this year and which had a certain effect on wheat. It was said in the beginning that, in respect of the first 300,000 tons of wheat put into the mills, the farmers would get back 5/9.  Every farmer was considerably surprised at this thing.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about ranching wheat, and so on.  Early on in this campaign, it was stated in the papers that the millers would pay so much and that the farmers would do their best to have the wheat in good condition, would try to cut it with binders where it was not suitable for the combine, and so on.  Large numbers of farmers suffered terrible hardship. People in the cities do not realise how the farmers suffer.  Just think of a binder and an ordinary tractor going through the land.  Then you would need two or three tractors to pull it around.  The hardship was cruel and the wheat was not fully developed.</P>
      <P>Farmers who went to all that trouble to get their wheat into stacks and to have it threshed in a good condition were cut not only 5/9 but were cut up to 7/- a barrel for screenings.  I have three cases of wheat that went through that state.  The moisture content was 20.4.  Can anybody say that that is bad wheat?  The screening was 10 per cent. It was bushelled at 57.  That farmer should get 71/6 and, with 5/9 taken off, 65/9.  However, the miller came and cut 3/- off it for screenings.  What is meant by &ldquo;screenings&rdquo;?  It is small wheat which is sound.  The stuff they are selling back to farmers at £24 a ton is good sound wheat and therefore they are robbing the farmer of that 3/-.  It is clear daylight robbery where that sound wheat is concerned to cut the farmer by 3/- a barrel for small wheat which can be used for animal feeding and which is sold back to the farmer for £24 a ton.</P>

      <P>I have had a lot of cases brought to my notice of 22 per cent. moisture and so much was deducted for screenings.  That means that 7/- a barrel was cut in respect of small wheat and that deduction of 7/- a barrel was daylight robbery from the farmers. Small wheat is small wheat.  It happened because of the weather.  Small sound wheat is perfectly good for feeding to animals.  It used to be sought for feeding fowl.  The mills are committing daylight robbery.  My point is that a small farmer with 67 barrels of wheat is cut 7/- a barrel for wheat of 22 per cent. moisture.  The 5/9 is bad enough.  The Government are in justice bound to give that 5/9 back to the farmers.  The farmers were quite willing and happy to stay with the 5/9 because they would have a bigger and better yield and have a better return. The farmers were cut for screenings. That is sheer daylight robbery.  The whole thing is a racket.</P>

      <P>It is notable that in this debate which has been in progress for some considerable time already and in which a number of Deputies have participated sitting silent in this House is, first of all, the Minister for Agriculture who is quite obviously afraid to speak in this debate.  Behind him are the silent cherubs of his own Party who were very vocal about wheat during the last election but who are sitting here mute of malice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is noteworthy that in this House now, behind the silent Minister for Agriculture, there does not appear to be even in the Fianna Fáil ranks sufficient interest amongst Deputies representing wheat constituencies to induce them to come into the House.  Where are the Deputies from Carlow-Kilkenny? Where are the Deputies <Col N="705" /> from Laois-Offaly?  Where are the Deputies from East Cork?  Half of them only are here.  Deputy Moher is the only brave man in Fianna Fáil, but, unfortunately, he is not vocal.</P>
    <P>We in the Fine Gael Party put down this motion as a reasonable proposal, expecting that it would be met by the Minister in a reasonable manner and that it could be discussed on its merits.  As Deputies have pointed out, this Party opposed the Minister's proposal to impose a levy on wheat. We were interested to note that when the Minister announced the intention to impose a levy on wheat, he himself said that he did not quite agree with it.</P>
    <P>In any event, we opposed it.  We opposed it, first of all, because we regarded it as a tax upon production and as an agricultural country concerned to build up our resources and to increase our production, we felt that any step taken by a Government which would clamp down on production was wrong, unwise and not in the national interest.  In any event, our opposition to this levy, when it was announced first, was because it represented a tax on production.  The Minister rather shyly and shamefacedly met our opposition by saying: &ldquo;Look; the position is this: The necessary tonnage of wheat in this country is 300,000 tons.&rdquo;  Leaving aside any argument as to whether we could or should produce all our own requirements of wheat, he took as the target figure 300,000 tons.  Deputies will remember that the figure of 300,000 tons represented the Fianna Fáil target when last there was a Fianna Fáil Government in office.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, before the harvest that the position might arise that from the land of Ireland we might produce more than 300,000 tons of native wheat.  He said that if we did, there would be a domestic surplus problem to deal with.  &ldquo;Accordingly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the object of this levy is to deal with that kind of situation.&rdquo;  I want no Deputy, no Fianna Fáil Deputy particularly, because it is extraordinary how easily Fianna Fáil Deputies get the wrong end of the stick, to be under any misapprehension <Col N="706" /> before they vote on this motion to-night as to what it involves.</P>
    <P>Last July, the silent Minister for Agriculture had a tongue and he used it in this House.  Speaking on 15th July, as reported in the Official Debates of that date, the Minister explained the reason for this levy.  He said, speaking on the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Bill which apparently gives him the authority to impose the levy:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;According to the scheme in this Bill, the producers will be called upon to pay a levy to meet the cost of the disposal of any wheat produced in excess of 300,000 tons of dried wheat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There, in the Minister's own words, is the reason he gave, on behalf of the Government of which he is a member, for asking the Dáil to empower him to impose a levy on wheat.  The reason he gave deals with an excess on 300,000 tons of dried wheat.  There can be no two ways about it.  This levy was imposed to deal with a situation involving a surplus.  What is the present situation?  It appears now, on the information available to the Dáil and to the country, that this year the total production of wheat will be something around 200,000 tons.  Of that, the millable intake of wheat is scarcely 20,000 tons.</P>
    <P>I want Deputies to realise what is involved.  This year, respecting all wheat, there are only 200,000 tons produced&mdash;100,000 less than our target figure&mdash;and out of that total production to date, in the middle of November, scarcely 20,000 tons of millable wheat have been taken into the mills.  That means that, as far as the wheat farmers are concerned, this years adds up to a national catastrophe. This year has seen almost a total loss of the wheat crop.  It is in those circumstances that we in the Fine Gael Party, who had to meet onslaughts from the Government Party in the last two years on wheat, come into this House fairly and reasonably and say to the Minister for Agriculture&mdash; and we will get him to speak yet&mdash;that three months ago he said he would impose the levy in order to deal with the surplus.  There is no surplus; there <Col N="707" /> is no wheat; there is a loss on the part of every tillage farmer in the country; and, therefore, we say to him that he should not seek to tax those who have lost so much.  That is not unreasonable. It is meeting the Minister's own proposal produced here last July on his own terms: a levy to deal with a surplus.  No surplus; therefore, no levy.</P>
    <P>It might be that, if the Minister finds his tongue and his courage and gets up on his feet, some kind of case could be made that the national Exchequer could not afford to give back to the battered farmers this year the amount of the levy.  I do not believe that case can be made.  The levy on 200,000 tons of wheat amounts to roughly £500,000. This year, in order to meet our national flour requirements, millers will import 250,000 tons of foreign wheat under the authority, and with the approval, of the Minister.  They will import that at £27 a ton.  As a result, the Exchequer will be saved the difference between the imported price and the Irish price of £38.  In other words, this year, the Minister's colleague in the Government will make £11 per ton on every ton of imported wheat.  Could there ever be a more amazing situation?  The State makes money this year out of the catastrophe that has befallen the tillage farmers of the land.  Because there has been a total loss of the wheat crop, the Minister for Agriculture imports wheat to the extent of 250,000 tons, and on every ton he imports the State makes £11.</P>
    <P>There is a loss on the part of An Bord Gráin in disposing of unmillable wheat this year, amounting to 150,000 tons, of about £9 per ton.  As I make out the figures, even assuming that the levy is given back to the farmers and taking into consideration the loss in the disposal of unmillable wheat, there will be a net gain to the Government this year of £900,000.  Retaining the levy, this year the Government makes out of the bad harvest £1,500,000. There it is.  Those are the figures; those are the facts.  I hope they will be clearly understood by all the Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party who 18 months ago wept crocodile tears for <Col N="708" /> the wheat farmers of this land.  This year, because there was a bad harvest, for which the Minister for Agriculture was not responsible, the Minister and his colleagues, representing the State, make £1,500,000.</P>
    <P>All we say to them is to have regard to the wet and flooded lands of the tillage farmers, the unfortunate men who this year find that what they produce from their storm-battered fields scarcely pays the costs of the seed and the labour of the spring.  All we say to the Government is: share the profit you have made this year. Do not retain the £1,500,000; give back 500,000 as some sort of <i>solatium</i> to those who lost so much this year. I think that is a reasonable proposal. It is put forward in a reasonable manner.  If this were a House in which Deputies on the Government side were permitted to act, vote and speak according to their consciences, I am quite certain that one of the first people to support this motion would be Deputy Moher of East Cork, and I am quite certain that the absent Deputy Corry would ably assist Deputy Moher and would make sure that Deputy Moher did not get too much publicity in the local papers in East Cork.</P>
    <P>I want Deputies to imagine what kind of debate would be taking place here if the Government had not changed 18 months ago, if sitting over there in the place of the silent Minister was Deputy Dillon and if over here behind me were the cohorts of Corrys Mohers, Medlars and all the rest of them.  What would be said by Fianna Fáil on such a subject as this?  We would have the drip of the rain in every farmer's field counted out amidst the tears of Deputy Moher and Deputy Corry.  An assault would be made on Deputy Dillon if he were Minister for Agriculture seeking to tax the unfortunate impoverished farmers in such circumstances and, forsooth, making money out of their trouble.  But that is not the situation.  The friends of the farmers, moryah, the supporters of the tillage farmers 18 months ago, are now in office.  Deputy Corry got a pain in his stomach and he has gone home, all these other wheat Deputies of Fianna Fáil have fled the House <Col N="709" /> and the Minister for Agriculture has not a word to say.</P>
    <P>I hope the people outside will duly note not only what is said in this House but also what is not said and who has not spoken.  I hope they will realise that here in this motion a reasonable proposition has been put forward, one that commends itself to the sense of fairplay of any reasonably-minded Deputy, and that they will realise the manner in which they have been codded by those who talked so much on their behalf a short while ago.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether what I have said will have urged the Minister to climb to his feet.  I do not know whether the Minister may now feel that, as Minister for Agriculture, he has at least a duty to give the views of the Government on this important motion.  Last September, when the farmers were in real trouble, the Minister was hard to find.  I want to warn him that if he does not talk to-night, he will certainly walk with the rest of his colleagues who vote against the farmers.</P>

      <P>While I come from a county where wheat growing has been destroyed by speculators and opportunists of all types, I strongly support this motion, because I believe it is a very reasonable motion and one which should have the support of farmers on all sides of the House.  Wheat growing is a national necessity.  It is something we are all proud of and we hope that in the future we will have balanced wheat growing, as we had in the past.  Before we ever formed an Irish Government, our farmers grew wheat and grew it well, but in the long years of wheat growing, this has been the most disastrous year farmers ever had, their losses being enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not put my name to this motion for political reasons; I put my name to it as a wheat grower and a farmer, and on behalf of the farmers I represent.  I would ask the Minister to make a reasonable statement on this matter before the discussion concludes. I know the Minister has a duty to be loyal to his Government, but I want <Col N="710" /> him to pull his weight because I believe there is a good case for refunding the 5/9 levy to the farmers.  That levy would have been all right if we had a surplus.  The National Farmer's Association themselves agreed to it as a way out.  It is very difficult to have the happy medium in regard to price.  If you have too big a price for wheat, the growing of barley and oats goes down and there will be too much wheat.  It is only right to have a reasonable price for wheat and barley, thus achieving a balanced economy.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see this motion debated politically as it is being debated at the moment, with one side of the House having all the say while the other side is silent.  Democracy is hypocrisy if Deputies from both sides of the House who represent farmers cannot speak on behalf of the farmers in a national crisis.  We should be allowed to speak out and get away from a lot of the tomfoolery which has been going on here for a number of years.</P>
    <P>It is not the Government's fault or that of their back-benchers that the farmer's had a disastrous year.  The hand of God was responsible for giving us the worst weather we have had for decades.  Our losses are not in thousands, but in millions, and it will take the farmers many years to recover from it.  In those circumstances, it is the duty of the Government to refund the 5/9 levy.  It is a small thing and the Government can reasonably well afford it.  We should be knocking at an open door and the Minister should be receiving this motion with open arms.</P>
    <P>It is time wheat growing was put on a proper basis.  It is bad for the economy that it should be bedevilled by Party politics.  There is not a farmer Deputy here who has reasonably good land who will not grow wheat, whether it is Deputy Dillon or the present Minister who makes the price.  If it pays us, we will grow it.  At the same time, I do not want to see a big price for wheat.  I come from a county which perhaps has the best land in Ireland, land which has been destroyed by bad tillage.  Speculators have come from goodness knows where, some of whom <Col N="711" /> never owned an acre in their lives, who were taking up to 1,500 acres of conacre by telephone and who never saw or never will see some of this land.  At the same time, there were other good farmers in that county who grew wheat and saved it in a fairly good manner this year.  The price they got was the same as the speculators got.  It made no difference whether the wheat was wet or dry.  The speculators got as much as they could into the mills, whether by fair or foul means.  The Minister has a heavy task in front of him to put that situation right.  We do not want speculators or racketeers to destroy the livelihood of the honest farmer.</P>

      <P>The Minister has a difficult task running agriculture.  If the farmers would co-operate as they should, the Minister would have an easy task, but we are a set of individuals who cannot be educated to co-operation.  If the farmers would co-operate, there would be no need for motions or anything like that.  I would ask the Minister to make a reasonable statement on the position and to do justice to the farmer.  I believe that if he gives this 5/9 back, the farmer will be well pleased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> The farmer wants nothing back for the damage the Lord Himself caused; he will accept that as he always did and always will; but where the Government put a levy on him for surplus wheat and there is no surplus, the farmer has a case for the return of that levy.  I do not want to see farmers going to court, or Deputy Corry leading them there.  That is not the thing to happen while this House is here.</P>
    <P>There is an open case for this repayment and I ask the Minister to accept the motion.  It is a reasonable and honest one.  It might look to him like a political one, coming from this side of the House.  I did not sign it as a political motion.  I always speak with my own mind, although I am always loyal to my own Party.  I state things as I see them down the country and I understand the farmers.  I speak for the Fianna Fáil farmers as well as for the Fine Gael farmers and I never give two hoots about that.  I speak fairly and squarely.  I would like to see, on this type of motion, all the farmers of this House coming to a meeting beforehand and seeing how we could have a happy medium and be able to put before the Minister our case from all sides of the House. Then the farmers would get what the industrialists here in Dublin get. When there is anything coming up about industry in this House, we find that the Deputies who represent industry are united on both sides of the House.  When it comes to a farmers' motion, however, we fight like tigers. Why should that be?  Agriculture is the most important industry in the country.  Why should we be so divided?</P>
    <P>There is really very little dividing us. We all believe in wheat growing; we all believe that the best Minister for Agriculture for wheat growing was Deputy Dillon, the former Minister. He was bedevilled by politicians and they hounded him down for the purpose of gaining votes.  That is the wrong method.  I could try to hound down the present Minister and say terrible things to him, but I will not do it.  He is a man of the people, coming from the people; he was elected as Minister and is entitled to be Minister. <Col N="713" /> I hope that when there is a change of Government, we will get away from all the nonsense.  The farmers are sick and tired of it&mdash;and sick and tired of us as well.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to do the right thing, to give the farmers back the 5/9 to which they are entitled and in the coming year to try to step in and give clean wheat growing, honest wheat growing, national wheat growing and make some effort to cut the the speculator who takes conacre.  I do not mind men setting land for part of the year, if they are down and out.  I do not mind how much wheat a farmer grows on his own land, so long as it is his own land; but I do not want to have speculators taking conacre and destroying it, leaving nothing but dirt, thistles, weeds and scutch, instead of leaving it the way they found it.  There will be a lot of talk in two or three years' time, if the best land is allowed to become destroyed.  If that goes on for years and a national crisis or a third European war arises, we would not get even two barrels an acre, if the people are able to grow wheat at all. That is an important thing the Minister should consider and I ask him to consider it.  He can see across the border into my county and see what happens and will happen, if he does not interfere. He should give the farmer back the 5/9 to which he is lawfully entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>Were it not for the fact that we had a surplus of wheat in 1956 and a greater surplus in 1957, we would have had no wheat levy imposed this year.  Therefore, we are perfectly right in assuming that the sole reason for the wheat levy was to enable a fund to be built up that would help the surplus wheat to be exported.  There is no surplus wheat this year.  We were amazed to learn to-day from the Minister that only 20,000 tons of Irish wheat of this year's harvest were accepted and paid for by the millers for conversion into flour.  Therefore, the volume of opinion of all farmers, of all shades of political thought, is that there is no justification for the retention of the levy this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The return of the levy does not compensate <Col N="714" /> the farmers in any sense, but at least it would be a gesture of goodwill by the Minister and the Government, an indication that they appreciate the farmers' efforts and have sympathy with them in their losses on the recent harvest.  Nobody but those who participated in the harvest activities or were associated with them can conceive the agony that the farmers suffered, physically and mentally, in the recent ten long tortuous weeks. It is a great tribute to the farmers that they were able to salvage so much of the harvest and the extraordinary thing is that there was very little sympathy with them.</P>
    <P>The farmers were not the only people concerned.  The millers were there; the hauliers were there; the agents were there; the sack lenders were there. They all had their profits guaranteed, but there was no such guarantee for the farmer, who suffered the entire loss and the main brunt of the adverse weather conditions.  It is most extraordinary that, compared with other years, the hiring charge for sacks this year was rather savage.  There was 5d. per sack for one day up to a week, and if the sacks were returned in wet condition there was a fine also.  The farmers had no facilities this year, or in any other year&mdash;but this year, particularly&mdash;to return sacks in a dry condition.</P>
    <P>Then we have this extraordinary farce associated with wheat, that we pay agents for every barrel of wheat delivered to the millers.  I know that custom grew up in the early years, when the millers, in order to ensure they would get some volume of native wheat into their mills, paid agents for that purpose.  Some of those agents have no land whatever.  If there is any payment to be made for agents, I think the agents should be the farmers themselves; and let whatever little things go to the agents go directly to the farmers.  Whenever there is a loss, it should be shared equitably and generally amongst all those associated with that activity.  It is inconceivable, therefore, that the farmers this year should have to bear all the loss themselves, and that there should be so little sympathy for them.  That is the least one <Col N="715" /> should expect, if wheat growing is not to be killed.</P>
    <P>This is not a political matter any longer.  We have to admit, of course, that there was a good deal of politics associated with wheat in the past.  The Party opposite were the great protagonists of wheat&mdash;I give them all the credit they can take for that&mdash;but I hope they are not the people now who are going to kill this national industry, which means so much to production in this country.  There is no doubt that our national production will be down considerably this year and that our national income will be down as a consequence. We all regret that, but nobody is to blame, as responsibility for the weather conditions cannot be placed at anybody's door.  We all know from our experience&mdash;and the figures actually corroborate it&mdash;that this was the worst harvest within living memory.  Right through the year, from May onwards, there was difficulty in saving the hay, which was a prolific crop and very promising.  Quite a big percentage remained uncut.  If one travels between Dublin and Cork by train, one sees to this day fields of hay still left uncut, left to rot, because of the impossibility of drawing it in.  With regard to root crops, mangolds were the smallest I ever saw; and potatoes were a failure in many areas and not as big as marbles in some places.</P>
    <P>All this loss, combined with the loss on wheat growing and combined with the levy now being retained on wheat makes it all the more nauseating and disgusting for the farmers.  They have got very little sympathy from the Government and we are asking now that the levy imposed on them should be repaid to them.</P>
    <P>There was one year in my experience &mdash;I think it was 1954&mdash;when the conditions which obtained were comparable with those of this year. As a matter of fact on 16th December, 1954, I saw from the train, in County Kildare, three fields of wheat standing uncut in mid-December&mdash;seemingly good crops&mdash;and I was told afterwards that that wheat was cut on St. Stephen's Day.  I doubt if there is any wheat uncut at this moment in <Col N="716" /> the country, but there was more sprouted wheat in 1954 and the then Minister insisted that all that sprouted wheat be bought, and it was bought.</P>
    <P>This year the Minister for one reason or another did not seem to be in a position to deal with the millers. They could have been compelled to help the farmers and take more wheat than 20,000 tons.  It is extraordinary to find that only 20,000 tons out of 200,000 tons is fit for milling and the remainder unfit for milling.  Where did the 20,000 tons come from?  In what parts of the Twenty-Six Counties was that wheat grown and in what condition was it harvested?</P>
    <P>I have met farmers who had one lorry load of wheat accepted for milling and another lorry load, harvested on the same day, from the very same field and from the very same farm was said to be unfit for milling.  Nobody can understand that. I am sure Deputies opposite are familiar with such circumstances.  I shall not quote documents or quote names but I can show the Minister for his own information that people were paid as low as 32/9 per barrel.  If the levy were returnable to these people they would at least get something more commensurate with their efforts.  The sum of 32/9 would not compensate any grower for his work, for the seed, fertiliser and lime put into the production of a crop of this kind.</P>
    <P>The great difference between the present Minister for Agriculture and his predecessor in 1954, Deputy James Dillon, is that Deputy Dillon did meet the millers.  He met them regularly and he held a commanding hand over them and let them see that they had a duty to the public just as the farmers had, a duty to share equitably in the losses and face the position as it then was and help towards a solution of the difficulties.  I agree that we have had many debates on wheat growing and we shall continue to have them until more realism is displayed towards this whole question.  In all earnestness I suggest to the Minister that he should have a committee of the whole House, composed of farmers and others interested <Col N="717" /> in wheat growing.  That committee would be there to advise him in a realistic way and we would not have these recurring difficulties year after year.  It would no longer be a question of politics.</P>
    <P>I remember a debate in 1954, which is the year most comparable with this year.  A case was made then when the price of wheat was drastically reduced because of the peculiar circumstances, but nobody in this House believed it, or if they did they pretended that the situation did not exist.  If you go back on the arguments used then from this side of the House you will find how unrealistic they were in the light of events since then.  I hope that this matter will be dissociated entirely from politics. The motion is a reasonable one and is not making any undue demand in view of the fact that the Government will be making a profit on wheat imported this year.</P>
    <P>If this levy is not returned no one will be more disappointed than the farmers who supported the Government. They will have the greatest reason for being disappointed because they expected an increase in the price of wheat for next year's crop which they did not get.  That is bad enough but it is worse when after their efforts of last year a levy was imposed on them, a levy which will not be returnable even when the whole motive for it has disappeared because we have no surplus of millable wheat for export.</P>

      <P>There can be no defence to the case made when we quote the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture when the Agriculture Produce (Cereals) Act, 1958 was being discussed here.  I quote from column 545. Volume 170.  He said quite definitely:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;According to the scheme in this Bill, the producers will be called upon to pay a levy to meet the cost of the disposal of any wheat produced in excess of 300,000 tons of dried wheat.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We find that the total crop of wheat this year is not likely to be more than 200,000 tons and a levy of 5/9 a barrel has been applied to every grain of that wheat, amounting to approximately half a million pounds.  We are requesting the Government, in view of the statement of the Minister for Agriculture, to return every penny of that because in fact the quantity of wheat taken from the land did not exceed 300,000 tons.</P>
      <P>I should like to know what is the reason for all this silence.  I see that Deputy Moher has left the House now. He was vocal on many occasions when the question of wheat policy and wheat prices was under discussion.  It was a live issue before the last general election when they gave the farmers reason to believe that they would get 85/- a barrel maximum if they were returned to office, 82/6 plus 2/6 bonus.  Instead of that, when the question was put to them regarding arrangements for the price of wheat in the spring of 1957, it was stated that they proposed to leave the price as it was until the following harvest when an announcement would be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, the Government avoided <Col N="719" /> making any announcement in relation to the price of wheat until the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Bill of 1958 came to the notice of the Deputies. After the last general election several extra Fianna Fáil Deputies came in here from wheat growing areas.  They were elected because it was understood that 85/- a barrel would be paid to farmers for their wheat.  I name in particular the Counties Louth, Meath, Kildare, Wexford, Waterford, Tipperary, Carlow, Kilkenny, Leix and Offaly.  Possibly I have omitted other places where wheat was made a political plaything from every Fianna Fáil platform.</P>
    <P>However, the Fianna Fáil Deputies are here now and they are mute of malice.  They are not raising their voices against or in favour of the proposal before the House.  They are showing they are taking no interest in what is evidently a rotten swindle on the wheat-growers. It is there in black and white that this money should not be deducted from deliveries of wheat, unless the surplus exceeded 300,000 tons.  Why does the Fianna Fáil Party, in the privilege and shelter of the House, not express its views?  Let us hear them here, if they are not prepared to face the farmers outside on this issue.</P>
    <P>We know the Minister went into hiding early in September when the wheat policy became a live issue.  At that time, I advocated that the Grain Board should be abolished because I realised the difficulties confronting the farmers and that they would suffer losses and hardships.  That has been the case, but when the National Farmers' Association and other representatives of farmers wished to make representations to the Minister for Agriculture, he could not be found, even though they came several times.</P>
    <P>The representatives of the National Farmers' Association were, to a large extent, ignored when they made representations to have this 5/9 per barrel refunded.  Altogether it amounts to £500,000 and it was taken from the farmers on a certain understanding.  It is being withheld from them now, even though that understanding in regard to surplus has been broken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> The Minister for Agriculture, we all know, was one of those determined to cut down wheat growing because, in 1947, he announced, in connection with the Marshall Aid proposals, a programme whereby he intended to reduce the acreage of wheat to 240,000.  If we study these figures, it will be seen that even then he had planned to bring the wheat output down to approximately 300,000 tons, if we agree that is the yeild from 240,000 acres.  I am sure that helps to explain why the Minister showed a reluctance to be helpful to the wheat growers in any way or to their representatives in this very difficult harvest.  We now have a position in which not alone has £500,000 been taken from the farmers, but they are left with no guaranteed market or guaranteed price and with only a price scale on which they may expect to receive payment for their wheat crop. It is obvious that the millers are dictating policy in regard to wheat growing.</P>
    <P>It was very interesting to see in the newspapers the other day&mdash;especially when we realise how Fianna Fáil made a plaything of wheat growing in the past a heading&mdash;not &ldquo;Grow more wheat&rdquo; from the Minister for Agriculture, but &ldquo;Grow more trees&rdquo; from the Minister for Lands.  So that is to be the slogan now, in an effort to make the farmers forget about the &ldquo;Grow more wheat&rdquo; slogan which in the past was pasted on every wall and hoarding and shouted from every platform by the Fianna Fáil Party.  They made it a plank in their platform, but they appear to have decided to discard that plank now and not only that, but to operate a barefaced swindle in regard to deducting from the prices paid to the farmers.</P>
    <P>This year, the farmers have produced only 25,000 tons of millable wheat out of a total of 300,000 tons required by the nation, but even though that amount only was produced, the 5/9 was deducted on every cwt. of that wheat in addition to every cwt. of the unmillable wheat.  If we examine the Minister's statement of last July, we see that his offer related to wheat produced in excess of 300,000 tons of dried wheat.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> There are many difficulties confronting farmers who have plenty of use for this £500,000.  In County Dublin alone, farmers who grew wheat will be required to pay approximately £100,000 in rates.  The wheat crop was a loss, in addition to other crops, but on top of that there is this deduction of 5/9 per barrel.  The figures show that in the past 12 months wheat-growers purchased combines to the value of £500,000&mdash;just over 500 combines in all.  Various other additional harvesting machinery and equipment was purchased to the value of a further £500,000, making a total of £1,000,000 and here we have the wheat policy thrown overboard&mdash;no market, no guarantee and only a price scale.  That is the prospect for farmers at present.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker quite rightly stated that the best Minister for Agriculture that wheat growers had was Deputy Dillon, because he faced the wheat problem realistically.  He met the millers and the growers and decided his policy.  He did not set up a board to which he could delegate responsibility; he took responsibility for the policy he implemented.  The farmers, and particularly the wheat growers, can see now it was more satisfactory that way.</P>

      <P>The Grain Board has been instructed by the Minister to deduct 5/9 per barrel on the wheat delivered by the growers.  We now have combines and other machinery lying in backyards, fields and bogs and a wheat policy under which there is no guarantee that the growers will be able to sell wheat next year, even with the 5/9 deduction.  We realise the millers are given the option now of refusing to accept wheat.  Up to now, wheat could be brought to a miller and he had to take it and give a price in <Col N="722" /> accordance with its quality.  Under the new arrangement, even if a grower brings in first quality wheat, bushelling 64 or 65&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <P>I wanted to mention&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to mention the fact that the 5/9 deduction for first quality wheat delivered at the mills will hardly be applied if we have a situation where the millers will turn away first quality wheat when it is brought to their premises.  Deputy Dillon, when Minister for Agriculture, guaranteed a price of 78/6 per barrel for unlimited quantities of wheat.  The position in future will be that, if there is a loss, the growers will be obliged to bear their own losses by paying this 5/9 per barrel into a fund; this fund will pay for the operations and activities of the Grain Board.  The remainder will be spread over the total quantity of wheat delivered.  That will have the effect of reducing the price still further.</P>
      <P>The Minister has returned to the House once more.  I hope that when I have finished he will find his tongue and let us hear what he has to say in relation to this swindle; £500,000 has been taken from the farmers and the Minister will take no steps to refund it to them.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of farm hands are being disemployed because the farmers are short of money.  This £500,000 would help them in some respect at least. Hundreds of farm labourers will be faced with the prospect of unemployment at Christmas because the farmers will not be able to keep them on.  No effort is being made by the Minister to compensate for the losses the wheat growers have suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister shows complete contempt for wheat growers.  It is well known that he has not been very polite to the farmers' representatives who <Col N="723" /> went to him in an effort to find some kind of solution for a very difficult problem.  Indeed, the Minister should never have allowed this matter to be brought up here.  He should have taken his decision the day the motion was tabled.  It is clear that wheat growers have a legal right to the return of this 5/9.  Some of the farmers intend to take court action to test the legality of the stoppage of this 5/9 per barrel.  If the matter goes to court, I have a shrewd suspicion the decision will be in favour of the farmers.  In ordinary equity and justice, the Minister should refund this money immediately, even if he is not prepared to agree that it is legally due.</P>
    <P>We have been waiting to hear from the Minister to-night.  We have been waiting to hear from some Fianna Fáil Deputies.  They have all remained mute of malice.  Some of those who represent wheat-growing areas have left the House.  There are a few Deputies here from these areas, however, and I would appeal to them to tell the House why they consider it right for the Minister to hold back the £500,000 from the wheat-growers?</P>
    <P>We had the folly of the Fianna Fáil Government some few short months ago selling the best of millable Irish wheat at £20 per ton to Great Britain. Great Britain was not slow to realise it was good value at that price.  In July and August of this year 25,000 tons worth £500,000 were exported to Great Britain.  I do not know how much the Irish taxpayer had to pay for that.  I think the Irish taxpayer paid £26 per ton and it was exported at £20 per ton to Great Britain.  We would be glad to have that wheat now.</P>
    <P>Other countries build up surplus stocks.  Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, guaranteed the price for unlimited quantities of wheat.  He knew that wheat would keep for at least two years.  Our surplus last year could have been stored and we would not now be confronted with the situation that faces us to-day.  It will take the farmers at least five years to recover the losses they have sustained, not alone in relation to wheat but in relation to their other crops as well. <Col N="724" /> The Minister has not even adumbrated any kind of credit guarantee scheme.</P>

The Minister himself remains silent.  His silence is typical of the contempt he has shown for wheat growers and milk producers in general since he became Minister. We remember an earlier occasion when he threatened and bullied the farmers. Apparently, he now intends to bully them once more and, not alone that, but to swindle them at the same time out of £500,000.  I invite the Minister to stand up and let us hear some facts.</P>

      <P>Those speeches, I suppose, may have some local or political value.  To that extent I was very anxious to see to it that they should have their opportunity. It is not easy to know when one is behaving in a fashion pleasing to the Opposition.

      <P>Let us see this picture as it was.  There was an admission on the part of every serious-minded person&mdash;the National Farmers' Association, the taxpayers, the members of this Government and the members of the previous Government, that there was no point in our continuing to grow wheat at a fixed price in excess of what was, from time to time, determined as the national requirement.  We made a determination and that determination was agreed upon by the Government which succeeded us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There was a recognition of that fact by everybody, and it was as a result of that that discussions had been taking place, even before I came back into the Department of Agriculture, as to what scheme could be devised to meet that situation.  Nobody believed that it was good national policy to grow wheat at the fixed guaranteed price, amounting to between £35 and £38 a ton when, if we produced in excess of the national requirement we would have to sell that surplus at £20 a ton, and ask the taxpayers to meet the difference.  I do not mind who hears me making that statement. I believe that was wise on the part of those who agreed that such a situation could not continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of general discussions, a scheme, providing for a levy, was agreed upon and I came into this House with the necessary proposals to give effect to that in a legal way.  I stated that it would be my duty and responsibility to announce at a certain date, when I knew the returns as to the acreage under wheat, what the position was likely to be, and what would be the amount of the levy.  I committed myself to giving an assurance that I would make that announcement at the end of July.  I suppose I was unwise in giving that assurance, but I was pressed by parliamentary question, and otherwise, to keep my word and honour my undertaking.  To the best of my ability, I did that and it was in the first days of August that the announcement was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I made that announcement, I had consultations with all the Parties who would be affected.  There were 410,000 or 411,000 acres under the crop, an increase of 19,000 acres on the previous year.  I could not tell the representatives of the growers, prior to making that announcement, just exactly what the deduction would be, but I know that they were very well satisfied with the amount of the levy. However, between the last days of July and the first of the harvest, the position changed.  In passing, I might comment that something great has been conceded <Col N="731" /> to me in this House, that is, that as Minister for Agriculture, I am not responsible for the weather.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation took quite a turn between the last days of July and the early days of September. When Deputies talk about a levy on millable wheat and try to score a little debating point on that aspect of the situation, do they not think of this? Suppose I had allowed that scheme, as announced on the last days of July, to continue and just said: &ldquo;Well, the levy will be so-and-so on all millable wheat&rdquo; and supposing 75 per cent. of the wheat presented or 80 per cent. or 85 per cent. or 90 per cent. was rejected as millable and that the people who grew it would have no protection whatever but to sell it at feed prices, at 40/- a barrel, if even that sum could be secured for it having regard to the fact that enormous quantities would be available, I wonder how the growers of wheat would feel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am accused of being dilatory. However, on the 11th September, as a result of the action I took, I had announced a ways and a means of meeting the new situation.  It did not take me too long to do it, either. Whether I was on tap or whether I <Col N="732" /> was not, I was not too far away from the centre of gravity, all the same. Anyhow, the scheme was announced on the 11th September.  Again, it was an agreed scheme.  It was a scheme designed as a result of discussions that took place between the National Farmers' Association, An Bord Gráin, the millers and ourselves. Every one of these interests, especially those who had the major reason to consider the interests of the growers, were mighty thankful to see that a scheme was devised, based on new definitions, that would enable them to dispose of wheat that was sound, that was as good as the Lord allowed it to be.  They were quite thankful at the time that that scheme was so designed.  It was designed quite early on in the harvest.  In fact, there was very little wheat.  No spring wheat at all, I might say, was presented to the millers when that announcement was made.</P>
    <P>Even when that scheme, in the early days of September, was being designed, it was impossible for anyone to know the outcome of the harvest. Some of the winter varieties that had been presented to the mills were very bad but neither the growers nor the millers could be sure either of the quantity or the quality of the spring wheat that was only about to be harvested.  Whatever the quantity, whatever the quality, the scheme that was designed as an emergency scheme to meet an emergency situation had the effect of ensuring that these growers would not have to truck around with their wheat looking for somebody to buy it at feeding prices and at prices at which the purchasers could determine themselves.</P>
    <P>Those who talk about the injustice and the alleged irregularity of making these deductions behave, I suppose, as nearly every section will behave&mdash;glad to get it, delighted to get it, enthusiastic about it, in fact, when it is designed and then, when they are over their trouble, they will try to repudiate those who made it.  I suppose that is a human thing.  I suppose that is a human tendency.  I am not taking exception to it.</P>
    <P>I do not mind how much any political <Col N="733" /> Party may strive to secure some advantage of one kind or another out of a situation such as this.  I do not mind any of these efforts on the part of members of the Opposition so long as I am satisfied that my Department or myself or the Government have not fallen down and that, although in the early stages when the Bill to which I have referred and which is now an Act was being discussed here I made it clear that any surplus wheat would have to be sold by all those who grew wheat. In the new situation which developed within a month, I was able to get agreement on the part of the Government to step in and to take their part in a scheme such as the one that was announced then and that the Exchequer would make available £250,000 or £500,000 sterling, or whatever it would be, because even then we did not know what the full picture would be as a result of this harvest.  Even now, it is not clear.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party can make their calculations.  They can find the mistakes. They can see the mistakes.  They can throw out the figures.  They can find the £2,000,000 here and the £1,500,000 there, and so on, while those who are watching the position carefully, and who are interested, cannot say yet with any degree of certainty what the picture will be like when this harvest comes to a close.</P>

      <P>The Department of Agriculture and myself and the Government are aware of all the factors that will enter into the situation <Col N="734" /> as a result of some of the figures which I have given in replies to parliamentary questions.  We are aware of some of the effect that is likely to follow from this small percentage of the wheat produced which is regarded as being capable of conversion into flour and the large percentage of this year's crop that has been purchased under the scheme I have spoken about which will have to be sold as feed.</P>
      <P>Deputies here are making calculations as to the price at which that wheat will have to be sold simply because the price of £24 has so far been announced.  It does not by any means follow that before this year is over, before we see the end of it, a price of £24 per ton will continue.  We are well aware that the wheat that is regarded as incapable of being converted into flour will have to be replaced by imported wheat.  We are well aware that wheat will be imported at a price lower than the price which native wheat would have cost. As I explained to-day in reply to a parliamentary question, there is a difference of £3 or £4 per ton in the quality and variety of imported wheat. We are aware of all these facts; we are fully conscious of them and we will deal with them.  All these factors are fully present to our mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a single factor &mdash; indeed, many more than were mentioned in the debate&mdash;of which we are not fully conscious.  If I had had all the wisdom, I would have kept in storage the wheat we disposed of last year.  There was no mention at all of the fact that 175,000 tons lying there were regarded by the growers as creating a disturbance.  Were we to take the risk of leaving that wheat undisposed of, while there were 410,000 acres under wheat this year?  How were we to know that the yield would be down?  If we are not blameworthy for having no knowledge as to what the harvest would be like, how, in fairness, can the accusation be made that we should not have disposed of the surplus when we were entitled to think in terms of a normal harvest this year which would yield 435,000 tons?</P>
      <P>What would be said if storage for that estimated crop were not provided? What would be said in view of the position resulting from the disastrous season which we have experienced? When the position becomes clear&mdash;as it will&mdash;the Deputies opposite will have ample opportunity of drawing attention to the fact that the Exchequer has benefited as a result of the misfortunes of the farmers.  I am sure that if any such situation were to arise, they would not be slow to remind us and the country of it.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, we must admit that as the situation developed and altered from week to week, we were on its track, saw every difficulty and provided as best we could against every hardship.  It was not possible, even with one's best efforts, to do more than just a limited amount.  We did that.  What is said in this House, often largely for the purpose of publicity, does not represent at all the feelings of our people, no matter of what political persuasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Giles when he says that this sort of extravagance in debate, this attempt to make political capital out of unjustifiable calculations, does not do a political Party the slightest bit of good. For 30 years or more, I have heard these accusations: &ldquo;You guaranteed this; you undertook that; you promised that; you deceived the public; <Col N="736" /> you codded the electors.&rdquo;  I do not think that anybody who has been here for any length of time will deny that that has been a common approach. The strange part of it is that if any member of this House heard the people in his own constituency accused of a lack of intelligence, he would be the first to resent it and denounce any person making such an accusation. Our people are intelligent and they are reasonable.</P>
    <P>What was stated here to-night does not count with any considerable percentage of them.  They appreciate a genuine effort made in time and without pressure, compulsion or publicity &mdash; made in the way we made this approach, on 11th September, to be exact.</P>

That is the time we were on the job devising ways and means to try to keep Deputy Hughes and his colleagues, who were plunging into wheat, out of their difficulties by giving them a market for wheat that was unmarketable from the point of view of suitability for conversion into flour.  The public realise that.  No matter how you may try to misrepresent that, they will look upon us as members of a Government capable of watching this situation develop and taking the appropriate action to ensure that everybody who entered into this agreement will play his part to alleviate this undoubtedly bad position and make it as tolerable as possible.  That has been my approach all through the season and it will be my approach to the end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it very much matters where the Minister was <Col N="737" /> on the 10th September or any other day because the issue raised in this motion is not whether Deputy Smith is a good Minister for Agriculture or whether Deputy Smith attends to his Department or not.  The issue is perfectly simple.  It is that if you enter into an agreement with the agricultural community that a levy of 5/9 shall be made on all millable wheat purchased to finance the disposal of the surplus millable wheat at the end of the harvest, you should not levy the 5/9 if there is no surplus for disposal. All this motion asks is that the bargain entered into by the farmers of this country and the Oireachtas will be honoured.</P>
      <P>If outside that arrangement the Government considered it appropriate to take certain steps to meet an emergency arising from the weather conditions, they were quite free to do so. There was no reason why they should not come before this House with any supplementary scheme which commended itself to them and ask the approval of the House for some arrangement that would relieve the circumstances of the farmers who had suffered disproportionate losses as a result of the weather.  But it does not seem to be defensible&mdash;and the Minister has not attempted to defend it &mdash;that we should levy 5/9 per barrel on every barrel of wheat sold this year to finance the disposal of a surplus that does not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could any issue be plainer or simpler than that?  All that the Government have in fact done is that they have&mdash;illegally, in my opinion, and certainly unjustly&mdash;collected a levy that was not due in order to relieve the Exchequer from the liability they felt would fall upon it in equity to compensate farmers for losses which their diligence as farmers could not avoid.  I do not think, and I do not believe any Deputy in Dáil Éireann thinks, that that is a justifiable course of action to follow.  I do not believe Deputy Moher or the Deputy from North Cork believes it.  I do not believe even poor Deputy Corry believes it.  I do not believe Deputy Medlar believes it.  But they will all be frogged into the Lobby to-night to <Col N="738" /> defend it.  Deputy Gibbons will be trotted into the Lobby, but I do not believe he considers it a proper course of action to collect the levy from farmers already suffering serious losses. That is the net point.  That is the injustice which induced us to put down this motion.  It is not right in this year to relieve the Exchequer of the liability which the Government concedes it is proper for the Exchequer to bear, by collecting the levy in relief of the charge.</P>
    <P>I do not want to follow the Minister in his excursions into irrelevancy but part of the justification he produces&mdash; Heaven knows how&mdash;for his conduct is that there were 175,000 tons of surplus wheat on hands when he took over the Department of Agriculture. Two comments fall to be made on that. Who declared that wheat surplus?  If we had it now, could it not be milled into flour?  Australia is carrying two years' wheat storage at the present moment.  The United States of America is carrying rather more than two years' entire crop.  Canada is certainly carrying forward more than one year's entire crop from year to year.</P>
    <P>It is all cod to say there was no storage in this country.  I know, because I arranged for a great deal of the storage.  There were four categories of storage in this country. There was Grade A, or No.1.  Then there were Grade 2, Grade 3 and the flour merchant's loft.  Grade A storage, the No.1 storage, was high efficiency storage, some of which has the highest efficiency potential in Europe.  Grade 2 was the kind of storage that was highly efficient but required excessive transport of the grain from place to place.  Grade 3 was storage we did not think was of first-class quality but that could be used if it were required for the carrying of surplus wheat from year to year.  It consisted largely of breweries, old mills and other water-tight buildings of that kind which we did not ordinarily use.  Then there was the immense storage potential of every flour merchant and miller's loft, who, if the necessity existed, could be asked to take 100 tons or 1,000 tons of flour &mdash; in other words, that it would not <Col N="739" /> be invoiced to them until they used it. The Government could perfectly well provide the millers with credit to do that if the storage problem were acute.  We never used that storage. We never used Grade 3 storage.  We never had to.  I do not believe the Minister has had to or even gone within a mile of having to use it.</P>
    <P>I think that the late Senator Moylan, Lord have mercy on him, shared my view in that regard and refused to allow the millers to bluff him and huff him into declaring surplus that which was not surplus but that which they did not want to mill. This poor man when he came in, desiring to demonstrate he was a man of action and resolution, was huffed and puffed by Deputy Lemass, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, into &ldquo;hooshing&rdquo; the whole stuff out of the country at from £18 to £20 per ton.  Now we have to buy wheat to replace it at £24 per ton c.i.f.  He sold 175,000 tons in Great Britain at from £18 to £20 per ton and he was delighted with himself.  He was like a cat with two tails after doing that.</P>
    <P>I know well what happened to the poor fellow.  I used to undergo the same pressure myself.  They arrived in Upper Merrion Street in their Bentleys and Rolls Royces.  The 'phone used to ring.  &ldquo;The millers are here.  What are you going to do?  They cannot handle the wheat.&rdquo;  I used to say: &ldquo;Send them over to me.&rdquo;  The Bentleys and Rolls Royces were sent over to Upper Merrion Street and they used to come in to tell me of the poverty that hung over their heads like the Sword of Damocles; but there was not one of them with whom I would not have swopped his overdraft most willingly for my bank book.  There was not one of them who was not earning in one month what I was being paid for 12 as Minister for Agriculture.  But when I left the Department of Agriculture, there was no surplus wheat.  They told me they could not make bread if they did not get 50 per cent.  Manitoba to 50 per cent. of Irish.  When I left office, they were using 79 per cent. Irish and 21 per cent.  Manitoba and I did not hear of anybody getting pains <Col N="740" /> in their stomachs from the resultant bread.</P>

      <P>No, no.  I was told there were 175,000 tons of surplus wheat which that Minister had to dispose of. What would be surplus about it if we had it now?  Why have we not got it now?  Because it was sold at £18 to £20 a ton in Great Britain.  Is that true or is it false?  Is it true or is it false that when the late Senator Moylan took office, the grist was 21 per cent. foreign and 79 per cent. Irish?  Is it true or is it false that now the grist will be 90 per cent. foreign and 10 per cent. Irish, and is it true that as a result of that, we are constrained to levy 5/9 per barrel on every barrel of wheat to dispose of a surplus that does not exist?</P>
      <P>I want to warn the House of this. I think we were operating a good policy when we said in respect of each commodity the farmer is encouraged to produce: &ldquo;We are going to give him stability of price.&rdquo;  I very well remember that when I first spoke for the inter-Party Government of which I was a member, the question of wheat price arose and I remember saying from the seat in which the Minister is at present sitting: &ldquo;The policy of this inter-Party Government is to demonstrate its belief in democratic principles by giving those farmers, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan and others who want to grow wheat the assurance that, with the inter-Party Government in office, whatever we may think or do not think of wheat, they will have the security they have enjoyed heretofore, and in addition, instead of one year's guarantee of price, they shall have two.&rdquo;  We went on to extend that principle to milk, to pigs and feeding barley.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with the levy of 5/9 per barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We arranged in this House to subtract from all millable wheat such sum as would be requisite to finance the disposal of surplus wheat and that sum was estimated to be 5/9. It is now ascertained beyond all doubt or question that there is no surplus.  It seems to me as clear as day that, if the express guarantee of Oireachtas Éireann is to be discharged, in the absence of a surplus, there ought not to be a levy.  If the purpose of the levy is to dispose of a surplus and there is no surplus, surely there should not be any levy.  That seems to me to be as simple as two and two make four.</P>
      <P>However, this is where I think we have gone wrong.  The Government, coming to the conclusion&mdash;rightly, in my opinion&mdash;early in the harvesting season that we were faced with a harvest catastrophe, felt that a heavy charge would come upon the Exchequer and, instead of facing that fact and meeting equitably what they conceived to be something which approximated to a disaster, they have tried and successfully tried a double-cross, saying: &ldquo;We will collect the levy not for the purpose for which we have authority from Parliament but for the purpose of relieving the Exchequer of the liability which the Exchequer should bear.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is strangely appropriate at this moment when I am describing the extreme financial difficulties in which the farmers find themselves, that the Minister for Lands should arrive respledent in evening dress, and very well he looks.  The picture of the Minister for Agriculture fleeing from the Bench leaving me face to face with this vision of beauty I now see before me gives me the key to this whole situation.  They are living 1,000,000 miles away from reality, but they have this redeeming quality to sustain them: they are a strong Government; they are very strongly supported by 78 yes-men whom they will now proceed to flog into that Lobby, whatever their belief may be, and they will go.  I do not know whether Deputy Corry is here or not. He may have gone home but if he <Col N="742" /> were here, in he would trot like a lamb.  I never see him going through that Lobby that I do not think of the slaughterhouse where the sheep all trot up the narrow path, always led by a goat.  I never can determine whether Deputy Corry in that context is the lamb or the goat, but in he trots, and whether he leads or follows after, I remember the solemn pledges he and many of his colleagues made on the public platforms of this country, when I watch with nausea their humiliating pilgrimage in repudiation of their undertaking.</P>
    <P>I often wonder do Deputies really know what is happening.  In the emergency situation that arose, farmers were told that any wheat which was potentially millable would be accepted by the millers at 63/6, and from that the levy is being deducted.  Millable wheat is purchasable at the scheduled price published, but from that the levy is deducted.  Now, there is called into existence this year that which was never invoked in any past year.  Over and above the levy this year, there is a new levy on millable wheat, only this time it is described as cleanings. In respect of that levy, there seems to be no limit at all, and I am informed that to any representation that has been made to the Department of Agriculture in regard to this very substantial additional levy, the Minister for Agriculture has made the helpful reply: &ldquo;What do you expect me to do?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Anybody that sold wheat for seed has had to pay the levy, too.  Is that fair?  Is it desirable that an arrangement made by this House with the express purpose of providing security to the agricultural community should be torn to shreds for no other purpose than to relieve the Exchequer of a burden which the Government, in their wisdom, believed it would not be allowed to avoid?  Now, a strong Government with a complacent Party behind them, under our system, can do almost anything.  I am not so sure that the courts will allow them to get away with this; but it is not a good thing, on the whole, for the people to get the impression that, given the opportunity, the Government are prepared to try it on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> I think the Government should honour their bond and should not seek retrospectively to alter an agreement without the consent of every other Party to it&mdash;and that consent it was not possible to get.  I know it would have been more inconvenient to honour the bond as it was given and take remedial measures by straightforward action and a separate agreement; but it would have been worth the trouble.  When I recall the infinity of trouble to which the Department of Agriculture went, when I was responsible for this difficult crop, and compare it with the cavalier insolence of the Minister, it fills me with dismay that the farmers, who should be the elect, seem to have learned the bitter lesson only too quickly again, that in the mind of Fianna Fáil, they are the hewers of wood and the drawers of water, to be told what is good for them and to be glad to take it.</P>
    <P>I look back with dismay to the days when the Minister used to tell them what he thought of them.  That was ten years ago.  In those days, he told them what he was prepared to do if they did not grow wheat: now he tells them what he intends to do if they do. I rejoice in the fact that the farmers of 1947 reached the end of their patience and put it on record that no one could talk to them as Deputy Smith believed it was his right and his duty to do, when he spoke at Navan ten years ago. I view with dismay the possibility that the same Minister to-day can enter into a solemn covenant with the agricultural community and, when it suits him, tear it up and kick them in the stomach, if they claim the spirit of their bond.</P>
    <P>I think that element in this situation is just as important as the money that enters in.  Is there anyone here who would contend, if this bargain had been made with the millers, if this bargain had been made with foreign capital, if this bargain had been made with any trade union in Ireland, that the Government would have dared to tear it up and bid them like it or lump it?  Is there any other section in the community, is there any other interest with which the Government of Ireland deals, who would submit to a bond of <Col N="744" /> that character being reneged upon and insolent contumely heaped by that Government on the heads of those who took them at their word?  I do not believe there is; and I hate to think it possible that treatment of that kind can be accorded to the farmers of Ireland, to whatever Party they belong. Their fathers would not have submitted to it; their grandfathers would not have submitted to it; and if it comes to pass that they do, then I can only pray that their sons and grandsons will be better than the men who begot them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to place on record the views of the Labour Party on this motion.  As we see it, the facts are these, that the 5/9 levy per barrel on wheat was deliberately placed there so as to subsidise surplus wheat for export this year.  At the time when the levy was being placed and when the sanction of the Dáil was being sought, I well remember the Taoiseach stating that perhaps in future years a system of quotas for wheat could be established but that for this year the immediate job was to finance the sale of surplus wheat on the foreign market. It is pretty clear, then, and certainly not denied by the Minister, that there will not be a surplus this year.  I was awaiting the Minister's long-sought speech to find out whether he denied that claim of Fine Gael that there would be no surplus, but he simply said: &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; All indications are that there will be no surplus.  If that is so, to continue the levy, in my view and in the view of my Party, is to take money dishonestly from the farming people.</P>
      <P>Anyone who gets a right to levy for a specific purpose and who uses that right in another way, is deliberately taking to himself a right in a wrong manner.  It is tantamount to reducing the price of wheat to the farming people and also not passing on that reduction to the consumer in this country.  It is because of that that I and the other members of the Labour Party propose to vote for this motion.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to take up the time of the House now, but as I have waited from seven o'clock until ten minutes to 11 to hear the spokesman for the farmers from East <Col N="745" /> Cork make the case for the wheat growers, and he has not arrived, I feel I should voice their opinion in his stead.  It is quite clear that Deputy Corry has no intention now of making any contribution to this debate.  It is quite clear also, from statements he made in the last few days around the country, that he opposes entirely the imposition of this levy.</P>
      <P>I might be permitted, in the few minutes left, to quote from the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of two days ago, November 10th.  A meeting was held of what are described in black print as the East Cork Grain Growers, at which Deputy M.J. Corry was certainly the principal and, in my view, the only speaker.  He said this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;They had a disastrous year from every viewpoint and added to the bad harvest was this uncalled-for levy of 5/9 per barrel on wheat. Whatever authority the millers had for collecting this levy on the estimated 50,000 tons of millable wheat, there is, in my opinion, no legal authority whatever for placing an impost on wheat purchased for animal feeding for and on behalf of An Bord Gráin.&rsquo;</P>
      <P>Mr. Corry went on to state that he was obtaining further legal advice on what he termed was a gross injustice to the farming community&mdash;a matter which involved upwards of half a million of money&mdash;money which was badly needed by the farmer this year more than ever before.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry did not come in to express that view, but I could not agree more with him in this instance, although it is not often we agree on matters of general policy.  He did not come in here to express that view and it is most unlikely that he will be here to vote.  I think as a representative of farmers in East Cork he would be much more likely to be heard and his voice much more likely to be recognised here than talking in public in Cork.  I want to say that I was one of those who put their signatures to this motion that &ldquo;as there is no surplus of home-grown wheat, there is no justification for the retention of the levy of 5/9.&rdquo;  I believe that I am <Col N="746" /> expressing the views of the vast majority of farmers in East Cork in so putting my signature to it.  I believe they would be very disappointed if I did not come in here and raise my voice in support of the motion and did not vote for the handing back of that 5/9 to which they are entitled, not only legally but morally, by any standard.</P>
    <P>One thing which emerged from this debate was the fact that this House and the farmers were being treated with sheer contempt.  The Minister was forced to get to his feet.  He said everything without making any case and without telling us what is happening to the 5/9.  I cannot understand how Fianna Fáil Deputies from the wheat-growing constituencies, could have the patience to sit and listen while 12 or 13 speakers from Fine Gael, and one from the Labour Party, made the case that this 5/9 should be restored.  The people of the country, whether they are Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael supporters, whether they are wheat-growers or other types of farmers, expect the Dáil to give back to the wheat growers what is justly theirs.</P>

      <P>I shall not delay the House more than a minute.  The Minister said that nobody could anticipate what had occurred.  On July 1st last, Deputy Hughes and myself asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, after disposing of any surplus that there may be in the wheat crop of this year, he will have distributed to the wheat growers any surplus of cash left over in the fund formed by the deductions ordered by him from the price of wheat.  The reply given by the Minister and my rejoinder, as reported at column 927 Volume 169 were:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" />&ldquo;Mr. Smith: I cannot say, at this stage, how any surplus that might arise will be disposed of...</P>
    <P>Mr. T. Lynch: If a surplus is found&mdash;and from what we are told, although the Minister is supposed to stop 12/-, we know he is going to stop 6/- a barrel&mdash;if there is a surplus why should it not be restored to the wheat growers?  It should not be carried forward because we know that if it is carried forward it will probably disappear into the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Mr. Smith: Since the Deputy can estimate so accurately, I am sure he will conclude that there should not be any surplus.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> To a question before that the Minister replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I know that the Deputy has some excellent advice to give, but I am not in need of advice at this time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My comment then was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think the Minister could always do with advice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I still think the Minister could do with some advice.  I would advise him to pay attention to his Department and refrain from attending dinners of the Tourist Board at a time when he should be meeting the National Farmers' Association.</P>
