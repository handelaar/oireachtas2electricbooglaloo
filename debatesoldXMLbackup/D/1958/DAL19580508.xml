      <P>May I repeat the request I made to the Government Whip last night that the House should rise at 2 o'clock?  Rural Deputies want an opportunity of seeing the Spring Show.  It is an agricultural show and it is necessary that agricultural techniques should be improved.  One of the methods of improving them is, of course, shows such as this.  That is why it is undesirable that rural Deputies should not get an opportunity of seeing the show.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete Section 2, lines 7 to 27, and substitute the following two sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>2.&mdash;For the purposes of this Act each of the following shall be a manufacturing process&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the making, by the use of mechanical power, of a commodity,</P>
      <P>(b)  the altering, by the use of mechanical power, of a commodity,</P>
      <P>(c)  the ornamenting, by the use of mechanical power, of a commodity,</P>
      <P>(d)  the finishing, by the use of mechanical power, of a commodity,</P>
      <P>(e)  the adapting for sale, by the use of mechanical power, of a commodity.</P>
      <P>3.&mdash;(1)  Wherever the Minister is of opinion that a particular commodity is either not being manufactured in the State or not being manufactured in the State to a substantial extent, he may by Order declare that such commodity shall be an excepted commodity for the purposes of this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where the Minister makes an Order under sub-section (1) of this section, then the word &ldquo;commodity&rdquo; shall, in Section 2 of this Act and in any section of this Act subsequent to this section, be construed as excluding the commodity to which the Order relates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1570" /> (3)  Whenever the Minister makes an Order under sub-section (1) of this section, notice of the making of the Order (which notice shall contain particulars of the commodity to which the Order relates) shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after the Order is made.</P>
    <P>During the course of the discussion on the Committee Stage Deputy McGilligan suggested it would be more appropriate if the sub-section which defined manufacturing processes was in the Bill as a separate section and the purpose of this section is to bring about that change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a better method.  I suppose the Minister is satisfied why each of the five things is a separate manufacturing process?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete Section 3 (2) (d), lines 43 to 47, and substitute the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d) that, of each class of shares carrying voting rights issued by it, not less than 50 per cent. have been <i>bona fide</i> issued for public subscription in the State and have been made available primarily to Irish citizens or Irish companies which are managed and controlled in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is again based upon a suggestion made by Deputy McGilligan during the course of the discussion on the Committee Stage, that the purpose of the section would be clarified if the wording were altered in the way in which it is here&mdash;that is to put the requirement that the shares should be offered for public subscription first, and their availability primarily to Irish <Col N="1571" /> citizens second.  It does not change the meaning but it makes the meaning clearer.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>During the discussion on the Bill in Committee, I accepted two amendments which Deputy McGilligan moved to this section.  He felt afterwards that the wording of the section required review, that both of the amendments effected the same purpose. I examined the effect of the amendments and I decided that he is correct. This amendment clarifies the whole position.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete Section 4 (1) (a), line 26, and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) such company carries on business primarily for export and sales by it on the home market of each commodity in respect of which it carries on any manufacturing process are incidental only to its export trade in that commodity, or.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will remember that we had a rather protracted discussion in Committee on the best method of expressing the purpose intended in subparagraph (a) of sub-section (1) of this section.  The section, as drafted, was intended to set out <i>seriatim</i> all the conditions applying to the carrying on <Col N="1572" /> of manufacturing operations in this country.  The section makes it clear that a company which conforms to any of these conditions is entitled to engage in such a business.  One of the conditions under which a company could carry on was that it was doing business solely for export.  It was felt that this term was too rigid a condition and that the purpose of the legislation could be better expressed by using some such term as &ldquo;primarily for export.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, the use of the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; would be too vague and would not meet the particular situation we had in mind.  What we had in mind was to exempt from all restrictions and regulations any company engaged in manufacturing operations primarily for the purpose of the export trade, where home market sales were only incidental. The amendment I am submitting here does define the intention far more precisely than it was defined in the original draft of the Bill.  If this amendment is adopted it will be quite clear that a company which goes in primarily for the export trade, in the sense that sales by it on the home market are incidental only to its export trade, will be exempt from any restrictions or control.</P>
    <P>Later in the Bill the term &ldquo;primarily for export&rdquo; is defined as a situation in which sales on the home market are not, taking one year with another, more than 10 per cent. of its average production.  In so far as it was intended to put such an undertaking outside the scope of the legislation this amendment does so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that amendments Nos. 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10 call for discussion together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir.  Later on in the Bill we provide that a company which carries on business in the month of April, 1958, a company which carries on a particular type of manufacturing business, can continue to do so.  Under this section we provide that a company which carries on business primarily for the purposes of export can do so. However, suppose you have a company <Col N="1573" /> qualified under the April, 1958, condition to do business and this company decides to go into the export trade with another line.  I think that as the sections are drafted here it must be the total of all such a company's volumes of business that must be taken to decide whether the 10 per cent. condition applies or not.  It should not be only the volume of business in the new export line which such a company is going into.</P>
      <P>Take a simple case.  A company makes bricks for the home market in April, 1958, and is entitled, under this Bill, to continue to do so.  The volume of that company's business is £100,000 a year and it is entitled to continue doing that business.  It then decides to go into the export market in relation to the making of machinery.  Suppose it has prepared a very excellent brick-making machine and it decides to make that machine available to the export market and the output of that machine on the export market is only £10,000 a year.  I think that the £100,000 and the £10,000 must be lumped together in deciding whether the business is primarily for the purpose of export or not.  I think that the business of such a company is primarily for the purpose of export in relation to any business in respect of which it is now qualified under the Bill.  I think that is what the Minister intends and I think that the more we can get existing companies into the export business the better it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We certainly do not want to make it the price of going into the export market that a company should desist from an existing manufacturing process. We want to make the inducement to go into the export market as great as we possibly can.  As I understand it, the Minister wants any existing business which qualifies under the Bill to be able to carry on.  Surely there must not be any provision which would restrict a company such as I have mentioned from going into that export market.  I think that if a company wants to go into the export market in respect of a new line in which it is not already qualified under the Act it should be enabled to do so <Col N="1574" /> and I do not think the section, as drafted, permits it to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has not been recommitted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I suggested that amendments Nos. 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10 be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this amendment makes for greater flexibility and removes the rigidity which is in the section as it stands.  You have to construe amendment No. 5 in connection with amendment No. 8.  I am doubtful whether the Minister is doing something which will be ultimately found to be wisdom in itself.  I take it that under amendment No. 5 a company will be qualified for continued operation, provided it is engaged primarily in the production of goods for the export market and that such goods as it supplies to the home market will not put it offside for the purposes of operation, provided the goods sold in the home market do not exceed 10 per cent.?  I take it that is the general intention under this Bill, as now amended?</P>
      <P>I am wondering if it is wise for the Minister to put 10 per cent. in the Bill? It has been found from time to time&mdash; the Minister must know this&mdash;that Bills sometimes get through this House, based on the kindliest and best of intentions, which, in actual operation, are found to be unduly rigid.  Some situation arises; the Bill is examined and everybody desires to meet the point raised by some manufacturer or some trading organisation; but it is found that the Bill is too rigid and it cannot be done.  Every kind of tortuous mind is put on the Bill to see what way this sub-section can be got around.  The most violent things are done through powers of administration and legislation in order to get over a particular difficulty which we ourselves created by making the Bill too rigid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be found in actual operation that there is a very good case for a firm engaged in the production of goods for export finding it nationally advantageous and advantageous to its own operations to supply <Col N="1575" /> a certain quantity of goods on the home market, goods which are at present imported.  If it is found that the average production and sale of these goods on the home market amounts to 12 or 15 per cent., then the company puts itself offside under amendment No. 8.</P>
    <P>In modern legislation, so long as Parliament still has control, I am strongly in favour of enabling a Government to do things by regulation, provided there is control over the regulation. It would be a pity if the Minister were to tie this thing up in such a rigid way that the 10 per cent. could never be altered, except by the Minister coming back to the Dáil and putting a Bill through five stages here and four stages in the Seanad to alter a matter of sale on the home market by the difference of 10 per cent. or 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether it would not be wiser for the Minister with this amendment No. 8 to take power to prescribe the percentage, by regulation or by resolution, which could be varied in a matter of an hour or two by a motion in the House, rather than to tie this Bill down to the position in which, once it exceeds 10 per cent., all you have to do is say to a manufacturer, perhaps doing a useful job nationally: &ldquo;What you are doing is excellent but it is 10 per cent. in the Bill and we cannot do anything about it.  We cannot contemplate now going back to the Dáil to make that 12 per cent. or 15 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>By using amendment No. 8 as an enabling amendment, the Minister could get power to vary 10 per cent. to 15 per cent., if he wants to take it.  If circumstances arise in which it is desirable nationally to make it 15 per cent., he can do it by regulation or resolution, without having to amend the entire Act.  I think that is a considerable advantage these days when getting legislation through is often a difficult process and when you have a back-log of legislation awaiting attention. I commend study of that to the Minister.  It does not tie the Minister down.  It gives him greater freedom in the matter and at the same time, <Col N="1576" /> provided the regulation gets the approval of the House, it maintains a reasonable flexibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was for the reasons mentioned by Deputy Norton that I put down my three amendments, on which I should like to say a few words. There is no special reason that 10 per cent. is regarded as incidental.  I do not know what decided the Minister on 10 per cent.  Why not 9 per cent., 11 per cent. or 12½ per cent.?  When I referred to the fact that 10 per cent. might be a very big proportion of the home market, although only 10 per cent. of the export of a very big company, the Minister replied that that was one very good reason for confining the home market to only 10 per cent.  I suggest, if the thing is left open on the lines of the amendment put down by me, namely, deleting the words in the original Section 4 (2) &mdash;the words after &ldquo;commodity&rdquo;&mdash;the qualification &ldquo;incidental&rdquo; would mean &ldquo;the sales on the home market of every commodity in respect of which it carries on any manufacturing process are incidental only to its export trade in that commodity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the Minister was concerned about the definition of &ldquo;incidental&rdquo;, I personally would be quite agreeable to adding something to that section giving him power to decide whether in fact a firm was confining its trade on the home market to a genuine incidental proportion of its total trade.  I am afraid if you leave it at a rigid 10 per cent., one of two things may happen: it may be too small for the company concerned or too big for the home market and may do damage to an existing efficient home manufacturer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You must allow some degree of sales on the home market.  I understand that in the question of exports to, say, the United States, the question of tariffs enters into the export price, and these tariffs are calculated in some instances on the home market price of the commodity in question.  If you export an article costing £100 invoice value to the United States, they will not base the tariff on a £100 valuation, but on the home market price, which may well be £125 or £150.  Some degree <Col N="1577" /> of home sales for an industry engaged primarily in the export market is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>In any event, from the very beginning of this Bill, as I stated here on more than one occasion, I am against this rigidity of 10 per cent. and 90 per cent.  I do not think it makes for a good Bill.  It would be far better to leave it at &ldquo;incidental to the general manufacture&rdquo; and for the Minister to take whatever power he thinks adequate to protect an efficient home producer.</P>
    <P>In Section 4, I do not think the Minister should elaborate on the word &ldquo;incidental&rdquo;.  The original draft &ldquo;and such company carrying on business solely for export&rdquo; was better after changing the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; to &ldquo;primarily&rdquo;.  It is a mistake to put too much in that section.  That is the section we will be using to advertise the advantages of this new Bill.  The simpler and more direct you make that, without any frills or qualifications, the better.  Later on, any qualifications, restrictions and explanations the Minister thinks necessary could be added. That section would read far better simply as &ldquo;such company carrying on business primarily for export&rdquo;, with nothing more than that.</P>
    <P>Then at the top of page 5, in sub-section (2), &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; could be defined as meaning that the home sales</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...of every commodity in respect of which it carries on any manufacturing process are incidental only to its export trade in that commodity...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the Bill would be a better Bill for that.</P>
    <P>I quite appreciate the objections to allowing too great latitude, which may in effect endanger the whole manufacture. As against that, I agree with Deputy Norton that it is a mistake to make it too rigid, in view of the fact of this Bill going out&mdash;as I presume it will&mdash;and being sent to those with industrial potential to work manufacturing plants here.  I think the stipulation of 90 per cent. will detract from the value <Col N="1578" /> of the Bill.  That was the reason I put down the three amendments, which are inter-connected, as can be appreciated. It was to get away from that rigidity and leave the Bill open to any manufacturer who wants to manufacture primarily for export.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion was the use of the word &ldquo;mainly,&rdquo; but I accept that the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; may do, provided the sales on the home market are only incidental, the definition of &ldquo;incidental&rdquo; to be left open.  Any phrase the Minister may require to put in to safeguard the home market may be put in, but should not be tied to 9, 10, 11 or 12 per cent., or any other percentage.</P>

      <P>I think Deputies are allowing themselves to be misled to some extent by reason of the fact that condition (a) is at the head of the conditions set out in Section 4 of the Bill.  The position at present is that a company can engage in manufacturing operations here, provided it is a qualified company within the definition of the 1934 Control of Manufactures Act, in respect of the ownership of its shares and the nationality of its shareholders; or provided it gets a licence from the Minister for Industry and Commerce under that Act.  That is the present position.</P>
      <P>There are people who think that position should not be changed.  The Federation of Irish Industries have argued that that is working satisfactorily and that there is no point in changing it at all, that so long as a company proposing to do a desirable job of manufacturing here is entitled to apply and get a licence to do it, there is no need to go further than that.  I do not agree with that and I am proposing in this Bill to go beyond the position established by the Control of Manufactures Act of 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the obvious considerations which apply is the desire to facilitate the establishment of undertakings to do export trade, but the 1934 Act was intended to deal with the position of companies manufacturing primarily for the home market.  In my view, there is still a need to ensure that undertakings which are primarily concerned with the home market should <Col N="1579" /> be either under the control of Irish citizens or subject to some sort of examination before they are allowed to operate.  It is clear that we can put outside the scope of this Bill companies concerned with export only. Our concern was to decide what is meant by the term &ldquo;solely concerned with export&rdquo;.  It was recognised that a company which was concerned solely with export might have incidental sales in the home market.  Very well; we are prepared to let them do that and there is no question of their position being invalidated by reason of the fact that they do so.  The position under this Bill will be that they require no licence, certificate or permit to engage in manufacturing operations, provided export is their primary objective within that definition.</P>
    <P>In my view, it would be undesirable to leave the term &ldquo;primarily for export&rdquo; with a vague meaning. Indeed, most of the companies likely to wish to avail of the paragraph of the Bill would prefer to know precisely what their position will be under the Bill.  I do not anticipate it is likely to give any difficulty whatever. Indeed, in the case of one company proposing to establish a new industry here, and to which I had undertaken to give a licence under the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934, they came back and said they would not need licences, as they expected to qualify under paragraph (a) and consequently would be able to carry on without any licence whatever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister not think the paragraph (a) company may feel that it might exceed the percentage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not think it will be a problem.  Deputy Norton said we should have a situation under which a company that could not qualify, or fears it might not at some stage qualify under paragraph (a), should get a permit to manufacture by ministerial Order.  That is precisely the position as the Bill stands.  A company that does not wish to be limited in the scope of its operations to export only, or primarily to export, which wants to <Col N="1580" /> have the power to sell with greater freedom on the home market, comes under some of the other paragraphs of Section 4&mdash;assuming that it is not a qualified company, in which case, of course, it could engage in any business either home market sales or exports, without any control whatever.  Assuming it is an externally-owned company, which wishes to engage in the home market or which wishes to have freedom in both the home and the export markets, then it comes to the Minister and seeks a certificate of exemption or a Control of Manufactures Act licence and it will get it provided it is decided &mdash;and it is to be an individual judgment in each case&mdash;that the effect of its development is to add to the industrial capacity of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking information. How is the 10 per cent. decided and who decides it?  Do you take it in good faith; so that the industrialist does not require to go near the Department and starts to manufacture; and it is assumed that he is not selling more than 10 per cent. on the home market?  Is there any check on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not anticipate any difficulty on that score.  The normal practice is that if some company is engaged in manufacturing operations under conditions which appear to be an infringement of the Control of Manufactures Act, then some other company whose interests are prejudiced by that development comes and reports the fact to the Department.  I do not want the Deputy to think inspectors will be going round investigating the position.  That is not the situation.  Objection will be made when some other firm's trade is being prejudiced by reason of the fact that some company has invaded this market without being qualified under this Bill. In that case, the position will have to be examined.  In 99 cases out of 100, assuming that the company is a reputable <Col N="1581" /> one, doing a good job and contributing to the industrial organisation of the State, if there is a problem for it in qualifying under paragraph (a) there will be no problem in making it qualify under paragraph (b) or some other paragraph.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister answer one question?  Supposing a firm is engaged in the export market primarily, exporting 95 per cent. of its products and selling 5 per cent. on the home market; and suppose some organisation comes to it and says: &ldquo;We have been importing a certain commodity from such and such a country, we think now you could make it for us and we want to buy it from you in the future instead of buying in the external market," can the supplying firm say: &ldquo;All right, we will take on that order&rdquo;&mdash;even though it means selling 15 per cent. of their production on the home market?</P>

It is only in relation to the home market that we require safeguards and that is the reason why paragraph (a) appears in this Bill. There is no need for any supervision where production for export is primarily intended.</P>

      <P>I do not think that should cause any difficulty at all.  I want to deal now with Deputy Sweetman's point, which is somewhat different.  It seems to me the Deputy is not quite correctly interpreting the effect of the paragraph it is proposed to insert by amendment No. 7.  The position is that certain companies are now carrying on manufacturing operations here.  They are operating within the strict letter of the 1934 Act.  They may not be able or they may not wish to conform to the conditions of this Bill; if they conform, there is, of course, no question about their position at all.  To a company unable to conform or unwilling to do so, though still wishing to remain in business, we say: &ldquo;You may remain in business producing the same class of goods you are now producing&rdquo;, but, if they want to go into any new line, then they must conform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will admit there will be some cases in which the Deputy would be correct in his negative interjection, but, in the majority of cases, they are companies that have not complied with the Control of Manufactures Act and were refused a licence because it was not considered desirable to allow them to operate; nevertheless, they brought themselves into strict conformity with the provisions of the 1934 Act and started manufacturing. As far as I am concerned, I am prepared to say to them: &ldquo;You can, if you wish now, alter the constitution of your company to qualify under the Bill&rdquo;, in which case they are free.  If they do not wish to do that and wish to maintain their present unusual type of capital structure, they can still continue to manufacture for the home market the goods they are now producing.  In the case of a company proposing to go into export, there would, in most cases, I imagine, be no problem at all about giving them all the necessary permits, licences or certificates to enable them to do so, but it would be clearly prejudicial to the main purpose of the Bill, which is to continue to retain powers of supervision and regulation in relation to home market operations, to grant to these companies any sort of general exemption.  I can see circumstances, as the Deputy suggests, in which a company would be given the necessary authority; but to give it in a general way which would not require them to inform the Department even of what they intend to do would, I think, be unnecessary and could be in certain circumstances undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what I suggested at all.  The Minister has completely misunderstood the point I made.  If a company carries on business here and is entitled to carry on business in the home market, does the Minister not wish that company under <Col N="1584" /> all circumstances to develop an export trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  A company will be entitled to carry on business here in the home market, provided it conforms to certain conditions.  We are talking about companies that cannot or will not conform, but which are nevertheless manufacturing at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It affects more than the Minister thinks.  It affects companies under other sections as well because paragraph (a) of Section 4 covers, as amended, the whole business of the company and not merely the particular line that is the export line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly covers the whole business of the company.  I admit that.  I think it must do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it should only cover the export line, because, otherwise, you will get a restriction on export business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the Deputy is over-emphasising the importance of paragraph (a).  In the normal case where a company wants to sell its products in the home market, if it is an externally controlled company and not qualified under the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934, it will come looking for an exemption certificate or a licence, and I think that is a situation we should retain.  No sensible Minister will refuse a certificate or a licence, if the effect of the development is to increase production.  He can refuse it where he realises it will put some other firm out of business and, as I explained on the Committee Stage, I think the danger of that happening would be a deterrent to industrial development rather than a help.</P>

If the Deputy is concerned only with that very small minority, externally owned, in legal compliance with the 1934 Act but unwilling to adapt their constitution to comply with the provisions of this Bill, in their case, if they want to extend their operations, a certificate of exemption or a licence will meet the position.</P>

      <P>(b) Where a company to which this sub-section applies sends to the Minister, before the appointed day, a statutory declaration, signed by all its directors, stating that on the 1st day of May, 1958, or within one month immediately preceding that date it carried on a particular manufacturing process in relation to a particular commodity, then, notwithstanding anything in Section 9 of the Act of 1934, it shall be lawful for the company to continue, on and after the appointed day, to carry on such manufacturing process in relation to such commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will remember that we discussed the position of these £100 companies, as they were called, during the Committee Stage and that the Bill as originally introduced required these companies to bring themselves in future, after a lapse of a year or possibly longer, into conformity with one or other of the paragraphs of Section 4. It was argued that it was undesirable to have any retrospective provision in the Bill and I accepted that.  Therefore, I am proposing here that any of these companies that does not wish to <Col N="1587" /> bring itself into compliance with any of the paragraphs of Section 4 can, nevertheless, remain in operation in respect of the types of goods that it is now producing.  It is necessary, however, that some record of them should exist because one could see circumstances arising in five or ten years' time where undesirable developments might be permitted by reason of the absence of information regarding the scale of the activities of any of the companies of this kind and, therefore, the section provides that they can secure that exemption from the need to comply with any of the paragraphs of Section 4 by the process of making a statutory declaration of their existence and of the type of goods they are producing and then, in respect of these types of goods, they are exempted from any further compliance with the conditions of the Act in the future.</P>

I want to get some information from the Minister as to what the interpretation of his amendment is.  Does &ldquo;particular manufacturing process&rdquo; mean that the company concerned cannot introduce any improvement in the process for manufacturing the particular commodity?  As I understand the situation, I can see the Minister's intention in relation to confining the commodity by the word &ldquo;particular&rdquo; but surely it is unnecessary to restrict the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I know &ldquo;manufacturing process&rdquo; is defined but &ldquo;a particular manufacturing process&rdquo; is different.  We have had a definition of &ldquo;manufacturing process&rdquo; in amendment No. 1 and it says &ldquo;the making, by the use of mechanical power, of a commodity&rdquo;.  I am a little bit worried <Col N="1589" /> that it might mean a restriction to the exact type of machine in operation and if the Minister assures me that he has been assured, from a drafting point of view, that it does not, I am perfectly happy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I am quite happy.  The other point is this: I know of one particular case where a company had placed orders to make, and have made, a prototype of a new form of machine that it is anxious to manufacture here and sell in the United States of America.  It had actually, itself, not started the manufacture of this machine before 1st May but it got the prototype manufactured by another contractor while it was altering its premises.  The alteration of the premises is not quite finished yet and it will not be finished even before the Bill is enacted.  What I am anxious to provide is that where reasonable steps have been taken to expend money on the initiation of a new line of country, where the declaration is filed showing that such reasonable steps have been taken, that the money was being expended before we had this discussion, on 1st May, 1958, the company would not be prejudiced.</P>

      <P>Normally, I think such a case as the Deputy mentions would be met without any difficulty by the issue of the necessary licence or certificate.  It would be very undesirable to have any element of vagueness as to operations that a company was doing&mdash;a company of this kind, at this time.  As I said before, we have to be thinking in terms of some Minister administering this Act, say, ten years hence and I would not like to see a situation where people who were proposing to do something that everybody thought was undesirable could, nevertheless, get themselves the legal authority to do so by the simple process of acquiring some of these companies which could claim to have <Col N="1590" /> had the intention of doing something but which it was not actually doing.</P>

      <P>This point was raised in Committee also.  Under paragraph 1 (2) of the First Schedule shares of the qualified holding (B) company, that is a subsidiary holding company, must be held in the required proportion by a qualified holding (A) company. It was pointed out that the shares should be held partly by individuals and partly by a qualified holding (A) company and the object of amendments Nos. 11 and 12 is to deal with that situation.  The point, I think, was raised by the Industrial Credit Company during discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point which, perhaps, could be raised on this which has been brought to my attention since the last stage, that is the case where a pretty substantial minority holding in a company was held by a qualified person under the 1932 and 1934 Acts.  That substantial holding brought the company within the terms of the 1934 Act as an Irish qualified company but the shareholder concerned died.  The beneficiaries under his will were not qualified persons and there does not seem to be any possibility of getting any other Irish person to come in and take this holding, which is about £50,000.  Nobody would be likely to put that much money in a minority holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there are provisions by virtue of which under the will certain persons can be deemed to be qualified because they are receiving them under trust and so on, but it does nevertheless create a difficulty where a company was completely qualified and suddenly that qualification collapses because of the death of one of the Irish qualified people who had a substantial holding <Col N="1592" /> in it.  His executors have to try to find somebody to take over that share-holding and that business.  A share-holding of the size I have in mind is not one that would be taken over as an ordinary investment.  It would be only taken up by a working partner.  I cannot see how one could avoid the difficulty unless there was some method of ensuring that after death the terms for qualification were different. The qualification that it would only arise after death would prevent any avoidance of the ordinary law.  It would be very cumbersome to do it.</P>
    <P>In the case about which I have been told&mdash;it is not a case on which I am personally engaged legally but about which a fellow solicitor has told me&mdash; I cannot see any possibility of their being able to get an Irishman to put £50,000 into this company because a person would put that amount of money into a company only if he was working personally in it.  I do not think there is anybody here likely to be possessed of that amount of money and the necessary qualifications to do the job.  This is an example of how restrictive legislation of this sort can land one in difficulties which were not visualised.  I do not know whether the Minister has met other similar cases and whether it could be met by a licence or by an exemption but it does seem to create a problem that must be met or else the particular business will have to fold up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The House will recollect that on the occasion of the debate here on the Supplementary Estimate for Transport and Marine Services which I introduced last month, I outlined the transport policy which had been settled by the Government following our consideration of the report and recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into Internal Transport which had reported some months previously and the report of which was in due course published and circulated to Deputies.  I indicated on that occasion that legislation would be introduced to give effect to the policy which I outlined then and also to provide for the <Col N="1594" /> expected amalgamation of the Great Northern Railway undertaking within our territory with C.I.E. as from the 1st October next when it is assumed that the agreement for joint operation will be terminated.</P>
      <P>Deputies will have noted that this Bill deals with C.I.E. matters only and that, to that extent, the intentions which I expressed in November last have not been fully carried into effect. Because of the necessity for parallel legislation in the Six Counties dealing with the G.N.R. and because of the necessity to settle a number of minor but very complicated details which will arise out of the termination of the agreement of 1953 relating to the G.N.R., it has been considered to be more convenient to deal with the affairs of the G.N.R. in a separate Bill. I hope to introduce that Bill shortly. It is at present being prepared and, indeed, it may reach Deputies before this Bill has completed its passage through the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>To some extent, that G.N.R. Bill will necessitate amendment of the provisions of this Bill, in relation to the amount of the subvention to be paid to C.I.E. and in relation to its temporary borrowing powers.  We may be able to arrange matters to ensure that both measures will become law more or less simultaneously.  It is important that Deputies understand that the G.N.R. Bill, which will follow on this one, should become effective before the summer adjournment.  That is why this Bill has to be pushed on also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main object of this Bill is to implement the principal recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into Internal Transport, with some very important modifications, the character of which I outlined in my statement of November last.  At that time, I made it clear that the Government were not accepting the specific recommendations in that report relating to the reduction of the mileage of railway lines, or the number of stations, nor have they accepted the specific recommendations in that report relating to the reduction of the mileage of railway lines, or the number of stations, nor have they accepted the pattern of the future railway system of C.I.E. which was suggested in the map published in that report.  I pointed out in November that it seemed to me that the committee did not intend to specify the <Col N="1595" /> particular sections of lines, or the individual stations which should, in their opinion, be closed down and that they gave their views in that regard by way of illustration only.</P>
    <P>It is the Government view, with which I feel sure the members of the committee, having regard to their report, would agree, that the actual carrying out of a reorganisation policy such as they suggested could be undertaken only by the board of C.I.E., who have day to day administrative responsibilities and access to all the relevant facts, and, thereby, the ability to judge the prospects of any section of line, or branch line, continuing to be useful to the community it has served. This Bill empowers the board to close down any line or any station for which there is clearly no future.  It empowers them to close down a line or station on their own decision and without having to seek the prior approval of the Transport Tribunal.</P>
    <P>They are, however, given a statutory direction not to terminate any rail service, except where they first satisfy themselves that there are no prospects of its continued operation being economic within a reasonable period.  The board are, of course, also placed under a general obligation so to conduct the undertaking as to eliminate losses on its working by 31st March, 1964.  That means, in effect, that the fate of any branch line, or any station, depends on whether sufficient business is generated to justify its retention and the future of these lines and stations will be determined primarily, therefore, by the amount of local support given to them.</P>
    <P>The effect of that arrangement is to put local communities in the position that they will have to make up their minds whether they can keep a railway service going.  A railway service can be justified only if there is local need for it and local support sufficient to keep it going.  One of the provisions of this Bill relieves C.I.E. also from the obligation to provide an alternative road transport system where a railway system is terminated.  It is appreciated that there may be in some outlying districts, or in some special circumstances, <Col N="1596" /> a situation in which it would not be economic for C.I.E. to extend their road transport organisation to deal with a small volume of traffic of an essentially local nature.  It seems to me that there would be no point in permitting C.I.E. to close down a station, or a line, where there was not sufficient traffic to justify keeping it open and then putting on them the obligation to substitute some other service, which, by their methods of working, might also involve them in losses.</P>
    <P>Where C.I.E. however, do not provide alternative road services, where, having assessed the requirements of the locality, they decide that it would not be suitable for them to provide alternative services, then applications will be considered from local private interests for the necessary road passenger and merchandise licences to enable them to provide services which will be adequate to the requirements of the area.  The principal function of the Transport Tribunal established under existing legislation, which is the consideration of applications for the termination of rail services and for the closing of canals to navigation, will disappear with this granting of complete autonomy to C.I.E.</P>
    <P>If C.I.E. is to be put in the position to act entirely on the basis of the information available to it, there will be no further justification for the continued existence of the tribunal. Therefore, the statutory provisions under which that tribunal was established are being repealed by this Bill.  It is appropriate that I should avail of this opportunity to express appreciation of the very fair and very satisfactory manner in which the members of that tribunal have carried out what must have been at times a most unenviable task.  I am sure the Dáil will join me in the expression of these sentiments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also proposed to relieve the board of C.I.E. of the obligation to maintain unused canals in navigable condition but they must still maintain them for the purpose of drainage and the prevention of <Col N="1597" /> flooding.  They already possess the necessary powers to terminate any canal service.</P>
      <P>The board is also being relieved of various obligations including the common carrier obligations which have heretofore restricted the commercial adaptability of the undertaking.  I want the House to appreciate the significance of that step.  The board will be empowered to quote one merchant a lower rate for carrying all his traffic than they quote another merchant for the carriage of only part of his traffic in the same goods.  It will be able to make bargains with individual merchants. The board will be able to utilise that freedom from these common carrier obligations in whatever way they think practicable to attract trade back to the C.I.E. railway services.</P>
      <P>Whatever justification there was for the imposition of these regulations on the railway undertakings of the past, and that justification was obvious when the railways were the only practicable method by which substantial quantities of goods could be conveyed over long distances, they have been undermined by the development of private road transport since then.  It is hoped that by giving C.I.E. that commercial adaptability it will be helped to stem the loss of traffic from the railways and, even, to win back some of the traffic they have lost previously.</P>
      <P>The proposed legislation will also relieve C.I.E. of considerable financial liabilities.  The 3 per cent.  Transport Stock, 1955-60, amounting to almost £10,000,000 will become a Government loan.  The interest thereon and the repayment obligation on maturity will become the direct responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  The board are also relieved of the obligation to repay to the Exchequer advances made in 1956 amounting to £1,800,000, advances which were decided upon to enable C.I.E. to undertake its capital expenditure programme of that year and also for the purpose of enabling it to redeem a guaranteed bank overdraft which had been used for capital purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is also made in the Bill for the wiping off of advances amounting to £4,800,000 made to C.I.E. from <Col N="1598" /> the Exchequer up to the 31st March, 1958, to meet interest on Transport Stock which C.I.E. was unable to meet.  In short, liabilities are being wiped off which amount to a total of £16,500,000 and annual interest charges of £632,000.  It may be said that these are only paper reliefs and that C.I.E. could never have met these charges in any case.  That may be true, but these charges are, nevertheless, very real charges which must be met by the taxpayer. As I explained in my statement in November last, this relief should contribute to the improvement of the morale of the whole organisation by giving it a financial structure which is realistic and financial obligations which they can hope, in favourable circumstances, to meet in full.</P>
    <P>It cannot be expected that any reorganisation measures or release from financial obligations such as I have mentioned could enable the board of C.I.E. to achieve solvency immediately. Indeed, the Bill envisages that the board will not have reached that situation for five years.  I know that at the present time there are few railway systems in the world which are not losing money and that in expecting the board of C.I.E. to achieve solvency it may be said that we are asking them to do something that other railway executives are not able to do even under more favourable circumstances.</P>
    <P>That may be true, but we must not allow the experience of other countries to lead us into slovenly thinking or relaxation of effort to improve the position of C.I.E.  We have to decide policy in this matter solely in relation to our own circumstances and it is obviously necessary that we should try to put our public transport undertaking on a solvent basis and so relieve the general taxpayer of the necessity of subsidising it by annual subvention.  Those who are concerned to secure the preservation of the railway system of the country must be conscious of the fact that the support of public opinion for that effort will be available only where there is evidence that the system is being worked in an economical and efficient manner and that the prospect of recurring losses will be reduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1599" /> We have decided, however, that for a period of five years financial assistance from the Exchequer will continue to be necessary.  The Bill, therefore, provides for the payment to C.I.E. of a non-repayable grant of £1,000,000 in each of the five years commencing 1st April, 1959.  That figure was determined in the light of estimates submitted by C.I.E., estimates which had regard to their present experience in the operation of their system.  I mentioned that when the G.N.R. Bill effects the transfer to C.I.E. of the part of the G.N.R. undertaking within the State, some review of that figure will be necessary because the obligation to carry on public transport services in the area now served by the G.N.R. will involve financial consequences.</P>
    <P>By that transfer, C.I.E. will be getting a liability rather than an asset, and it will be necessary to put them in a position to carry that liability during this five year period.  It is possible that the subvention of £1,000,000 per year will not be sufficient to close the gap between receipts and outlay in 1959 and 1960, and C.I.E. may have to resort to temporary borrowing to tide them over these years. I would hope, however, that this fixed subvention of £1,000,000 a year for five years will be more than sufficient in the latter years and that C.I.E. will be able to pay off any temporary borrowing incurred in the earlier stages and have something left to carry on with, if complete solvency has not been finally reached by 1964.</P>
    <P>These annual payments must cover all the needs of C.I.E., including payment of interest on their stocks, all outlay other than expenditure on capital account.  The dieselisation of the undertaking is, as the House knows, now nearly completed and it is not anticipated that any further substantial capital expenditure will be required during that period.  Any capital outlay which may prove to be unavoidable, necessary or desirable should properly be financed by another stock issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> Under the Bill, compensation is provided for staffs who suffer a worsening of their conditions or lose their employment as a consequence of the termination of their service, either on the railway or canal service, or as a consequence of the substitution of dieselisation for steam traction.  The provisions of the Bill in that regard correspond with those of the Acts of 1950 and 1955, with some important modifications.</P>
    <P>The current scales of railway compensation date from the Railways Act of 1924.  They are, by any comparable standards, very generous.  The generosity of the scales of compensation are, to my knowledge, unparalleled anywhere else, providing, as they do, for maximum compensation for life at a rate equivalent to two-thirds of the employee's remuneration at the time his employment terminates.  I think the origin of these scales lies in the fact that, in 1924, it was not foreseen that any widespread redundancy would ever arise on the railways and, no doubt, it was thought well then to deal very generously with the few cases of redundancy which might prove to be unavoidable.</P>
    <P>This problem of the loss of traffic from the railways to the roads, the rapid emergence of private lorry transport, had not arisen in 1924 when these scales were being fixed.  Moreover, these earlier Acts placed the obligation to pay compensation on the privately owned railway companies at the time, whose ability to pay it depended on their solvency.  The security of the compensation payment rested solely upon the ability of the recipients' former employers to find the money.  Under this Bill, however, the responsibility for compensation in respect of future redundancy is being transferred to the Exchequer and will become a charge on the taxpayers of the country.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Government do not feel, in the light of the recommendations in the report of the inquiry, that they would be justified in effecting any substantial reduction in the scales of compensation to, say, the level of compensation that would be payable in similar circumstances in <Col N="1601" /> the public service.  The Government do feel it is necessary to remove certain anomalies.  It seems to us difficult to justify a situation in which a man receives compensation, at a level as high as two-thirds of his remuneration when working, for the whole of his life when, if he had never become redundant, he would have gone on pension not later than 65 years of age at a much lower figure.  It seems to us to be appropriate that compensation for loss of employment should apply only over the years of potential employment and that compensation thereafter should be at a lower figure in respect of the pension which the worker could then have reasonably expected.</P>
    <P>When speaking here previously, I indicated that the intention was to provide that a redundant worker receiving compensation under the Act would, at the age of 65, become qualified to obtain the maximum retirement pension for which he would have qualified if he had continued in employment until that age.  That did not prove to be practical and the provision in this Bill is that at the age of 65 the compensation pension will be reduced, by basing it upon one-eightieth of the annual remuneration for each year of service instead of one-sixtieth.  That is not the same as reducing it to the maximum retirement pension which a worker would secure who had remained in employment.  It is, indeed, more advantageous to the worker in receipt of the redundancy compensation pension. On that basis, the maximum compensation will be reduced from two-thirds of the remuneration of the worker when earning, to one half of that remuneration at the age of 65.</P>
    <P>Civil servants and Army pensioners who may be employed after their retirement, by public authorities, are liable to have their pensions abated in respect of the remunerations they draw from that employment.  It is considered to be equitable that that principle should be applied also to persons drawing railway compensation, especially now that the cost of those pensions will have to be met by the taxpayers of the country as a whole.  It is provided, therefore, in the Bill that compensation pensions will be abated <Col N="1602" /> while the recipient is in the employment of a Government Department, of a State sponsored body or of a local authority.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recollect that, in the course of my statement last year in replying to the debate upon the Supplementary Estimate for C.I.E., I drew attention to the findings of the committee on the subject of staff redundancy in C.I.E.  I pointed out that this was a matter primarily for the trade unions catering for railway workers, who would have to reconcile the somewhat conflicting aims&mdash;first, of making the employment of their members engaged in railways operation more secure than it now seems to be and, secondly, keeping the maximum number in employment.</P>
    <P>I suggested then that the trade unions and the management of C.I.E. should get together for the purpose of working out what the minimum staff needs of an efficient railway organisation are and should consider what alterations in rules or working methods might be made or what other measures might be adopted to bring the staff down to the minimum required for efficient operation and thus to make more secure the whole future of the railway undertaking and particularly the employment of those who will continue to be engaged in railway working.</P>
    <P>I indicated that I was prepared to consider what I called &ldquo;a package deal&rdquo; under which, in consideration of the prospect of improving the cost of railway operation and in order to facilitate the carrying out of any agreement that might be made between the trade unions representing the railway workers and the board of C.I.E., I would consider the extension of the compensation provisions and arrangements set out in this Bill, or even the institution of new compensation arrangements which would ensure that the reduction of the number employed in railway work would not cause hardships.</P>
    <P>As I have explained, the legislation provides for the payment of compensation, where workers are made redundant by reason of the termination of a service or the introduction of the <Col N="1603" /> diesel locomotives but the situation I had in mind was one where redundancy might arise by reason of the introduction of new working methods, even if there were no termination of a service or closing of a line or a station. Later on, I asked the chairman of C.I.E. to discuss that matter with the trade unions and to seek their agreement to a programme of reorganisation which could be submitted to me with proposals for the necessary extension of the redundancy provisions to facilitate it.</P>
    <P>Yesterday morning, I had discussions with the representatives of the Provisional United Trade Union Organisation, at which that question was again raised.  No agreement of that kind has yet been arranged and it is even difficult to see the emergence of the machinery which would facilitate its negotiation.  There is a large number of unions catering for railway workers and it is, perhaps, understandable that in a matter of this kind which may vitally affect the interests of their members, none of them likes to delegate authority to a small negotiating committee.  Nevertheless, it is obvious that the matter cannot be taken further unless some effective negotiating machinery is brought into being.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that some agreement would have been reached before the Dáil would be dealing with this Bill in Committee, in which case I contemplated bringing in by way of an amendment a provision of the kind I have indicated.  Having regard to these practical difficulties, and even assuming all the goodwill in the world, that may not prove to be feasible. Even if there were agreement in principle to seek such an agreement, I think I would be prepared to produce such an amendment, although the amendment would be such as to make it clear that the extended compensation provisions would apply only in respect of redundancy arising out of the application of an agreement which had been negotiated between the board and the unions representing their workers.  There may be some development in that connection <Col N="1604" /> between now and the Committee Stage or some of the later stages of the Bill &mdash;in which case I will inform the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I should point out in this connection that for those who will be affected by the reduction in railway employment&mdash;which I am sure all of us feel will be inevitable sooner or later, for one reason or another&mdash;it could well be to their advantage to avail themselves of the compensation provisions which will apply to those losing their employment over the next five years. Having regard to the heavy cost to an already overburdened Exchequer which may be entailed by the present rates of compensation, I think I should make it clear that no guarantee can be given now that any compensation provisions which may be introduced after the lapse of the five-year period contemplated in this Bill to replace those in the Bill will be either as extensive or as generous as those we are now considering.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill to give effect to the recommendation of the committee of inquiry for the prescription of minimum fines and for the non-application of the Probation of Offenders Act in respect of second and subsequent conviction for breaches of the Road Transport Acts.  Most Deputies are aware that our transport problem is being accentuated and complicated by the fact that we have not yet been able to devise means to make the restrictions of the Road Transport Acts fully effective.  There is a great deal of what is called &ldquo;illegal haulage&rdquo; going on&mdash;business being stolen from the public transport operators by persons who are not authorised in law to carry goods for reward.  There are proposals in this Bill which are intended to try to strengthen further the measures applied to secure the end which the Dáil had in mind when the Road Transport Acts were passed and if any Deputies have suggestions to make in that regard, which would be effective and equitable, then I am prepared to consider them.</P>
    <P>Opportunity is also being taken to carry out some amendments to both the Railways Acts and the Road Transport Acts to facilitate administration of the operation of the railways.  These are <Col N="1605" /> matters which could, perhaps, be more usefully discussed on the Committee Stage debate.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, when speaking here in November last, the policy of the Government in broad terms is to maintain a publicly-owned transport undertaking, State wide in its operations, for both freight and passengers. We believe that both social and economic considerations require a decision against leaving the availability of public transport facilities for freight or for passengers to a number of private operators.  We recognise, however, that the public mind is disturbed by the continued record of losses of the existing publicly-owned transport undertaking and that there is an obligation on the Government and the Dáil to enact legislation which will help and encourage those who are concerned with the operation of that undertaking to minimise these losses and eventually to eliminate them. That is one of the primary purposes of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The problem of C.I.E. is, of course, a railway problem and the Government reached the decision that we must try to preserve railways as an integral part of the national transport system.  The aim of the policy measures upon which we decided and which this Bill is framed to implement, and indeed of any other measures which may be taken from time to time, will be to make effective, so far as it can be done, that decision to maintain railways as an integral part of the national transport system by reducing the gap between the revenue earned on railway operation and the cost of operation and thereby to make the whole of the national transport undertaking capable of paying its way.  We have in this Bill made a contribution towards the reduction of that gap by the elimination of substantial capital obligations from the C.I.E. balance sheet and by the proposal to make available an annual non-repayable Grant-in-Aid of £1,000,000 per year for five years.  But these measures alone will not be sufficient to close the gap. They must be supplemented by the expansion of revenues through the attraction of additional trade and the <Col N="1606" /> reduction to the maximum possible extent of the operating costs.</P>
    <P>I should not like to be taken as suggesting that this Bill provides all the answers to our transport problem or that it is certain to be effective in achieving these policy aims that I have outlined.  But it seems to us the best that can be devised in present circumstances and, in devising it, we have had the very valuable report of the Committee of Inquiry on Internal Transport which did, I think, help to explain to our people and to Deputies the nature of the transport problem confronting us.  I can say, however, that if any Deputy has an idea to put forward, which would facilitate us in achieving the policy aims I have stated, that idea will be very, very welcome if it proves to be practicable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It would, I think, be correct to describe the measure before the House as another chapter in the long, melancholy story of public transport since the establishment of the State.  The announcement of the huge sums which will be written off or transferred to the Exchequer under the proposal before the House, while it will come as no surprise, will act as a sharp reminder of the serious situation which has continued without interruption for decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill in so far as it proposes to reorganise transport services is based on the recommendations of the Beddy Commission.  While the Minister has dealt at some length, both in introducing this measure and also in the Supplementary Estimate which was considered in November last, with various aspects of the transport problem, nevertheless there will be considerable disappointment that no indication has been given of the steps C.I.E. propose to take to try to bridge the gap between revenue and expenditure.  The committee which reported on this matter dealt exhaustively with the problem from almost every angle and, while numerous suggestions have been made by different organisations and we here in the House have discussed the problem on a number of occasions, it must be recognised that neither the Government nor the Dáil can run a <Col N="1607" /> transport company.  We can offer suggestions as to improvements or changes which are considered desirable or, on the other hand, express criticism of the policy being operated.  This measure does afford an opportunity of trying, once again, to get agreement on a policy that will eliminate or reduce the losses that have been such a continuous feature of public transport. In that connection, I was interested in the Minister's concluding remarks where he said that the Government accepted the view that the railways had to be maintained as an integral part of the transport system.</P>
    <P>Reading this report and examining the figures published in a number of tables in that report, it is obvious that many of the difficulties arise from the attempt made over the years to maintain a railway service built for conditions and circumstances which no longer exist.  Since the establishment of the railway system, conditions and circumstances have altered radically. It is pointed out in the course of this report, at paragraph 384, that in the construction of our railways regard was had to the size of our population in the middle of the 19th century and that since then there have been fewer people for railways to serve since the population has fallen since 1861 by one-third and the rural population has been halved.  It goes on to say that this is contrary to the experience in every other country in Western Europe.  While it is true to say that no other country has abandoned the railway service&mdash;and I do not suggest that we should&mdash;nevertheless, C.I.E. over the years, has endeavoured to maintain a service in conditions and circumstances which are entirely different from those which existed when the railways were built.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the course of the inquiry to the feeder service provided by C.I.E. road transport to railheads and the efforts made to bring custom to the railway by means of that service.  The figures given in the course of the report indicate that, certainly for live stock, which is one of the big users, conditions have altered very much and that they have even altered <Col N="1608" /> since the end of the emergency.  During the emergency, and even for some time after the emergency ended, no alternative transport was available but, since then, with the exception of long hauls, the tendency has been, with the establishment of marts throughout the country, and even in the case of fairs, for live stock to be brought by road.  Anyone familiar with the requirements of that particular trade will agree that it is a much more satisfactory system.  With the exception of long hauls or occasional large fairs in particular centres, from every point of view, the efficient and the economic method of transporting live stock is by road.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, unrealistic for C.I.E. to try to maintain a system which was satisfactory in other circumstances and at a time when road transport was not available.  It is quite true that, prior to the advent of road transport, there was no other system available and farmers and live-stock traders had to use the railways but, with the advent of road transport, conditions changed and, in view of the losses involved in handling, and so forth, nobody will revert to the old system.</P>
    <P>What appears to me as being the dilemma of public transport and, to some extent, the dilemma of Governments over the years, is the effort to maintain a railway system, certainly railway services in parts of the country, in the altered conditions of the present day.  As far as one can gather, it was the view of the committee which reported on this matter that it will not be possible in future to maintain such a system, except at the cost of a State subsidy or State subvention of some form or another.</P>
    <P>There is in Section 6 of this Bill a general directive which defines the duties of the board.  It goes on to say in sub-section (2) that, taking everything into account, it is proposed that not later than 31st March, 1964, the operating expenditure, including all charges properly chargeable to revenue, shall not be greater than the revenue of the board.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his introductory speech, referred to the fact that the amalgamation of the <Col N="1609" /> portion of the G.N.R. which runs within the State and C.I.E. will take effect later this year and he said it may mean an amendment of this Bill, changing the subvention and certain other matters.  It is somewhat difficult in a discussion of this kind to deal with the problem when an amending Bill is contemplated in the next few weeks and when, instead of an annual sum of £1,000,000, we may be dealing with a greater sum.  What this Bill does say is that, allowing for whatever changes C.I.E. propose to make, taking the liability which has been removed in respect of the sums that have been written off and the transfer of the 3 per cent.  Transport Stock of 1955-60 to the Exchequer, deeming it as a Government loan, and the transfer to the Minister for Finance of the annual interest charges of something over £600,000 a year, over and above these charges, the loss which C.I.E. expects to make will not be more than £1,000,000 a year, that is, to provide them with money for capital purposes and also for any other contingencies which may arise.  That, in itself, is a formidable sum.</P>
    <P>We have, over the years, become accustomed to dealing in large sums so far as transport losses are concerned, but I think there will be general disappointment that there has been no indication from the Minister's speech of what reorganisation internally in the transport company or what changes in policy are anticipated or in course of being implemented which will reduce or eliminate the present heavy losses.  It is true that C.I.E. have been faced with a difficult problem, if not an impossible one.  On the one hand, there is an obligation on them to maintain services because, up to now, of common carrier and other obligations, an obligation to maintain a railway service in conditions which make it difficult, if not impossible, to do so and, on the other hand, the difficulty of competing with private transport undertakings.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that conditions and circumstances have altered substantially since the railways were established, that it is impossible, even if it were desirable from some points of <Col N="1610" /> view to put back the clock.  Therefore, the suggestion which C.I.E. made in their submissions to the committee of inquiry and to the Minister, and which were repeated in a number of reports, that there should be a restriction on private transport, is unrealistic.  We might as well suggest that we should go back to horses and traps.  There may be some advantages but a pattern of transport has developed, and the indications are that the users of road transport, particularly traders dealing in perishable commodities and live-stock hauliers, recognise it as a more efficient and more satisfactory system to operate.  Once the obligation of common carrier is removed from C.I.E., C.I.E. will then be in a position to operate on a commercial basis in so far as they will be able to charge competitive or preferential rates to different traders.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that they would be in a position to quote different terms and to make bargains with merchants and traders and that it was hoped in this way to attract custom or to stem the loss of traffic.  In that connection, there is a need for some right of appeal or some tribunal to which traders can go if they feel there is unfair discrimination against them. The present-day conditions do not warrant the retention of the obligation and it is obvious that in present circumstances it is unduly onerous. However, once it is removed, the way will be clear for discriminatory treatment. That discrimination may mean the ordinary commercial practice of offering a trader better terms, on the understanding that he gives all the traffic to C.I.E., but there is another aspect of the question which should be considered.  If a large trader is given preferential terms as against smaller traders who trade in the same goods and who are competing with him, it might operate to the detriment of those traders, and, unless those traders are allowed to operate their own transport or have available to them an alternative system, it would, I think, be contrary to the public interest to allow preferential treatment to go to the extent of discriminating unfairly or unjustly against a <Col N="1611" /> number of smaller traders.  The provision of some sort of appeal or review, should the necessity arise, might be considered between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced&mdash;and it is included in the Bill&mdash;that it is proposed to relieve C.I.E. of the obligation to provide a road service where they discontinue an existing rail service.  In that connection, some changes should be made in the present conditions under which licensed hauliers are allowed to operate.  At present, licences are granted under the 1933 Act and weights, and so on, have altered very much since that time. Over the past 25 years, there have been very great changes and conditions which were regarded as normal in 1933 no longer exist, and there ought to be some adjustment of the conditions under which merchandise licences are granted.</P>
    <P>The restrictions about unladen weight or the maximum weight at present bear no relation to modern lorries or modern requirements.  Some more flexible system should be adopted which would permit an extension of the maximum unladen weight.  These matters probably could be more properly discussed on Committee Stage, but undoubtedly the present restrictions and requirements which date from the 1933 Act bear little relation to the type of lorries in use and available at present.</P>
    <P>When it was announced that this measure would be introduced, I think it was generally understood that there would be no alteration in transport policy before the discussion on this Bill took place.  Public opinion undoubtedly has been greatly perturbed, not now but over the years, by the continuing heavy losses made by C.I.E. and the recent announcement by the company that it was proposed to increase bus fares and freights from Monday next, 12th May, was especially resented, particularly as the announcement was made on the eve of this discussion.  In anticipation of that discussion and in view of the promised reorganisation which it was understood <Col N="1612" /> would be the subject of debate here, the increases in fares and freights have created a good deal of ill-feeling.</P>
    <P>One of the essential requirements for a satisfactory transport system is public goodwill.  For a number of reasons, C.I.E., not through any fault of their own staff, whom Deputies on all sides of the House find courteous, considerate and helpful when changes are suggested, but through some lack of liaison with the public, lack goodwill and understanding. As I said earlier, neither the Government nor a Minister can run a transport undertaking, but repeatedly criticism of C.I.E. is expressed through lack of knowledge and information.  If C.I.E. took the public into its confidence and explained the necessity for certain changes, or for a particular line of policy, it would do a great deal to secure goodwill and understanding.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that if people have only one side of the story, views will be expressed which might not be expressed if they had the whole story. Therefore, the recent announcement that fares were to be raised on the eve of this discussion came as a great shock to the general public and the decision to drop the special fares applicable to school-going children is particularly harsh.  It is well known from the figures of bus receipts published periodically that the suburban services are paying.  It was therefore a shock to the people that the increases which were announced were so steep and more especially, as I say, that this change in regard to school children was made.  So far, it has not been possible to get the amount of revenue which it is proposed to secure from the abolition of these school children's fares.</P>
    <P>I think it is right to say this, that while other transport users, adults, business people and even people travelling for pleasure may have&mdash;or some of them may have&mdash;alternative means of transport, or may be able to reduce the number of their journeys or postpone them, in the case of school children, no alternative form of transport is available.  Some of them are either too young or are travelling in places in which it is dangerous for <Col N="1613" /> them to be left alone and unattended. While some children may use bicycles or other forms of transport, the vast majority have no other means of transport available to them.  They must go to school and they must use the public transport system.  Therefore, it is quite unfair that this facility which was available to them should be abolished.</P>
    <P>I think also that we ought to be given an indication of the proposed amount which it is expected to secure, and the actual contribution to the total budget of C.I.E., which will be made by users of the suburban services.  As I said, much of the criticism expressed against C.I.E. would be eliminated if the company had a better public relations system.  Whenever suggestions are made to the company for improved services, I find they are met with the utmost consideration and receive every attention with a view to seeing if the suggestions can be accepted or met in any way, but that is only one aspect of the problem, where a group of people in an area have a suggestion to make and get a Deputy or other public representative to make it for them.  The vast majority of the users of public transport, who accept the service as it is, and who, because of preoccupation with their own affairs, do not make any recommendations or suggestions as to how better and more useful services could be provided, express their view in the way in which they meet whatever changes are made. Alternatively, it is expressed when they see an announcement of the losses, such as the Minister made this morning, or which are periodically announced at sittings of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>It was a disappointment that we did not get an indication from the Minister of what the proposed reorganisation, foreshadowed by the company, is and I hope the Minister will give us that indication before the Second Reading is passed.  So far, the changes, to some extent, have been merely bookkeeping ones, a transfer of a liability which C.I.E. itself could never meet, to the Exchequer, which, in the long run, had to meet it any way.  There is some merit in putting into the Bill a fixed <Col N="1614" /> sum.  Over the years, we have all had experience of Government announcements, on a few occasions, that there would be no subsidy for C.I.E.  Both this Government and the previous Government announced that decision. Then, in a short time, C.I.E. have to approach the Department of Industry and Commerce and they get embattled with it.  Subsequently, the Department of Industry and Commerce get embattled with the Department of Finance and finally, the three of them, the two Departments and C.I.E., agree on a figure which is presented to the Dáil and it is passed covering either one year's or two years' losses.</P>
    <P>If a figure is put in the Bill it, at any rate, sets a headline, but in the absence of an indication from the Minister of what changes the company itself proposes, and what increased traffic it is proposed to attract, it is impossible to view this measure as setting an end to the losses which will be made by the company.  There is no evidence from any quarter that the company will attract increased traffic. Experience over the years indicates that the contrary will be the case; that, in fact, the difficulty is to hold the traffic it has, rather than anticipate any increase in traffic because if C.I.E. gets the contract for some specific commodity, it is more than offset by losses on other fronts.  It is, therefore, disappointing to the Dáil, and to the country, that we have not been given a better indication of the proposed reorganisation which, in turn, would offer better hopes for a more satisfactory outcome for the future.</P>

The number of rights awarded to any of the successful claimants was calculated on portion only of their holdings.  The exact areas in respect of which rights were granted were never defined on a map and considerable difficulty would now be involved in ascertaining conclusively the exact areas in respect of which grazing rights were granted. Sales and sublettings of many lands are involved, which sales and sublettings have taken in areas in respect of which no grazing rights were allowed.  I think that excerpt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has listened to the Second Reading of another Transport Bill, but, unlike many of its noted predecessors, this Bill was introduced in rather muted tones this morning by the Minister.  I have sat in this House for more than 30 years and have listened to various Transport Bills being introduced.  Practically every one of them was recommended to the House and the country as being specially designed to put our transport services on their economic feet and to provide a cheap and efficient transport service for the public.  Notwithstanding these glowing testimonials to the efficacy of the contemplated legislation, the House has been troubled, within a matter of a few years, with a fresh Transport Bill designed to patch up the deficiencies in the previous legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day, 34 years after we passed the 1924 Transport Act&mdash;which was to remedy our transport difficulties for all time&mdash;we find our national transport undertaking with a greater deficit than at any previous period.  We find its <Col N="1630" /> reputation in the public mind substantially lower than it has been for quite a long time.  It is quite clear that the longer we live, the more we learn.  The Minister's speech to-day was noteworthy for the absence of many of the flowery recommendations which he gave to the 1944 Transport Bill when introducing it here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave said this Bill was another chapter in the history of our transport undertaking.  In fact, it is something more than another chapter or another saga of our transport activities: it is another surgical operation on C.I.E. and it is deliberately intended to be so.  This Bill, as well as being a surgical operation, provides for a financial transfusion, in the hope that C.I.E. can be saved by both financial transfusion and surgical operation.</P>
    <P>What are we doing under this Bill? It is well known that C.I.E. has on the market 3 per cent.  Transport Stock running to the amount of £10,000,000, that it is liable to redeem the stock and it is liable to pay the interest on the stock.  In fact, C.I.E. have never been able to pay interest on the stock, because their financial position did not permit them to do so, with the result that each year they had to borrow money from the Exchequer to pay that interest.  Then, having paid the interest on the stock, they also had to pay the Exchequer interest on the money which they borrowed in order to pay the interest on the stock.  That situation has continued for a number of years.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, C.I.E. will be exempt, not only from paying the principal of the £10,000,000 which it raised on the public stock market but it will be exempt from paying the interest on the stock and on the moneys which it has borrowed, and which amount in the aggregate to between £6,000,000 and £8,000,000.  The slate is being wiped clean in respect to those liabilities.  What we are doing is nothing more than realising that C.I.E. never has been able to pay any of its debts under those heads.</P>
    <P>Those who have looked at the situation closely or discussed it with C.I.E. <Col N="1631" /> never imagined, in their wildest moments, that these moneys could or would be repaid by C.I.E., If we discuss this matter with C.I.E., we find they never regarded this as a liability for which they could be held responsible; they never regarded it as a liability over which they would display any ecstatic joy in liquidating.  They merely said: &ldquo;Well, those figures are there; we know all about them.&rdquo;  They knew they had no money to pay and, far from being able to pay those debts, their problem was to find out who would lend them more money.  Their problem was not to find out whom they would pay back first and in what amounts they would pay back: the problem of C.I.E. down through the years has been to find out whether they can get money from banks or finance houses or from the Exchequer, but the notion of ever paying back a pound out of the £15,000,000 or £16,000,000 was never a realistic notion on their part.  They never believed they would be asked to pay it back and they never bothered, when you reminded them they owed it; because they realised their financial position was such that they never had a chance of paying back the money.</P>
    <P>Now we are simply recognising that those are bad debts and that C.I.E. cannot repay them.  We are wiping those debts out and saying they are State responsibility henceforth.  The State will meet those liabilities, thereby wiping the slate clean and giving C.I.E. a new chance to make good economically, in the hope that this may be the last occasion on which it will require a financial transfusion.</P>
    <P>I agree that C.I.E. has not been its own best friend.  It has not been able to build up for itself a high reputation in the public mind.  That is regrettable. Our transport services to-day, especially in our circumstances, have undergone transformations which have made them better than they have ever been before; yet at the same time, C.I.E. has not been able to establish for itself a high reputation in the public mind. I think C.I.E. ought to have done something to try to popularise itself. It is essential for a national transport undertaking such as C.I.E. to carry with it public goodwill.  C.I.E. does <Col N="1632" /> not appear ever to have worried about public goodwill and some of the things it has done, and some of the things it refused to do, have had the cumulative effect of establishing in the public mind towards C.I.E. a rather hostile and cynical attitude.</P>
    <P>For example, C.I.E. has stubbornly refused to introduce workmen's fares, though these are a common feature of transport undertakings in various countries.  I know they will give you a long memorandum stating reasons why that cannot be done.  It should not be an insuperable difficulty to introduce workmen's fares.  Even though it might cause some trouble, it is nevertheless desirable that C.I.E. should build up some good reputation, from a business point of view, with the travelling public.  Efforts have been made, for example, to get C.I.E. to provide cheap fares for old age pensioners.  C.I.E. will give reasons galore, more reasons than there are old age pensioners, as to why that cannot be done.  It is not an insurmountable difficulty, but C.I.E. are not concerned, and exceptions of this kind do not apparently make any great appeal to C.I.E. administration.</P>
    <P>Recently, in Dublin, C.I.E. announced that they intended to withdraw the cheap fare available to children going home from school to lunch.  I do not know anything more calculated to engender a feeling of hostility and bitterness towards C.I.E. than a petty economy of that kind. It cannot cost C.I.E. an enormous sum of money to transport school children at a reduced fare during the day time. Yet, C.I.E. have abolished the fare.</P>
    <P>They have done that in this City of Dublin where an examination of their accounts&mdash;certainly an examination of their accounts up to 1956&mdash;will show that in that year they probably made close on £500,000 on Dublin bus services alone.  It may be that that profit is not there now because of the wage increases; but the increased fares which C.I.E. will exact from the travelling public whenever it is compelled to meet increased wages will, I have no doubt, readjust the balance and show that the Dublin bus services <Col N="1633" /> operate, as do the provincial bus services also, at a substantial profit.</P>
    <P>Of course, the profits made on the Dublin bus services and the profits made on the provincial bus services, together with the profits made on the road freight department, are ploughed back into the losing railway sections. In addition, it has been found necessary to stop the haemorrhage there by putting in a State subsidy of £1,000,000, or more, to keep the whole organisation in balance.  It is unfair that the privilege of a cheap mid-day fare going to and from school, hitherto enjoyed by school-going children in Dublin or elsewhere, should now be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. has not a problem worth thinking about if the problem is capable of solution by resort to a device of that kind, which, as I said earlier, is just a petty economy.  It does harm to the reputation of C.I.E. and it is a pity they would not be sufficiently alert to and aware of the tempo of public opinion <i>vis-a-vis</i> C.I.E. and manage to avoid resort to devices of that irritating character.</P>
    <P>The main problem confronting C.I.E., of course, is the problem of competitors.  There would be no transport problem for C.I.E. and no financial problem if we had on the roads our 1939 complement of motor cars and motor lorries.  If we had no more lorries or motor cars on the road than we had in 1939, C.I.E. would have no transport problem.  The problem is caused because the number of lorries has increased five-fold since 1939 and the number of motor cars has increased considerably, too.  Of course, illegal haulage is now indistinguishable from legal haulage, so far as freight is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is because of these factors&mdash; increasing lorry traffic, the increase in the number of private motor cars and illegal haulage by people with lorries, inside and outside this portion of the country&mdash;that C.I.E. have been faced with these difficulties which press so acutely upon them.  C.I.E. are crying to the moon, if they think that, in world conditions to-day, they can restrict lorry development in the way in which they urged it should be restricted <Col N="1634" /> in the evidence which they gave before the Committee of Inquiry into Internal Transport.  The lorry has come to stay and it is being unrealistic to imagine that lorries can be exterminated, as if they were a national pest.</P>
    <P>It is there that C.I.E. fails to take cognisance of what is really a public demand and a public requirement. These lorries do not float in here. They do not come in as unsolicited gifts.  They were ordered and purchased and brought in by business men and others for use in their transport service.  They do not drive themselves.  People have to be employed to drive them.  To that extent, they give employment.  If C.I.E. could be got to realise the fact that lorries have come to stay and endeavour to ensure that those who compete should compete on fair terms, then the situation might be capable of being remedied.</P>
    <P>Of course, C.I.E. is not permitted to compete with the lorry on fair terms. The drivers of these lorries engaged in illegal haulage are employed from six o'clock in the morning until 12 o'clock at night.  The law is frequently broken by these lorries hauling cattle illegally to and from fairs. C.I.E. cannot employ people from six o'clock in the morning until 12 o'clock at night; neither can C.I.E. put its transport on the road in the condition in which some of these privately owned lorries are.  C.I.E. must conform to certain standards and respect the obligation imposed by the Road Transport Act as to the hours for which people can be employed.  To that extent, they are put in a seriously disadvantageous position as compared with the private haulier.</P>
    <P>Sanity will come back into our transport system if we can manage to get some reasonable balance between the conditions in which the railways operate, on the one hand, and the road freight system, on the other.  C.I.E. has a monopoly, if you like, as far as the transport of passengers by bus and train is concerned.  They have not a monopoly, of course, of all passenger traffic because every new motor car seriously indents on the traffic C.I.E. <Col N="1635" /> would otherwise get.  Its financial position would be very much better if we only had on our roads to-day the same number of private cars as operated in 1938.  In my view, the lorry has come to stay.</P>
    <P>Sanity in transport depends upon our ability to get an equitable balance in the conditions under which railways operate, on the one hand, and road freight traffic under private ownership, on the other.  We could make a start in that direction, without imposing any great hardships on anybody who has invested his money in road transport services.  Eight, ten and 12-wheel privately owned trucks are now a common sight on the roads, carrying commodities which could quite easily be carried by C.I.E.  It is almost impossible to pass one of these trucks, unless the driver is unusually gracious.  You find these very heavy lorries on roads travelling almost side by side with and within sight of a goods train which is half empty.  It ought to be possible, with the new powers given to C.I.E. under the Bill, to arrange that these goods will be carried by C.I.E.</P>
    <P>At all events, I do not think we would impose any great hardship on those using these large vehicles by saying that, while they can continue to use what is there at the moment, after a certain period of years, they will not be allowed to import any new lorries of that kind.  It seems absurd to buy lorries longer than this Chamber from countries exporting them here, to compete with the publicly-subsidised transport service, at a time when that service is starved, not for the means of transporting goods, but for the goods to transport.  I do not think we would cause any serious hardship to anybody if the very heavy road traffic of that kind were restricted. It would give C.I.E. a chance of obtaining that traffic for transport by rail.  It would also save the public a considerable sum of money, because these huge lorries must inevitably do considerable damage to roads, particularly to sections of roads over which they constantly travel.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> Ratepayers and motor users pay a substantial sum for the maintenance of roads, but the biggest damage of all is done by those very heavy lorries, even though I concede they pay a greater rate of road tax than the smaller vehicles.  The damage these heavy vehicles do, particularly when they get off the main roads on to the side roads, is completely disproportionate to the amount of road tax they pay.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with compensation for people who may be affected by the future operations of C.I.E. and the curtailment of their services.  I notice, for example, level crossings are to be modernised.  Though I do not know what this means, I assume it means that, as in other countries, there will be some mechanical device for operating level crossings in the same way as traffic lights are operated in the city, and that these crossings will be automatically controlled.  Traffic will be prohibited from crossing them at certain times and then the barrier against the road user will be removed when danger has passed.  There are quite a number of people employed as level crossing keepers and, as far as I understand it, there is no provision in the Bill for compensating those persons, in the event of level crossings being converted to automatic working. We can come back to this on Committee Stage, but I should like the Minister to look at the matter in the meantime, because, I presume, it is hardly intended to displace those keepers without giving them compensation.</P>
    <P>On the general question of compensation, I think this Bill marks a substantial step back, and that railway workers who are redundant under this Bill, who will lose their employment, will in future get compensation which is distinctly less favourable than the basis of that compensation to-day.  It is provided in the Bill that a person who is redundant, and who loses employment in consequence thereof, will get a pension under the terms provided in the Bill.  These terms provide, however, that when a person reaches the age of 65 years, the pension, for some unknown reason, will be reduced <Col N="1637" /> by 25 per cent.  In other words, a person who is 50 years of age, who is told he is redundant and must go, gets a pension which will be less than his pay.  He will suffer the loss of the difference between his pay and pension until he is 65 years of age, and then he will suffer another reduction of 25 per cent. on the amount of his pension.</P>
    <P>The Minister said a person would get, under redundancy, something at 65 years of age which he would not get if he retired in the ordinary way. That remark of the Minister can have no validity, so far as the salaried staff are concerned, because a person retiring at 65 years of age from C.I.E. in the ordinary way would get a pension appropriate to his service at that age.</P>
    <P>I want to know why it is proposed at this stage to interfere with the whole basis of pensions which was inserted in the 1924 Act.  The pensions provisions in the 1924 Act were inserted as a result of a hard and tough fight on the floor of this House by the Labour Party, and were the result of Labour Party pressure.  The Dáil Reports of the period confirm that without question, and those provisions have remained in our transport compensation legislation since 1924.  In other words, they have withstood the test of equity over the past 34 years, but now, for the first time in 34 years, these pension provisions are being worsened.  Railway workers who will be redundant under this Bill will get less compensation than they would if the 1924 pensions provisions were fully operated.  I think that is unfair.</P>
    <P>It is not just sufficient for the Minister to say that, in future, the taxpayers will have to pay the compensation involved.  The taxpayer is not entitled to dismiss people from their jobs, jobs in which they have served for many years, unless these people get reasonable compensation.  It is an inhuman and brutal thing to say to a person who is 55 or 60 years of age: &ldquo;You must get out of your job to make room for modernised methods of locomotion, modernised methods of transport,&rdquo; unless you are prepared to say to that person: &ldquo;We will give you compensation which will insulate you <Col N="1638" /> against hardship because of the fact that this action is taken in the public interest.&rdquo;  Where action is taken in the public interest in that way, it is only fair that the victim should be adequately compensated for the serious dislocation in his whole life, in his domestic arrangements, and in his ability to meet liabilities to his family which he may have contracted, on the assumption of continued permanent employment.</P>
    <P>It is a petty way of approaching the question of compensation, to say that after 34 years' experience of the 1924 compensation provisions we should now contemplate whittling them away in this manner when a person reaches 65 years of age.  I hope the House, particularly those who sit on the Government Benches, will show some interest in those who will be the victims of the enactment and the operation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another innovation in the Bill which is to the disadvantage of railway workers.  It is provided in the Bill that in order to get compensation, the event leading to redundancy must take place within five years of the passing of the Act. In other words, one must be discovered to be redundant within five years.  If one is discovered to be redundant within six years that is just too bad for one.  The compensation provisions apply only where the person is found to be redundant within five years or where he is a victim of dieselisation within five years, but outside the five-year period there is no protection.  That is another cutting back on the provisions of the 1924 legislation and subsequent Acts based on it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if this Bill is passed and C.I.E. continue to operate branch lines but discover two years hence that a certain line should go, the people on that line will get compensation but if six years hence they discover that that line should go, then there is no compensation as I read this Bill, for the person whose redundancy takes place outside the five-year period.  If C.I.E. get to the stage in which the five-year period is nearing exhaustion and they say that a particular branch line should <Col N="1639" /> be abolished, there is a great temptation to say: &ldquo;Do not do it this year. Leave it over until next year.  If we abolish the branch line next year, that is the sixth year and we shall not have to pay any compensation but we shall have to pay it if we abolish the branch line within the five-year period.&rdquo;  That kind of manipulation ought not to be possible because C.I.E. could push its redundancy proposals to a point at which they could dodge paying compensation if they desired to do so.  I do not say they would deliberately wish to do that but they should be put beyond temptation.  That can be done by eliminating the restrictive character of the compensation clauses in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Again this is a novelty from the point of view of compensation.  This is a restriction which is being imposed for the first time; it is a restriction which ought not to be imposed when the clear purpose of it is to deprive some people of compensation to which they would normally be entitled if this provision were not there and to which they are morally entitled if, in the public interest, they are cast aside to permit of the modernisation of our transport undertaking.</P>
    <P>There is another shortcoming in this measure.  The section dealing with compensation refers to the cessation of train services or the cessation or reduction of canal services or the substitution of diesel for steam traction. However, there is no provision in the Bill for compensation for workers made redundant as a result of reorganisation. If C.I.E. carries out a reorganisation which is not a cessation of a train service or a canal service or is not the substitution of diesel for steam traction, then the victim of the reorganisation whose services are no longer required will receive no compensation under this Bill as I understand it.  He must be caught by the closing of a railway line, the closing of a canal service or by dieselisation. If anything else happens to him and he loses his employment, no compensation is provided for him here.  That is grossly unfair because we are dealing with people who have feelings, <Col N="1640" /> emotions and liabilities which they cannot cast aside, to themselves, to their families and to the whole community. This is an unworthy section of a Bill which purports to grant compensation but which, in fact, imposes some conditions which do violence to all decent conceptions of what reasonable compensation should be.</P>
    <P>There is provision here whereby C.I.E. can close branch lines and canals once they are satisfied that these branch lines and canals are not economic.  I do not think anyone will regret the abolition of the old transport tribunal machinery which was a rather complicated piece of mechanism when the question of the closing of a railway line came up for consideration. At the same time, the switch from that complicated mechanism to a situation in which C.I.E. can do this on their own, without consultation with anybody or without any intimation to anybody, is a revolutionary change. This is a case requiring C.I.E. to give public notice of what they intend to do and consult bodies which might be interested in the consequences which would follow the closing of a railway line.</P>
    <P>For instance, it would not be unreasonable to ask to have imposed on C.I.E. an obligation to consult beforehand with some kind of consultative committee which, I think, would be the most desirable method, or if for any reason that is not possible or practicable, they should be required to consult with such bodies as perhaps the Trade Union Congresses, the Federated Union of Employers or the Federation of Irish Manufacturers.  At all events, some kind of consultation should be imposed upon C.I.E. so that the merits of the case may at least be examined before C.I.E. takes the final decision in the hope that it might be possible by fresh suggestions and by alternative methods to keep open the service on an economic basis.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain they have set up a consultative council which operates for the purpose of the closing of branch lines in Britain&mdash;the Central Consultative Transport Committee I think it is called.  That body is entitled to consider any proposals for <Col N="1641" /> closing, and is empowered to issue an opinion in connection with the closing of a branch line.  While, as I have said, nobody will regret the passing of the transport tribunal machinery, nevertheless, there should be some form of consultation imposed on C.I.E. before they are permitted to close branch lines without regard to other people's needs, and without consultation with other interests which might be vitally affected.</P>
    <P>May I conclude by saying that the kernel of this whole business seems to me to be our ability to find a reasonable balance between road transport and railways and that is not a thing you can do by legislation?  I know you can help to do it by indicating the signposts in legislation and if we can do that we can save C.I.E. from continuing catastrophic losses.  To the extent that we fail to do it, this House will be considering similar legislation when the £5,000,000 provided under this Bill is spent in 1964.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We require some form of legislation to deal with our transport problems and in so far as this legislation endeavours to maintain our railway system in existence, I welcome it.  I think the Beddy Report was a very good one.  Transport conditions in this country were studied and very valuable suggestions were made.  We have a particularly difficult problem now with regard to transport because we have a small population and a widely scattered area to cover.  However, I do feel that this Bill is somewhat generous to C.I.E.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of years, in fact since the establishment of C.I.E., they have had considerable losses, and the cheap and easy transport that was envisaged by the Minister when he originally set up this company has by no means been fulfilled.  Apparently all the debts which have accrued to the extent of £11,000,000, will be wiped out overnight and taken over by the State, and they are to be relieved of their responsibility in connection with the interest on capital charges.  They are to be allowed a sum of £1,000,000 a year over the next five years which seems to be a pretty generous action on the part of the Government.  Perhaps there was no alternative to it; perhaps it was the only way in which they could keep transport alive in this country and, when I say transport, I mean keeping the railway system alive which is such an essential public transport system in any country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister when he says that the railways of practically every country in the world are losing money.  Even France, which appears to have the most efficient railway service in the world and which has a large population, is losing money.  If we are making this generous provision to C.I.E. and giving them more or less <Col N="1643" /> complete control over their own affairs, does it not strike the Minister as possible that we could have the same state of affairs accruing by 1964 as exists now?  It is all very fine to say that we are giving them £1,000,000 a year and that they must keep within the confines of that income.  It has always been envisaged that this company should be run, if not at a profit, at least within the bounds of financial reason.  What is to stop this company from coming back in 1964 in exactly the same financial position as they are in to-day?  I do not think there are sufficient safeguards and controls.</P>
    <P>I have often spoken in this House on private enterprise which I entirely favour, but if we are to pay the debts of this company and give them an allowance of £1,000,000 a year, surely in justification to those who provide the money, the taxpayers, we should have some safeguard at official level whereby expenditure can be controlled or curtailed and whereby the best possible use may be made of the State funds placed at their disposal.  What I mean to convey to the House is that the system heretofore has been that our public transport system has lost money and everybody has said: &ldquo;That is too bad; they should not do that,&rdquo; but, in the final analysis, Dáil Éireann has to vote that money.  We have to do it whether we like it or not, because, if we do not, public transport will not be carried on.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact that under this Bill, they are being given a clean sheet? The House is saying, in effect, if we pass it as it is at present drafted: &ldquo;You have lost all this money but we will forget the past.  We will pay all your debts.  We trust you entirely in the future to manage your own affairs. We give you <i>carte blanche</i> to carry on.&rdquo;  I suggest that there are such large amounts involved that there should be State control in this regard. Whether C.I.E. are to be responsible to a Parliamentary Secretary, or to the Minister himself, I think that is desirable.  If things are not satisfactory, under the authority which they are to be given, whereby they have <Col N="1644" /> the complete right to decide that such and such a line or such and such a waterway shall be closed, nobody has any redress.</P>
    <P>Representations are bound to be made to us.  Representations are continually being made to us now and we make representations to C.I.E. In that respect, I confirm what other Deputies have said, that officials show the greatest courtesy in every way, but we have no say in what they do. If we come in here and ask the Minister any questions about C.I.E., he has a stereotyped answer, which I myself have received from him, that the board was established by a previous Government, and that they have control over their own affairs and that he has no say in their operations.  Now, however, the position is exactly as it was before, except that they will have more freedom now than they had heretofore.</P>
    <P>I was struck by one sentence in the Minister's speech where he said that the board cannot terminate a service, unless it is satisfied that its operation is not economic and there is no prospect of its becoming economic within a reasonable period.  The Minister said that there is a statutory obligation on them to provide a service, provided that service is economic.  That is clear and it is cut and dried, but how, if you are to give the board full authority&mdash;completely free from parliamentary control&mdash;is anybody to have a deciding voice as to whether it is economic or uneconomic?  There is nothing to stop the board from closing down a line, and therefore I cannot see where the statutory obligation to provide a service comes in.  There may be a service which is not actually paying its way&mdash;it may not be losing a great sum of money&mdash;but according to this Bill they are quite free to close that line down, to the detriment and to the disadvantage of the public at large. They really have complete and absolute control over all the affairs of the company. That would be all right and it would be desirable that they should, provided their past record&mdash;that is, their financial record&mdash;entitled them to it.</P>
    <P>For this Bill to be a success, and there is a lot in it with which I agree, <Col N="1645" /> and a lot in it with which I disagree, and possibly many Deputies will have the same opinion, I think there must be, until the transport system is on better lines, some sort of parliamentary control.  The Minister also said that in the event of the board closing down a particular line, it is not mandatory on it to provide alternative transport of any sort.  I think the company has got to try to establish itself on a sound financial basis and thus make it a paying concern.  In any part of the country where they feel that the system is not economic and that it may be unworkable, they will simply close it down.  They have no obligation to provide, in place of that line, any form of road transport.  The board will say that it is uneconomic to run a rail service in this particular place and that it is also uneconomic to run a road service so they will leave it to private enterprise to run the road service.</P>
    <P>However, if C.I.E., with its great organisation, cannot provide a road service, it is extremely unlikely that any private company will be able to provide the service to the more backward sections of the country which will then be completely disorganised as regards transport in any shape or form.  It may be difficult to get the answer to that question, but I would suggest that in regard to these districts, and it applies to many parts of rural Ireland, Deputies should think in a more rural manner.  We are too much inclined to become Dublin-minded in this House.  If you are going to eradicate transport from these districts you ought to do something to mitigate the hardship that will be caused.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister not consider altering the Bill in some simple way so that the company will have to provide alternative road service for a limited period after any section of line has been closed?  By doing that you would at least mitigate the hardships caused and allow the people to readjust themselves to the changed circumstances.  The powers given in this Bill are drastic.  In order to close down any part of the system, all the board has to do is to give two months' <Col N="1646" /> notice in the official publications or in the local papers.  I suggest that this is a matter which requires much more consideration.</P>
    <P>I may have been very critical of the Bill, but I feel that a Transport Bill is necessary.  I feel that it would be a tremendous mistake if we were to get rid of our railway system.  Our memories would be very short if we did not recollect the great service they gave us during the emergency.  A reorganised and smaller railway system could possibly become at least a semi-solvent concern.  I think that some of the railways probably could be made pay in the more highly populated centres.</P>
    <P>However, with the record of C.I.E. in regard to providing transport, and the financial set-up under which they have operated over the years, I do not think you can honestly ask this House to pass a Bill giving them complete jurisdiction over their own affairs.  If this House does that there will be many complaints voiced here for which we will have no redress and some Government will be back at one stage or another looking for further legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill is sufficiently important to merit the serious attention of every section of the House.  All of us had a look through it long before this and I think that it marks a bold step in the transport history of our country.  Everybody will agree that it was necessary to do something quickly.  Once we made up our minds that public transport was to remain, it was necessary to do something about the railway undertaking. I am sure that the commission which inquired into the operation of our internal transport examined all the pros and cons of the question.  On the one side they considered whether a public transport undertaking should continue and on the other hand they considered letting private transport take over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One does meet people who think that private transport should get full authority or should be allowed to go ahead without any hindrance but it is very easy to see what the situation would be if we allowed private trans- <Col N="1647" /> port to take complete control.  They would elect to work the most profitable centres and they would charge the price which they considered economic. At the same time we have the growing problem of private transport and, when I say private transport in this instance, I mean transport privately owned, firms who have built up their own transport system to transport their own goods.  Nobody can say with certainty that at the expiration of five or six years C.I.E. will be in a completely happy position if private transport continues to challenge public transport as it has been doing progressively over the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>This Bill was necessary; it is a bold step.  It is a big undertaking, and I believe it should see the end of the transport load imposed annually on the Exchequer.  If the Bill is likely to succeed in its aims I think it should be welcomed by the House.  A huge transport undertaking giving the employment that C.I.E. gives cannot be cast aside with an instruction: &ldquo;You must make the best you can of the position; we will allow free competition.&rdquo; Nobody would like to experience the chaos resulting from that. Apart from such considerations there is also the absolute necessity for public transport to provide facilities for both industry and agriculture and that is something that is essential to our economy.  It is true to say that the difficulties in transport which we are experiencing are being experienced by practically every other country. They have the same causes and the same effects.</P>
    <P>In the northern portion of the State we are at present in a rather strange position which will right itself as transport operations in other parts of the country come into line.  In Donegal we have three public transport concerns operating and not always with the greatest possible measure of co-ordination. Notwithstanding the improvements in that system as a result of efforts made up to now, it is most unsatisfactory and we look forward to the overhauling of that system in the near future.  Consequently, we are particularly concerned with the provisions <Col N="1648" /> of this Bill which will at some stage undoubtedly apply to Donegal transport systems.</P>
    <P>One can see certain difficulties arising from the fact that this Bill relieves the C.I.E. from its common carrier obligation. At present C.I.E. is obliged to accept traffic as it comes and one of the things which I always found all transport concerns unwilling to carry is the unprofitable freight known as &ldquo;empties&rdquo; or &ldquo;returns&rdquo;.  The old railway system was a convenient means of returning &ldquo;empties&rdquo;; traders merely dumped them at the local station and a train came along some time and took them to their destination at what was usually an economic, prearranged rate.  Other concerns did not want to touch that sort of freight and to-day it has been to a great extent eliminated because many private concerns are now running their own factory-to-door or producer-to-consumer service by which they bring their own goods to the purchaser and collect the &ldquo;empties&rdquo; at the same time.</P>
    <P>This traffic has been eliminated also to some extent&mdash;and I hope it will be further eliminated&mdash;by the introduction of cardboard cartons instead of the old wooden crates which lasted for years and which had to be returned. Modern methods tend more and more towards the use of corrugated cardboard containers which are not returnable and that means that the service provided for the returning of containers will not be necessary in future and will eventually disappear. The necessity for such returns is even now being eliminated also in the case of beer and spirits and the old wooden casks are disappearing in the case of some of our best known beverages. That makes it easier for both public and private transport to operate.</P>
    <P>Relieving C.I.E. of the obligation to provide an alternative transport service, where they deem it proper to close down a line and can show it is not an economic concern, may create certain anomalies.  One could easily visualise a remote area where it is found unprofitable to operate a permanent line although such a line would provide a very essential service for, <Col N="1649" /> perhaps, limited traffic.  There may not be any great desire on the part of the company to provide alternative transport in that case nor any great desire on the part of a private concern to apply for the necessary merchandise or passenger licence to operate an alternative service.  One can see that situation might cause considerable inconvenience, but if the demand by private hauliers to secure merchandise-carrying licences continues, it is not likely to arise.  If such a case did arise and private transport secured the necessary licence to operate a service where the railway would refuse to do so, they would have the ball at their feet to some extent and would be able to impose charges which might be prohibitive to those obliged to use the service.  I do not know if there is anything in the Bill to control that situation.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the question of closing branch lines which has always been a source of worry to anybody who has given any thought to the problem.  It is the position whereby a company may deliberately allow a branch line to become uneconomic over a period of years, due to a service which is not properly maintained and properly managed.  Eventually, it will fall into disuse and will be abandoned by the public so that a company can produce figures revealing that a particular branch line showed a continuous decline in revenue over a period.  By doing that, the company is able to show it is an uneconomic line and so have that part of the undertaking abandoned.</P>
    <P>I should like to see some control over the proper maintenance of existing branch lines in order to ensure they would get a fair chance of showing whether or not they would be economic if they were maintained.  In many cases it happens that a number of passenger services run side by side with the branch lines.  If better cars were used, more express service maintained, if delays were eliminated as far as possible, time tables speeded up and a general and better service given in every respect, it is questionable whether these lines would show the decline they reveal in most cases to-day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1650" /> I sometimes think that that decline possibly results from deliberate inattention and that it could be completely eliminated were the necessary attention given to those lines.  I do not know what the impact on the economy of the country may be generally but the modern trend is to get traffic on the public roads.  At one time these lines were considered to be the last word of a system of modern transport. They were sometimes built without due consideration to the location of towns and villages.  Nowadays competition is too great to permit those railways to continue.</P>
    <P>At the same time if you go into any area where a branch line is in operation and suggest that the road passenger service be discontinued in order to ensure that only one system of transport is maintained economically, you will have a public hue and cry because the road passenger service is taken off.  If you propose taking off the railway service, there is a similar protest from the public with the result that in many places throughout the country to-day you have branch lines and a road service running simultaneously on practically the same route.  One is in actual competition with the other.  It would be impossible to operate both economically as long as that system prevails.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should be in too great a hurry to close down some of the remaining branch lines.  Due regard should be given to the condition of the roads which must carry the extra traffic as a result of the closing of lines and the impact which that must necessarily impose on the public purse, whether it be the local authority or the national Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In some cases, millions of pounds could be expended on short stretches of roads to put them in a state where they would be able to carry the added traffic which they would have to bear ultimately as a result of the disappearance of the railway lines.  To my mind a branch line is always an extra road. If it were even maintained and confined to freight service it would take off the public roads the extra traffic <Col N="1651" /> for the time being&mdash;anyhow until they were put in a state when they would be capable of bearing it.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any action of any Government will arrest modern trends. As the trend is towards road service, I think it will go in that direction in spite of anything we, or any other Government, are likely to do, but to suggest that the public transport system should not be given the necessary encouragement to continue is tantamount to saying that we should allow it to fall into disuse completely and have the opposite situation which would inevitably come about.</P>
    <P>I think this Bill takes a very bold step and makes very generous provisions for the public transport undertaking. It should at least put an end to the worry of that undertaking in regard to the annual budget.  It is understandable, when a concern is charged with the obligation of carrying certain traffic, irrespective of whether it may be economic or not and when it shows continuing losses, it can justify a demand on the public exchequer at any time.  Relieving the company from their obligations as a common carrier and giving them autonomy as far as possible certainly puts them in a position where they must at least now realise they must stand on their own feet.</P>
    <P>Once a commercial undertaking finds itself in that position it will immediately set about looking daily to the economics of the undertaking to ensure that it is operating in a way which will bring in the necessary revenue to balance expenditure over the years. I may be optimistic, but I feel that before the time allotted in this Bill&mdash; the transitionary period&mdash;has elapsed, the public transport system will have reached the stage where it will pay its own way and no longer be an obligation on the public.</P>
    <P>The most unpredictable thing about transport is the extent to which private transport will be availed of by the individual family as time goes on. It is quite possible that in another 20 years any firm, irrespective of how small or insignificant it may be, will provide most of its own transport. Any public transport undertaking will <Col N="1652" /> have to charge rates that will make it an economic undertaking, if it is to make a profit.  At least the Bill, in implementing most of the recommendations of the Internal Transport Commission, gives the C.I.E. undertaking every possible chance to establish itself on a footing that will eventually show, commercially and economically, it is operating on sound lines and without the losses which are now shown each year.</P>
    <P>Sometimes one wonders how a large public concern can compete commercially with privately-owned concerns when one considers the overheads which they have, some of which a private firm might sometimes say are unnecessary in order to keep going. If any private undertaking were to have the same conditions for its employees, the same rates and regulations generally, it would hardly be able to operate economically, either.</P>
    <P>I wonder if C.I.E. will now be strong enough to effect the economies I think they will have to effect, if they are to run the business as a private undertaking would, in the most economical manner.  The elaborate machinery for dealing with demands for increased wages and the conditions of employment, are far superior to anything anybody would experience in a private transport undertaking.  If I had a truck to-morrow and had to get a driver, I would probably be able to select him from 100 applicants who would be prepared to work extended hours&mdash;continuous work through the night, as is often done by private concerns&mdash;and, in general, who would be prepared to accept conditions that would not be accepted for one moment by an employee of a public undertaking such as C.I.E.</P>
    <P>People who advocate the complete handing over of our transport system to private hands do not for a moment refer to the fact that thousands of men are employed under these conditions in C.I.E. and other transport systems in the country&mdash;conditions which are entirely unknown to those operating private transport.  I suppose one might say it is due mainly to the fact that those in private transport are not so organised as to be able to command <Col N="1653" /> the conditions they would like.  However, the fact remains that where, in public transport, three drivers would be employed to do a certain job, the same job is done in private transport by one man.  Sometimes you find one man doing as much as it would take four men to do in a public transport concern.</P>
    <P>It is impossible, for the reasons I have already stated, to conceive how a public transport system can operate at rates anything like those that apply to the private haulier.  I am referring to people who have the necessary vehicles to carry out their own transport in the larger and smaller firms and to those who have merchandise licences and can operate within restricted limits in their own province.</P>
    <P>I do not know at this stage what the position is likely to be with hauliers with merchandise plates, but for some time there has been a keen demand to have the area of operation extended. Unfortunately, I was not present when the Minister was making his opening statement on the Bill, but personally I think the restriction on the operation of merchandise licences should be relaxed.  Perhaps that would be creating further competition with the system which in this Bill we are making a final attempt to put on a sound and profitable basis, but there are quite a few anomalies with regard to merchandise licences.</P>
    <P>Very often, the existence of merchandise licences tends towards abuses in other respects.  Take, for instance, a man with a private truck who collects a load, possibly live stock, puts them all down as his own property, drives into the market and disposes of them there.  It is very difficult for anybody to prove that such a man has taken part in illegal haulage. Consider, on the other hand, his neighbour who has a merchandise licence. If he wanted to take the same load, he could not do so because he would be going outside the limits of his area. The moment his truck was detected with its merchandise plate, he would be questioned as to whether or not he had gone outside the limits specified in his licence.  It is galling at times to <Col N="1654" /> see that happen&mdash;and it happens pretty generally.  Men who have merchandise licences are precluded from carrying out work which men who have not such licences are able to carry out.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is not appropriate for me to say so now, but I should like the Minister, at some stage, to consider relaxing the restrictions imposed on lorries with merchandise plates.  The regulation regarding unladen weight is not so rigid as the regulation regarding the restricted area in which they may operate.  It is necessary that the weight should be increased because the modern trend is towards the bigger and better vehicle, equipped with tipping gear, and so on, which makes for increased weight.  In many cases, such vehicles have trailers which are sometimes equivalent in weight to the actual traction vehicle.</P>
    <P>While the restriction is not so rigid in relation to the increase in unladen weight, it should be a little more elastic with regard to the area of operation.  I do not think it would put these people into any great competition with public transport if that were to happen, because, when a load of merchandise, live stock, or anything else is taken a short distance and must then be unladen so as to be taken a further part of the journey, extra charges are imposed which makes it much more unprofitable for both concerns. If holders of merchandise licences were unrestricted in their operation, I think it would eventually work out to the betterment of transport generally.</P>
    <P>If something could be done to solve the problem of carrying live stock, it would dispel a good deal of the bad feeling existing at present.  Rather than have the present position continue, it might even be better to put live stock outside the scope of the merchandise restriction and make it a free-for-all.  At present it is impossible to substantiate a breach of the transport regulations in this regard. Owners of lorries can go around, collect from the farmers all the cattle they may, bring them to their destination in their own names and dispose of them there.  It is impossible to <Col N="1655" /> prove it is illegal haulage.  For that reason, the men who have merchandise licences are being deprived of business which should be theirs.</P>
    <P>Occasionally we have complaints about the transport of live stock concerning lorries from the Six Counties operating in the Twenty-Six Counties. I may be selfish and parochial in this, but I take a more lenient view of that. The amount of trade between the two areas is considerable.  When dealers come to Donegal and the other counties contiguous to the Border to purchase cattle, they should be allowed a certain freedom of movement, and not be hounded too much in regard to the use of their trucks.  There may be exceptions, but in most cases they are legitimate traders doing useful work. It is not necessary to impose restrictions detrimental to the trade existing between these areas.  Sometimes these people are accused of coming across solely for the purpose of hauling live stock for remuneration here.  The number of cases where that applies is few. The number of genuine cases where dealers come in to purchase live stock is far in excess of the number of abuses.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, I may ask the Minister to answer questions in regard to sections on which I am not clear at present; but I do not think I should sit down without reminding the Minister&mdash;I do not think it is necessary to do so; I have discussed it with him in private on many occasions&mdash;of the position in regard to transport in Donegal at present.  We are anxiously awaiting a solution of the problem.  We have the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway providing transport in one section of the county, the C.D.R. Joint Committee providing transport in another section, and the G.N.R. operating passenger and freight services in another section.</P>
    <P>Whilst these three try to co-ordinate their services as best they can, it does not make for the best system of transport. A great deal of uneasiness has been created.  People are in suspense that some change is impending.  At the moment, transport in Donegal can be described only as operating on a shoe string.  The sooner some means are <Col N="1656" /> devised by way of co-ordination of the systems throughout the county, to put the services in Donegal on a sound footing and dispel the impression of anxiety for their future employment of workers, the better.  It is not an easy problem, but the passing of this Bill will make the position somewhat better.</P>
    <P>One of the features I commend in the Bill is the provision it makes for redundancy in employment or worsening of conditions.  We owe that to the workers who carried on our railway system for so many years when we were very glad to have such a system. Without it, we might have found great difficulty during the emergency years and a number of years afterwards.  The old trains on the branch lines became a part of the landscape.  At times, they had not the coal to carry on but they very often came puffing through Barnesmore Gap with turf keeping the boilers heated.  They may not have gone as rapidly as one would have liked, but all the same they maintained the service during a most difficult period.  I should hate to think that we have seen the end of them and I should like the situation to come about in which we would be clamouring for the opening of branch lines rather than for their closing.  If the present trend in transport continues, we will find ourselves, so to speak, &ldquo;on the road&rdquo; in a few years' time.</P>
    <P>Somebody told me recently&mdash;I do not know how true it is&mdash;that in some places branch lines closed some years ago had to be reopened.  I should like to think that is a pointer to what we might do in the future.  There are areas which would still be unknown, were it not for the railways built through them years ago, which opened them up and gave them the opportunity of taking a full part in the commercial life of the country.  Road transport is doing that most expenditiously at present, but I hope that the transition will not impose on us a burden that may be too great to bear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for Industry and Commerce made his statement on transport policy in November last, I said his statement <Col N="1657" /> had much to commend it but it did not go far enough to achieve what he hoped, what this House hoped and what the country generally would desire.  This Bill gives effect to the policy he announced then.  It has much to commend it, but it has also many shortcomings.  There can be no doubt about the benefit accruing to C.I.E. from the reduction of the board's capital liability and the direct financial assistance of £5,000,000 over the next five years.  The removal of the common carrier and other obligations will enable them to go out after business and try to win it back from their competitors. They will also be aided by the strengthening of the provisions against illegal haulage.  All this will be to the benefit of C.I.E. and will contribute towards providing a proper transport system.</P>
      <P>The Bill is not radical enough to ensure that at the end of five years the company will be able to provide an unsubsidised national transport system for passengers and goods, over rail, road and canal, to the satisfaction of the public and of the House.  The wiping out of the accrued losses and the removal of the liability to redeem almost £10,000,000 of 3 per cent.  Transport Stock is merely a recognition of realities and I do not think the Minister should be condemned for recognising the realities.  C.I.E. would not have been able to meet those obligations and therefore their removal will not give them any direct financial benefit.  However, it was just as well to clear up the situation.  For the next five years, the Company will be obliged to work within the limits outlined for them by their earnings and their annual direct grant from the Exchequer. After that period, they are expected to be able to carry on without further subsidy.  We all hope that can be done, but I find it difficult to see how it can be done unless C.I.E. can rush off immediately towards the abandonment of railway lines to cut losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major disappointments for me is that there has been no attempt to equate road and rail <Col N="1658" /> costings.  I advocated before that continued and permanent assistance be given to C.I.E. for the maintenance of the permanent way.  Down through the years, and in recent years, particularly, the losses have been high and it has been a serious embarrassment to the company to maintain the railway highways.  That obligation falls on them alone, with no contribution from anyone else.  We know that road users get very much more preferential treatment in this matter.  All of us are expected to contribute in local and national taxation towards the upkeep of the roads.  Roads, canals and railways are three necessary highways of the country, each playing an important part in the national life and as such all should be dealt with equally.</P>
    <P>In 1955, the cost per mile of maintaining the roads was £213, made up of £82 4s. from the Road Fund, £39 7s. from Central Funds and £91 from local taxation.  C.I.E. are large ratepayers, they pay taxes and licence fees, in respect of their lorries and buses.  They contribute in no small way to the maintenance of roads on which their competitors operate and which are used by people engaged not only in legal haulage but in illegal haulage as well.  C.I.E. also have to pay fully out of their own resources for the upkeep of the railways.</P>
    <P>In a recent year, the examination of their accounts revealed that to earn £6,750,000 actual turnover they had to expend £1,000,000 in maintenance of permanent way.  In the same year, the road freight department earned £7,000,000 but the road tax on that was only £250,000.  Significantly enough the railway loss that year was £750,000.  It can be seen therefore that if the cost of maintaining railways were in the same proportion as its contribution to the maintenance of roads, C.I.E. would not have had a loss of £750,000 on its railway working in that year.  Someone may ask: &ldquo;What is the solution? What do you want us to do?  What do you advocate?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister and the House are no doubt aware that in the Milne Report some years ago there was a recommendation that a central highway <Col N="1659" /> authority should be set up here charged with the upkeep of all the amenities of communication within the State.  Under the control of that authority would come roads, canals, railways and so forth.  In that way railways would be maintained in the same manner as roads.  Everyone would make the same contribution towards the maintenance of our traffic highways. No doubt that recommendation was considered at that time.  I do not know whether or not it has been reconsidered since.  I do not even know if that is the correct solution but I suggest that the proposal, together with the other recommendations made, is worthy of further examination because I believe that the maintenance of their own highway will represent to C.I.E. at the end of the five-year period an insoluble problem.  The cost will be out of all proportion and might well be such as would result in their not being able to do what this Bill presupposes and what all of us hope will be done.</P>
    <P>Another shortcoming of the Bill is that there appears to be no effort to stop, or even to discourage, the import of heavy lorries.  Deputy Norton referred to the lorries that all of us have seen plying the roads every day&mdash; large, heavy vehicles to which a trailer of almost equal dimensions is very often attached.  These vehicles do severe damage to the roads.  The roads were constructed at a time when such vehicles were undreamt of and the Minister might have availed of the opportunity provided by this Bill to discourage the use of such vehicles. These vehicles ply between points already served by railways.</P>
    <P>It is Gilbertian that the taxpayer should be called upon year after year to subsidise the railways while, at the same time, these vehicles are allowed to ply the roads, thereby throwing an extra expense on the ratepayer because of the increasing cost of upkeep.  I take it the Minister, in framing the Bill, considered whether or not he might put a limit on the radius of operation of these vehicles.  I would urge him to give that matter further consideration between this and Committee Stage.  In West Germany, <Col N="1660" /> where the roads are of a much higher standard, legislation was recently introduced permitting these heavy lorries to operate only within a very limited radius.  I hope the Minister will give that matter consideration.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of this measure outlines the general powers and duties of the board.  As it is worded, it is a very definite departure from the powers and duties of the existing board as outlined in Section 15 (1) of the 1950 Transport Act: &ldquo;It shall be the general duty of the board so to exercise its powers under this Act as to provide, or secure, or promote the provision of an efficient, economical, convenient and properly integrated system of public transport for passengers and merchandise by rail.&rdquo;  The important words there are that &ldquo;It shall be the general duty of the board... to provide an efficient, economical, convenient and properly integrated system of public transport.&rdquo;  In Section 6 of this Bill it is stipulated that it shall be the general duty of the board to provide a reasonable transport service &mdash;a reasonable transport service as against an efficient, economical, convenient and properly integrated system.  I do not know how that will be interpreted.  I do not know who is to judge what a reasonable transport service is.  Will it be a service which will be regarded as reasonable by the board of C.I.E., by the Minister, by the Government or by this House? How is it to be ascertained whether or not the public, who should be our chief concern, regard it as reasonable?</P>
    <P>It would appear that C.I.E. is now being charged with providing what will be regarded as a reasonable service only where it pays to provide such a service.  That is a very definite departure from the duties entrusted to C.I.E. in the 1950 Act.  When the Minister is replying, I should like him to clarify that.  It is a section that will have to be amended when we come to the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill for compensating C.I.E. employees who become redundant because of the closing of railways or because of the change from steam locomotion to diesel locomotion.  There is provision <Col N="1661" /> that compensation will be abated in the case of employees securing employment with State undertakings, local authorities or the Dundalk Engineering Works.  Nobody could object to that provision particularly as commendable efforts were made to provide work in Dundalk by the establishment of a suitable industry there where, because of the change in the transport system, the people appeared to be falling on hard times.  The provision for abatement in relation to the three categories I have outlined is quite reasonable.</P>
    <P>As pointed out by Deputy Norton&mdash; and it cannot be too strongly stressed &mdash;there is enshrined in this proposed piece of legislation a new principle as far as compensation is concerned, that is, that compensation which a person might be enjoying because of the loss of his employment for any of the reasons mentioned by me, is to be cut to the extent of 25 per cent. when the person reaches the age of 65.  There is nothing in the Bill which would help to explain why such a new principle should be invoked.  I was listening to the Minister's Second Reading speech and I cannot recollect his saying anything which showed we would be justified in including such a provision in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It would scarcely be fair to a railway employee who would have given 30 or 35 years' service at wages very often that could not be described as other than depressed, to find, on losing his job because of the modernisation of transport or the closing down of branch lines, that the compensation to be paid to him would be cut by 25 per cent. at the age of 65 without any reason being given.  That is a completely new departure because in the Act of 1924, and in all subsequent Transport Acts where there was provision for compensation, that compensation was payable for life without diminution at the age of 65 or at any other age.  Each one of the Transport Acts passed since 1924 and which contained clauses for compensation provided compensation for life, and we on these benches, at any rate, will strongly resist any effort made to change that principle which has, apparently, been universally accepted <Col N="1662" /> on all sides of the House down through the years.</P>
    <P>If this Bill passes as it is I can visualise the position of a member of the salaried staff of C.I.E. who is a member of a superannuation fund and who becomes redundant between the ages of 55 and 65.  Not alone will he lose the difference between his compensation and what his salary would be, but then at the age of 65 he will be paid a sum lower than that which would be payable to him through the superannuation fund had he retired at that age.  At this stage, I think we should disagree with the principle and perhaps we can leave it there for an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Another serious part of the section dealing with the payment of compensation has been referred to by Deputy Norton.  It is that the compensation will be payable to a redundant person after either the closure of a branch line or the transfer from steam to diesel locomotion when that event occurs within five years.  If a person becomes redundant within the five years, he qualifies for compensation within the terms of this Bill.  Should it happen, however, that he becomes redundant six months after the five years, or at some time in the sixth year, there is no provision for any compensation at all.  Without any trick of the loop being tried by anybody, it could happen that the modernisation and reorganisation of C.I.E. would not have effect until perhaps the sixth, seventh, eighth or tenth year.</P>
    <P>I cannot visualise any policy which may be implemented over the next five years showing its full effects for two, three, four or perhaps five years. According to this Bill, although no man will become redundant because of that reorganisation, within the five years, if he does become redundant, it will not be shown until after five years, but there is no provision for paying him any compensation.  In the White Paper, there is some reference to that.  It says: &ldquo;Further legislation would then be necessary to provide for compensation for any redundancy which may occur thereafter.&rdquo; There is that reference in the White Paper, but of course that is not of <Col N="1663" /> much use when there is no provision by a deliberate exclusion, in the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was moving the Second Reading he referred to what I have been referring to&mdash;people who might become redundant after the five years&mdash;and I was surprised to hear him saying that it was his intention that compensation provisions for those people would be much inferior to the compensation provisions which will be payable under this Bill.  I hope I did not misunderstand him, but that is what I understood him to say.  I glean from that that the reason, perhaps, would be to entice people to come out now within the first five years, but I would ask the Minister to clarify the matter and to say whether or not there are definite proposals that a man will definitely get compensation, should be become redundant after five years and, if so, what are the intentions regarding the mode of compensation.</P>
    <P>Under this compensatory heading also, there is no provision for the payment of compensation to people who become redundant because of the reorganisation of the internal workings of C.I.E. People who become redundant because of the closing of lines and the change over from steam to diesel rank for compensation.  At the same time, the Board of C.I.E. and the employees are being urged by everybody to reorganise themselves in a manner which will ensure that losses will be reduced and eventually wiped out, but there is no provision in the Bill, and apparently it is not intended that there should be, to compensate people who become redundant due to that reorganisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister did say to-day, and indeed previously, both inside and outside this House, that he was anxious for the board of C.I.E. and the C.I.E. trade unions to come together and reach some agreement whereby the minimum staff requirements could be agreed upon for operating the transport system and, arising from that and because of it, if such an agreement could be reached, that compensatory provisions would be provided for those who would become redundant under such an agreement.  The Minister called <Col N="1664" /> it a package deal.  Essentially, I think there is nothing wrong in it.  There is, perhaps, much that is right in it, but I have the feeling that the package which the Minister is looking for is too big a package all at once.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that it would be extremely difficult to get all the trade unions catering for all the different types of grades of employees in the C.I.E. organisation to decide on a particular agreement regarding the staff and other requirements of such a vast organisation.  I suggest to the Minister that perhaps he could get package deals, taking them section by section.  He will appreciate that, say, the clerical staff, would be quite willing to discuss such an agreement with the board, but obviously they would violently resist some other trade union not catering for the clerical staff coming in to discuss what the terms of the agreement might be for the clerical staff.  The same would apply to other grades who might be willing to discuss the agreement with the board, but would think that the clerical staff should not have anything to do with it.</P>
    <P>I hope I am impressing the difficulty of getting the package deal which the Minister had in mind and I would urge him to examine the possibility of getting an agreement in this manner.  If an agreement could be got with one section or grade, it might induce an agreement in other directions as well. There will be the difficulty, of course, that the trade unions will feel that they are discussing this agreement with a board whose days are apparently numbered, for, as I understand the position, a new board will be set up for the new organisation amalgamating C.I.E. with the G.N.R.  It does not inspire confidence if you feel you are making an agreement with a board that is dying.  Indeed, perhaps the personnel of the board could not be expected to take the same interest in the matter as a new board.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty which I see in regard to this package deal is that, so far as I know, up to now the terms of the compensation which will be made available to redundant employees has not been revealed.  Would they be precisely the same terms as outlined <Col N="1665" /> in the Bill for redundancy because of other reasons?  If a proper approach were made, I think that some headway might be made in the direction which the Minister desires.  I am sure he is quite aware himself that for quite a while now there has been a complete lack of confidence in the board on the part of the trade unions.  I need not go into the history of that, but it is a difficulty which does not bring about a situation in which agreements such as these may be readily reached.</P>
    <P>Regarding the abolition of the Transport Tribunal, all of us would agree that it will be of benefit to C.I.E. to rid it of this slow and cumbersome machinery which it had to invoke heretofore whenever the question of the closing of a branch line was concerned. It is a good thing that such a very slow procedure will not in future have to be called on, but I do think the step taken in this Bill in that connection is really an overstep.  We have gone from the situation of the old Transport Tribunal and simply put it into the hands of C.I.E. themselves, without any obligation on them to consult anybody. So far as I can see, if a branch line is to be closed, C.I.E. give notice in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> and the newspapers in the locality concerned.  They have to give two months' notice and then they may proceed to close it.</P>
    <P>We should avoid a situation in which we set up some kind of body which, in effect, would be the Transport Tribunal all over again.  We should avoid that at all costs.  On the other hand, we should have a body which, even if it had only a consultative function, would issue a recommendation.  I think that should be done.  There is no opportunity now in this Bill for local traders to make their point and no opportunity for the trade unions to make their contribution, if they feel a railway line could be made to pay.  There is no opportunity for them even to challenge figures presented by the board to prove that the line was uneconomic and likely to be uneconomic for a considerable time.  I urge the Minister to reexamine the situation in that light and see if he could establish some consultative body to which interested parties might make recommendations before a <Col N="1666" /> decision is reached by C.I.E. on these matters.</P>
    <P>Section 26 deals with illegal haulage. I think all of us should welcome the steps taken in this section to increase considerably the fines imposed on people found guilty of illegal haulage. However, I think that if the section is not implemented in law there is not much use in having it there.  Up to now the position has been that illegal haulage is rampant and that little or no effort is being made to prosecute people in court.  I do not think we should condemn the Garda for that. The Act covering illegal haulage is a complicated one, under which it is very difficult to prosecute successfully. I think that illegal haulage is of such dimensions now that we are only throwing an insuperable burden on the shoulders of the Garda in asking them to deal with it.  Illegal haulage has progressed to such an extent now that we shall have to find some other method of detecting it and of bringing offenders to court.  We have already got special methods of radio detection; we have special people for dealing with Customs and Excise and I think it is time that we got away from the idea of expecting the Garda to implement this legislation.</P>
    <P>We should set up some special section to deal satisfactorily with offenders, a section which would specialise in the detection of illegal haulage.  If we do that in connection with this section, under which the penalties are so widely increased, I feel that in a very short time we would wipe out illegal haulage to a great extent.  In this way we would give C.I.E. a fair opportunity of competing with other people; we would give them a fair opportunity of getting back some of the traffic they have lost in the past and an opportunity of earning new traffic.</P>
    <P>There are many other points which I think would be more appropriate on the Committee Stage so I will conclude by saying that I think the Bill has much to commend it and that it is regrettable that it does not go the few steps further which are necessary to make it into a really good transport <Col N="1667" /> Bill.  However, the opportunity will present itself at a later stage when I hope the Minister will have examined the suggestions made by Deputies.  I hope that when we come to the Committee Stage it will be possible to amend the Bill to such an extent that it will become a comprehensive step in the transport legislation of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill represents still another effort on the part of a Government to save the railways.  We all know the position of the railways in general throughout the country over a number of years.  They have been continually losing money and the main reason for that is the modern trend of road transport and private enterprise in that regard.  We have the position now where the Government is trying again to do what it can to save as much as possible of the railways.  With that end in view they are prepared to take on themselves the responsibility of paying a considerable State debt which has accrued over a number of years.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for a period of five years in which C.I.E. will, as it were, be placed on trial.  They must, in that period, do everything they can to see to it that their revenue meets their expenditure.  I would suggest that one of the best means in which that can be achieved is by co-operation between the employee and the board itself.  It is in the interest of the employees to ensure that whatever contribution they can make in the next five years will be made with sincerity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The march of time points to the fact that the era of rail transport is coming to an end in certain respects.  It is because of the large employment potential in rail transport that every Government is anxious to do what it can to prolong the life of the railways. In addition to that, we must remember that, from other points of view, the railway is essential to this country.  We have only to throw our minds back to the last war years when there was a great oil scarcity and when all our transport was carried by rail.  I am sure that the Minister is aware of the <Col N="1668" /> essential need that there is for rail transport in this country and I know that he is doing what he can to save the railways.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision in the Bill which gives C.I.E. permission to close branch lines if they are not economic Deputy Esmonde, I think it was, said that that power should not be given to the board and that there should be some way whereby sections of people interested in retaining such a line would have access to a tribunal in order to give their views against the closing of such lines.  He said that C.I.E. would not be liable to provide alternative road transport in the case of any such branch line being closed down.  I know it is not mandatory on the board to provide alternative road services but I am sure the board is as anxious as anybody else to retain as much business as they can and they will not take that ultimate step of closing any branch line until they are quite satisfied that keeping it open would be entirely uneconomic.</P>
    <P>I would suggest in that regard, too that if any branch line is in fact closed down, the board seriously consider incorporating a skeleton passenger service with a goods service.  Sometimes when branch lines are closed, it is only the passenger service which is closed, and the goods service is still carried on.  If that should happen, I suggest a skeleton passenger service be incorporated, by having a small carriage attached to the diesel goods unit where it might not be economic to provide a separate passenger service on a line.  It might serve a useful purpose to retain in part a small passenger service in conjunction with the existing goods service.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the question of compensation.  I am interested in this question because eventually these provisions will apply to the present G.N.R. employees who, next September, we may presume, will become C.I.E. employees, and will be entitled to all the benefits which at present obtain on the C.I.E. system. It has been suggested by some Deputies that those who are dismissed as the result of a reorganisation of the C.I.E. system should also be entitled <Col N="1669" /> to compensation, just like those who are dismissed because of the dieselisation programme, and because of closing down of branch lines.  I am inclined to agree with that because what reason is there for compensating a person who is disemployed as the result of dieselisation?  Is there not hardship inflicted upon such a person as the result of losing his employment?  I do not think any distinction should be made between the two sections.</P>
    <P>I know it is contended another Bill will be introduced under which these compensation provisions will apply.  At least, in the White Paper it is stated that further legislation may be necessary to extend that period of years. Therein lies a ray of hope that the Minister will consider the position when that time comes, if there is any necessity to do so.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's statement to-day&mdash;part of which I regrettably missed&mdash;I understand he referred to his proposed legislation in respect of the amalgamation of the G.N.R. with C.I.E.  I know there is great anxiety in the minds of many of the workers in Dundalk with regard to their prospects. I hope the provisions of the second Bill will allay that anxiety and that it will clear up a lot of the problems and irregularities which exist at the present time.  I do not intend to refer to any of the matters which that second Bill may deal with in relation to G.N.R. employees as such.  I will await the introduction of the Bill which has been promised by the Minister.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recent increase in fares which we read about in the papers, we know, of course, that an increase of 10/- a week was given to certain sections of the employees, and that award for C.I.E. meant £583,000. In addition to that, the board stated that the cost of stores and materials which were necessary for the proper running of the whole system had increased by £70,000, making a total of £653,000.  We know they have passed that increase on to the public in the form of increased fares, but I read later that the chairman of the C.I.E. Board said that there was a saving of £1,000,000 on fuel alone, as a result of <Col N="1670" /> the dieselisation programme, and I think he was referring to the past year. That statement makes it seem strange that the board should adopt the method of passing on the cost of the recent wage award to the people who travel in their buses instead of utilising its £1,000,000 saving, which the chairman states has been achieved.  I cannot reconcile the action of the board in raising their fares and the statement of the chairman that there has been a saving of £1,000,000 as a result of the dieselisation programme.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will help in some way to alleviate and ameliorate the position of the railways in general.  I doubt very much, whether we will see during the next five years, the ending of all our problems in that regard, but, with proper co-operation from all sources, I hope that in five years' time we will have progressed to a certain degree in our efforts to save the railways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because I feel that the Minister has had quite a lot of experience in trying to save the public transport system. Any advance which has been made in that regard has been due to his introduction of various Bills which succeeded to a great degree in that effort. Now, we have reached a time when private cars and the transport systems of various semi-State bodies are competing with the public transport system.  We have heard a great deal about the closing of branch lines from time to time, but unfortunately, the people who could have helped to keep these branch lines open had their own haulage services in small and fairly large towns which were served by branch railway lines.  They were competing with the branch lines and there did not seem to be any co-operative spirit which would have helped to save the branch lines in a number of areas throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could have expected that people with business acumen would have been anxious to save the railways and would have done something worth while to save them.  Even from the tourist point of view, the railways were worth saving, and they would have been a <Col N="1671" /> great asset where new factories were established.  I had the experience of being a member of some deputations in that regard, but people who could have contributed something worth while in a practical way thought only of their own personal interests.  While people do that, it is very hard for a transport system to exist.</P>
    <P>While the Minister was piloting certain transport Bills through this House, we always had the private individual who said we had a public monopoly here.  That was the cry from many bodies, that interests had been interfered with, and following the introduction of the 1944 Transport Act, compensation was paid to a number of hauliers and others using private transport in that period.</P>
    <P>We hear it said that we are giving a monopoly to a board to do what it likes.  The answer to that is to ask: are the people of Ireland anxious to have public transport or do they want cut-throat competition by private enterprise, with no security of any kind for workers or for the travelling public?  Each year that goes by has brought us nearer to the time when we have to decide finally what can be done to save the public transport system.  By the Bill, the Minister is trying to give C.I.E. power to carry on&mdash;that is really what it means.  He is endeavouring to find a method of saving C.I.E. and yet ensuring that it will not be a public liability all the time.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, the canals may come &ldquo;under the hammer,&rdquo; and I am concerned about the employees, especially those in my own constituency, who are working on these canals.  I suppose they will be treated in the same way as other redundant staff, if the canal system closes down.  It is not so many years ago that C.I.E. took over the canals.  There are, of course, numbers of workers in other grades with long service who may become redundant and the Minister has made provision to ensure that as far as the C.I.E. Board can afford, they will do the best they can to look after such workers. I hope that the board will not disappoint <Col N="1672" /> those who have given it long service and who expect that, even though they may not get constant work in future, they will get something to tide them over until they get other employment.</P>
    <P>Some other points which I wish to make can be deferred until the Committee Stage.  I welcome the Bill as a step towards saving the public transport system.  It would be a very poor country if the railway system went. While the branch lines which are totally uneconomic are going, I hope we shall succeed in improving the present position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate how difficult it is for the Minister to introduce transport legislation for this country.  Therefore, any remarks I make will be aimed at improving the position of the board in the future rather than criticising the measure introduced by the Minister.</P>
      <P>In Part II, Section 6, dealing mainly with the general duties of the board, I notice that these duties include provision for safety of operation, encouragement of national economic development and the maintenance of reasonable conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>Some points require elucidation in this Bill.  Section 18 and what follows refers to the termination of train services.  To many Deputies in rural areas, that is one of the biggest problems connected with this Bill.  We cannot agree to the suggestion that from now on the new C.I.E. Board, having given two months' notice, can decide to close a branch line.  That could be disastrous, not alone for the people in the area concerned, but for the country as a whole.  I believe the people of the area should be able to appeal to an authority over C.I.E. C.I.E. may be able to show that a branch line is uneconomic to them, but when we take the overall economy of the country into account&mdash;and that is a matter which gravely concerns the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash; the question may be the uneconomic working of a branch line for C.I.E. or the disaster which might follow a closing down in regard to the transport of goods from that area to the common market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1673" /> I am thinking of areas in South Cork such as Courtmacsherry where, for some years past, the closing of the branch line has been rumoured.  It is to the credit of the present C.I.E. Board that, despite such rumours, this branch line has not been closed, but the danger is that under this Bill the people down there may have no appeal, if they are notified by C.I.E. that, after two months, the branch line is to be closed.  That is unfair to the people.  Later on, I shall refer to the fact that while some of these areas may now be considered uneconomic to C.I.E. it was due to the neglect of C.I.E. that they have proved uneconomic.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to Section 8, Part II, which deals with level crossings.  Without being critical of the Bill, I feel it is our duty to draw attention to some anomalies in the system which has imposed such heavy liabilities on the country.  Even outside this Assembly, many people grumble about the heavy C.I.E. wages bill and say that it is keeping down C.I.E.  I have never believed that and it is only fair to say that it is not the men's wages but the unfortunate system they have to operate that is the trouble.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question in regard to this section.  On one occasion, because C.I.E. considered it essential to reduce the wages of a caretaker at a level-crossing from £3 10s. to 30/-, a very senior official had to travel out there on five different occasions.  He found it inconvenient to travel by C.I.E. rail or bus and made the journey in a more expensive way.  I draw attention to these items in order to pinpoint the fact that if these things continue in the future we shall still be faced with a problem in regard to C.I.E.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to bus fares.  Bus fares undoubtedly play a major part in relation to the income of C.I.E. Attention was drawn to the recent increases in bus fares and questions were raised as to whether or not these increases were justified as a result of the increase in wages.  Bus and rail fares from Cork to Crosshaven are twice as high as they are from <Col N="1674" /> Dublin to Bray which is the same distance. Not only was the Cork to Crosshaven service economic but it catered for a very large number of people.  Nevertheless, in that area, and in other areas in Cork, the people are saddled with a rate of charge which we consider is not justifiable.  C.I.E. will continue to get the right to say they will charge economic fares.  Ever since the last increase and, indeed, before that, the tendency in rural areas was to cut down as far as possible upon the number travelling by bus.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that the one branch of our public transport service which had been paying for itself should have been saddled with such a burden in order to relieve the railways.  Not only were the people in those areas asked to pay higher fares but, as members of the community, they had to pay indirectly towards subsidising the railways. I consider that there would not have been any necessity for so high a subsidy to keep the railways going had a policy been put into operation of fixing an economic fare on the roads in relation to people travelling by bus. As a result of the many increases, not only during the past 12 months but over the past couple of years, people have been obliged to get a drive in a neighbour's car or in a lorry.  The high charges policy in relation to bus fares pursued by the board of C.I.E. over very many years has been instrumental in reducing the receipts to the company from that source.</P>
    <P>I should like in particular to draw the Minister's special attention to another aspect of this matter.  I have done all I could by sending communications to the company.  It is no use for the Minister to say it is not a matter upon which I can question him now.  In the Cork area the practice always had been for people, who travel on weekly tickets, to give their money to the bus conductor on a Monday morning.  On Monday evening, when returning from their employment, they got their weekly ticket from the bus conductor.  There was some new system evolved in Cork, by whom I do not know, whereby if these people had not their weekly ticket on Monday morning and if they gave their money for <Col N="1675" /> the ticket, they were forced to pay for the trip on Monday morning.  Unfortunately, many of these workers find it impossible to get into the bus company's office in Cork on Saturday to get a weekly ticket.  It is outrageous. I know workers who, because of this added imposition and this local policy of C.I.E., could not get their tickets. I reported the matter to the head office in Dublin and got no reply.  Unless all these weaknesses in C.I.E. are wiped out, in spite of the Minister's best intentions and the hard work he has put into this Bill, we shall find that C.I.E. will be a headache and a burden to the community.</P>
    <P>There is very little more I have to say except to refer to Part V., Section 23, of the Bill which deals with road transport.  We hope the present Bill will be of some assistance.  It will be something better than the system in operation through no fault of the legislation introduced by any Government but through the fault of the company itself.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the following matter.  Sea sand had been drawn from Courtmacsherry, which is a seaside area in South Cork, to the Bandon district which is inland and at the same time lime was carted by C.I.E. from the Bandon area to the Courtmacsherry district.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that we are asked to provide so much money but if we provide it to have it squandered we will be up in a heap. That is my difficulty.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister is anxious to get the system as efficient as he can. In the instance to which I refer, C.I.E. used a railway service and sent empty wagons from an inland district to a seaside area.  In the case of the lime, they sent their road traffic lorries from Bandon to Courtmacsherry and they came back empty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the Minister well.  There may be faults in the present legislation. We would like it to be better and we would like to see everything done to <Col N="1676" /> improve our services.  People outside the House will draw attention to the high cost of Government.  Now, after this discussion and whenever this Bill becomes an Act, they will comment on the fact that more subsidies are being given.  We believe it is essential to have a proper railway service.  It is essential for our economic advancement and development.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding losses that may accrue, it is vitally important to every one in the community that we should have an adequate and satisfactory transport service.  That is our approach. Let us hope this Bill will help to improve the lot of the workers in C.I.E. This measure will help whoever may be on the new board to realise the shocking and glaring mistakes made in the past in the operation of the service.  It will help them to realise that a lot of money could have been saved and collected in many ways but was either ignored or squandered by the management and not by the workers.</P>
    <P>Let us hope we shall have an improvement in relation to transport which will help areas that may at present be on the danger list inasmuch as C.I.E. may be considering closing down their services within 2 months.  I would ask the Minister to examine that aspect of the matter between this and the Committee Stage.  We cannot afford a lack of transport services in the so-called uneconomic areas.  Our country cannot afford a position wherein farmers and others with stock for sale cannot get them to the market available to them. Unless C.I.E. are prepared to take the stand that, though uneconomic, they consider that the country, as a single unit, requires a railway service even in such areas, then I am afraid the outlook is not good for an improvement in our economic condition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deserves a full-dress debate.  We have had many such Bills and one after the other has failed in its purpose.  The present Minister for Industry and Commerce was always a great optimist and he still is.  He must have had many headaches but he always saw the breaks <Col N="1677" /> through the dark clouds.  Are they there still?  The nation has lost too much money already on the transport service and something must be done about it. We are in just as big a muddle as ever. Every transport Bill brought to this House was to be the final Bill to solve our transport problem.  It was a case of millions going down the drain and the solution is still as far off as ever.  The public are fed up with the question.</P>
      <P>Our railways must be kept going. They are chiefly needed for agriculture which is our main industry.  We cannot afford to close our railways though we may have to close some of our branch lines.  If things were going properly, the branch lines should not have to be closed.  We are not approaching the matter, even now, in the proper way.  In my view, we should have a completely electrified system. Other countries have it and parts of America have operated it with great success.  It is giving very good service and it is economic.  We have our bogs, our rivers and our lakes harnessed for electricity.  That being so, I cannot understand why we do not electrify our railway system.  I see no such approach at the moment and yet that is the solution I see to our railway problem.</P>
      <P>We now have the diesel engine.  We were told it would be a great saving. It was a saving but not nearly as great a saving as we require.  The diesel engine is now almost obsolete. Other countries are discarding it.  The solution to our problem is to electrify our railways and I hope this House will see to it that we do so.  We should then be able to cut down drastically on our imports of coal, oil and other materials which cost so much money and, instead, give an enormous amount of employment to our own people in our own country.  Surely the point is well worth consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has many good features and some bad ones.  Nothing is said in it about the people who hold merchandise licences.  I trust they are not being ignored.  They are almost as important as the railways from the point of view of haulage.  They give splendid service.  They have paid large sums for their lorries and trade plates and, as I say, they give splendid service.  This <Col N="1678" /> Bill should safeguard their interests. They are operating under a great handicap at present, because, all over the country, pirate lorries are running illegally and nothing is being done about it.  The result is that those who have paid dearly for their lorries and trade plates have no protection.  If it is to be a case of everybody having to fend for himself then it is a poor look out for the country.</P>
    <P>Rules and regulations should be carried out.  Action should have been taken long ago with regard to these pirate lorries as there is too much of that sort of thing happening.  People who have no right to carry cattle and merchandise are doing it night and day.  How could C.I.E. survive in such circumstances?  The railway service and people with trade plates have not a chance of surviving if every man who can get a lorry can defy with impunity the rules and regulations in regard to them.  I am sorry to have to say that C.I.E. could not succeed in such circumstances. Millions have been lost in the past and millions more will be thrown after them in the future unless the regulations are carried out.  The hauliers should be protected.</P>
    <P>There is room for private enterprise to a certain extent but there is no point in thinking that private enterprise can carry the whole transport of the country.  It could not do so.  Our country is small and our roads are not fit for it.  If we left it a free-for-all we should have chaos, the destruction of life and limb, day and night, and we cannot afford that.  I wish the railways and C.I.E. every success.  We cannot afford to allow them to fail.  The railways are the most important service in the country and they cannot be allowed to become obsolete.</P>
    <P>I believe that this will not prove to be our last Transport Bill.  We shall have many more such Bills if we do not tackle the problem in a revolutionary way.  With the harnessing of our rivers, lakes and bogs for electricity purposes, there is no reason why we should not have a first-class railway system.  We should then be able to keep the main lines and the by-lines open because we would save an enormous amount of money on the importation <Col N="1679" /> of coal, oil, and so on, and, instead, be able to give more employment, especially in rural areas where it is greatly needed.  I appeal to the Minister to give that aspect of the matter full consideration in the very near future.</P>
    <P>If the rules and regulations had been carried out in the past, C.I.E. and others who are now paying through the nose would have saved much.  However, the rules and regulations are discarded. Any man can do as he likes. He can go to any fair, take in cattle, say they are his own and nothing can be done about it.  It is all a swindle. I am not against any private man with his lorry doing his work in his own way but I am dead against swindling because it is making us a nation of crooks.  If action had been taken against them, C.I.E. and this House would not have to suffer these headaches.</P>
    <P>I trust this Bill is leading us along the right road to the satisfactory solution of our transport problems.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that no branch-line is closed down unless there is an appropriate service in its place.  In the north of my county and in the Oldcastle area there is great hardship as the people say the bus service does not suit them.  Nevertheless, nobody comes down from central headquarters to try to find out what service would suit the people there. C.I.E. should send somebody to the area with a view to providing a suitable service for the people.</P>
    <P>Thousands of pounds are lost annually because the railway service and the bus service in many places have exactly the same time-table and are running at the same times from the different towns and villages.  Surely that is extremely foolish?  If a man missed his train it meant that he also missed his bus.  If the train left an hour, say, before the bus, then such a man would be able to catch the bus. However, in this country we have had the railway service and the bus service competing with each other and that is a sheer waste of public money.  I urge the Minister to see to it that these matters are tightened up and in fact.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1680" /> I urge him to see to it that C.I.E. will pull up their socks and get going in an economic fashion.  With rules, regulations and trade unions, they are in the devil of a position, but we cannot afford to lose them.  The Minister has done his best to find a solution, but after eight or ten years we are just as far away as ever.  I believe he is a brainy, hard-working man and means well, but he can do nothing, unless he is there to see that rules and regulations are enforced and justice prevails.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave expressed disappointment that I was not able to give an indication of the steps which C.I.E. might take under the Bill for the purpose of reorganising its system, and particularly its railway system.  I do not think it is advisable I should attempt to do so. The purpose of this Bill is to give C.I.E. the power to effect reorganisation and in the light of all the information they can get, not merely about the present earning powers of sections of the rail system but future prospects as well.</P>
      <P>It has been mentioned here that reorganisation of the C.I.E. Board is contemplated later in the year.  That would have been inevitable following on the amalgamation of the G.N.R. and C.I.E. in any case, but I have in mind something more than that.  The enactment of this legislation giving new powers to C.I.E. should be followed by the appointment of a board which will have regard to its obligation over the five years contemplated in this Bill of giving effect to the aims the Bill is intended to serve.  It would be inappropriate for me to attempt to say to such a board now what I think they should do.  In this Bill, I am giving them general directives and the powers to achieve our general aims, but the intention is that it should be left to them to apply the powers in particular respects and seek to attain these aims in accordance with their own good judgement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, it is still a very open question whether railway operation can in the circumstances of our country ever be maintained upon a basis that will not involve losses.  The Beddy <Col N="1681" /> Committee Report pointed out the problem of railway operation in our circumstances without the density of traffic which is available in more highly developed countries and in view of the rather unusual distribution of population around the island.  We know that railway companies in other countries, notwithstanding the advantages they appear to have in traffic density and great population centres between which there is a continuous flow of business, are not making money either.  I have said I do not like to make a plea in the defence of C.I.E. because of the financial results of the working of our railways based on the experience of other countries.  We will have to examine our own problem and try to find the solution of it applicable to our circumstances only.  We do not have to be influenced unduly by the experience of other countries or deterred from making the attempt to put C.I.E.'s finances right just because other countries have not been able to do it.  We cannot afford to be pouring into an unnecessary, inefficient or unduly wasteful transport service money that could be devoted to far more useful purposes.</P>
    <P>However I do not believe that railways are obsolete.  I want to state a personal conviction in this matter.  I believe that, as a technical device for the transportation of traffic, the railways are superior to road transport for most classes of traffic and certainly when the problems of peak requirements are taken into account.  I expressed the doubt here in November whether it would be physically possible to handle our grain harvest, our sugar beet harvest, the pilgrimage traffic that develops during the year and the other special traffics in respect of goods or passengers that arises from time to time, without railways.  It would be most detrimental to the development of our tourist trade if it became known abroad that no railway services were available in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The problem of railway operation is a financial one, not a technical one. The whole difficulty arises from the fact that the costs of running railways have mounted up and up to the point at which it is difficult to sell railway <Col N="1682" /> transportation at an economic price which is competitive with the price at which other transportation can be procured. As I see it, the task before us is to devise some method of working our railways which will make them competitive in cost with other forms of transport.  If we do that, I believe the traffic will come back to the railways because of the superior service they are still capable of giving.  The board have got to do that.  We have got to give them the means of attempting it and the opportunity of proving that view right or wrong.</P>
    <P>There is not much point in giving the board liberty of action with one hand and trying to get it back with the other.  Deputy Cosgrave talked about the desirability of having a tribunal to which a trader could appeal if he alleged he was being unfairly discriminated against by C.I.E. in regard to charges.  Other Deputies talked about maintaining a right of appeal against a decision of the C.I.E. Board to close down branch lines.  We are not dealing here with a private organisation working for profit.  That fact must be continually before our minds.  Here we have a nationalised undertaking controlled by people chosen by the Government of the day because of their particular suitability&mdash;or who should be chosen because of their particular suitability&mdash;for the operation of that concern.</P>
    <P>Let us assume we have that situation established in the future: a nationally-owned board, not concerned with making profits, under a statutory obligation to provide reasonable transport services for our people, controlled by the best people we can pick for that job.  What is the point of making their decisions subject to an appeal?  If we pick the best people for the board, it will be the second best who will be exercising a veto or judgement on their decisions if we give them that power.</P>
    <P>I do not see any problems in that regard.  We know the board has got to keep the confidence and goodwill of the public.  We know that no matter what may appear in the statute, any misconduct on the part of the board, any unfair utilisation of the powers given to it, will be ventilated here in <Col N="1683" /> the Dáil, in public bodies and by organisations of traders throughout the country.  The board will be conscious of that, too.  It is superfluous to set up statutory channels by which these protests can be ventilated.  They will be ventilated anyway.</P>
    <P>In cases of decisions to close down a branch railway line, the Bill says two months' notice must be given.  I do not think we need to write in there that during these two months the board will have to hear the deputation from the local council of the town losing the railway service or meet the representations of the trade unions who may have a point of view.  Of course, they will do it.  Indeed, the whole purpose of the requirement to give two months' notice was to provide a statutory period during which these inevitable representations could be entertained. It is far better to let our knowledge of what will happen guide our judgment in this matter than to be seeking to write into the Bill a rigid statutory safeguard.</P>
    <P>There are some matters which were referred to, with which I will not deal now, as they will arise again on the Committee Stage.  I want to deal with the general policy issues raised rather than with specific problems.  The financial problem arises mainly from the company being obliged to operate a railway service.  The railways are losing, while the other services&mdash;the road passenger, road freight and hotel services&mdash;are in the main making money. I do not say that the boat on the Shannon or the service to Aran make money but the losses they produce are insignificant in relation to the total losses of the railway system.  The maximum hope we could entertain was that the railway system would be so organised that it would break level, that the revenue earned would equal the outgoings. We may not be able to do that and it was not contemplated C.I.E. would do that, but it was hoped that the surplus revenue earned on road and other services would be sufficient to offset the railway losses.  That must be our hope now, if we are to be realistic in our approach.  That means that when some higher charges have to be met, <Col N="1684" /> such as increased wages, C.I.E. must be regarded as at liberty to get the money to meet them wherever it can be got.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave spoke about the decision to increase fares and freights. They have not increased freights and have not done so because they did not think an increase would bring more money.  The cost of freight services has not been affected by recent decisions. I am quite certain that it would have been increased if they thought it would bring increased revenue.  It was realised it would mean only they would lose more traffic and the net result might be loss of money.</P>
    <P>They have to increase the charges where they think they can get more money.  They had to get more money. Recent increases in wages, as I told the Dáil in reply to a parliamentary question, will cost about £600,000, while increased wages in other businesses will mean increased prices on some of the things they have to buy, amounting to about another £70,000.  The company has not been able to devise a system of increased charges sufficient to get the whole of that £670,000 and to the extent of about £200,000 they will have to try to offset those increased costs by the application of economies in their services.</P>
    <P>It is presenting the picture in an entirely wrong light to point to the fact that the Dublin bus services are earning surplus revenue or other sections of the organisation are doing so.  It would be quite feasible to break up C.I.E. into several parts, to make the Dublin passenger services a separate organisation which would be profitable and probably which could always pay a substantial return on its capital liability.  Possibly the rest of the omnibus services, while not as profitable as Dublin, could maintain themselves without State subvention. However, it would leave the railway services in the position that they could not be maintained at all and certainly could not undertake the liability to pay increased wages.</P>
    <P>I am most anxious that there should not be allowed to develop any idea that C.I.E., by imposing increases in <Col N="1685" /> the Dublin bus fares, is doing anything unfair to Dublin.  The bulk of the C.I.E. workers are employed in Dublin. The total increase in wages which C.I.E. will be paying out in Dublin will not be offset by the increased charges made by the Dublin bus services.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that a company which is losing money and has to be supported by State subventions will be regarded generally as inefficient. People will jump to the conclusion that there must be bad management somewhere. In practice, that may be a most unfair conclusion, in relation to the whole C.I.E. operation.  I would point to the fact that very many people who are entitled to be regarded as experts in transport organisations have paid high tribute to the general conception and efficiency of C.I.E. omnibus services in Dublin and in the country generally.  So far as I can discover, there is no city in Europe where the cost of bus transportation is lower than that of Dublin.  In the great majority of cities and towns of comparable size in this part of the world, bus transportation costs a lot more.</P>
    <P>That economic working of the omnibus services in Dublin has not been brought about by any lowering of the standard of service.  I think the services provided for the citizens of Dublin are as good as those of any other city in regard to which I have been able to get information.  The problem is that we have a national transport organisation which since the war has been meeting continuously increasing operational costs resulting from higher wages and higher prices of materials and which has not been able to offset completely those mounting costs by increasing charges.  It has pushed the charges to the point where they are bringing in the maximum revenue and we can only hope to extend that revenue further by expanding the amount of business available to it.  That applies particularly to railways.  We are hoping to put them in a position to expand business by giving them complete freedom of action, the power of commercial adaptability to which I referred in introducing the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> In regard to compensation provisions, I have said that the arrangements for railway workers who lose employment are generous.  If this were a problem we were facing for the first time and if I came here with a proposal that the worker who lost his job by reason of these changes would get half pay for the rest of his life, everyone would say that was a reasonable provision to make.  The worker employed by a Government Department who is disemployed for reasons of redundancy, because his particular section has been disbanded, does not get anything like the compensation C.I.E. workers get on disemployment through redundancy.</P>
    <P>In many of our harbours the pattern of trade caused the disemployment of staffs of harbour authorities and there were no compensation provisions for them.  When Irish Shipping, Ltd. had to tie up a boat recently because it had no goods to carry, the sailors were paid off and there was no compensation fund to which they could turn.</P>
    <P>In the case of railway workers, we are providing for compensation where-ever they lose their jobs because the job has folded up.  Thousands of workers lose jobs every year in every country because the particular business in which they were engaged cannot be carried on in changed circumstances and there is no compensation provision for them.</P>
    <P>It was not quite realistic for Deputy Norton to talk about compensation arising because considerations of public policy necessitated the disemployment of these workers.  There is no consideration of public policy which necessitates the closing of a branch line.  In fact, public policy is directed towards keeping it open if at all possible.  It closes down solely because not a sufficient number of people want to use it either for the conveyance of passengers or goods to justify its retention and the public interest in the matter is no greater than where disemployment arises because of the shutting down of some harbour or some other business of that kind.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to the five-year <Col N="1687" /> provision.  This compensation will be payable during the next five years to workers who lose their employment on grounds of redundancy.  The scheme envisaged in the Bill is that we are giving C.I.E. the opportunity, the support and the money over five years to get their undertaking on a basis where it will no longer require a subvention from public funds.  The aim, at any rate, is that by the end of five years any curtailment of railway services or any other reductions in the scope of the facilities provided by C.I.E. will have been completed and the problem of redundancy will then have been permanently eliminated and, from that on, there will be an organisation which can operate in the normal commercial way without external support.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not that will happen.  I am not attempting to forecast what the position will be at the end of five years, but Deputies will appreciate how anomalous it would be for me to frame this Bill in a manner which would express my doubts as to whether or not that aim will be achieved.  The five years is there.  We propose to provide compensation for workers who become redundant for these reasons during the five years and anyone who reads the White Paper circulated with the Bill will see that I was not ruling out a possibility of further legislation being enacted to provide for compensation for redundancy arising at a late date.  I made it quite clear in introducing the Bill that I was not holding out any prospect that whatever compensation provisions might operate at the end of the five-year period would be as generous as those contained in this Bill.  The whole aim of this legislation is to compel the board and the trade unions and every one concerned to get on with the job now and work to complete the job within that period.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to this idea of a package deal involving an extension of the compensation arrangements to which Deputy Casey referred.  Deputy Casey mentioned the difficulty and the delay that would be involved in attempting to get agreement of the <Col N="1688" /> kind suggested covering the whole operation of the C.I.E. railway system.  I recognise that.  There are obvious categories of workers, those who are employed in the operation of the rail services&mdash;the conciliation grades as they used to be called because of certain administration arrangements&mdash;the clerical workers and the shop workers.  I do not know that the shop workers are concerned in this at all because I assume the railway engineering shops are an economical proposition in the ordinary sense and the amount of work done in them is the amount that has to be done and the workers employed in them are those who have to be employed to get the work done.</P>
    <P>In regard to those concerned with railway operation, the conciliation and the clerical grades, it should be possible to have a separate agreement in regard to each of these categories. I am prepared to extend the compensation provisions to cover workers rendered redundant by reason of general reorganisation within either of these broad categories provided that the reorganisation is carried out under an agreement negotiated between the board and the trade unions concerned. It is hopeless to think of a reorganisation without the goodwill of the trade unions and it would be impracticable to provide for compensation for a reorganisation carried out by the board faced with the opposition of the trade unions.  Indeed, my aim is to secure that there will be a combined approach to this problem leading to an agreement designed to bring about the economies which will save the future of the railways.  If that is done, then I am prepared to support it by the introduction of the necessary compensation provisions to eliminate the possibility of hardship and make it easier for the trade unions to secure the acceptance of their members for the proposal.  I fully realise all the difficulties involved and it is for that reason I have chosen not to be specific. I think it can be taken that the compensation provisions applying to an arrangement of that kind would not be dissimilar to those in the Bill.  I would naturally prefer that they would be similar because it would be far <Col N="1689" /> easier for administration purposes; but I do not exclude altogether the possibility of a special compensation scheme applying in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The essential conditions that I require to have met are that, first of all, there should be an agreed scheme and, secondly, that it shall have the effect of reducing the cost of railway operation. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, whoever he may be, will have to be able to justify to the public the placing on them of the obligation of providing the money out of which that compensation will be paid on the ground that, by doing so, they will be the ultimate beneficiaries in the elimination of C.I.E. losses and the ending of a situation in which they have to provide each year in the Budget sums to keep the organisation going.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde has some doubts as to whether this will be the last of the Transport Bills to come before the Dáil.  We all have that doubt. Maybe the situation will not be as bad in 1964 as it is now.  I hope it will not be.  Deputy Burke said no one had as much experience of trying to save the railways as I had.  That was a sort of back-handed compliment.  This time, I hope the experience will pay off in a more effective way.</P>
    <P>With regard to the level crossing keepers likely to be affected by changed techniques, many of these <Col N="1690" /> people are not paid any remuneration at all.  At the moment there are about 500 of them.  They receive no remuneration. They receive free housing.  That matter was brought to my attention yesterday by a representative of the trade union and I am having it looked into.  Only a fraction will be affected. None of them receives any cash payment. They are paid for their services by rent free accommodation.</P>
    <P>Illegal haulage is of course a key problem.  There, legislation is less important than enforcement and, following the enactment of this measure, I intend to discuss with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, whether the arrangements in operation in regard to enforcement for the elimination of illegal haulage cannot be strengthened and improved.  I agree with the argument that it is placing too great a burden upon the local Gardaí to deal effectively with the systematic evasion of legal obligations such as arise in that regard.  The other matters mentioned can, I think, be more usefully discussed in Committee.</P>

      <P>Hearing-aids are not being made available generally by health authorities pending the organisation of a scheme for the economic supply of these appliances.  Owing to current financial and other difficulties the introduction of such a scheme must be deferred for the time being.  Such hearing-aids as are now being supplied under the Health Acts are mainly for the use of children maintained in recognised institutions for the deaf, the cost of the aids being met by the health authorities of the particular areas where the children concerned normally reside.</P>

    <P>Health authorities have been asked to concentrate their available resources on the development of dental services for children in preference to services for adults.  Having regard to this consideration and the present urgent need for economy, some health authorities are not providing any dentures, while <Col N="1629" /> some, included in the list above, are providing them only on a restricted scale, for the lower income group. Most health authorities provide dentures for school children in the occasional cases in which they are found, at school health examinations, to be necessary.</P>
    <P>Spectacles are provided by all health authorities for national school children for visual defects discovered at school health examination.  The majority of health authorities also provide spectacles, as required, for children attending child welfare clinics, where such clinics are operated.  Spectacles are provided for the lower income group in all areas by the responsible local authority (i.e., health authority, board of assistance or board of public assistance, as the case may be), but in County Limerick, in the current year, the council, as an economy measure, has suspended the supply of spectacles to this group.</P>
