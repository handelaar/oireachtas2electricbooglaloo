      <P>Is the Tánaiste aware that a number of people in Dublin City have been disturbed by the fact that dispensary doctors who gave satisfactory service for a great number of years were not appointed to the permanent posts which they had filled in a temporary capacity?  Would the Tánaiste agree that there is something wrong with the system where this can happen and would he agree that, where a man has held a temporary appointment and given satisfaction for a number of years, some system should exist whereby he will have the right to permanent appointment when such a vacancy is to be filled?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state what is the present position concerning the proposed Free Trade Area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Inter-Governmental Committee set up by the Council of the O.E.E.C. in October, 1957, have been discussing the basis on which a Free Trade Area, which would associate on a multilateral basis the European Economic Community with the other member countries of the O.E.E.C., could be established.</P>
      <P>This committee, on which all 17 member countries of the O.E.E.C. are represented by Ministers, were asked to complete their work in time to permit of the coming into effect of a Free Trade Area by 1st January, 1959, on which date the first series of tariff reductions and quota enlargements come into operation within the European Economic Community.</P>
      <P>Unless there are some extraordinary developments, it is now unlikely that this target can be attained; but work is continuing and the Inter-Governmental Committee will meet again this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although agreement has been reached on the methods by which various matters should be dealt with in a Free Trade Area, certain fundamental differences persist in the Inter-Governmental Committee.  The most important of these differences relate to the definition of goods which would benefit from the removal of trade barriers in a Free Trade Area, and to the degree of freedom which member countries should have in their commercial relations with countries outside the Area.  The problem of origin and certain related questions, which have proved particularly difficult, have now been remitted to a committee which will sit in a permanent session <Col N="339" /> under the chairmanship of the Chairman of the Inter-Governmental Committee in order that decisions may be reached as soon as possible, and if possible, by the 31st December, 1958.</P>
    <P>The treatment of agriculture, which has been one of the major problems since the start of the negotiations, is still unsettled, but the difficulties in this regard do not now appear to be so formidable as they did in the earlier discussions.  It is clear, however, that any such agreement will not provide for a regime of free trade in agriculture on the lines of the arrangements visualised for industrial products.</P>
    <P>With regard to the treatment of Ireland as a country in the process of economic development, the Inter-Governmental Committee have received favourably the case made that we should be allowed a longer period than the more advanced countries in which to scale down, and ultimately eliminate, protective measures.  If a Free Trade Area is set up, and if we join, it may be taken that we will be allowed to reduce industrial protection against imports from the economically advanced countries at a substantially slower rate than that at which those countries will be obliged to reduce their protective measures against any manufactured goods we may have for export to them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state (a) the number of insured persons and dependents entitled to institutional and specialist services under the Health Act, (b) the number of persons and their dependents within £600 yearly means similarly entitled, (c) the number of farmers and their dependents similarly entitled, (d) the number of women who have availed of the maternity service under Section 16, Health Act, 1953, and the estimated yearly number upon which the cost is now based, and (e) the number of doctors who have agreed to provide medical care for mothers under Section 16 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The approximate number of persons in the category &ldquo;insured persons and their dependents&rdquo; is 1,580,000.  The approximate number eligible as farmers and their dependents is 770,000.  A reliable figure could not be given of the number of persons outside these two classes who are entitled to the services because their family income is less than £600 a year.  This number is, however, thought to be considerably less than 10 per cent. of the total number of entitled persons.</P>
      <P>The number of agreements entered into by doctors with local authorities as at 31st March, 1958, totalled 1,588. This figure represents more than the total number of doctors engaged in the service, as some doctors enter into agreements with more than one local authority.  The number of doctors, as distinct from the number of agreements, is not available in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to (d) in the question, the Deputy will appreciate that Section 16 provides for a variety of services in <Col N="345" /> respect of maternity.  By far the most widely used was the general practitioner service which, according to returns furnished by health authorities but not yet checked in my Department, provided care for 29,200 women whose confinements occurred in 1957 (including 13,600 domiciliary confinements). In addition to this number, there were over 3,100 domiciliary confinements and nearly 14,000 hospital confinements in which services (ante-natal, intra-natal or post-natal, or a combination of those) were provided under the Act, but in which cases the women concerned had not registered with any particular medical practitioner.  (Cases in point are those provided with care by the major voluntary maternity hospitals under their agreements with health authorities.)  The returns show also that nearly 11,000 women availed in the year of services under Section 25 of the Act in respect of maternity. There is an overlap, the precise extent of which cannot be stated, between the last mentioned figure and the figure quoted for Section 16.</P>
    <P>The cost of services under Section 16 of the Health Act, 1953, is estimated by each health authority for its own area.  Each year's estimate is based on the health authority's most recent experience in relation to such expenditure. While the number of women availing themselves of the service would be a major factor affecting expenditure, other significant considerations would be the extent to which the services available are utilised and changes in the balance between hospital and home confinements.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state the total number of persons entitled to free medical services under Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, and the total number of persons estimated to have been entitled under the pre-existing provisions of the Public Assistance Act, 1939.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the returns furnished to me by the local authorities the number of persons covered by general medical services cards at the 30th June, 1958, was <Col N="346" /> 824,756; this is the latest date for which the information is available.</P>
      <P>Under the Public Assistance Act, 1939, persons requiring medical assistance were obliged to obtain a medical assistance ticket from (a) a warden appointed by a public assistance authority or (b) a member of the public assistance authority or (c) an assistance officer of the public assistance authority.</P>
      <P>No statistics were kept of the numbers availing of such services and it would not be possible to give a firm estimate of the number who were entitled to medical assistance under the 1939 Act.</P>
      <P>The same class of persons who were entitled to medical assistance under the Public Assistance Act, 1939, are entitled to general medical services under Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, and I have no reason to believe that there is any substantial difference as between the number now covered by general medical cards and the number who were entitled to the services of the dispensary doctor under the Public Assistance Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether that complaint is well founded because, under the 1939 Act, free medical assistance was to be provided only for persons who could not, by their own industry, or other lawful means, provide medical attention for themselves and their families.  It is quite possible that a number of people who were getting assistance under the 1939 Act were not entitled to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that many people around the country, agricultural workers, casually employed persons, and persons in posts which do not carry substantial remuneration, are being refused medical cards although many of them could get free medical treatment under the Public Assistance Act?  It is well known in many counties, to my own knowledge.  At a time when the  is worth about 8/7 and when £6 a week represents little more than 50/- would the Minister call the attention of local health authorities to the necessity of appraising accurately the inability of these persons to provide medical assistance on to-day's scale of charges, when illness happens to afflict any member of the family?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large, I have no reason to believe that the local authorities who act as health authorities in this matter deny any person who is entitled to it a medical card, but it is very possible, having regard to the manner in which medical assistance tickets were issued prior to the Health Act of 1953, that many people were given medical assistance tickets who were not entitled to have them.</P>

      <P>Returns received from local authorities, and which have not yet been audited, indicate that the expenditure on the general medical services for the year ended 31st March, 1958, was £879,000, made up of £570,000 for salaries of dispensary doctors, £184,000 for medical supplies and £125,000 for remuneration of other staffs, upkeep of dispensary premises and miscellaneous expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of that large expenditure, would the Minister not consider that the time has come to examine the dispensary system in order to provide a free choice of doctors to those entitled to free medical assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to allow every person a free choice of doctor, but there could not be an absolutely free choice of doctor in every case.  At the most, it could only be a choice between one doctor and another.  We could not allow a person to select a doctor from any part of the country or even county in which he resides.  In any case, the 1953 Act has been in full operation only for the past three years, and I think it would be premature to interfere with the existing system until we see how it will work out in the end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But what I have said is that the 1953 Act has been in operation only since 1956 and I think it would be entirely premature to interfere with it until we see how it works out in the end, particularly bearing in mind in this connection that the cost of the Act is very much greater than was originally anticipated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether in view of the failure of his Department's poliomyelitis vaccination scheme operated by local health authorities to cover more than <Col N="349" /> a total of 7 per cent. of the age groups 0-10 in the years 1957 and 1958 and of the increased incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis in 1958 over 1957 he proposes to amend the scheme in order to make vaccination available free of direct charge to parents of children who wish to avail of it, as in the case of diphtheria and other free inoculation schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The percentage of vaccinations quoted by the Deputy refers only to those who have already completed the full course of three injections under the scheme operated by health authorities.  As I informed the Deputy in reply to a question which he addressed to me on the 29th October, the total number who have so far received one, two or three injections is 22 per cent. of the eligible age groups.  I have every reason to believe that the great majority of those who have not yet completed the course of three injections will do so.  In any case, even those who may not complete the course will have received a measure of protection against polio. I would also remind the Deputy that none of the figures which I have quoted take account of the considerable number of children vaccinated privately.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that any special significance attaches to the fact that the number of reported cases of polio in 1958 is greater than it was in 1957, as the incidence of this disease fluctuates widely.</P>
      <P>While I would have liked to have seen the scheme more generally availed of this year, I am hopeful that, with the spread amongst the public of greater knowledge and appreciation of the value of this relatively new technique, parents and guardians will come forward in increasing numbers in future years.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, it is not my intention to make any substantial changes in the present scheme.</P>

The Regulations came into operation on the 1st November, 1958. Copies have been presented to Dáil Éireann. (b) and (c) are matters which the Central Bank treat as confidential. In regard to (d) the Regulations relate only to clearances arising at the Central Clearing in Dublin.

      <P>In the case of Loughconneera and Kylesalia, agreement by the tenants to certain proposals put forward by the Land Commission was not forthcoming until June last and it is now hoped that a number of holdings will be rearranged and enlarged during the current financial year.  Further rearrangement will be effected according as circumstances permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Mweenish townland, the Land Commission, in an effort to obtain additional land to facilitate rearrangement, have resumed one holding and have instituted proceedings for the resumption of five further holdings in this townland.  The <Col N="363" /> total area involved is upwards of 100 acres.  It is not possible, however, pending the result of these proceedings, to indicate when rearrangement proposals can be formulated.</P>

    <Title>National Loan, 1958&mdash;Statement by Minister for Finance.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform the House that a new national loan to be known as Exchequer Stock will open for subscription on Monday next, the 10th November.  The loan will be for £15,000,000 but, in my capacity as Minister for Finance, I am taking up £2,000,000 of the stock.  The amount available for public subscription will, therefore, be £13,000,000, which will be fully underwritten by the Irish banks. The rate of interest will be 5½ per cent. per annum and the issue price £99 for each £100 of stock purchased.  The stock will be redeemed at par not later than 1974 and may be redeemed at any time from October, 1971.  As the issue is being made at a discount, those who hold the stock to redemption will obtain the benefit of a capital gain of £1 per £100 of stock held, and this gain will be tax-free to the ordinary investor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To facilitate investors, there is, as usual, provision in the prospectus whereby only 10 per cent. of the purchase price need be paid on application, the remainder being paid in three further instalments over the months of December and January.  On the other hand, those who wish to pay the full amount on application, or to <Col N="370" /> complete their subscription on allotment, will be entitled to a discount equivalent to an interest rate of 5½ per cent. on the advance payments.</P>
    <P>The tax privileges which have been a feature of recent loans are once again included.  Interest will be paid without deduction of tax at source, though, of course, a holder ordinarily resident in the State will be assessed to tax at the rate appropriate to his income.  Stock of the issue will be accepted at its nominal value as the equivalent of cash in satisfaction of death duties on properties of which it formed a part.  The stock and the interest on it will be exempt from all Irish taxation, present and future, if owned by a person neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
    <P>The issue is being made under the authority of the Appropriation Act, 1958, and other statutes.  Both principal and interest will be a charge on the Central Fund.  The market value of the stock will be upheld by its status as a trustee security, by the concession whereby it will be accepted in payment of death duties and by the substantial sinking fund allocations.  A continuing and active market will be ensured by the arrangement under which the Government stockbroker will be prepared at all times to buy and sell blocks of the stock in reasonable amounts.</P>
    <P>The 5½ per cent.  National Loan, 1966, which was issued in October, 1956, carried a right of conversion into any public issue made by the Government within five years.  This right will apply to this issue.  Stock of the new loan issued under this conversion arrangement will be additional to the £15,000,000 of stock offered for cash subscription.</P>
    <P>As you are all well aware, it is primarily to our own people we must look to provide the funds needed for national development.  It is only by applying the maximum amount of resources to productive development at home that we can build up employment and living standards.  Investors who subscribe to the new issue will be playing their part in ensuring that resources will continue to be available for the expansion of agricultural and <Col N="371" /> industrial output, the provision of houses, schools and sanitary services, the development of fuel resources and afforestation and the other objectives of the State Capital programme.</P>
    <P>Since the resources for national development must come in the main from the savings of our people, I should like to stress the continuing need for a large volume of savings. The amount saved in 1957 showed a gratifying increase on previous years, but it is necessary to maintain the improvement if we are to continue, without set-back, the development of our economy.  All subscribers to the new loan will be helping to attain this objective as well as securing for themselves a safe investment and an attractive return on their capital.</P>
    <P>The prospectus will be published in to-morrow morning's newspapers. Copies of the prospectus, with the application form for cash subscriptions appended, may also be obtained as from to-morrow from any bank, stockbroker or Post Office.  The lists will close not later than Friday, 14th November.</P>
    <P>I confidently ask for the full and active support of every Deputy in the House for the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I would like to join with the Minister in expressing the hope that the loan, the flotation of which he has just announced, will be a success.  We are all clear that it is only by productive capital investment that there can be any permanent improvement in our economic progress or any permanent increase in our standard of living.  There can be no better way in which the savings of our people can be invested than in such productive investment in Ireland, and the Minister in the statement he has just made has made it clear that this loan is required for that purpose. Every Irish man and woman who has the means at his disposal for investment is therefore fulfilling a patriotic duty by subscribing to this issue and thus helping the development of our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, however, he or she <Col N="372" /> is doing more.  The terms of the loan are so attractive that investment in it can also be recommended purely as a matter of self-interest to investors.</P>
    <P>It would seem possible that the trend of interest rates in the world or at any rate in the part of the world that affects us in Ireland is likely to be downwards and it may well be, therefore, that investors would not be able again in the immediate future to obtain as high a rate of interest as 5½ per cent. for a period of 15 years or so with capital appreciation at the same time.  The financial position of the State is fundamentally sound and justifies, therefore, every confidence for investors.</P>
    <P>Speaking, therefore, on behalf of Fine Gael, I would urge everyone who can possibly do so to invest in this loan and we hope that it will be oversubscribed at an early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome and commend this loan to the investing public.  The terms of it offer a rewarding return to the rich investors, and to institutional establishments who find it necessary to invest their funds as part of their commercial activities, and also offer a source of encouragement and thrift for the small investor whose savings, in the matter of a national loan, can be vital from the point of view of the success of the loan, and for the encouragement of good citizenship as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we have to recognise here, and what cannot be too often emphasised, is that the development and expansion which have taken place in other countries have, in the main, been financed by native savings.  It was that road other highly developed countries had to travel in order to attain the measure of capital development which they desired. Whilst we here might be able, from time to time, to invite limited external investments in our economy, the inescapable fact is that, in the main, we must rely on native savings and native investment in order to promote national development.  Every national loan is, in fact, a euphemism for national development and national expansion, because the proceeds of the loan are utilised for the purpose of <Col N="373" /> undertaking large-scale schemes of capital development which would not be possible out of current revenue. Good citizens, therefore, must welcome national loans as an indication of the State's determination to pursue a policy which will enrich the nation's estate, which will provide civilised amenities for our people and which will offer rising living standards.  They provide great opportunities also for well-paid employment.</P>
    <P>There will, of course, be many persons who will be unable, from their slender resources, to subscribe to the loan, but nevertheless they are vitally affected by its success or failure.  The success of every loan means more work. It means an extension of our national activities.  It means the provision of great opportunities for employment and it means regular wages and rising living standards.  It is because of that fact that even the poorest of our citizens must take an interest in the success of national loans which, in their own sphere, help to provide sustenance and economic security for those who must depend on their labour as a means of achieving that security. For these reasons, I welcome this loan on behalf of the Labour Party.

      <P>Deputies are aware that under the Control of Imports Act, any Quota Order, or any Order amending a Quota Order, ceases to have effect on the expiration of six months from the date on which it is made, unless it is approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas before the expiration of the six months.  In this first Order, amending Quota No. 45, the amendment was a technical one affecting the quota control on cotton cloths.  The effect was to remove from the scope of the quota certain printed cloths.  The second and third Orders amend Quotas Nos. 45 and 13 in certain details for the purpose of stopping evasions of the quota controls which had developed. The fourth Order to be confirmed (Quotas Nos. 1 to 32) (Amendment) Order removes an exemption in the quota control for cloths used in the binding of books, as Irish mills are now able to supply this cloth.  Further information in regard to the four Orders is contained in the supplementary memorandum already circulated to Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of machinery by which it is hoped that the existing defects in our apprenticeship arrangements may be remedied.  I think most Deputies will agree that the three-fold aims of a good system of apprenticeship should be to ensure that (1) sufficient numbers of boys and girls of the right type are attracted to the skilled trades; (2) these apprentices are given an adequate opportunity, by thorough training on the job and by technical school instruction, of acquiring the knowledge and the skills which it is desirable that they should have; and (3) there is adequate supervision of apprentices so that they may make good use of the opportunities with which they are provided.</P>
      <P>The present position regarding apprenticeship in this country is not satisfactory.  I think that fact is widely known and I doubt if anybody will dispute it.  There are, it is true, some apprenticeship schemes in existence which are, in the main, quite satisfactory. The broad picture throughout the various trades, however, is that the vital problem of recruiting and training future craftsmen is dealt with either in a haphazard manner or in a way which is prejudicial to the long-term interests of the trades themselves and the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I regard this as a most important issue, bearing upon the whole future of national economic development.  Faulty apprenticeship can result in poor and inefficient workmanship which can adversely affect, if <Col N="377" /> not altogether eliminate, our ability to compete in export markets.  I think everybody now realises that our industrial programme has reached a stage where further expansion depends on our ability to find export outlets for some of the goods we produce.</P>
    <P>We cannot hope, in the foreseeable future, to compete with the larger and more industrialised countries for export markets in mass-produced goods. We have, it is true, industries which have long export traditions and I am aware that they are making every effort to step-up the volume of their exports.  However, the main hope of achieving a significant expansion lies in finding overseas markets for speciality products.  Some of our industries producing goods which require a high degree of skilled workmanship are already achieving success in that direction. The markets, and a substantially increased volume of exports of that kind, are there to be won.  If they are to be won in the face of growing competition, every effort must be made to bring the industries concerned to a high pitch of efficiency.  One of the first things that must be done is to ensure that they will not be short of highly-trained workers in the critical years that lie ahead of us.</P>
    <P>This problem of apprenticeship, the inadequacy and unsatisfactory character of our apprenticeship arrangements, has been under consideration for many years.  Indeed, it has been allowed to go too long unremedied.  It was reviewed some years ago by the Commission on Youth Unemployment. The existing legislation on the subject is the Apprenticeship Act, 1931.  That Act was based entirely on what I may call the principle of voluntary co-operation. No trade has been brought within the scope of that Act, unless those concerned asked that action to that end should be taken.  Following the enactment of the measure, efforts were made to secure the consent of a number of trades to accept designation under the Act.  The results were most disappointing.</P>
    <P>The Act has now been in force for 27 years and it has been applied to only four trades: (1) furniture making; <Col N="378" /> (2) house painting and decorating; (3) hair dressing and (4) brush and broom making.  There are, of course, a number of other trades with voluntary schemes, some of which appear to be reasonably satisfactory.  It is clear, however, that the 1931 Act has failed to make any significant impact upon this important question of ensuring an adequate supply of properly trained craftsmen.</P>
    <P>The operation of the 1931 Act was considered carefully by the Youth Unemployment Commission.  The commission came to the conclusion, which it stated in its report, that fresh legislation was required.  They envisaged the establishment of a national apprenticeship committee, the setting up of statutory apprenticeship schemes for more trades and the provision of more effective measures for the training, instruction and testing of apprentices. I think it can be said that the main recommendations of the commission are incorporated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there are some progressive trades in which employers and workers have co-operated wholeheartedly in the task of providing satisfactory apprenticeship schemes.  If other trades were to follow the example of these progressive ones, if both sides were to come together and undertake the overhaul of the existing apprenticeship arrangements in a serious and liberal way, there would be no need for this Bill.  Voluntary co-operation would be the better way, if it could be worked.  The experience of the 1931 Act, however, has shaken confidence that it will work.</P>
    <P>For many years now, attempts have been made, without avail, to secure reform from within the trades.  It is clear that we can no longer adopt a policy of <i>laissez faire</i> on this subject. We must make a fresh effort to provide a framework within which satisfactory schemes of apprenticeship can be evolved by the combined efforts of all concerned &mdash; workers, employers, vocational education authorities and the State &mdash; and that is what this Bill sets out to do.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are given in detail in the explanatory memorandum <Col N="379" /> which was circulated with it.  I think that at this stage it is only necessary to emphasise the main features and the ideas underlying them.  It is intended that the Bill should apply mainly to craft trades. Agriculture, the dairying industry and the professional and clerical occupations have been left outside its scope. It would not, I feel, be practicable to apply the type of apprenticeship schemes envisaged in the Bill to a large and loosely-knit occupation like agriculture, and, so far as the dairying industry is concerned, there is already in operation a scheme of the Department of Agriculture for training in butter and cheese making.  It is, I think, obvious that the Bill would not be appropriate for professional and clerical organisations.</P>
    <P>One of the major defects of the Apprenticeship Act, 1931 will be removed because the initiative in the matter of setting up statutory apprenticeship schemes will be vested in the central apprenticeship authority to be known as An Ceard Chomhairle which will be established under this Bill.  The Chomhairle will be under the direction of a full-time officer, the Director of Apprenticeship, who will be in a position vigorously to promote the principles and practices of sound apprenticeship.  The other members of An Chomhairle will severe on a voluntary basis and will be representatives of employers, workers and educationists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to communications which have been addressed to me by the Trade Union Congresses.  I received these communications yesterday.  The Congress of Irish Unions described the Bill as an unwarranted interference with the rights of trade unions to negotiate with the employers concerning apprenticeship arrangements.  The Irish Trade Union Congress, while conceding that improvement in apprenticeship arrangements is necessary, referred back to certain discussions which I had with them in 1952 when I expressed a desire to seek a solution to the problem by voluntary co-operation rather than by legislation.  They urge that I should try that method now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> With regard to the communication of the Congress of Irish Unions, I am not quite sure what they meant by the adjective &ldquo;unwarranted.&rdquo;  I think it is most unlikely that they were challenging the authority of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, I assume what they meant was that action by the Oireachtas in this matter of apprenticeship is unnecessary.  The reply to the Congress of Irish Unions must be that the problem&mdash;this urgent and important problem&mdash;cannot be left to the trade unions alone if that means, as it has meant up to this, doing nothing about it if they do not wish to tackle it.</P>
    <P>The reply to the Irish Trade Union Congress is that reliance on voluntary co-operation has got us nowhere.  It is true that I tried in 1952 to get some progress by that method, but I did not succeed and, as Deputies are aware, nothing has happened since 1952. Nevertheless, the principle of the Bill is that voluntary co-operation will still be the motive force towards progress. It is not intended that the provisions of the Bill will be applied automatically to all trades in which formal apprenticeship is the method by which future skilled workers are trained.  An Chomhairle will have power to carry out an examination of the methods used in any trade for the recruitment and training of apprentices. Trades which operate satisfactory schemes will not be interfered with by An Chomhairle.  Other trades will have an opportunity, in consultation with An Chomhairle, of putting their houses in order in so far as their apprenticeship arrangements are concerned.  Any trade which does so will be left outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is my earnest hope that many trades will avail of this opportunity, because I am in full agreement with the view that the best apprenticeship schemes are those evolved as the result of close co-operation between responsible workers' and employers' organisations which recognise that they have a duty to the community as a whole as well as to their own trades. That is why it has been provided that trades with apprenticeship schemes <Col N="381" /> which are, or which can be made, satisfactory will not be designated for the purposes of the Bill and that satisfactory schemes operated by individual employers or groups of employers within a designated trade may be excluded from certain provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We must, however, provide for the eventuality that certain trades may not be willing or able voluntarily to remedy defects in their existing apprenticeship arrangements.  Where that is so, nobody at the present time has any function or authority to do anything about it.  On the enactment of this measure, An Chomhairle will be the authority and will step in in such cases.  The trades will be designated for the purposes of the legislation and apprenticeship committees will be set up to co-operate with An Chomhairle in regulating their apprenticeship schemes.</P>
    <P>It is possible, of course, that there may be instances in which it will not be possible for An Chomhairle to establish an apprenticeship committee, or where a committee, through lack of co-operation between workers and employers, will neglect or fail to do its duty.  In such circumstances, An Chomhairle will be empowered to act as or for an apprenticeship committee, although I freely admit that the task of imposing an apprenticeship scheme on a trade which is unwilling to accept it will be a formidable one.</P>
    <P>When a trade has been designated, An Chomhairle will constitute an apprenticeship district or districts for the trade and, if possible, establish an apprenticeship committee for each district so constituted.  Apprenticeship committees will include representatives of employers, workers, and educational interests under an independent chairman and all the members of these committees will be appointed by An Chomhairle.</P>
    <P>Much of the emphasis in the Bill is on the training and instruction of apprentices.  In order to be eligible for employment as an apprentice in a designated trade, candidates will have <Col N="382" /> to be enrolled on the Register of Candidates and they cannot be enrolled unless they comply with certain minimum requirements as to education and age which will be laid down by An Ceard Chomhairle.</P>
    <P>In connection with apprenticeship problems, many people think, when they are mentioned, only of what is called the &ldquo;closed&rdquo; trades, where recruitment of new entrants is believed to be entirely or mainly confined to relatives of existing craftsmen.  In that problem I think we must be realistic. It is very natural for the sons of craftsmen to follow their fathers' trade.  It is a practice which has very many advantages. I certainly have no desire to discourage it.  On the contrary, I believe it should be facilitated.  There will be nothing to prevent an employer from selecting a boy whom he knows personally or who is related to a skilled worker in the trade or employed by him but it will not be possible to recruit boys whose only qualification is relationship to the employer or tradesman. Each apprentice entering a trade should be required to receive the basic education considered necessary to enable him fully to assimiliate the training and instruction given to him during the course of apprenticeship.  It is to that end that this Bill has been framed.</P>
    <P>Each apprenticeship committee will make rules specifying in detail how apprentices are to be trained by their employers, and if, in the case of any particular trade, An Chomhairle considers it necessary that special advice and assistance should be provided to raise the standard of training, it will appoint supervisors for the purpose.  If it is found that an employer is persistently neglecting to train his apprentices properly, arrangements can be made for the transfer of the apprentices to a more conscientious employer.</P>
    <P>It is the intention that, in time, all apprentices will be required to attend courses of instruction in technical schools.  If a boy is to reach a high standard of craftsmanship, attendance at a well-defined course of technical instruction must form part of his training. The technical school cannot displace the workshop as the principal means of training, but it is an essential adjunct where the apprentice's knowledge should be broadened and stabilised. <Col N="383" /> It would be a mistake, however, to make water-tight compartments of these two aspects of the apprentice's training.  Success will depend largely on their effective co-relation.  An employer will have to co-operate in this feature of his apprentices' training by giving them time off without deduction of pay to attend any day courses selected as suitable by an apprenticeship committee.</P>
    <P>Suitable tests of the apprentice's progress are an essential element of a well-ordered apprenticeship scheme. To give an apprentice an opportunity to acquire knowledge and skill is not enough.  It is equally important to ensure that he makes good use of the opportunity.  Employers will be required to make periodic progress reports to the apprenticeship committee on how the training of each apprentice is proceeding.  Apprentices themselves will have to keep records of the training they receive, and each apprentice will have an opportunity of undergoing proficiency tests, one midway during the course of training and the other towards the end.  Apprentices who have completed their training satisfactorily and have passed their tests will be given certificates by An Chomhairle, and it is hoped that, in time, possession of this certificate will come to be regarded as the hallmark of a good tradesman.</P>
    <P>I think that these provisions should be welcomed by workers in the various trades.  They provide an opportunity for raising the status of the various craft trades.  The craft to which a boy claims entry at the expiry of his period of apprenticeship will suffer if the boy's training is scamped and the status of the craft will decline if standards of skill are permitted to be lowered.</P>
    <P>There are provisions in the Bill whereby An Chomhairle can award scholarships and other prizes to apprentices of outstanding merit, and it is hoped that these powers will serve as an added inducement to apprentices to take a keen interest in their own training.  Linked in with these provisions is the power given to An Chomhairle to collect fees from apprentices, which, it is intended, <Col N="384" /> should be used in part to finance the payment of scholarships and other awards.  It is intended that any fees so collected should be of a reasonable amount to be determined with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There is provision also for exemption from the payment of fees in cases of hardship.</P>
    <P>A very important provision from the training aspect is that contained in Section 44, providing for the payment of grants to employers in designated trades who train their apprentices satisfactorily.  I think it is well recognised that the training of apprentices involves an employer in the expenditure of time and money and that, on completion of their training, apprentices can, and very often do, leave their employers for someone else who reaps the benefit of time expended by the first employer.  I consider that there should be practical recognition of these facts, and so the Bill provides for the making of direct monetary grants to suitable employers.</P>
    <P>These grants will be given only to those employers who train apprentices in accordance with rules made under the Bill.  An Chomhairle will recommend the trades in which such payments would be appropriate, the emphasis being placed on craft trades making a positive contribution to national productivity.  The amount of the grants will be subject to the consent of the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Finance, and it is not proposed that they should be paid in respect of apprentices in State or semi-State organisations.</P>
    <P>Another vital question which is being tackled in this Bill is that relating to the intake of apprentices. There have been complaints that, in some trades at least, trade unions place undue restrictions on the number of apprentices entering the trades each year, thereby creating an acute and artificial shortage of skilled operatives. On the other hand, it is often argued on behalf of the trade unions that they must protect the interests of their members by ensuring that the intake of apprentices is such that it will not lead to the employment of apprentices as a source of cheap labour, or result in the deliberate <Col N="385" /> creation of a pool of unemployed craftsmen.  It will be the task of An Chomhairle to examine closely the arrangements in each trade for the intake of apprentices.</P>
    <P>What is needed is a fair balance in regard to intake and this Bill provides an arrangement under which such a balance can be struck.  An Chomhairle will not leave a trade undesignated unless it is fully satisfied about the arrangements for the intake of apprentices in that trade and, where a trade has been designated, the intake of apprentices will be determined by the apprenticeship committee in consultation with An Chomhairle.  The idea is that the workers and employers will sit down with the other members who will represent the general public interest, and work out each year the number of apprentices which will be taken into the trade in that year with a view to ensuring that there will be a sufficient supply of skilled workers for the trade in the years to come.</P>
    <P>There is re-enacted in the Bill a provision contained in the Apprenticeship Act, 1931 whereby an apprenticeship committee may direct an individual employer to take a specified number of apprentices into employment. It is the intention that this power should be availed of only as a last resort, when all other efforts by the committee to ensure a reasonable intake of apprentices to a trade have proved fruitless.  It is necessary to have such a power to deal with the cases of employers who refuse to accept a reasonable share of the burden falling on a trade in respect of the recruitment and training of future craftsmen, or who, while willing to meet the committee's wishes in regard to the number of apprentices to be employed, are prevented from doing so by a trade union.  When a direction about numbers is given to an employer by an apprenticeship committee it will be an offence for any person to prevent the employer from complying with the direction.</P>
    <P>Under the Apprenticeship Act, 1931, apprenticeship committees were required to make rules regulating minimum wages and maximum hours of work.  It will be noted that this requirement is not repeated in the <Col N="386" /> present Bill.  I hold the view that a requirement of this kind is not appropriate to a Bill dealing with apprenticeship.</P>
    <P>Wages and other working conditions are more appropriate for settlement by direct negotiations between employers and workers' organisations with the assistance of the Labour Court where that is necessary.  If apprenticeship committees were empowered to deal with such matters under this Bill, it would be very likely that much of the time would be absorbed in these matters and they would spend less on their real tasks of regulating the intake and training of apprentices.  I should mention here that the 1931 Act will be repealed when the four trades which availed of it to set up statutory apprenticeship schemes have been brought within the scope of the new legislation.</P>
    <P>An Chomhairle will have power to make rules defining the type of employment constituting apprenticeship in a designated trade.  Apprenticeship committees will make rules dealing with the period of apprenticeship and will be required to keep registers of candidates for apprenticeship and registers of apprentices.  All rules made by an apprenticeship committee will be required to be confirmed by An Chomhairle before they have the force of law, and penalties are provided for breaches of rules made, and for failure to comply with directions given, by An Chomhairle or by an apprentice committee.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, I want to say that I am prepared to admit that there may be scope, perhaps considerable scope, for improvement in the Bill.  I have already asked all interested organisations for their observations, and I will welcome constructive criticism and advice and proposals for improvements from any quarter.  I propose to arrange, too, that there should be a reasonable interval between the Second and Committee Stages so that the views of all interested persons and organisations can be given the most careful and serious consideration.  The only thing I am not willing to do is to drop the whole effort to improve our apprenticeship arrangements.  I do maintain that legislation is required, and required urgently, to enable our apprenticeship arrangements to be modernised with the object of ensuring an adequate supply of skilled labour for our industries.  I am confident that, given goodwill and co-operation from all concerned, the Bill now before the House does provide a suitable framework within which the problem can be tackled.  Therefore, I commend it to the House.</P>

Quite a number of provisions can probably be dealt with more appropriately on the Committee Stage but there are a few matters with which I should like to deal on this stage.  One of the important questions considered by the Commission on Youth Unemployment, with which most Deputies are familiar, is the problem which a great number of people have in finding suitable employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the main, most of our people are obliged to seek work without any training.  Those of them who get <Col N="388" /> some training either get it when they are working in a temporary capacity associated with some industrial undertaking or firm, or through whatever training it is possible for them to get while attending courses of technical instruction under the vocational educational schemes.</P>
    <P>Our own people who seek work within the country are our prime concern but we are also obliged to consider those who will be forced to emigrate in search of employment. Nobody will deny that, no matter how vigorously or how successfully economic policy may be operated here, in so far as one can look ahead a great number of people will seek employment abroad.  In modern conditions those who go abroad in search of work have far better prospects available to them if they have the skill, training, knowledge and experience which will enable them to work in some capacity other than ordinary unskilled work, in which in the past so many of our people were obliged to engage.  For the moment, however, let us deal with those who work here.</P>
    <P>Under the system of protection which has been provided here for industry, both directly and indirectly, and which has enabled industries to be established, or those established to progress further, the State and the community have conferred a benefit on a number of people, the industrialists and the workers engaged in the industries. In turn, I believe that the State and the community are entitled to expect that that protection will be utilised to the fullest possible extent and that there will be no unnecessary restriction placed on entry to a trade or industry by those who are fortunate enough to be in it themselves.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely that if it is possible to get a voluntary scheme working with the co-operation and goodwill of all concerned that should be explored to the fullest extent.  Up to the present the experience of the 1931 Act has shown that, whatever the causes may have been, it has not been particularly successful.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that in modern society a high degree of skill and training is required for almost all industries.  In <Col N="389" /> this country protection and assistance have gone far and the community, therefore, has a right to expect that no artificial restrictions will be imposed. One can well understand the obvious reluctance of those employed in an industry to have that industry swamped with a large number of trained personnel with no obvious outlet for them in the trade to which they have been apprenticed.  On the other hand, quite a large number of them, if they do not get employment and if the available vacancies are already filled, will be obliged to seek work elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Emigration and population referred to that matter at paragraph 449 and said that some witnesses were definite that technical and vocational education, by developing the aptitude of younger people and providing them with skilled training, enabled them to take better advantage of employment opportunities and was therefore a deterrent to emigration. They went on to say: &ldquo;While this may be true it is no less desirable that the educational standard of those who emigrate should be raised so that they are not confined to the more arduous and menial forms of employment through lack of adequate education&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Most of us are familiar with the position which so many of our people who emigrated in the past had to face. One of the few assets they had in the United States&mdash;and in Britain more recently&mdash;was that they spoke the same language as the majority of the people but with that possible exception, the only other asset they had was their ability to work hard and their determination to get on.  In recent times many of them have had better training, better education and consequently better prospects.  Here at home, with the development of industry the attitude which existed in the past will not be adequate or suitable for the circumstances or conditions of the future.</P>
    <P>I agree that if it is possible to get a voluntary arrangement that possibility should be explored to the full but most of us, I think, are familiar with the restrictions which are imposed on entry into certain trades.  I have in mind a particular trade where there is <Col N="390" /> not merely adequate work available and sufficient business to keep the trade going for a very long period ahead.  I refer to the printing trade. I know of a case where a man was obliged to take his son out of school in order to ensure that he would not lose his chance of being apprenticed. If he waited for the normal time to finish his primary education he would probably miss his opportunity and another chance might not occur. It should be possible to prevent a situation such as that operating to the obvious detriment of the boy who was obliged to leave earlier than is normal, because his father, who was himself a skilled craftsman, did not want him to miss the chance and knew that if he did not avail of it, it would not recur.</P>
    <P>Adequate training and instruction of apprentices are vital if we are to have available here skilled personnel with the knowledge needed in most workshops and factories.  In that respect I expected that the Minister would make some reference to the recommendation which was made in the Report of the Commission on Youth Unemployment where it was recommended that the school-leaving age should be raised to 16 and that, as a first step, the age should be raised to 15.  While most educationists who have studied the question are, I think, satisfied that whatever defects&mdash;and there are many &mdash;our system may have, the standard of education here is comparable to that provided elsewhere and that in fact it compares quite favourably with that obtainable either in Britain, the United States or on the Continent. Nevertheless, those who have considered the matter are satisfied, I think, that the school-leaving age should be raised, the first step recommended being that of raising it to 15 with the ultimate age limit, 16.  In that connection, experience has shown that our people are capable of acquiring quickly a high degree of skill in whatever course of training they are given.</P>
    <P>During the emergency years, quite a number of soldiers who completed a term of service in the Army subsequently joined the British Army and it is true to say that the majority of <Col N="391" /> them, in a very short space of time, attained non-commissioned rank.  In the comparatively short period of service which some of them had here, they had attained sufficient skill and training and shown such aptitude for that type of work that, when they received a further short period of training, in most cases they were appointed to non-commissioned rank, probably more quickly than those who had not the same period of training here.</P>
    <P>That led the Army authorities to the view that a period of apprenticeship should be included as part of the Army training for those who wished to do it and the Transport Corps established an apprenticeship school in recent years at Naas.  It had the two-fold object of providing skilled personnel for the Army and, in addition, it enabled those who would leave the Army at the completion of their period of service to have a skilled trade.  One of the criticisms which were always made of the Army service was that when a man left the Army he was fit for nothing else.  He had probably passed the period in life when it was possible to train or adapt him for any other type of employment or he was past the normal age when people show an aptitude for acquiring knowledge and skill in a trade.  Consequently it was decided to equip these people in some particular manner.  I believe it is working most satisfactorily.  These people will be trained as craftsmen. They will have further opportunities of promotion available to them while in the Army.  In addition, when they leave the Army, they will be skilled in a particular trade and that skill will enable them to become useful members of civilian society with advantage to themselves and to the community generally.</P>
    <P>From our point of view this measure is very welcome.  It further increases the opportunities available for training apprentices, for equipping them with the skill and technical knowledge necessary to them for employment in industry.  It provides opportunities for the acquisition of that knowledge so essential if they are to take their place in a community which <Col N="392" /> is more complex to-day than it has been at any time in the past.  Technical skill and technical knowledge are all-important in this era of scientific and technical development.  Indeed, technical and scientific knowledge is to some extent the be-all and the end-all of most people to-day who seek to advance themselves.</P>
    <P>If it is possible to improve the position on the basis of voluntary effort and co-operation I have no doubt that everyone concerned will be anxious to see that development extended.  On the other hand, I believe the community is entitled to expect full co-operation between employers and trade unions, in conjunction with the vocational educational authorities, to ensure that the aim of these three bodies and the State, wherever the State may enter in, is achieved.  The aim is to have available here a system of education and a system for training apprentices which will enable the ability and the skill available to be utilised to the maximum extent so that those of our people who have an aptitude for technical skill, technical training or technical knowledge will have the opportunities of acquiring those skills and training for which they have an aptitude.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, then, if it is possible to absorb these people into employment here that will be not merely to their advantage but to the advantage of the community as a whole.  On the other hand, if they are forced through circumstances outside their control to seek employment elsewhere they will be equipped with the knowledge and training so essential for them if they are to face successfully the stern and difficult battle that all who go abroad must face.  They will be better equipped than if they had not that skill and training.</P>
    <P>I should be glad from that point of view to learn whether the Government contemplate raising the school-leaving age in view of the very insistent recommendations made by both the Commission on Education and the Commission on Youth Unemployment. Both those bodies recommended that the school-leaving age should be raised as a first step to 15 and ultimately to 16 years of age.  These matters cannot be considered in isolation.  The question <Col N="393" /> of education, both primary and educational, is involved in this question of training apprentices and the matter should therefore be considered as a whole rather than that we should consider solo the question of apprenticeship arrangements under the measure at present before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody concerned with the promotion of craftsmanship and technical skills is vitally interested in any proposal, legislative or otherwise, designed to confer a wider measure of craftsmanship and technical skill on our people.  That holds good irrespective of whether our people will find employment at home or are compelled, through economic or other circumstances, to seek a living elsewhere. Education and craftsmanship are the lightest possible commodities to carry and, whether one's economic destiny is set in Ireland or in Australia, weight of technical knowledge and education is no impediment to work.  Rather does it ensure that the person so equipped starts in not holding the hod or pushing the barrow but at a pay level which is calculated in most cases to give him a security which the unskilled cannot command.</P>
      <P>I must confess I do not understand the Minister's approach to this matter. The Minister seems to have had second thoughts on this question of apprenticeship legislation.  The existing Apprenticeship Act was passed in 1931. This is 1958.  Twenty-seven years have flown since the previous legislation was enacted.  That fact would seem to establish <i>prima facie</i> the case that there is no real urgency in 1958 for legislation of this kind.  In 1952, when this matter was discussed by the Minister and the Congresses, the Minister took the view that it was better to endeavour to get a voluntary scheme rather than have a scheme imposed by the Government or by the Legislature. The Minister was wise then.  I cannot understand why he is now being so imprudent as to introduce a Bill of this kind without first endeavouring to secure the co-operation of the two Congresses and the Federated Union of Employers in working out an agreed scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1952 the Minister took the view that that was the better kind of approach, <Col N="394" /> that it was the type of approach likely to succeed and that it was the type of approach which would give an apprenticeship scheme carrying with it the approval of the two main operative parties, the employers on the one hand, the trade unions on the other.  The Minister now comes along and introduces this Bill, a Bill which bears a fair stamp of dictatorship in some of its sections, and blandly tells the trade unions that he has abandoned any attempt at co-operation&mdash; although the Minister has not tried co-operation&mdash;and intends instead to put this Bill through the Dáil with the aid of his majority.</P>
    <P>The Minister is running into difficulties. This Bill will boomerang.  The Minister may find that this will be an &ldquo;Apprenticeship Folly&rdquo; as the years go by.  One cannot operate apprenticeship legislation without the goodwill of the employers and the trade unions.  It is fatuous to think that we can get a Bill from officials in a Department, drafted by a parliamentary draftsman, when none of those participating in the conception of the Bill and in its drafting ever served one day's apprenticeship to any trade.  It is fatuous to imagine that they can impose a scheme of that kind on employers on the one hand and trade unions on the other.  It just cannot be done.  Any Bill which is designed to do it will be wrecked on the rocks of practical experience.</P>
    <P>So far as the trade unions are concerned, I believe that they recognise the necessity for overhauling our apprenticeship legislation, that they realise that the 1951 Act was ineffective, that they realise that it is necessary that there should be a much more modern approach to this problem of apprenticeship but, at the same time, they have this well developed idea that in the matter of training an apprentice they have a point of view because it is their members who will train the apprentice.  It is not the employer, not the Deputies of this House, not the drafters of this Bill; it is the craftsmen on the job who will train the apprentice. The employer will not train him. Nobody will train him except the journeyman tradesman who is on the particular job.  It is because of that that <Col N="395" /> unions are vitally concerned in a matter of this kind.  The Minister would have been well advised, even if it took another six or 12 months, to have endeavoured to develop co-operation between the unions and the employers in this matter.</P>
    <P>The unions themselves prefer co-operation. They prefer a voluntary scheme.  They are not the only body which prefer co-operation and a voluntary scheme.  The Federated Union of Employers have told the Minister that they think that this matter would best be dealt with through co-operation between the unions on the one hand and themselves on the other hand.  In other words, the two vital bodies which would operate an apprenticeship scheme satisfactorily have said to the Minister: &ldquo;In our opinion we can make greater progress if there is co-operation between us and an agreed scheme worked out between us.&rdquo;  Yet, in the face of that testimony, which is on record, the Minister comes along with a scheme which represents agreement with nobody and which is merely the immature conception of whatever brain or thought is behind the Bill.</P>
    <P>Let us hear the Minister on what was necessary in respect of apprenticeship legislation.  The Minister wrote to the Congresses in 1952 referring to previous correspondence with the Congresses and to the replies which he had received.  In the course of a letter to the Congresses the Minister stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister has reason to feel gratified that all parties appear to be agreed on two fundamental points, viz.: (1) that the existing systems of apprenticeship stand in need of reorganisation and overhaul and are capable of improvement in many directions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, two bodies had said to the Minister, that the scheme of apprenticeship is in need of overhaul and that the scheme is capable of improvement in many directions.  He had not to argue the point with them. They were both accepted.  They said: &ldquo;We realise these needs exist.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on and says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) that it is better, if at all <Col N="396" /> possible, that the remedies for the existing defects should be found through voluntary co-operation than by way of mandatory legislation and Government intervention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On 3rd November, 1952, the Minister was preaching the obvious advantages of devising a scheme on the basis of voluntary co-operation.  He has now switched completely from that point of view and has told the unions and the Federated Union of Employers that he now apparently prefers the mandatory legislation and the Government intervention which he deplored in 1952.  In fact, so convinced was the Minister then of the virtues of voluntary co-operation that he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As he made clear in May 1952, the Minister would much prefer that organisations of employers and workers should themselves work out the solution to the problem of apprenticeship.  He is, however, prepared to assist these organisations in every possible way to arrive at a satisfactory solution, and in order to bring to fruition the promises of co-operation which he has received, he proposes to arrange for the holding in the near future of joint discussions between representatives of the two Congresses and the Federated Union of Employers with the object of securing agreement on the steps now to be taken to bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He added:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister appreciates, of course, that it may very well prove necessary to have a series of discussions and he will be prepared, if the parties concerned so wish, to provide a chairman and secretariat to assist in the deliberations.  On the other hand the Minister is also quite prepared to leave the discussions entirely to the parties concerned, if they so desire, provided he can be assured that every effort will be made to bring the matter to a speedy conclusion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The significance of that letter is that it demonstrates that at that stage the Minister believed that success could best be achieved by voluntary co-operation, <Col N="397" /> that he felt gratified that the unions and the employers accepted that point of view.  So keen was he to achieve that co-operation that he offered to provide a chairman and secretariat for the discussions and he indicated that he would much prefer that co-operative kind of approach rather than mandatory legislation and governmental intervention.</P>
    <P>When the Minister stood there, he was right.  That was an excellent and sagacious point of view for the Minister to take.  So long as he was prepared to approach the problem in that way, he could get the goodwill of the employers and the goodwill of the unions.  The Minister has changed all that now and has, instead, given the unions and the employers the mandatory legislation and governmental intervention which apparently he was reluctant to recommend in 1952.</P>
    <P>It may be asked why these discussions did not take place in 1952.  The Minister knows the situation in that year and the atmosphere which existed in that year between the two Congresses. The House knows it also.  The Trade Union Congress and the Congress of Irish Unions accepted the idea of co-operation, accepted the idea of discussions between themselves and the Federated Union of Employers but, because of an atmosphere and a set of circumstances, into which we need not probe at this stage, it was suggested that the discussions should take place separately between the C.I.U. and the Federated Union of Employers and between the T.U.C. and the Federated Union of Employers.</P>
    <P>One can see how easy it was to destroy the possibility of fruitful co-operation when two entirely different sets of discussions were taking place, the discussions, perhaps, at one conference vitiating, in part or entirely, the discussions which took place at the other conference.  Because of these circumstances, unified discussions, that is, on the basis of the Congresses on the one hand and the Federated Union of Employers on the other hand, were not possible in 1952, and, indeed, were not possible for some time later.  But now they are possible because the unity discussions between <Col N="398" /> the T.U.C. and the C.I.U. have reached a stage in which I believe it will be possible, and I think both organisations have so indicated, or will indicate to the Minister, that it will be possible for the joint committee, the Provisional United Trade Union Organisation, which represents C.I.U., on the one hand, and the T.U.C. on the other hand, to undertake to explore this whole field with the Federated Union of Employers, in an endeavour to get the agreed scheme to which the Minister was so attracted in 1952.</P>
    <P>I ask one question at this stage.  Is it not worth while, even now, trying to get these discussions under way?  Is it not worth while now trying to get the employers and the Congresses together, to work out a scheme, their adherence to which will, I think, ensure that the scheme has a more prosperous life than anything which is likely to emanate from this Bill if the Bill is opposed, as it will be opposed, by the trade unions?  I would suggest to the Minister that, even at this stage, he ought to suspend further discussion on the Bill to see how far it is possible to achieve that agreement between the two bodies.  Then, having got agreement between the two bodies, the Government could embody such of this agreement as commended itself to the Government in a new piece of legislation which would be likely, as I have said, to give a greater measure of satisfaction than this Bill, when it becomes an Act, can ever give.</P>
    <P>I still think the Minister is unwise in pressing this Bill through while he has within his grasp, and can get tomorrow morning, a guarantee that the two Congresses will unitedly meet the employers' representatives, who are likewise anxious to meet the Congresses in order to work out some mutually agreed scheme.  Why should we, in the face of that possible agreement, commit ourselves to giving a Second Reading to this Bill?  It is beyond me and, as I said, I think the Minister is running into trouble on this business. I think the Bill will boomerang on the whole question of apprenticeship.</P>
    <P>What I am afraid of is that, realising how deliberately unbalanced the Bill is towards them, the unions will decide <Col N="399" /> themselves that they will fix the number of apprentices in each trade, and a situation may develop in which the new position will be worse than the position we are endeavouring to remedy to-day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave quoted a case to-day in which he deplored the fact that a man was obliged to take his son from school, rather prematurely, in order to get him into the printing industry.  The father was a printing craftsman and there was a vacancy in that father's employer's shop and, in order that his son might not miss the apprenticeship, he had to remove him from school. What Deputy Cosgrave did not realise is that, under this Bill, the father would have no chance at all of getting his son into the shop because the selection of apprentices will be in the hands of employers, and the unions will not be able to operate what they do operate to-day in the printing industry, a one-for-one arrangement. In the printing industry the employer takes in one apprentice and the next vacancy goes to the union who select their own nominees.  Under this Bill that arrangement will go by the board. That mutual exchange between employers and trade union representatives in the printing industry, and in a number of other industries, will go completely by the board.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister, on reconsideration, is prepared to withdraw the Bill and give co-operation and consultation a chance.  I am a firm believe in the efficacy of both these approaches, and I do not believe anyone's face would be seriously smudged, or his reputation seriously impaired, if the Government were to withdraw the Bill at this stage in order to give an opportunity to the possibility of getting an agreed scheme. But, on the assumption that the Minister will not do that, there are a couple of points I want to raise.</P>
    <P>Firstly, I want to say I am opposed to the Bill as it now stands.  I think it is an unfair Bill.  I think it will not operate satisfactorily and we are making sure of that by relying now on mandatory legislation and governmental intervention which, in his letter in 1952, which I quoted, the <Col N="400" /> Minister deplored so much then. Mandatory legislation and governmental intervention in this field have not earned for themselves a higher reputation in 1958 than they had in 1952 and they had no very high reputation then because the Minister deplored the fact that he would have to have resort to either mandatory legislation or governmental intervention.</P>
    <P>There are some aspects of this Bill on which I should like to comment.  I think it is quite unfair and quite out of balance that an unbalanced committee, which will control apprenticeship, should be entitled to define or designate by law any trade to which the apprenticeship legislation will apply.  In other words that committee, which will consist of four representatives of employers, four representatives appointed by the Minister who are supposed to represent trade unions, and three people representing education, are to be permitted to have exclusive rights in the designation of trades for apprentices.</P>
    <P>I do not know why they have been prevented from designating trades other than craftsmen.  The Minister, in his speech, said that it was the general intention to cover crafts, but whole sections are being excluded. The whole field of agriculture, of butter making, cheese and the dairy industry are excluded.  All professional occupations are outside its scope; all clerical occupations are outside it, and it looks to me, according to the Minister's reply to Deputy Dillon about the retail trade, that it will be outside it, too.  I did not notice any enthusiasm by the Minister to include it.</P>
    <P>This committee, when it is established, will, for the first time, deal with apprentices by representation on a basis other than equal representatation of employers with equal representation of workers.  It is provided that the committee will be composed of employers' representatives, of workers' representatives and of three educational representatives.  Those educational representatives will be entitled to deal with a number of <Col N="401" /> matters affecting apprentices which, up to now, have been within the domain of the employer-employee sphere.</P>
    <P>The new committee will be entitled to discuss such matters as employer-worker relations, to supervise investigation of disputes, and a whole variety of other matters which at present are the subject of discussion between unions and employers.  These three educational people will have no status whatever in the employer-worker relationship field, but they will be brought on to that committee and given a status to regulate certain conditions applicable to apprentices, though they are not the employers or the apprentices, and though they do not represent the persons who are employed by the employers.  What is the purpose of allowing them into this field?  I could understand if they were there as advisers and not having a membership status.  What is the purpose of loading-up the committee in such a way as to disturb the existing balance?</P>
    <P>In Section 11, the Minister has adopted a rather strange method of defining who will represent the trade unions.  Why has the Minister departed from the method of selection of trade union representatives which was defined &mdash; wisely, in my opinion &mdash; in the Industrial Relations Act?  The Minister apparently is to give himself power to select four people who, he thinks, will represent the unions whereas Section 10 (4) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, provides as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister shall, in respect of each workers' member, designate an organisation representative of trade unions of workers to nominate a person for appointment, and, in respect of each employers' member, designate a trade union of employers to nominate a person for employment and the Minister shall appoint the person so nominated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely, it is only right that, if a person represents the unions on a committee of this kind, the status of the person should be such that it commends itself to the trade unions or the congress concerned rather than that the Minister should pick and choose between individuals as to whom he thinks best <Col N="402" /> to represent the trade union point of view?</P>
    <P>Similarly, again, in the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, there was an equalisation between the representatives of the employers and those of the trade unions.  That has gone with this new apprenticeship committee.  The equality which has been a characteristic of this type of negotiation, and which is provided for in the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, is now being upset. The balance is being disturbed&mdash; and to the detriment of the trade unions concerned.</P>
    <P>Many of the craft unions to-day operate an unofficial scheme of apprenticeship with the employers. The scheme gives relative satisfaction. It is a scheme by which all those who want to become apprentices are considered and allocated on the basis that, when there is a vacancy, the employer picks one and the next vacancy goes to the nominee of the union.  That enables of the apprenticeship requirements to be met in particular industries. Apparently it has given satisfaction to both sides.  It may not be perfect.  If there are any imperfections in it, the best way is to get the employers and the unions together and, as the Minister suggested, to put in a neutral chairman, in an endeavour to show both sides the infirmities of the present scheme in the hope that both sides may be induced to adopt a scheme with more elasticity and flexibility than may be considered to be present in the existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks he will get a scheme of apprenticeship in which the sole selection will be made by the employer and in which there will be no equality in the distribution of apprentices, and imagines that the unions will meekly consent to an arrangement of that kind, I foresee trouble.  I do not want to see that.  I want a sagacious approach &mdash; putting two people in conclave and helping them to arrive at a decision in the hope that they will bring out a scheme which, enshrined in legislation if that be necessary, will give maximum co-operation and ensure smooth and efficient working.</P>
    <P>In giving this new committee the <Col N="403" /> power to intervene in many matters which affect the working conditions of apprentices, while members of the committee know nothing whatever about apprentices and in fact are not concerned with their day-to-day work, the Minister is asking the unions to swallow something which I do not think they would be prepared to do.  I am not, indeed, sure the employers themselves would swallow any such proposal.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of sound apprenticeship legislation.  We have a lot to gain by devising, either voluntarily or through agreement, a system of apprenticeship legislation which will give the maximum measure of satisfaction and the greatest amount of elasticity and real flexibility that we can attain.  However, in a matter of this kind, the basic goodwill of the two chief partners in the whole arrangement is essential, that is, the co-operation of the employers, on the one hand, and the co-operation of the unions, on the other hand.  In 1952, the Minister said he regarded that co-operation as vital and preferred it to mandatory legislation or Government intervention.  Now, we will have no co-operation.  We get the mandatory legislation and we are getting the Government intervention although, in fact, the Minister, within 24 hours, can get agreement with the employers and the trade unions to sit down, with a chairman appointed by him, to work out the best possible scheme of apprenticeship legislation that will work and, if it does not work, it is a waste of the time of this House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton's speech has surprised me.  I am surprised that a member of this House should treat the lapse of six years as if it counted for nothing.  Surely, a generation of young boys has grown up in the meantime?  It is one of the ideas both of the trade union organisations and of the employers' organisation, and of everybody in this country, that industrial progress should be made and that the rising generation should be equipped to take its place in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware, from experience of <Col N="404" /> many years, that this very question has been referred to technical and vocational congresses and that there were no more interested people in trying to tune up public opinion for legislation of this kind than the direct trade union representatives of the vocational committees with which I was concerned and that it has gone to these congresses and that time is passing and nothing has been done.  Deputy Norton states that the committees appointed will know nothing about the apprenticeship conditions.</P>

      <P>The Deputy does not know.  Would it not be quite possible that the trade union representative of the technical branches would be on this committee?  How can the Deputy judge what the committee knows before it is appointed or before the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>We know about the crafts and the trades.  We know that any vocational committee that had an eye to business and towards fulfilling its functions has already arranged classes of that sort and that the teachers are craftsmen themselves &mdash; because nobody else could give the practical side of that education.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand Deputy Norton's approach to this Bill.  The need for it has been well recognised over a number of years and nothing has happened.  Now this Bill has come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that a Bill is subject to amendment.  If it is properly criticised &mdash; apart from mere destructive criticism &mdash; then, if somebody moves some practical amendments, the Bill may be improved.  Surely nobody <Col N="405" /> is so blind as not to give them due consideration.</P>
    <P>The main point is that in this connection there is a crying need for many years.  The citizens of our towns and our cities in particular have been looking for something of this kind. There is a change and there should be a change in the educational trend. There has been too much emphasis on the academic side and on the getting of leaving certificates and so on.  When they have got to that stage, only a small proportion have any avenues of employment open to them.  Indeed, some of them go back to the schools of commerce, under the vocational education committees, to get further training in secretarial work, economics and subjects of that kind to fit them for the progress for which we hope and anticipate.</P>
    <P>That is the full purpose of the Bill to my mind.  I would be the last in the world to come into conflict with trade union congresses or employers on the basic principle of the Bill because, after all, their children are affected very seriously, perhaps, because very often in life, as the Minister said, there is an advantage in having the sons of craftsmen follow their fathers' trade.  They have the sympathy of the home towards it.  They also have the knowledge that they naturally acquire from their father.  All these things will permeate the whole scheme of things if we are sensible and approach the matter in a proper way.</P>
    <P>Surely it is not held that the sons of craftsmen would not have an advantage in getting into whatever apprenticeship scheme is developed?  I am sorry that I did not hear all of the Minister's statement on the subject since I was present at a meeting of a Committee appointed by this House but I know from my own knowledge and from my contact with trade union leaders and others that they feel a Bill of this kind is necessary.  This may not be the most perfect machine but it makes a start at any rate and avoids having to wait another six years without anything being done.</P>
    <P>We should get down to the matter on the fundamental principles that a scheme is necessary, that a certain <Col N="406" /> administrative body will be necessary to implement whatever is done and that it may be advisable to reconsider some of the points in the Bill.  I myself may not be satisfied with many of them and neither may the vocational committees who have a certain responsibility for training the rising generation on lines for which this Bill seeks to cater.  I welcome the Bill.  All that is necessary upon the Second Stage is to agree to the principle of the Bill.  I think it is a good thing it has been introduced and I hope the House will discuss it properly and sympathetically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy MacCarthy, I welcome this Bill if it will improve the position with regard to apprentices in general throughout the country but, like Deputy Norton, I agree that there should have been more co-operation between the Minister himself, the trade union congresses and the employers before this Bill was even drafted.  If that co-operation had been sought and given, the Bill might present different aspects from those which we see enshrined in it to-day.</P>
      <P>Many amendments may be put down to this Bill.  There are certain sections of it which will not meet with the approval of the unions or the employers. If the Minister tarried a little he might have found, after consultation with the unions, that he could have drafted a Bill more acceptable to all concerned.</P>
      <P>However, the Bill is before us now and I suppose we must make the best of it.  I agree with the principle enshrined in it.  As the Minister said, it is an effort to rectify the anomalies and the disorders, if I may describe them as such, attaching to this question of engaging apprentices throughout the country.  It is a fact that some definite action is required in this regard&mdash;an action which must be taken whether by co-operation, consultation or legislation.  Naturally, I prefer it would be taken as a result of co-operation and consultation.  That in itself does not rule out the possibility of legislation because the legislation should come after the co-operation and consultation and not before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is axiomatic that in these modern <Col N="407" /> times and in this technical age it is imperative to do all we can to train our coming apprentices so that they will be skilled tradesmen when they mature.  With the impending introduction of a Free Trade Area, it is all the more essential to equip ourselves and our young tradesmen with the knowledge and the technical skill which will be absolutely necessary if this country is to survive the very keen industrial competition which will result from the setting up of the Free Trade Area.</P>
    <P>We have only to read foreign newspapers and periodicals to realise the efforts which other countries are making in this regard.  They are taking similar steps to ensure that our young men will be properly trained to cope with the increased industrial production and be able to compete with neighbouring countries.  As the Minister said when introducing the Bill, the present Acts in force with regard to apprenticeship do not cover engineering activities as a whole.</P>
    <P>I doubt if there is any engineering activity at the moment covered by legislation.  Any apprenticeship scheme in an engineering concern is, I think, of a voluntary nature and if this Bill passes through the House unamended, I sincerely hope that it will not interfere too much with the existing setup with regard to apprenticeship schemes.  At the present time there are a number of voluntary schemes working out quite well and although there is provision in the Bill whereby the board to be set up may exempt or exclude certain industries from becoming designated industries, I would urge the Minister to emphasise the point that as little interference as possible should be allowed in industrial concerns.</P>
    <P>While condemning the introduction of the Bill before there has been consultation with the unions or employers, at the same time I feel that it is a fairly flexible Bill and that there are certain safeguards which should allay the fears of both the trade unions and the employers.  However, it is only during the Committee Stage that we can clearly see the way we are moving and ascertain whether we can negative certain anomalies we see in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> Reference was made to the question of the intake of apprentices to industry.  There are two views on this matter.  One, held by the trade unions, suggests that they should have power to say how many apprentices should be recruited by an industrial concern.  Naturally, they adopt that attitude because they want to safeguard their skilled men.  They harp on the idea that a small number of apprentices should be employed so that there will be plenty of work for their fully trained men.  I suppose that is an understandable attitude for trade unions to adopt.  On the other hand, there is the point of view taken by employers that they should have full control over the number of apprentices to be employed.  If they are given that control they are, as the Minister said, accused of trying to carry on with cheap labour.  That is a very important problem and we cannot be too careful in trying to solve it.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that provision has been made in the Bill for local committees to be set up by the general board.  These committees are to be composed of representatives of the employers, the trade unions and the educational authorities.</P>
    <P>In regard to the setting up of this board, which will operate throughout the country, Section 11, sub-section (1) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister shall appoint four persons whom he considers to be representative of employers, four persons whom he considers to be representative of workers and three persons whom he considers to be representative of educational interests to be the ordinary members of An Chomhairle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister shall, before appointing the persons whom he considers to be representative of employers and those whom he considers to be representative of workers to be ordinary members of An Chomhairle, consult with such organisations of employers and such organisations of workers, respectively, as he considers necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> The Minister goes on to say in sub-section (3):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister shall, before appointing the persons whom the considers to be representative of educational interests to be ordinary members of An Chomhairle consult with the Minister for Education.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister why he should consult with the Minister for Education unless, of course, it is the intention that the Minister for Education will in turn consult with the various local vocational committees as to who should be appointed on this local committee representing the educational side.  I do not think that a Minister as such, even the Minister for Education, should have authority to say to the Minister for Industry and Commerce: &ldquo;Appoint so-and-so or so-and-so&rdquo;.  The Minister should have resource to and should consult with the vocational committee in the country involved.  Maybe that is the intention; I do not know.</P>
    <P>I observe that the question of wages and working hours is to be excluded from this Bill.  I suppose that is a wise precaution because, as the Minister says, this is a very delicate matter and should be solved by local consultation and negotiation between the employers and trade unions.  With that point I agree.  It is more important to concentrate on the training of apprentices, not so much on their conditions of employment.  Of course, they are important, too, but it is more important to train them to be skilled men. They will get the fruits of their labour later on when they are skilled.  By that I do not mean to suggest that they are not entitled to a fair apprenticeship wage, but the emphasis should be placed on the training of those young boys to become skilled men as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what educational requirements will be necessary before a prospective apprentice gets on the register of apprentices. Will that education be confined to technical education or will it embrace all kinds of ordinary education, national school education, secondary <Col N="410" /> education and technical education?  Or will it be confined to technical education, as it is more or less at present?</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse Deputy Cosgrave's statement in regard to the raising of the school leaving age and to urge the Minister to do what he can to achieve that amendment.  The longer a young chap is left at school, the more chance he has of becoming properly educated.  Of course, it does not always follow that the longer a person is at school the brighter he will be&mdash;sometimes the reverse is the case &mdash;but, by and large, the practice of allowing children to leave school when they reach the age of 14 years is neither good nor right.  Its abolition has been recommended by various commissions set up here.  The opinions and recommendations of such commissions should be listened to, treated with respect and acted upon.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister say that a long period would elapse between the Second Stage and Committee Stage of the Bill.  Maybe his conscience is pricking him a little bit and he feels a lot of amendments will be required to this comparatively hastily-introduced Bill.  Perhaps that is why he says there will be a long period before the Committee Stage. During that time I hope there will be that consultation and co-operation between the employers, the unions and the Minister which is not evident on perusing this Bill.  That would meet Deputy Norton's point and the anxieties of the trade unions and the employers.</P>
    <P>I would conclude by sincerely hoping that some good will come from this measure.  It has been introduced, and we must try and pick the good out of it and reject the bad.  We all realise that at present opportunities for young people in the industrial sphere are not very many.  They could be greater and we hope they will be greater.  Maybe they will be greater if this Free Trade Area comes into existence.  One thing about the Free Trade Area is that there will be no <i>via media;</i> either we will do very well out of it or do badly.  If we want to do well out of it, we must be in a position that we can compete with <Col N="411" /> other countries on an equal basis.  With that end in mind it is a good thing to see an effort of some description made to put the apprenticeship question on a proper footing in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill appears to have been rushed into the House.  In his opening statement, the Minister gave no reason whatever for the degree of urgency in this matter.  He certainly did not indicate in his opening statement&mdash;a good proportion of which I heard &mdash; that he wished to impose conditions on the trade unions who represent those covered in the legislation.  Yet, as Deputy Norton pointed out, it is quite clear that the Minister appeared to depart completely from his clearly expressed attitude that this problem of apprenticeship and allied problems arising therefrom could best be dealt with by co-operation between the representatives of the workers and of the employers.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacCarthy made some reference to the fact that 1932 to 1958 appears to be a fairly long time.  If Deputy MacCarthy is ignorant of what has been happening in this country in those years, I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not ignorant, that he is well aware that last year, for the first time for many years, it was found possible for the Irish Trade Union Congress and the Congress of Irish Unions, through the medium of the Provisional United Trade Union Organisation, to meet the employers as one body.  You will recollect reference was made to those meetings, meetings to which the Minister himself made a substantial contribution. It appears very likely that any problems arising from defects in the 1931 Apprenticeship Act in relation to the general conditions governing the recruiting, training and absorption of apprentices into industry can be dealt with by one body representing all the workers concerned and, on the other hand, mainly one body representing employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, when that situation seems likely in the near future, one would think the Minister, with his knowledge of the general position, would say: &ldquo;Whatever my views as a Minister are <Col N="412" /> on these matters, I shall hold my hand for a little longer and see whether it is possible for these questions to be dealt with in a spirit of co-operations and consultation by those who know the problem.&rdquo;  The Minister has received assurances that the two congresses are anxious to co-operate with the employers and are prepared and anxious to have his assistance or that of the officials of his Department in this connection.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister at this stage bring this Bill into Dáil Éireann?  He tells us he is prepared to consider a substantial period between the Second Reading and the Committee Stage so that he will have an opportunity of considering amendments that may be proposed and even of considering possibly the views of trade unionists. But nobody is more aware than the Minister that there are certain general principles laid down here.  Knowing the Minister, I think it is unlikely that he would, at the conclusion of the Second Reading debate, agree in advance to alter general principles laid down by himself in a Bill.  He might, in the course of discussion through representatives of his Department and responsible organisations such as the Federated Union of Employers, the Irish Trade Union Congress and the Congress of Irish Unions, accept a point of view that he did not hold originally.  However, as Minister for Industry and Commerce he has given us a Bill which appears to include as one of its general principles, which no doubt will be repugnant to the trade union movement, the introduction of a third party.</P>
    <P>The problems of apprenticeship are basically problems for the representatives of the workers and the representatives of the employers.  To introduce, as the Minister proposes to introduce, in a general committee, representatives of educational authorities, must have one immediate effect: that, on that council, unlike all other such bodies, the representatives of the workers will be in a permanent minority.  That cannot be avoided and it applies both to the council and the apprenticeship committees.</P>
    <P>The desirability of having the young people adequately trained so that <Col N="413" /> they may be able to provide for themselves and their families in due course and take advantage of such opportunities of employment as offer is not contended or objected to by anyone in this House or outside it, but is there anything in this Bill which suggests that one additional young person will get employment in a trade or craft?  It appears to me there is no suggestion in the Bill to that effect.</P>
    <P>As well as the balance of representation appearing to be unfair in this Bill, there is a suggestion that there should be an educational qualification of some kind or other for apprentices in various trades.  I think all Deputies are particularly anxious to see that the children of Irish families receive adequate training, but the Minister's Government have not yet indicated to this House that they have any intention whatsoever of extending the school leaving age even by as much as one month.</P>
    <P>On that issue, the Bill must surely be examined in the light of the experience of apprentices in various trades, from the point of view of obtaining employment, primarily in their own country after they complete their apprenticeship. It must be examined also as to the effect of introducing an educational standard fixed, not by the employers, not by the trade union representatives in the light of the knowledge of what is required for the particular trade, but fixed possibly as a result of a recommendation from some expert on an education committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was introduced a long time ago.  The Second Reading was taken at the end of May or the beginning of June.  At that time, assuming that the Bill passed in the ordinary way, the question of its coming into operation on 1st January, 1959, so far as Parts II and III and portion <Col N="414" /> of Part IV are concerned, was a reasonable possibility.  It is quite clear that that is not the case now.  After the Bill has passed, there must be a period in which people may become acclimatised to the changes in the law.  Apart from anything else, therefore, I think the Minister will have to appreciate that the changed devolution requires sufficient time for people to amend their existing testamentary documents, if they desire to do so, and their existing plans in relation to what is going to happen.  I would urge the Minister, therefore, to extend the date from 1st January, 1959, in the circumstances, to, perhaps, 1st July, 1959.</P>

May I make a suggestion which I was going to make at a later date?  It <Col N="415" /> was my intention here to listen to whatever the Minister had to say on various amendments and leave these over for consideration without debate &mdash;or, at any rate, without very much debate.  I was hoping the Minister would allow at least a fortnight between to-day and the Report Stage, as it may be that these amendments will require countering amendments. I myself, on my reading of the Bill and the amendments so far, do not feel that any great counter amendments will be required.  However, there are certain other people interested in this.  I asked certain colleagues of mine in another area to give their consideration to this legislation.

    <P>&lsquo;the Registration of Deeds Act, 1707&rsquo; means the pre-union Irish statute (6 Anne c. 2 (Ir.)) passed in the year 1707 and entitled &lsquo;An Act for the Public Registering of all Deeds, Conveyances and Wills that shall be made of any Honors, Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments&rsquo;;</P>

      <P>It is proposed to delete sub-section (3) from Section 7 as its provisions are contained in sub-section (7) of the section it is proposed to insert by amendment No. 24.  It is proposed that the provisions in amendment No. 24 will apply to all personal representatives whereas sub-section (3) in Section 7 applies only to personal representatives of real estate. In amendments Nos. 22 to 26 we are seeking to consolidate existing law as to personal representatives as regards personal property and compulsorily registered land, and to extend the law, where appropriate, to real property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>First in regard to sub-section (1) of this section, is it clear that the effect of it in future will be to require a positive transfer organ in all cases?  If says &ldquo;requiring a transfer of real estate&rdquo;, and whether that means a transfer only of unregistered land or whether it means a conveyance of registered land as well, I do not know.  Quite apart from the expense such a transfer or conveyance would involve, I should like to know exactly where the effect of it will arise as regards stamp duty.  Secondly, I am completely unable to understand sub-section (4).  As I see it, it says in paragraph (a) that where a person dies after the 1st January, until whatever date we shall decide is the operative date for the coming into operation of the Bill, and dies possessed of real estate, his real estate will be administered in the same manner as if it were personal estate.  That I can understand.  Then we come to paragraph (b) and it says that nothing in paragraph (a) of the sub-section is to alter the position, the relative position, between real and personal estate as it was before 1st January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> I thought by clause (a) of sub-section (4) we were altering it and then we find according to clause (b) we are not.  I presume clause (b) is intended to refer to the marshalling of assets for the purpose of ascertaining primary liability, but I am afraid the comparative wording of these two clauses of sub-section (4) will lead to some considerable confusion and doubt in people's minds.</P>

      <P>They thought there was some ambiguity in it and because of that we had it carefully examined. As a result we are quite satisfied that there is no question of ambiguity. Paragraph (a) is to be read subject to paragraph (b).  If there is ambiguity there, there is also ambiguity in Section 86 of the Registration of Titles Act, 1891.  These clauses have been taken practically verbatim from that section.</P>

      <P>In page 5, before Section 10, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Part of this Act shall apply to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) land to which Part IV of the Act of 1891 applies, or</P>
      <P>(b) an interest in a parcel of untenanted land which, under Section 5 of the Land Act, 1946 (No. 12 of 1946), is, for the purposes of devolution on death, to be deemed to be a chattel real.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  We want to exclude from Part II not alone compulsorily registered land which is dealt with in Part IV of the Registration of Title Act, 1891, but also an interest in a parcel of untenanted land which devolves as personalty by reason of Section 5 of the Land Act, 1946.  Where a person agrees or undertakes to purchase from the Land Commission the fee simple of a parcel of untenanted land which was not at the time of the agreement <Col N="425" /> subject to Part IV of the 1891 Act, Section 5 of the 1946 Act makes the interest in that parcel of land created by the agreement devolve on death as a chattel real.

He came in there having made an application under Section 44 of the Land Act of 1931 and the application was granted by the Land Commission.  Between the date of the application being granted and thereafter, until the actual registration in the Land Registry, under the provisions of the 1891 Act, that still remains real estate and now I do not know what the intention is.

      <P>I am not too clear as to what is intended by this vesting in the President of the High Court. What powers will the President have pending administration?  What responsibilities will he have?  I always understood that there was in fact no such duty on the President but that, in the case of an intestacy, the administrator of the estate of the deceased person acquired no title until title had been granted by the President of the High Court.  Does Section 14 merely intend that that will be the position?  Earlier we decided that &ldquo;personal representative&rdquo; means the executor or the administrator for the time being in the estate of the deceased person.  I take it, therefore, that by &ldquo;administrator&rdquo; we mean the person to whom administration has been granted and not merely a person who is filing an application to be an administrator.  There is a difference. The executor at present takes his powers immediately from the date of death.  The administrator takes his powers from the date on which he extracts his grant.  It is given to him by the President of the High Court.</P>

      <P>What is the point in bringing the particular matters in sub-section (3) in?  Is it just that the Revenue Commissioners, efficient body of tax gatherers that they are, could not bear to see a Bill going through without their collecting more power?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised by the Incorporated Law Society and by the Dublin Solicitors' Bar Association and it has been carefully considered.  The administration bond is the bond entered into by the administrators that they will duly administer the estate.  In administering the estate they must pay the debts due from the estate.  The Law Society say there is no necessity for the provision in regard to these revenue debts as the personal representative is liable to see that they are discharged, as in the case of other debts.  We are, however, advised otherwise.</P>
      <P>The administration bond at present in use seems to provide only for payment of debts &ldquo;which the deceased did owe at his decease&rdquo;.  This does not appear clearly to cover death duties which do not become due until after the death.  Further, it does not clearly cover income-tax or surtax in respect of income arising after the date of death.  The purpose of the provision to which objection is being made is to cover these defects.  Income-tax and surtax up to the date of death are clearly covered in the present form of bond and the proposed amendment of the law will make little difference as far as these taxes are concerned.  It seems only fair that where an administrator is given control over property by the court he should be made to pay all debts, no matter to whom due.  We cannot, therefore, agree to the deletion of the provision in sub-section (3) of Section 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly clear that in relation to all debts up to the date of death, whether income-tax, surtax, or any other type of tax, the form of bond covers the position.  As I understand it, after the date of death <Col N="428" /> the position is that you do not get your grant unless you have paid your estate duty to begin with.  You may have additional estate duty to pay and additional legacy duty and succession duty subsequently.  You may have additional estate duty if the valuation is increased by the valuation office from the provisional value accepted for the grant.  But I think it has always been understood that the administrator is personally bound to apply the assets to that and, if he applies the assets to any other purpose, it is just too bad for him; he must make up the amount out of his own pocket.</P>
      <P>Similarly, income arising to an administrator, which is taxable to income-tax or surtax, is income which he receives and it is a new principle of law to suggest that where a trustee receives income, even though he does not receive it for himself, he is not personally liable to ensure that the tax on that is paid.  I can assure the Minister that if the basis for the insertion of sub-section (3) is that an administrator, who is expressed to be a trustee in this case, is not liable to pay tax on income he receives the Revenue Commissioners will find that very many trustees will hold off making the returns that they are bound to make at the present moment and the Revenue Commissioners will lose for more than they will gain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>A much greater bond covers it.  This is entirely misconceived from the practicability of the situation.  Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that a person dies worth £10,000 gross.  I am not interested in the net end of it at all.  The bond to the President of the High Court then will be on £20,000, double the gross assets.  Now the bond has got to be for an entirely different figure. The bond has to be for double the gross assets plus whatever estimated amount will arise after the date of death for death duties, for income-tax, for surtax, before the administration is completed because the bond must take <Col N="429" /> regard of those things as well as of the assets and this will throw the whole thing in the melting pot and we will never have certainty.  Frankly, I do not understand at all how it will be operative.  The bond clearly covers all debts due at the date of death.  That is easily ascertainable, easily fixed, but, if it is going to cover further debts that might possibly arise after death, I cannot see how any insurance company, for example, will ever be able to assess what the bond should be and what the premium on that bond should be.</P>

      <P>I thought there was that power already.  I saw this in the White Paper originally.  I understand the position to be that if a person is a trustee of property in Ireland but has himself no estate in Ireland there is already power to extract a grant. If it is meant to cover a case where <Col N="430" /> there is something different from that &mdash;and it is not quite clear from the White Paper &mdash; then I could appreciate it but the present situation undoubtedly is &mdash; because I have extracted a grant &mdash; that a trustee who has no estate in Ireland himself still can extract a grant to somebody else, to a bare legal estate which is vested in him.  May I put it another way?  As long as I am satisfied that the section will not prevent the existing practice being carried on I do not mind what additional power is given but I want to be quite clear that a trustee who himself has no estate in Ireland still can extract a grant for the purpose of conveying or transferring the trust estate of which he is the last trustee.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, before Section 18, but in Part III, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) The President of the High Court shall from time to time cause to be prepared in the Probate Office calendars of the grants of probate and administration made in the Probate Office and in the several district probate registries for such periods as the President of the High Court may direct.</P>
      <P>(2) Every such calendar shall contain a note of every probate or administration with the will annexed and of every other administration granted within the period specified in the calendar, setting forth&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the date of the grant,</P>
      <P>(b) the place (being the Probate Office or a district probate registry) in which the grant was made,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> (c) the name and the place and time of death of the testator or intestate,</P>
    <P>(d) the names and descriptions of the executors or administrators, and</P>
    <P>(e) the value of the estate, if any.</P>
    <P>(3) A copy of every calendar so prepared shall be sent by post or otherwise to every district probate registry, and every copy so sent shall be kept in the district probate registry to which it is sent.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to consolidate and bring up to date the law as to the preparation of calendars of grants of probate and administration made in Probate Office and in the six district probate registries.  The existing law is contained in Sections 72 and 73 of the Probates and Letters of Administration Act (Ireland) 1857. Under Section 73 of the 1857 Act it is provided that the calendars are to be sent to the probate office or registry in London and Edinburgh.  This was done in the old days but has not now been done for years.  As is explained in paragraph 6 of the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill, resealing of probates and administration between here and Britain has been suspended since 1923.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of the amendment involves the repeal of Section 72 of the 1857 Act and this is provided for in amendment No. 29.  Section 73 of the 1875 Act is already proposed for repeal in Part II of the Schedule.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, before Section 18, but in Part III, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) The personal representatives may sell the whole or any part of the real or personal estate of a deceased person for the purpose not only of paying debts, but also (whether there are or are not debts) of distributing the estate among the persons beneficially entitled thereto, and before selling for the purposes of distribution the personal representatives shall, so far as practicable, give effect to the wishes of the persons of full age beneficially entitled to the property proposed to be sold or, in the case of dispute, of the majority (according to the value of their combined interests) of such persons so, however, that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a purchaser shall not be concerned to see that the personal representatives have complied with such wishes; and</P>
      <P>(b) it shall not be necessary for any person beneficially entitled to concur in any such sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) (a) It shall not be lawful for some or one only of several joint personal representatives, without leave of the court, to exercise any power conferred by sub-section (1) of this section to sell any land, save that where probate is granted to one or several persons named as executors, whether or not power is reserved to the other or <Col N="433" /> others to prove, the sale of the land may, notwithstanding any other provision or rule of law to the contrary, be made by the proving executor or executors, without leave of the court, as fully and effectually as if all the persons named as executors had concurred therein.</P>
    <P>(b) Where a sale of land is made under paragraph (a) of this sub-section by the proving executor or executors, sub-section (1) of this section shall have effect as if the references therein to personal representatives were referrences to the proving executor or executors.</P>
    <P>(3) Where one of two or more proving executors has died, references in sub-section (2) of this section to a proving executor or executors shall be construed as references to the survivor or survivors (as the case may be) of the proving executors.</P>
    <P>(4) Where land is settled by will and there are no trustees of the settlement, the personal representatives proving the will shall for all purposes be deemed to be trustees of the settlement until trustees of the settlement are appointed, but a sole personal representative shall not be deemed to be a trustee for the purposes of the Settled Land Acts, 1882 to 1890, until at least one other trustee is appointed.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes a new section to consolidate the existing law as to the powers of personal representatives to sell property and act as trustees.  The section will extend that law to all property.  Although sub-section (2) (c) of Section 7 of the Bill proposes to give personal representatives the same powers, rights, duties and liabilities over real estate as they have over personal estate, we think, on reconsideration, that it is desirable to set out clearly the powers of sale of personal representatives, as is proposed in this amendment, the law as to the position of purchasers from them, as is proposed in amendment No. 23, and also the law as to transfers and assents by personal representatives, as is proposed <Col N="434" /> in amendments Nos. 24, 25 and 26.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (1) of the proposed new section contained in this amendment applies the former law, as to the powers of personal representatives to sell personal property, to all property However, it expressly requires them to take into account, so far as practicable, the wishes of the beneficiaries.  Personal representatives have always had an absolute power of sale over personal estate in order to pay the debts and distribute the estate amongst those entitled to it.  It is for the purchaser to see to it that the wishes of the beneficiaries have been complied with but the law is that he must act in good faith.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) (a) deals with the power of sale of land by some or one only of several joint personal representatives. The sub-section extends the existing provisions of the law as to compulsorily registered land to all land.  These provisions are contained in Section 86 (2) of the Registration of Title Act, 1891, as amended by Section 20 of the Registration of Title Act, 1942.  If the amendment is accepted the provisions in these Acts will no longer be necessary and their repeal is proposed in amendments Nos. 30 and 31.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) is an interpretation provision.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) extends to all land the existing provisions of the Registration of Title Acts, 1891 and 1942, as the powers of personal representatives to act as trustees of a settlement created by a will which does not appoint trustees.  It is proposed to repeal these provisions in amendments Nos. 30 and 31.  The law as proposed in sub-section (4) of the proposed new section will apply to all personal representatives proving the will and will make them trustees for all purposes.  At present as regards compulsorily registered land only proving executors are trustees and they are trustees only for the purposes of the Registration of Title Act, 1891 or the Settled Land Acts, 1882 to 1890. Accordingly, if the will appoints no executors, persons who take out administration with the will annexed <Col N="435" /> are not trustees of any settlement contained in the will.  Furthermore, even if there are executors, such executors are not trustees for all purposes.  Sub-section (4) of the proposed new section cures these defects.</P>

      <P>We will have to try and stir the muddy water between now and the Report Stage.  Before we do that, I want to ask a specific question. I want to make my will to-day and I want to appoint executors to do a certain part of the task, and I want to appoint trustees to do another part of the task.  As far as I could gather from the Minister's explanation, my executors will have power to deal with my property in relation to what this section empowers them to do, without having any reference to the separate people who are to be the trustees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, this section, as I read it, overrides my direction contained in the will, and is not subservient <Col N="436" /> to the direction contained in the will.  I thought these would be powers that would cover the case of intestacy, but, as I understand the definition of the words &ldquo;personal representatives&rdquo;, it also covers executors, and it means executors are given powers by statute which I, as testator, do not wish to give them.  To me, that seems to entirely contrary to the whole doctrine of testamentary capacity, and I must confess I found it difficult to believe that such should be intended.</P>
    <P>There are other cases that arise. There is a case where, say, three executors are appointed.  Only two extract the grant.  There is a trust for life of lands, and the present practice is clear that when the ordinary executorship terminates, the trust begins to operate and, though the executor who has received and not extracted his grant is not an executor, he is a trustee from the moment the administration itself operates.  As far as I understand it by this section, he is no longer going to be a trustee for the purpose of the Settled Land Acts.  The other two executors alone are so declared.  That, again, is an entirely new principle in relation to the construction of testamentary documents.</P>
    <P>I should like also to know whether I am right in thinking whether the effect of this section will be that in future the court will be deprived of the jurisdiction it has at the present time of deciding whether people are or are not, fit and proper persons to be trustees for the purposes of the Settled Land Acts.</P>
    <P>As I understand this section, it means that in future, automatically, any personal representative is a fit and proper person to be a trustee for the purpose of the Settled Land Acts.  The court has always taken a very clear view that that is not so&mdash;that a person might be quite proper to be an executor or might be quite proper to be an administrator but might be not, <i>ipso facto,</i> necessarily be the person to be a trustee for the purposes of the Settled Land Acts.  I do not think we should lightly throw overboard that jurisdiction of the court by a statute. As I read this amendment, we are doing so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="437" /> Quite frankly, my reading of these amendments, before we discussed them to-day, led me to the conclusion that they were being brought in for the purpose of an alleged streamlining of administration of estates which, in fact, will not be a streamlining and which will cause more confusion and do away with many safeguards that were there before.  I do not think it is right that we should do it in this side-issue way of an amendment to this Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 7, before Section 18, but in Part III, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  A purchaser, in good faith and for value, from the personal representatives of a deceased person, of any property, being the whole or any part of the real or personal estate of the deceased person, shall be entitled to hold that property freed and discharged from any debts or liabilities of the deceased person, except such as are charged otherwise than by the will of the deceased person, and from all claims of the persons beneficially entitled thereto, and shall not be concerned to see to the application of the purchase money.</P>
      <P>(2)  (a) This sub-section applies to all property other than registered land.</P>
      <P>(b) A purchaser in good faith and for value of any property to which this sub-section applies, being the whole or any part of the real or personal estate of a deceased person, which has been transferred by the personal representatives to the person entitled thereto or to the vesting of which in the person entitled thereto the personal representatives have assented, shall be entitled to hold that property freed and discharged from the claims of creditors of the deceased person except claims of which the purchaser had actual or constructive notice at the time of his purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed section consolidates the existing ordinary or non-statutory law as to <i>bona fide</i> purchasers from personal representatives of personal property and extends it to all property. The law always favours a purchaser who buys in good faith and for value. A purchaser cannot be expected to satisfy himself that a sale by a personal representative is being made in the <Col N="439" /> ordinary course of administering the property.</P>
    <P>This amendment is a corollary to amendment No. 22 which deals with the power of personal representatives to sell.</P>

      <P>I do not want to score petty points by cross-examining the Minister on legal points.  I could not expect him to know them without seeking advice.  I always understood that, when you sold as a personal representative, the purchaser was not concerned.  That is why you convey or assign as a personal representative.  That is the existing law.  I see, at the side of this amendment, the word &ldquo;New&rdquo;. That is what puzzles me&mdash;amendment No. 23 (1).  I understood that was the law.  I can assure the Minister that, in relation, shall we say, to the assignment of leasehold estates, it is the law. Why the word &ldquo;New&rdquo; is there at the side, beats me.  I am a suspicious person, as the Minister knows.  It makes me think that there is something more at the back of it than I can spot.</P>

One does that every day.

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, before Section 18, but in Part III, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In this section and in section * of this Act&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) references to the land of a testator are references to land to which the testator or intestate was entitled or over which he exercised a general power of appointment by will;</P>
      <P>(b) &ldquo;person entitled&rdquo; includes, in relation to any estate or interest in the land of a testator or intestate&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) the person or persons (including the personal representatives of the testator or intestate or any of them) who (whether by devise, bequest, devolution or otherwise) may be beneficially entitled to that estate or interest, and <Col N="441" /> (ii) the trustee or trustees or the personal representatives or representative of any such person or persons.</P>
    <P>(2)  Without prejudice to any other power conferred by this Act on personal representatives with respect to any land of a testator or intestate, the personal representatives may at any time after the death of the testator or intestate execute an assent vesting any estate or interest in any such land in the person entitled thereto or may transfer any such estate or interest to the person entitled thereto, and may make the assent or transfer either subject to or free from a charge for the payment of any money which the personal representatives are liable to pay.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where an assent or transfer under sub-section (2) of this section is made subject to a charge for all moneys, if any, which the personal representatives are liable to pay, all liabilities of the personal representatives in respect of the land shall cease, except as to any acts done or contracts entered into by them before the assent or transfer.</P>
    <P>(4)  At any time after the expiration of one year from the death of an owner of land, if the personal representatives have failed on the request of the person entitled to transfer, by assent or otherwise, the land to the person entitled, the court may, if it thinks fit, on the application of the person entitled and after notice to the personal representatives, order that the transfer be made, and in default of compliance with that order within the time specified therein by the court, may make an order vesting the land in the person entitled as fully and effectually as might have been done by a transfer thereof by the personal representatives.</P>
    <P>(5)  An assent not in writing shall not be effectual to pass any estate or interest in land.</P>
    <P>(6)  The statutory covenants implied by a person being expressed in a deed to convey as personal representative shall also be implied in <Col N="442" /> any assent signed by a personal representative unless the assent otherwise provides.</P>
    <P>(7)  It shall not be lawful for some or one only of several joint personal representatives, without leave of the court, to make an assent or transfer under this section, save that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) where probate is granted to one or some of several persons named as executors, whether or not power is reserved to the others or other to prove, such assent or transfer may, notwithstanding any other provision or rule of law to the contrary, be made by the proving executor or executors, without leave of the court as fully and effectually as if all the persons named as executors had concurred therein;</P>
    <P>(b)  when the proving executor or executors exercise any power conferred by paragraph (a) of this sub-section, this section and sections ** and ** shall have effect as if references therein to personal representatives were references to the proving executor or executors.</P>
    <P>(8)  Where one of two or more proving executors has died, references in sub-section (7) of this section to a proving executor or executors shall be construed as references to the survivor or survivors (as the case may be) of the proving executors.</P>
    <P>(9)  This section shall not operate to impose any stamp duty in respect of an assent.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to set out clearly the general law as to assents or transfers by personal representatives. Assents or transfers are necessary in order to convey the land to the persons entitled to it under the will or on intestacy.  These persons may be entitled as trustees appointed by the will or as ordinary beneficiaries under the will or on an intestacy.  Special provisions as to assents or transfers in the case of unregistered land and in the case of registered land are proposed in amendments Nos. 25 and 26.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> Sub-section (1) of the proposed amendment contains an interpretation provision.</P>
    <P>Sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) propose to consolidate the provisions of Section 87 of the Registration of Title Act, 1891, which applies to compulsorily registered land only, and to extend these provisions to all land.  It is proposed to repeal Section 87 of the 1891 Act in amendment No. 30.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (5) provides that all assents shall be in writing and this sub-section will extend the existing law as to compulsorily registered land to all land.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (6) provides that the statutory covenants implied in a deed of conveyance by a personal representtative shall also be implied in any assent.  Section 7 of the Conveyancing Act, 1881, provides that, where a person conveys land as personal representative, there shall be implied in the conveyance a covenant against incumbrances, which covenant shall be deemed to extend to every such person's own acts.  The implied covenant is to the effect that the person conveying has not done any act whereby the conveyance may be impeached or the person who conveys hindered from conveying in the manner in which the property is expressed to be conveyed. It is only reasonable that a similar covenant should be implied where a personal representative executes an assent.</P>
    <P>Sub-sections (7) and (8) correspond with sub-section (2) of the section contained in amendment No. 22.  It is proposed to consolidate and extend to all land the provisions of Section 86 (2) of the Registration of Title Act, 1891, as amended by Section 20 of the Registration of Title Act, 1942.  Under amendments Nos. 30 and 31, these provisions will be repealed.</P>

      <P>In page 7, before Section 18, but in Part III, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  An assent to the vesting of any estate or interest in unregistered land of a testator or intestate in favour of the person entitled thereto shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) be in writing.</P>
      <P>(b) be signed by the personal representatives,</P>
      <P>(c) be deemed, for the purposes of the Registration of Deeds Act, 1707, to be a conveyance of that estate or interest from the personal representatives to the person entitled,</P>
      <P>(d) operate, subject to the provisions of the Registration of Deeds Act, 1707, with respect to priorities, to vest that estate or interest in the person entitled subject to such charges and incumbrances, if any, as may be specified in the assent and as may otherwise affect that estate or interest.</P>
      <P>(e)  subject to the provisions of the Registration of Deeds Act, 1707, be deemed (unless a contrary intention appears therein) for all purposes necessary to establish the title of the person entitled to intervening rents and profits to relate back to the death of the deceased person so, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall operate to enable any person to establish a title inconsistent with the will of the deceased person.</P>
      <P>(2)  Any person in whose favour as assent or conveyance of any unregistered land is made by personal representatives may at his own expense require the personal representatives to register that assent or conveyance in the Registry of Deeds pursuant to the Registration of Deeds Act, 1707.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> The proposed section contains the special provisions applicable to assents by personal representatives in the case of unregistered land.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (1) contains detailed provisions in regard to assents.  An assent must be in writing, it is being deemed for the purposes of the Registration of Deeds Act to be a conveyance, and, for the purposes of rents and profits, it will relate back to death.  The advantages of writing are obvious.  A beneficiary is more easily protected against a later conveyance by the personal representatives to some other person, as he can have the assent registered in the Registry of Deeds and so obtain priority against a later conveyance affecting the land. Paragraphs (c) and (d) do not make registration in the Registry of Deeds compulsory, but it would be foolish for a beneficiary not to have the assent registered.  In the case of compulsorily registered land, an assent or transfer by the personal representative must be in the prescribed form and must be registered.  Otherwise, the beneficiaries could not deal with the land.  The folio is conclusive as to the title to such land, and the ownership of the land and charges thereon have to be set out in the folio.  Special provisions as to registered land are proposed in amendment No. 26. Dealings with unregistered land are registered in the Registry of Deeds, but registration of deeds is not compulsory.  However, conveyances affecting unregistered land are always registered because registration gives priority as from the date of registration.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2)  enables the beneficiary to require the personal representatives to register in the Registry of Deeds an assent or conveyance.  The registration is at the expense of the beneficiary and this is considered to be a fairer provision than one which would put the expense on the estate. The proposed provision will bring the law as to registration in the Registry of Deeds into conformity with what appears to be the law as to registration of assents or transfers in the Land Registry.</P>

      <P>In page 7, before Section 18, but in Part III, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  For sub-section (2) of Section 37 of the Act of 1891, as amended by Section 27 of and the Second Schedule to the Registration of Title Act, 1942 (No. 26 of 1942), in its application to the estates of persons dying on or after the 1st day of January, 1959, there shall be substituted the following sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  On the death of a sole registered full owner of land, or of the survivor of several registered full owners of land, not being registered as tenants in common (which owner or survivor is in the succeeding provisions of this section referred to as the deceased owner), the personal representatives of the deceased owner shall alone be recognised by the registering authority as having any rights in respect of the land, and any registered dispositions by them shall have the same effect, as if they were the registered owners of the land.</P>
      <P>(3)  The production of an assent or transfer from the personal representatives in the prescribed form shall authorise the registering authority to register the person named in such assent or transfer as the full owner or limited owner of the land, as the case may be.</P>
      <P>(4)  Where the High Court or the Circuit Court makes an order under sub-section (4) of section * of the Administration of Estates Act, 1958, vesting registered land in any person, it may also order that that person be registered as owner of that land either solely or jointly with the personal representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> (5)  Save as provided by sub-section (4) of this section, nothing in the Administration of Estates Act, 1958, shall operate to require the registering authority to register as the owner of land a person in his capacity as personal representative.</P>
    <P>(6)  In this section &ldquo;land&rdquo; includes a leasehold estate, within the meaning of Section 53 of this Act, and any right referred to in sub-section (1)  of Section 54 of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where, on the application of any person claiming to be registered under the Act, of 1891 as owner of registered land, in succession to a deceased full owner of such lands, the court is satisfied&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) that at least six years have elapsed since the death of the deceased full owner, and</P>
    <P>(b)  that the personal representatives of such owner are dead or out of jurisdiction,</P>
    <P>the court may, if it thinks fit, notwithstanding anything in the Act of 1891 of this Act, dispense the applicant from the necessity of raising representation to the deceased full owner or of giving notice to his personal representatives, and may order that the applicant be registered as owner of the land.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with special provisions as to registered land.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in sub-section (1) to extend to all registered land the existing provisions of the Registration of Title Acts, 1891 and 1942, as to compulsorily registered land.  Sub-section (37) (2) of the 1891 Act is concerned with pure realty only, and it does not apply to personal property or to compulsorily registered land.  The provisions proposed to be substituted for Section 37 (2) of the 1891 Act will apply to all registered land, whether compulsorily registered or not.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of the proposed new section allows the court after a lapse of six years from the death of a registered owner to order that an applicant for registration be registered <Col N="448" /> as full owner.  The order will be made if the court is satisfied that the personal representatives of the deceased owner are dead or out of the jurisdiction.  The sub-section will extend to all registered land the provisions of Section 21 of the Registration of Title Act, 1942.  This section now applies only to compulsorily registered land.</P>

      <P>(c) The Supreme Court and High Court (Fees) Order, 1956 (S.I. No. 251 of 1956), which said Order was made under Section 65 of the Act of 1936, shall apply in respect of each district probate registry and each district probate registrar as it applies to the Probate Office and the Probate Officer respectively subject to the following modifications:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) the references to offices of the Supreme Court and High Court shall include references to a district probate registry,</P>
      <P>(ii) the reference to an officer of the Supreme Court or the High Court shall include a reference to a district probate registrar,</P>
      <P>(iii) the references to the Probate Office and the Probate Officer shall include references to a district probate registry and a district probate registrar respectively.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="449" /> (2) (a) Where a person (in this sub-section referred to as the acting district probate registrar) is for the time being required and authorised, by the Minister for Justice under Section 9 of the Court Officers Act, 1945 (No. 25 of 1945), as amended by Section 5 of the Court Officers Act, 1951 (No. 8 of 1951), to perform the duties of district probate registrar for the district served by a particular district probate registry, the said Minister may authorise a specified officer serving in that district probate registry or in the Circuit Court Office which serves the area within which such district probate registry is located to execute, during the temporary absence or temporary incapacity through illness of the acting district probate registrar, the office of district probate registrar for that district and, if the said Minister does so, then such officer shall, during any such temporary absence or temporary incapacity, have and exercise all the powers and fulfill all the duties of the district probate registrar for that district unless and until the said Minister otherwise directs.</P>
    <P>(b)  Paragraph (a) of this sub-section shall be deemed to have come into operation on the commencement of Section 9 of the Court Officers Act, 1945.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to replace Section 18 of the Bill by a new section.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (1) will allow the Minister for Justice to prescribe fees for the district probate registries.  It is not possible to do this under the existing law, because these registries are not offices established by the Court Officers Act, 1926.  At present the fees in the Probate Office in Dublin are double those in the district registries.  The sub-section will remedy this anomaly by providing that the 1956 Fees Order dealing with Supreme and High Court offices will apply to the district registries in the same way as it applies to the Probate Office.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) proposes to allow the Minister for Justice to appoint an <Col N="450" /> officer to perform the duties of an acting district probate registrar, where such acting registrar is temporarily absent or incapacitated.  There is no power to do this at the moment.  The county registrar acts as district probate registrar in each of the local registries.  There is, however, no statutory provision to enable an officer in the Circuit Court office to carry out the duties of district probate registries when the county registrar is on leave.  Paragraph (b) of the sub-section seeks to validate any acts done by an officer who has performed the duties of the acting district probate registrar.</P>

      <P>I find it hard to understand what is the necessity for Section 20.  I understood that by the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957, we had definitely come to certain conclusions about express trustees and constructive trustees.  As I understood it, the position is that anything tainted with fraud prevents the title being secured by anybody, express or constructive trustees.  I understood the position was complicated in regard to trustees of a constructive type who hold some part of the property, but I thought the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957, agreed that the statute could run in that person's favour so that they could obtain title after a certain number of years.  What is added by this?  The explanatory memorandum says this is an extension.  It says that Section 20 &ldquo;will re-enact in an extended form ...&rdquo; What is the extension?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I was indicating that, for a number of reasons, it was felt that the interests of apprentices, employers and trade unions and the interests of the country at large could be better served if this problem of apprentices were tackled on the lines the Minister himself indicated as the correct approach in a letter to the trade union movement about November, 1952.  I understood he indicated that all parties agreed that some form of overhaul was necessary and that in his view, that overhaul, as well as improvement in the existing machinery, could best be dealt with on a basis of voluntary co-operation rather than by mandatory legislation.  As I mentioned before&mdash; and I do not want to unduly stress the point&mdash;it appears the Minister has now departed from the point of view stated by him and the point of view with which every responsible person in the country would agree.  When you come to the problem of training apprentices for skilled trades and for crafts, what is necessary above all is that the understanding, voluntary co-operation and assistance of the workers already in the trades will be forthcoming, co-operation which I believe cannot be obtained by any form of mandatory legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Section 48, the Minister referred to the obstruction of employers in carrying out the directions of the apprenticeship committee or the <Col N="455" /> council.  On that point alone, surely the Minister and every Deputy realise that if, in the employment of any employer, there are one or two craft workers of a certain craft and one apprentice, the apprentice cannot obtain adequate training in his trade, except with the voluntary and wholehearted co-operation of the craftsman. There is no means known to man that can compel a skilled craftsman to train, guide and advise the lad whom he is supposed to train in the skills of his trade, if he does not feel like doing it, and no Order of a Minister or of any committee will have any effect.  If a case arises where such a skilled craftsman does not give wholehearted support, will there be recourse to inflicting penalties under the penal clauses?</P>
    <P>To come back again to what is fundamental here, in relation to the council, there is provision, first of all, for the appointment of a chairman by the Minister.  You will note that Section 10 provides that the chairman shall be described as a director.  With all due respect, I think that is a mistaken approach if one hopes to get co-operation from a representative group of trade unions and from employers.  We find that the representation will be four persons whom the Minister considers to be representative of employers, four persons whom the Minister considers representative of workers, and three others who will be selected on the basis of being representative of some educational body or other and who will be appointed in consultation with the Minister for Education.  Therefore, you have four employers, four workers&mdash;if we accept for the moment that they are properly representatives &mdash;three representatives from an educational authority of some kind, and the chairman.</P>
    <P>The present bodies looking after apprenticeship and other matters between employers and workers operate on the basis of equal numbers from each side.  In the case of the joint labour committee set up under the Industrial Relations Act, there is provision for a chariman appointed by the Minister and independent members. <Col N="456" /> The employers and workers are equal in number, but no decision of that body is entirely binding on the workers.  They only fix minimum standards, minimum rates of wages, minimum hours of work, minimum overtime rates in the industry for which the joint labour committee operates, and there is nothing to prevent the organised workers in the industry seeking, as they do, and obtaining, as they do in many cases, better rates of wages, better hours of work and better conditions of employment than those set down in those Schedules.</P>
    <P>This council, or comhairle, as it is described here, will be given an almost overriding authority and being set up in that way, it will appear to the representatives of the skilled workers or craft workers to be a council in which the dice is loaded against them the whole time.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the fear of the trade unions that opening wide the gates to allow a higher proportion of apprentices into various trades would be looked upon with suspicion because it would be regarded as an effort by certain unscrupulous employers to endeavour to carry on their own section of the industry with cheap labour.  I agree with the Minister that that suspicion would be there and that suspicion would be strengthened in the light of this Bill and of Sections 10 and 11.</P>
    <P>In Sections 25 and 26, it is proposed that there be educational and age qualifications.  We are all agreed that it is essential to increase the general educational standards of our people. However, we do not appear to be going about it the right way.  Here we have a proposal to make an educational standard for skilled tradesmen, while many hundreds of skilled tradesmen down the years have demonstrated that although they might be lacking to some degree in formal education, their ability to carry out their work expertly in their own trade has not in any way suffered.  The fact that a lad's formal educational standard may not be very high does not necessarily mean that he is not a first-class mason or carpenter, a first-class butcher or tradesman.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that these <Col N="457" /> qualifications will be decided, not by the mutual consent of representatives of the employers of industries and the direct representatives of the workers concerned, but by a committee mainly comprised of three categories&mdash;those who, in the Minister's view, represent the employers; those who, in the Minister's view, represent the workers; and somebody brought in from the educational field.</P>
    <P>In Section 35, there is a suggestion that an apprenticeship committee might be empowered to determine the number of apprentices to be permitted in any particular area.  The present basis of operation, which is accepted generally by responsibly employers, is that the ratio of apprentices shall be such as to ensure reasonably that the apprentices who devote their time to the particular trade will have some hope of employment at that trade.  We know that in recent years, of course, that position has gone completely out of balance, because of the reduction in employment in the building industry. We know there is little definite hope amongst those who served their time in that industry that they will be able to work as skilled craftsmen in their own country.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether in farming this Bill consideration was given to the question of training apprentices for work outside the country.  If we are to depart from the recognised voluntary efforts, we would like to know whether the Minister has in mind any question of endeavouring to see that more lads are apprenticed in industry than can be absorbed in a reasonable time in our own country.</P>
    <P>I notice that in Sections 38 and 39 the Minister has set out various principles governing the examination of persons undergoing an apprenticeship period.  In sub-section (2) of Section 38, the Bill says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The conditions governing entry for examinations under this section shall be determined by the apprenticeship committee concerned after consultation with the Minister for education.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> It goes on in the next section to set out the conditions in which certificates will be issued to those who qualify for the trade by passing two examinations. What the trade unions are concerned with is whether the apprentices will get employment, not certificates; and it is because of their overriding concern with this phase of the matter that they have gone on record, I understand, and informed the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that as far as their constituent bodies are concerned, they feel that this Bill should not be passed.</P>
    <P>If the Minister sincerely desires that any difficulties or problems in connection with the training of young workers be removed and if he sincerely desires the active co-operation of the trade unions, both in the Irish Trade Union Congress and the Congress of Irish Unions, surely even at this stage he should pay them the compliment of accepting that they have a primary interest in the matter and agree to defer consideration of this Bill until after he has had discussions with representatives of those bodies?</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, can put the gun to the heads of the members of the House.  There is no doubt about it he has got a majority and he can carry the Second Stage and the subsequent stages just as he will.  He can put it on the Statute Book but I feel if it goes on the Statute Book, either in its present form or as amended on the Committee Stage, and is not a Bill that is welcomed by both sides of industry, it will be of no positive value in dealing with the problems outlined by the Minister.  While sections of the Bill propose that in certain cases penalties of £2, £10 or £20 can be enforced, nobody can enforce co-operation.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister was sincere in 1952 when he said that he felt that the problem could best be dealt with by the parties concerned.  I have no doubt that in the light of the developments within the trade union movement since 1952, and particularly in the light of developments in the last 12 to 18 months, the Minister will be doing a good day's work if he decides not to exercise the powers he has in persisting in this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pretty generally agreed that an Apprenticeship Bill is a desirable thing.  I suggest to the Minister that if we are to get an Apprenticeship Bill to work, it is highly desirable that it should be an agreed Bill and the more closely we can approximate to that desirable end the more likely are the Minister's efforts to be attended with success.  It is pretty generally agreed that, for special reasons, into which it is now unnecessary to go, to get adequate consultation with the trade union movement on this question of apprenticeship regulation was extremely difficult up to 12 to 18 months ago, but that there is a development now by which the Minister would have available to him a body representative of the whole trade union movement by which he would have profitable discussions on the problems here involved.</P>
      <P>In the light of that, fact, he would be very much better advised to have these discussions before the next stage of this Bill comes before the House. I am fully aware of the fact that in his opening statement the Minister said that he was anxious for a protracted period to elapse before the next stage, during which period he would be happy to hear representations from any quarter which had an interest in the matters dealt with in this Bill, and with the firm intention of giving the most sympathetic consideration to any such representations.  He would probably get a very much more constructive reaction if, instead of asking the House to accept this Bill as at present framed, he would conduct these consultations before the Second Stage is completed and it is not impossible that he might be obliged to come back and say: &ldquo;I have done my very best to get a substantial measure of agreement.  I cannot get it and in the absence of that I am now offering the House the best solution I can work out from the consultations that have taken place.&rdquo; The House would view that situation much more sympathetically than the situation in which the Minister dumps a Bill upon us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was presented a fortnight ago.  I am not very fretful one way or the other about the Bill but I believe that, if this problem is to be dealt with effectively, you do require in substance an agreed measure which everybody concerned is prepared to work.  It is not the kind of Bill you can enforce if you beget a situation in which the important parties to it simply stick their heels in the ground and refuse to play.  You cannot make a man teach an apprentice if he does not want to.  What you want is to encourage the craftsman, or the employer, to provide agreed facilities for the apprentice so that you will have competent apprentices in fair numbers.</P>
      <P>I know that many of us who do not belong to craft unions feel that craft unions are unduly conservative in the matter of restricting entry to their trade.  That creates very serious problems for consumers who after all are a party to all these proceedings. I am obliged to recall, when sometimes I am stirred to irritation by the attitude adopted by certain craft unions, that there are such organisations as the Pharmaceutical Chemists' Association, the Incorporated Law Society, the veterinary profession, and even the Bar Council, and that they go about their restrictive practices quite as much as the craft unions but not in so crude a manner as the craft unions.  They take quite good care that, in so far as they are able to do so, there will not be too many chemist shops opened and that there will be some restrictions on those entering solicitors', veterinary and other professions, so that all the restrictive activities are not on the side of the trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of us is a saint in this matter but if there are difficulties, and I <Col N="461" /> think there may be, in regard to this whole problem of apprenticeship I am certain they cannot be overcome without common discussion on all sides. I sympathise somewhat with the Minister's impatience in trying to bring this matter to a head.  I often had the same impatience in other matters when I was Minister for Agriculture, but I believe that in the long run, particularly about a matter which is not excruciatingly urgent, it is worth while having preliminary discussions with interested parties so that they will not feel that they are having their heads knocked together.  Being the kind of people we are, we do not like having our heads knocked together and, in the special circumstances attaching to this Bill, to evoke that reaction is to make the effective operation of this Bill terribly difficult.  There is another reason why preliminary consultation is requisite, quite apart from the susceptibility of the trade unions. I know that Deputy Norton possibly feels that if a good Apprenticeship Bill is to come before the House it should be made as widely applicable as possible.</P>
    <P>I want to put another view to the Minister.  I think we should be careful in delegating to the apprenticeship board the arenas in which they are to function.  I think, for instance, that an apprenticeship board eminently suited to deal with crafts and industrial relations of that character might go very far wrong in an effort to deal with the general apprenticeship question in the retail distributive trade in rural Ireland.  A competent apprenticeship board under this Bill&mdash;or Act, if it becomes an Act&mdash;which was familiar with conditions obtaining in Dublin, Cork and Limerick might make regulations eminently suitable for such conditions and which would create chaos in the small towns of rural Ireland.  When I recall the numbers of boys who move from farm homes into trade and industry through the medium of apprenticeship to a local trader it appeals me to think what might happen if an inappropriately rigid code of apprenticeship rules were set up which made it virtually impossible for the average <Col N="462" /> small business man in rural Ireland to take apprentices at all.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are familiar with conditions in rural Ireland know of our own personal knowledge men who entered into a very elemental kind of apprenticeship agreement with traders in rural Ireland but who are to-day in a very large way of business which they would never have secured if they had not started with the rudimentary agreement which obtains up and down the country.</P>
    <P>I did not infer from the Minister's reply, when I questioned him as to whether it was possible for this Bill to be operated for the retail distributive trade what Deputy Norton perceived &mdash;that there was a profound reluctance on the part of the Minister to contemplate that.  I gathered that it was a matter of complete indifference to him, that the board would decide that themselves.  I do not think he is right in that.  If he had prior consultation with a body like R.G.D.A.T.A. which is familiar with the rural distributive trade rather than the large city emporia, they would bring to his attention certain considerations in that respect that might induce him to say that, certainly at this stage, the Oireachtas would decide on the merits that conditions of apprenticeship in the rural distributive trade would not be subject to regulation by the apprenticeship board envisaged under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the period of waiting which the Minister envisages between the Second Stage and the Committee Stage may prove adequate for representations of that kind to be made, considered and possibly accepted, in regard to that specific problem, but I think the Labour Deputies are right in saying that an attempt to short-circuit consultation with the trade union movement may beget so much ill-feeling that the whole Bill will be put in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>It is probably a good thing to have a Bill drafted along the general lines of this Bill for, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, it is drafted on the lines of the report made by the Commission on Juvenile Employment, but I think it is an antediluvian approach to these problems to proceed as though you did not think the trade union movement <Col N="463" /> existed.  That may have been appropriate to 1857 or 1858 but it is not appropriate to 1957 or 1958.</P>
    <P>I believe there is no country in the world functioning under our kind of institutions in which it is thought expedient to make that approach at this time.  Any of us who have any experience of trade or industry will say to the Minister what he himself probably already knows, that the best way to create bad labour relations is to ignore the trade unions.  On the whole we have here a trade union movement which is rationally led and, if one deals with it openly and frankly, in the vast majority of cases one can deal with it satisfactorily and reasonably expeditiously.</P>
    <P>It is true, and I have said it before, that where there is a great problem of 30 or 40 unions representing the employees of one firm such as C.I.E., the difficulty of dealing with labour relations is infinitely complicated.  I think we all know that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and his predecessor had the problem in connection with this business that there was more than one body which professed to speak for the trade unions movement here.  I think I am right in saying that within the last 12 months developments have taken place which would give the Minister reasonable ground for hope that he could now have discussions with one body which could express the trade union view to him on this whole apprenticeship problem.</P>
    <P>If he takes my advice he will agree to postpone the Second Reading of this Bill until such time as those consultations take place.  If he accepts that advice then I invite him to look into the question I have raised of whether apprenticeship in the rural distributive trade should be made subject to general regulations of the kind envisaged under this Bill.  But I do not think the same urgency applies to that representation as applies to the desirability to consult the trade union movement before the House is asked to pass the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not accept my advice the case will be made, and many people will believe it, that the <Col N="464" /> Minister is holding a pistol at their heads.  If the Minister has prior consultation, then those who make that case afterwards cannot expect any reasonable person to accept their point of view.  As things are at present I think the Minister is giving the trade unions ground for legitimate apprehension. That is, I think, a bad point of departure from which to embark upon this Bill.  I would ask the Minister for the purpose of securing successful administration of this legislation to make a concession which, as Deputy Larkin pointed out, he need not make.  He has a majority and he can use it, but there never was a time when a person should be more scrupulous in using a majority than the time when he has the majority.</P>

      <P>Nobody will deny that the object of this Bill is desirable. Many industries, particularly those in rural areas where labour is not organised, are deplorably in need of rules and regulations governing the admission and the careers of youths going into the various services in this country covered by industrial relations. Nobody will deny that there is a good deal of exploitation of juvenile labour and the apprenticeship system at the moment.  All of us would welcome a Bill to remedy the grievances which exist, but it is to the way in which that object is achieved and the method adopted that we on the Labour Benches object.  Deputy Dillon struck the really important point governing labour relations in relations to this Bill: one can make all the rules and regulations one likes, but, in the last analysis, it is the craftsmen who will decide whether or not they will train apprentices. Without the goodwill of those who have the trade, no rules or regulations made by this House, or by any other body, can be effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to postpone this Bill until such time as he has had an opportunity of discussing it with the Irish Trade Union Congress and the C.I.U.  I am aware that the Minister has said that he will consider their views and perhaps incorporate some of them through the medium of amendment on the Committee Stage.  But the very principle of this Bill is objectionable <Col N="465" /> to the trade unions because they see the scales weighted against them. If the Bill is forced through and that objection persists, nothing but chaos will ensue.</P>
    <P>I make this appeal in all sincerity. I am trying to give the Minister the views of the combined trade unions. It is significant that there are certain exempted groups, such as clerical workers and others.  Deputy Dillon pointed out that there are other organisations which take in apprentices, such as solicitors.  Would the Minister consider the formation of any committee without consulting these groups?  Would he lay down rules and regulations without meeting the people concerned and getting their agreement?  In the interests of the trade unions and the employers, and ultimately in the interests of the country as a whole, would the Minister accept the advice we offer and postpone the Bill to some later date?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious from a study of this Bill that the Minister decided to draft a Bill covering the problems that might arise without consulting the trade unions or the employers.  He decided that the issues involved should be fought out here rather than through the medium of discussion and consultation with the interested parties.</P>
      <P>One significant feature of this Bill is the power the Minister takes unto himself in appointing members to the board.  According to the Bill, the board will consist of 11 members under a State-appointed chairman. The other ten members will act in a voluntary capacity.  Four will be representatives of the employers, four representative of the workers and three representative of educational interests.  The significant phrase is that the Minister will appoint those whom he considers to be representative. It is he who will appoint the members.  He disregards the fact that the employers' organisations may consider other people to be more representative, from their point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will appoint four persons whom he considers to be <Col N="466" /> representative of the workers' interests. He does not say that he will appoint such persons as the trade unions consider to be representative of their interests.  Three will be appointed to represent educational interests.  No indication is given as to whether or not they will be professors, professors who have never known what apprenticeship to a particular trade connotes and who have no understanding of the problems confronting young people seeking apprenticeship.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a shock.  It is a complete departure from a system which has operated reasonably well.  The last Apprenticeship Act was passed in 1931.  It is agreed that there is necessity now for certain improvements from the point of view of regulations and methods, but it is obvious from a study of this Bill that the Minister decided to have the problem threshed out here without any consultation with, or consideration for, the interests involved.</P>
    <P>In order to get a satisfactory Bill, it is essential that the Minister should now postpone this measure until such time as he has an opportunity of consulting with the main interests involved, namely, the trade unions and the employers.  He should have consulted those bodies before introducing this measure.  He has ignored those vitally concerned and he has decided apparently to put through this Bill with the help of the majority on the Government Benches.  We know there is a substantial measure of unity in the trade union movement now.  The Minister mentioned that this Bill was contemplated two years ago.  The Minister knows quite well that the position of the trade union movement has changed very considerably in those two years and he has a much better opportunity now of consulting with the trade unions than he might have had two years ago.</P>
    <P>Every parent knows the difficulty confronting children who wish to take up a trade at the present time through the machinery mainly of the vocational schools.  At present the busiest persons working in the interests of young people who have completed vocational school courses are <Col N="467" /> the vocational teachers who have completed the training and education of those young people.  A very difficult part of the work of vocational teachers is searching amongst firms and employers for apprenticeships for their students.  It is desirable that there should be, with the agreement of the various interests concerned, a new scheme whereby recruitment of apprentices could be made easier than it is at present.  Under this Bill it is proposed to establish apprenticeship districts and apprenticeship committees. That shows appreciation of the difficulties experienced by vocational teachers in placing their pupils.</P>
    <P>The Bill appears to me to be designed for a highly organised industrial economy and not for the type of economy which we have where we are trying to put industries on their feet and keep them there.  In this country there is a large number of small businesses. The provisions of the Bill, in my opinion, would work effectively with regard to the recruitment of apprentices in large concerns but we must remember the very large number of businesses which would recruit a very limited number of apprentices in the normal way.  In my opinion the Bill should be designed to meet that problem rather than, as I think this Bill is designed, for recruitment of apprentices in large numbers in large concerns.</P>
    <P>I notice that it is proposed to omit from the provisions of this Bill certain classes of activities.  For instance, it is intended that the Bill should not include agriculture, horticulture, the making of butter, cheese and other dairy products, or professional or clerical occupations.  As Deputy Dillon mentioned, there is a number of professional and clerical occupations for which there is prolonged apprenticeship. There is no need for me to particularise.  They are well known to the Minister and to the House.  It is not proposed that this Bill should in any way affect those particular activities.</P>
    <P>If I read it properly, Section 34 interferes to a great extent with individual freedom.  Section 34 says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" />&ldquo;A person who carries on a designated trade in an apprenticeship district for the purpose of the trade shall not take into his employment by way of apprenticeship in the trade and in the district any person other than a person who is registered in the register of candidates kept, under Section 40 of this Act, by the apprenticeship committee for the trade and the district.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, it is proposed that unless an apprentice is duly registered and offered by the proposed new board, he shall not be permitted to become an apprentice in any trade.  That, in my opinion, is an interference with the liberty of the individual and would force the person concerned, whether he likes it or not, to go through the board for presentation to a firm as an apprentice rather than being free to be accepted as an apprentice in the normal way by any business or firm that might wish to recruit him.  There is a number of such provisions in the Bill that are contrary to the ordinary type of freedom that one would expect for young people wishing to follow the various activities that involve apprenticeship.</P>
    <P>I would conclude by asking the Minister if he would consider the suggestion made to him already, that is, to adjourn discussion of this Bill.  It is there now in black and white.  Let him take the Bill to the employers' organisations and the trade union organisations and thresh it out with them in order that he could bring in a Bill that would be acceptable to the House and to all the interests concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that either Deputy Dillon or Deputy Rooney has grasped what all this discussion is about.  As I understood the speech made here by Deputy Norton and the speech of Deputy Larkin, there is objection not so much to this Bill, but to any Bill.  The issue being put to the House is not whether this Bill is good or bad but whether it is desirable that there should be any legislation to put right the unsatisfactory position that now exists regarding apprenticeship in many trades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first matter the Dáil has to decide therefore is whether it is desirable <Col N="469" /> that we should do anything about this matter at all by way of legislation. There is objection to our legislating about it and it is only when the nature of that objection is understood that the House will be able to understand the other points that have been raised in the discussion.</P>
    <P>Let me dispose straightaway of the suggestion that this Bill has been hastily decided upon or is being rushed through the Dáil for some reason.  I foreshadowed in 1957 the intention to introduce legislation dealing with apprenticeship.  In the course of my speech introducing the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, on 11th June last, I referred to the need for legislation to amend the existing Apprenticeship Act and I said &mdash;I am quoting from column 1534 of the Dáil Debates, No 11, Volume 168:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The proposals for new legislation which I foreshadowed last year are being developed and I should greatly welcome the views of employers, workers and of educational interests on that very important subject.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Bill, which we are now discussing, got its First Reading in the House on 17th July last.  In view of the fact that legislation was foreshadowed last year, that I invited all interested parties, in June of this year, to send me their observation on what they thought the Bill should contain, and in view of the fact that this Bill gots its First Reading four months ago, is it not reasonable to assume that everybody in this country who is interested in the subject of apprenticeship&mdash;and I am prepared to assume that the members of the Labour Party are so interested, that the trade union leaders who are members of the committees of the congresses are so interested &mdash; at least knew that there was going to be legislation, dealing with apprenticeship, debated in this House?</P>
    <P>The matter has been the subject of discussion in various parts of the country, and reports have appeared in the Press of lectures given, and of debates organised on the form of legislation that should be enacted.  Is <Col N="470" /> it not, therefore ridiculous to suggest that this Bill is being rushed in any way, that this question is being hastily thrust on the notice of the Dáil?  It was not until yesterday, however, that I received from the two trade union congresses communications indicating to me that they were objecting to any legislation on this subject.  In the case of the Congress of Irish Unions the objection was on the grounds that they thought this legislation was an unwarranted interference with the rights of the trade unions and, in the case of the Trade Union Congress, on the grounds that they thought this matter should be dealt with in another way than by legislation.</P>
    <P>Let me deal now with this suggestion that there has been some inconsistency in my attitude and that I am taking a different line from what I took in 1952. 1952 is six years ago and if I thought, then, as many other people thought, that this question of defective arrangements for apprenticeship was worth attention, surely the time which has elapsed since then with nothing accomplished would justify us in considering a change in the attitude we adopted then.  In 1952, I initiated discussions with the two trade union congresses and the Federated Union of Employers with a view to the formulation of agreed measures for the improvement of apprenticeship schemes.  There were discussions on that matter, from which it emerged that there was general agreement on the need for the improvement of the existing apprenticeship arrangements, and the view was generally held that, if possible, these improvements should be effected through voluntary co-operation between the parties directly concerned, rather than by way of legislation.</P>
    <P>I accepted that view in 1952 and I am still of that view.  I am still strongly of opinion that if we could get this matter put right by voluntary action between the parties concerned, legislation could be avoided, but I am not prepared to accept the view that we should do nothing if voluntary action is not going to be taken.</P>
    <P>On 4th November, 1952, I sent to these congresses and organisations the communication to which Deputy Norton referred, and from which he <Col N="471" /> quoted; but he left out from his quotation the part that, from my point of view, was most important.  In that letter, having dealt with the matter in the manner in which Deputy Norton indicated I went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As already emphasised the Minister would be only too anxious to leave to the organisations of workers and employers the establishment of a satisfactory system for regulating apprentices, but the Minister must also emphasise that he cannot remain indifferent to the outcome of any dicussions on the lines proposed.  For this reason, and in order to help with the business of the proposed meeting, he has drawn up draft headings of what appear to be to him the essential foundations of any apprenticeship scheme.  In drawing up these headings the Minister has been influenced by the recommendations of the Commission of Youth Employment whose statement of general principles on this subject of apprenticeship he accepts. I am to inquire whether these headings appear to you to provide an adequate and satisfactory basis for the purpose of the proposed discussion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The letter then went on to suggest a conference to discuss the matter.</P>
    <P>For reasons, which Deputy Norton explained, arising out of internal problems in the trade union movement at the time, the Congress of Irish Unions refused to attend the conference, and attempts made to have separate discussions with the two trade union congresses, in conjunction with the Federated Union of Employers, failed.  There the matter stood and it certainly appeared to me that we were deadlocked, that there was no means by which we could proceed to get action on this matter in the way everybody accepted was most desirable, by voluntary co-operation between the parties.</P>
    <P>In the following year, in May, 1953, I decided that the headings of a Bill should be prepared, on the general lines of the Bill now before the Dáil, and that the organisations should be given the opportunity of commenting <Col N="472" /> upon these draft heads before the question of proposing legislation was brought to the Government.  There the matter ended, as far as I was concerned at that time.</P>
    <P>May I say that I have very considerable sympathy with Deputy Norton in his task here this afternoon. He has been arguing to a brief supplied to him by the Trade Union Congresses, a brief in which I know he does not personally believe.  Indeed, Deputy Norton, who was my successor as Minister for Industry and Commerce, prepared and circulated to these organisations the draft headings of a Bill which he asked them to consider, and which he made clear were sent to them only for consideration, and on which he invited their views.</P>
    <P>The draft headings of this Bill which he circulated, and which was suggested to be the type of legislation he thought he might introduce, provided for the establishment of a central committee of the kind I am proposing, with a slightly different composition, with powers to set up trade apprenticeship committees which in turn would have all the powers I am proposing to give them in this Bill.  For a very long time, the effect of that action of his was nil.  Deputy Norton sent these draft headings to the organisations concerned in March, 1956, but nothing significant happened as a result until December of that year.</P>

      <P>The net result of it all was that the Trade Union Congresses signified, in December, 1956, that they were opposed to any proposals which envisaged an overall apprenticeship scheme based on legislation. They did not, however, put forward any alternative proposal for consideration and nothing further was heard about the matter from them until the present Bill was circulated. As soon as copies of this Bill came from the printers it was circulated to the congresses and to other interested organisations.  They were all informed of the intention to provide for a fairly long period&mdash;between the second Reading and the Committee Stages&mdash; to give them ample opportunity to consider its provisions and an assurance that any suggestions or proposals regarding the Bill which they would put forward would be fully considered. There is no foundation for the suggestion that I am reluctant to discuss this matter with the trade unions.  On the contrary, the trade unions never have any difficulty in making contact with me.  There was no request from them to discuss this matter with me.  The perturbing feature about this business is that notwithstanding the invitation I issued here in public last June, notwithstanding the knowledge that this matter has been under consideration for years, notwithstanding the general appreciation amongst the workers of the country that there is a situation here that requires attention, no such request for action has come to me from anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it would be far better if we could get this situation dealt with in a satisfactory way by what is called voluntary action but voluntary action appears to me, in this context, to be synonymous with doing nothing.  I am not prepared to agree that in this matter we should do nothing.  Deputy MacCarthy in his speech to-day expressed the view that it would be a dereliction of our duty if we failed now to deal with the matter which we <Col N="474" /> accepted was urgent six years ago merely because of the difficulties of doing it or because of the problems which may be created for some people by our proposals.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which has been neglected for years, and, with everybody else, I am prepared to accept full responsibility for the neglect.  Twenty years ago it was obvious that we needed a revision of our apprenticeship legislation because the 1931 Act was a failure and it was clear that the conditions of apprenticeship in many trades were unfair to the country and to the young workers of the country who were seeking the opportunity of acquiring skills, under proper supervision, in conditions which would give them a reasonable chance of getting those skills, and the certificate that went with it at the end of their course of training, which would give them also the opportunities of employment which their skills would open up for them.</P>
    <P>I made it clear in my introductory speech that I am not seeking to imply that the conditions of apprenticeship are unsatisfactory in every trade.  We know there are some trades which have satisfactory arrangements.  Four trades set up apprenticeship committees which functioned under the 1931 Act.  Other trades have voluntary schemes outside that Act which appear to be quite satisfactory.  Some of them certainly could be made completely satisfactory with minor amendments. But, behind all these, there is a body of trades in respect of which apprenticeship arrangements are completely haphazard and, indeed, some where there appears to be a complete absence of supervision over the training of apprentices, and of proper co-ordination between work in the factory and the courses in the technical schools, with no assurance that apprentices are not been exploited or that the skills they set out to learn will in fact be imparted to them within the time they anticipated.</P>
    <P>We have been trying to remedy that situation now over all that period by this process of voluntary action which is suggested.  We failed.  We got nowhere. Nothing happened.  No important change has taken place.  I have <Col N="475" /> become completely satisfied that we will get nowhere without legislation; that, unless it is clear that something will be done by an effective authority the parties that should be moving in this matter will not begin to interest themselves.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied also in my mind that whatever motives may be operating in the executive committees of the trade union congresses, in seeking to put this position right we will have the support of 99 per cent. of the organised trade union workers of the country. Indeed, in my experience, it is far more frequently that one hears of the need for action in this field stressed from workers organised in trade unions than from people outside the movement. If we can get action taken by agreement, of course we will welcome it.  That is what we have been trying to do for years.  But, as action has not followed, we now have to push a little ahead.  But still the effort must be to secure agreement &mdash; agreement not merely on the general form of the Organisation that is to be set up to supervise apprenticeship but right down the line.</P>
    <P>Deputies spoke as if it was contemplated that coercive action would be taken everywhere.  That is not the manner in which I contemplate that the comhairle to be set up under this Bill would function.  They would seek to get the results they were aiming at by agreement.  The powers to act in relation to any trade &mdash; to set up a committee for the trade or to act itself as committee for the trade &mdash; would only be used in the last resort.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about the conservatism of some of the craft unions.  We have to recognise its existence.  We have to recognise that some of these unions are extremely conservative.  They are suspicious of change in any form and are particularly suspicious of change precipitated by means of legislation.  I do not know that anybody would seriously contend that the organisation of the Irish trade union movement is particularly efficient &mdash; I mean, is particularly adapted to the fulfilment of the process <Col N="476" /> of getting agreement on matters of this kind by unanimous consent.</P>
    <P>We all know that unanimity in such a matter is extremely improbable. Does that mean that if we cannot get unanimous agreement amongst all the unions likely to be affected in this matter, we are to do nothing; that none of the difficulties attending the organisation of apprenticeship in this country are to be dealt with; that the haphazard conditions prevailing in many trades are to be allowed to continue; that the defect that represents in the whole industrial organisation in the country is not to be remedied?  I do not think that point of view will be seriously put forward by anybody.  I regard the introduction of a proper system of apprenticeship and proper methods of training young workers in the old skills and in the new skills that modern industry requires as an integral part of the whole programme of national development.</P>
    <P>I do not think we could contemplate a situation being allowed to develop in which we would be in effect depriving these young workers of the opportunity of acquiring these skills.  I do not think that we should fail to do what is our obvious duty in this matter merely because there are some internal problems in the trade union movement as a whole or because some individual unions have, for reasons of their own, objections to a measure of this kind.</P>
    <P>So far as the Bill is concerned, there is not a detail in it that is not open to amendment.  I heard Deputy Norton talking about provision regarding the nomination of trade union representatives by the Minister.  I invite him to draft the amendment which would, in fact, ensure that the trade union members on An Cheard Chomhairle would be nominated direct by the appropriate trade union organisation.</P>

      <P>I sent a copy of this Bill to the two Congresses on the 17th October and I invited them to let me have their views on it.  They have no reason to believe that their views on the Bill will not get the most careful attention.  Indeed, the whole anxiety on my part would be to meet their views so long as they were consistent with the general principles we aim to secure and one of these is that there should be some central body responsible for the development in this country of a proper system of apprenticeship. We have no such central body at the moment and the 1931 Act was a failure precisely because it did not provide for any central authority set up to get apprenticeship schemes organised and with power to supervise them.  Secondly, there must be provision to ensure that, where necessary, the central body can itself take measures to ensure that apprenticeship arrangements are made.  Undoubtedly, it should seek to get its results by voluntary co-operation and agreement amongst all parties concerned in any trade but they must ultimately, if they are to get agreement, have power to act where the withholding <Col N="478" /> of agreement is in their view unreasonable.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to have in such an organisation the means by which the State can come in to help the development of apprenticeship in a sound way by providing for these grants to employers who undertake the proper training of apprentices and the means by which the suitability of the training can be regularly tested.  There must be some supervision over the training of apprentices.  We have all heard about apprentices being taken into work and left cleaning the floors or handling tools to a worker during their period of apprenticeship.  They come out at the end without having any real knowledge of the trade which they through they would get when they embarked upon their apprenticeship course.  There must be a central organisation and some form of supervision. The central organisation must be responsible for getting arrangements organised voluntarily if at all possible with financial resources provided by the State to enable them to do the things contained in the Bill and with power for the setting up of apprenticeship committees where required for any trade &mdash; committees representative of the trade.</P>
      <P>I have heard objections voiced in regard to bringing the vocational education authorities on to these committees.  I cannot understand that.  I cannot conceive of any apprenticeship scheme being worthwhile which does not provide for the closest link between the technical schools and the workshops.  The capacity of a new entrant to a trade to learn and to acquire skill depends very largely upon a proper integration of the work in the workshop and the courses in the technical schools. It seems to me not merely sensible but essential that there should be brought into this organisation of apprenticeship and kept in a key position there the representatives of technical education.  It is contemplated that they should be associated with these committees and that, under this organisation, there should be integration of training between the workshop and the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="479" /> If there is agreement that we should have legislation which will provide these essential things &mdash; they are all the headings set out in the Report on Youth Unemployment and Emigration then the details are open to any amendment that may be agreed upon between the parties.  I would be prepared to leave the drafting of the Bill in detail to these organisations provided they accept these essential principles.</P>

      <P>You will make no progress whatever in this matter unless it is quite clear that a Bill is coming on the Statute Book and that, while it can be amended, it will get through in some form or other.  We have spent six years sitting on our hunkers doing nothing about this matter.  As far as we are concerned we are not prepared to sit any longer.  If the congresses accept that there is need for action and that that action should not be longer postponed, then we can get agreement.  If these communications are intended to put this matter off for another six years, then as far as I am concerned, the Bill will get to the Statute Book in some form.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is in touch with his colleague in the Department of Education he must know that the six years we are talking about in relation to this problem exist in regard to the other fundamentals of the educational policy of the country. A substantial amount of decision requires to be taken in the Department of Education with regard to that.  I do not see the necessity for a postponement to reach the position suggested by Deputy Norton.  Even if another six months had to be spent, the fundamental facts that have to be decided and reviewed from the educational side could not be looked at in any realistic kind of way at any earlier date.</P>

Now we have got November, December, January and February.  We do not get back to the Committee Stage until February.  Would it undermine the foundations of our industrial fabric if we said: &ldquo;Instead of being bogged down on the Committee Stage of this Bill in the middle of February next, what we will do is this.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that ameliorative measures of a permanent nature for the relief of farmers in the flooded area of the Shannon Valley should be initiated immediately by the Government.</P>
      <P>Anyone listening to the Tánaiste during the discussion here for the past couple of hours must have noted the anxiety expressed as to the desire that the question of apprenticeship should be dealt with in co-operation with the trade unions and that that should be brought into consideration in the next couple of months.  Anyone listening to those statements would think it a most desirable thing that some anxiety for the good of the community would be expressed or portrayed by the other members of the Cabinet.  We all know perfectly well that the subject matter under discussion for the last couple of hours could well be postponed until there is more agreement, but on the subject matter of the motion now before the House, I think that the time is overdue for immediate action.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention to delay the House in painting a sad picture of the conditions in which people along the Shannon Valley have existed for the past 25 or 30 years.  Instead of that, it is my intention here to put on record the various statements and replies made in this House over the past ten years to queries as to the steps different Governments proposed to take to improve the conditions of the people whose homes and farms are flooded every winter along the Shannon Valley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have been in office since March of 1957.  As soon as this Dáil came into session after the general election, I had this motion placed on the Order Paper.  The motion has lain there since March of 1957 and it has been held there over the heads of the Government, in order to ensure that they would be reminded every month, while that motion remained on the Order Paper, of the conditions that obtain in the Shannon Valley.  There were, indeed, a number <Col N="487" /> of occasions on which the motion could have been discussed.  I think it would have been unfair on my part to have sprung the motion on the Government after their first two or three months in office.  No one will suggest that at this stage it is unfair, after almost two years in office, that the Government should be asked to state specifically what its programme is in connection with the Shannon Valley.</P>
    <P>My first knowledge of the whole sad problem of the Shannon drainage came to me in 1948 and 1949 when I inspected conditions along that river. I started the ball rolling here on November, 24th, 1948, by requesting the then Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that the sluice gates at Meelick were kept open and that even that slight ameliorative measure would prove beneficial to the farmers upstream whose lands were affected by flooding.  Instructions were issued, after that request here in the Dáil, to have the sluice gates opened whenever there was danger of flooding between Athlone and Meelick.</P>
    <P>The next step taken to bring the light of publicity on this problem was on 9th March, 1950 in a question here, when the Government were asked what steps they proposed to take in order to remedy the terrible conditions existing along the Shannon. The reply given by the then Parliamentary Secretary was that no practical scheme could be devised. That was a sad answer for the people concerned.  A number of other Deputies in all Parties took up the problem with their organisations and the matter was raised in this House on a number of occasions, from March, 1950 onwards, during the next two or three years.</P>
    <P>As all Deputies will remember, we had a change of Government in 1951. The incoming Parliamentary Secretary, when he was queried as to what steps this Government proposed to take in connection with flooding, replied in similar terms to those of his predecessor. The individual responsible between 1948 and 1951 was Deputy Donnellan as Parliamentary Secretary to the <Col N="488" /> Minister for Finance.  The Parliamentary Secretary from 1951 on was the late Deputy Paddy Beegan.  I find that the practice has been that, whether it was the inter-Party Government or that of Fianna Fáil, while they were out of office they were full of sympathy for the people along the Shannon Valley but when they got into office, it became a very heard and difficult task which would tax the resources of the country. So, between the two groups, the people of that locality began to lose faith completely in the words of any politician.</P>
    <P>The first sign of hope for the future came on 31st January, 1952, when the then Minister for Lands, the late Deputy Derrig, was asked by me here whether he would consider making suitable alternative proposals for those farmers whose lands were constantly inundated by the Shannon flooding. The reply of the late Deputy Derrig at that time was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is hoped to initiate a survey of this area shortly with a view to ascertaining, in consultation with other Departments, what can be done to ameliorate conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That reply was given to me in this House almost seven years ago, that a survey was shortly to be initiated to see what could be done in regard to the removal of some of those people from the terrible conditions in which they were expected to live.  The people in that area began to have some hope again.</P>
    <P>I let 12 months pass and then, on the 11th February, 1953, I questioned the late Deputy Derrig again as to what progress had been made in connection with this survey.  Again, the Minister's reply was that the survey had been made and was under examination at present.  That was the reply made on the 11th February, 1953, in this House.  I pressed him as to whether a scheme would be brought into operation to expedite the good work and get the unfortunate people removed from the locality, those who were willing and anxious to go.  That was February, 1953, and it was a Fianna Fáil Minister who said that the survey was ready, had been carried out and was under examination and this is November, <Col N="489" /> 1958, and we have a Fianna Fáil Minister in power and so far the promise of 1952 and 1953 has not been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Let us continue along the line.  Some time elapsed and in December, 1954, there was a motion before this House dealing with the problem of the Shannon.  There was also a number of questions tabled and the reply given, in brief, was to the effect that the Government were keeping the problem under review.  Around about that time, Deputies will recall, the River Tolka here in Dublin overflowed its banks, and for the first time in the history of the people of Dublin they found that water was useful for more than making tea.  They found that their mattresses were wet, their bedrooms were damp, their furniture was damaged and their homes became, for a period, very uncomfortable to live in.</P>
    <P>The result was that the Dublin people, and rightly so, called together their Deputies of all Parties and at the time the Taoiseach's office, and the corridor to it, was choked with Deputies demanding that the Government do something to relieve the flood conditions around Dublin.  Mark you, all during this period the people in the Clonown area had floods of two and three feet of water in their kitchens and their bedrooms.  They had to sleep on boards raised six inches above the flood waters but they were told all along: &ldquo;Nothing can be done for you, it is too big a problem.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the time I must say that while I was sympathetic with, and sorry for the people of Dublin who had suffered from the floods, I felt that out of evil good might come, when applied to the problem of the Shannon, because the Government, through the representations and kicks which they got from their supporters and Deputies, brought in remedial measures.  Compensation was given to the people whose homes were flooded and a general period of emergency was declared to ensure it would not happen again.  Having done all this in Dublin, naturally enough a blind eye could not be cast on the problem of the Shannon and for the first time we had a recognition by the Government, and by the general public, <Col N="490" /> of what the people in the Shannon area had to put up with.</P>
    <P>We had reporters from the newspapers down at the Shannon, day and night.  If there was a rise of one inch in the water level the reporters rushed to the telephones and the news appeared in the following day's newspapers&mdash;the dramatic statement that the Shannon had risen another inch. The extraordinary thing was that that particular flood condition was there every year for the last 30 years and there was no publicity worth talking about until the Tolka decided to rebel and left its normal course.</P>
    <P>As a result of the publicity and the pressure brought to bear on the then Government, it was decided that something must be done.  The easiest thing at the time was to ask: &ldquo;How about getting in some outside experts to see what can be done?&rdquo; Then the inter-Party Government made a big announcement that they hoped to get American engineering consultants over here who would carry out a survey of the Shannon Valley.  The House was informed to that effect and the people in the Shannon Valley were also informed that the Government were expecting a team of engineers from America under Mr. Rydell to carry out a survey.</P>
    <P>That promise was not much good to the people whose houses were flooded, to the people who had no stock or no hay for their stock or no means of conserving their crops.  At any rate, it enabled the Government to postpone the day when something would have to be done.  It gave a chance to the authorities to shelve the major problem.  However, seeing that it was a Government decision, and as everybody hoped that in the long run something of a major nature would come from such expert opinion, we waited in patience.  That information was given to us in December, that Mr. Rydell, the consultant, would be coming over here and the people in the Shannon Valley and the Deputies said: &ldquo;We had better wait awhile to see what is going to happen. We waited long enough and there is no harm waiting for some time longer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> The first question on what progress was being made by this expert came in April, 1956.  Deputy Sweetman, the then Minister for Finance, in reply to a question, stated that Mr. Rydell's final report had not yet been received. Questions were repeated from the 10th April all through July up to October, 1956, and the reply on 25th October, 1956, by Deputy Cosgrave, who was acting for the Minister for Finance, was that the report was not yet available. Then we had a change of Government and Deputy Sweetman who had been Minister for Finance decided that he would put down a question on the Shannon problem. He put down the question which I had been asking month after month. He asked the Minister for Finance, on the 20th February, 1958, what had he to say about the Rydell report. Deputy Dr. Ryan in reply said that Mr. Rydell stated that he had no simple solution for the River Shannon problem.  He recommended that preliminary engineering investigation should be undertaken of the possibility of additional lake storage, river diversion and channel improvement. The Minister for Finance added that the Government approved in principle of this recommendation and said that &ldquo;the investigation is at present being carried out jointly by the Commissioners of Public Works and the E.S.B.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is as far as we have gone, so far as I can gather, in regard to what I heard described here as &ldquo;a major report by a first-class expert on drainage&rdquo; brought over here from America as a man who should be able to teach the Board of Works engineers their functions.  As a result of that report, engineers have been chasing around the Shannon Valley inspecting the tributaries to the Shannon.  I understand that one of their recommendations, or one of the points that Mr. Rydell suggested should be investigated, was that the River Suck's channel should be changed and that instead of following into the Shannon at Ballinasloe, a new cut should be made near Athleague and that the Suck should enter the Shannon at Knockcroghery.  Engineers were paid <Col N="492" /> to go down the country and investigate this.  I do not blame the engineers; they were carrying out their work.</P>
    <P>I do not know what other suggestions were made because I find it very hard to extract the details of the plans which are hatched, but I know that these recommendations are of little benefit as far as the major problem of the Shannon is concerned, and that it is only a matter of continuing to spend money all the time, without getting down to the major issue of dealing with the people along the Shannon whose lands and houses or general accommodation are subject to flooding.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects of this with which I want to deal.  The first is in connection with Mr. Rydell's report. What progress has been made now with regard to these surveys, in connection with further lake storage and channel improvement?  What estimates, if any, are available in the Department of the likely cost of carrying out such investigations? Or shall I be told now, as I was 12 months ago, that the Board of works and the E.S.B. are still hatching this, when we know that for years past various reports and surveys were carried out by the Board of Works and the E.S.B. and that it is not now necessary to go round making an actual physical and practical resurvey of the areas?</P>
    <P>The second point I want to deal with is: what happened to the plans prepared in 1953 to give alternative holdings to the people to whom the late Deputy Derrig referred in his reply to me in 1953?  At that time, it was good to say that we were investigating and exploring and that we hoped that something would be done, but since 1953 we have had at least two very serious floods in that area, apart altogether from the number of houses and the large number of farms which are flooded from the end of November to the following January each year.</P>
    <P>I understand from a local provincial paper that the present Minister for Lands&mdash;or landlords, if you wish&mdash; when he visited a secret Fianna Fáil convention in the Midlands, announced plans for the expenditure of £100,000 on ameliorating conditions <Col N="493" /> for the farmers whose houses and lands were flooded.  I was amazed at that: the Dáil had not heard a word about it.  Naturally, attempts were made to find out what the position was and during the discussion on the Vote for the Department of Lands on July 8th, the Minister, when asked for further information about relief for the Shannon area said, at column 17, Volume 170, of the Dáil Debate:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;About £100,000 is being made available from the National Development Fund&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>mark this</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and a special corps of inspectors is being detailed to investigate all aspects and to prepare a specific scheme.  It is hoped to complete the scheme in the current year and the next year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the statement made on 8th July, last.  On 31st January, his predecessor in the same Party said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is hoped to initiate a survey of this area shortly with a view to ascertaining in conjunction with other Departments what can be done to ameliorate conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that was not sufficient, on 11th February, 1953, when I repeated a question to him as to what progress was made in the survey announced on 31st January, 1952, the late Deputy Derrig replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A survey has been made and is under examination at present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, we have the Minister for Lands saying, on 8th July, 1958, that a special corps of inspectors was being detailed to investigate and prepare a scheme.</P>
    <P>I want to know if, even at this stage, people in that locality may take as certain that the present Minister will implement a scheme this year to remove from Clonown those men whose lands and houses are flooded?  Will he be prepared to utilise the good land on the far side of the Shannon which is available to facilitate those unfortunate men who have asked for removal over the years?  I know perfectly well that there are reports in the Department of Lands from gentlemen who went down from Dublin, queried the people whose lands were flooded in <Col N="494" /> the Clonown area and asked a number of them if they would be willing to move.  The extraordinary thing is that of the list of names submitted, the majority&mdash;not supporters of mine; most of them would be supporters of Fianna Fáil, God help them!&mdash;were never asked if they would leave the locality, although it was their lands which were flooded.  Instead of that, the Minister got up here and asked: &ldquo;What could we do when these people would not leave?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fact.  They refused to leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not get better confirmation of my statement than that.  The unfortunate back benchers of the Fianna Fáil Party swallowed, hook, line and sinker, the propaganda put out, to the effect that the people in the Shannon Valley would not leave.  I know many people would not leave, but many of those whose houses and lands were flooded were not asked if they would like to leave.  These people are neither vocal nor organised and they would not get up and demand that they should be removed.  They were not asked if they would leave.</P>
      <P>All this has been threshed out on a number of occasions.  Public representatives were invited to Shannon-bridge, Banagher and elsewhere and the case was put for those people, Fianna Fáil Deputies and other were present.  They heard the people speak about the conditions.  When the Deputies left these meetings, however, they took the easy way out.  It is much easier not to bother about these unfortunate people.  It is much easier to accept the argument put forward by the Minister here: &ldquo;We asked so-and-so to go and he would not go. The rest are not worth bothering about.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time we had the truth.  I want the Minister to tell us now what specific scheme he has under way; how many families will be transferred in the next 12 months whose lands and houses are subject to flooding, how many new houses will be built and how many houses will be reconstructed? Will the scheme he <Col N="495" /> announced here on 8th July be put into operation and concluded before the end of the next 12 months?  I hope we shall have a detailed statement as to the concrete steps the Government will take to give some hope to the people in the Clonown area that the end of their misery is in sight.</P>

      <P>I was amazed at the comparison made by Deputy McQuillan between the River Tolka and the River Shannon.  Every schoolboy known that the River Shannon drains one-fifth of the surface of the country.  Surely the problems involved in the Shannon drainage should not be compared with those on a small river like the Tolka.</P>
      <P>This year was perhaps one of the worst years, so far as flooding of the Shannon was concerned.  The people were caught on the wrong foot because the floods came six or seven weeks earlier than usual.  They expect the floods to come in October and November and they take the necessary precautions and they remove their hay and fodder in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, this year they could not take any precautions because the floods came early in July and August.  They were not able to remove their crops and they lost everything. I was invited to a number of meetings in the Clonfert area where the problem was very acute.  Large tracts of land were under water and all one could see was the tops of the cocks of hay.  Even the road leading to the village was submerged.  In that area 50 or 60 farms were very seriously flooded.  A deputation was appointed to meet the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and the problem was fully discussed with him.  We went back then to another meeting and it was generally agreed that the problem would have to be tackled in a practical way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan said an American expert was brought in to advise the <Col N="496" /> previous Government on this matter. In the first paragraph of his report, the American expert, Mr. Rydell, pointed out that the problem had been engaging the attention of experts for over 150 years, and that he had no solution to offer.  If an expert from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mr. Louis Rydell, with wide experience of flooding in the Tennessee Valley, could offer no solution other than certain steps mentioned by Deputy McQuillan, such as diversion and so forth, how can anybody say that the problem should be tackled in this way or that until the preliminary work is done?  The American expert would not even hazard a guess as to what it would cost.  In one part of the report, he mentioned £100,000,000 and in another £150,000,000.  He confessed these figures were pure guesswork.</P>
    <P>I wonder would it be a cheaper way out of the problem to remove the people whose houses and lands are subject to flooding?  We discussed that at these meetings in Clonfert and it was suggested that an authority should be set up similar to the Tennessee Valley Authority in the United States and all that area declared a distressed area. The authority could arrange to have the people taken out of the distressed area and given holdings elsewhere.  In due course, when the drainage problem had been surmounted, it should be possible to put some very good land to use.</P>
    <P>There is no easy solution to the problem and I do not think Deputy McQuillan would hold that there is. The E.S.B., Bord na Móna, the Commissioners of Public Works and an American expert have all given their attention to it.  For the past 50 years, or more, the flooding of the Shannon has been under discussion.  Various solutions have been offered but no remedy has been found.  Possibly if the preliminary work indicated in the Rydell Report were carried out, something good might come of it, but some consideration can and should be given to a suggestion made to us in Clonfert and the surrounding area, namely, that where land is subject to flooding the people should be taken <Col N="497" /> from the area and accommodated elsewhere. I certainly agree with that suggestion.</P>
    <P>In the Clonfert area, at the confluence of the River Suck and the River Shannon, there are large holdings in close proximity to the flooded area. In Lawrencetown there are about 2,500 acres of the finest land in the hands of three or four landlords and the 50 or 60 people in Clonfert who are affected by flooding could easily be resettled in the Lawrencetown area if that land were acquired and the present owners could be duly compensated.</P>
    <P>There is one recommendation made in the Rydell Report that has adversely affected my constituency and has caused the drainage of the River Suck to be postponed.  Mr. Rydell recommended that nothing should be done with the tributaries of the Shannon until some concrete solution had been found for the drainage of the Shannon itself.  The people in South Galway, therefore, do not know when the Suck will be drained.  That is a very serious effect of the Rydell Report as far as we are concerned.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to adhere to whatever priority list had been agreed upon with regard to the tributaries of the Shannon before the publication of the Rydell Report and not to await solution of the problem of the drainage of the Shannon before this work is put into operation.  It has taken 150 years and it will probably take another 50 years before the Shannon is drained.  God knows when the Suck will be drained if the Rydell recommendation is accepted.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should go ahead with the drainage of the Suck as envisaged before the publication of the Rydell Report and before Mr. Rydell suggested that there should be no work done on the tributaries until the Shannon itself had been dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather disappointed with Deputy McQuillan's remarks.  Of course, the case he has made is incontrovertible, that the farmers in the Shannon Valley are suffering and have suffered for a considerable time very great losses and hardship but when the Deputy was <Col N="498" /> giving the history of his activities on behalf of the farmers in the Shannon Valley he should have mentioned that Colonel Collins Powell and the Red Cross and the then Government did great work in that time of hardship. He should have made some reference, to show that the then Government were not unmindful of the difficulties and that there were conflicting views held by engineers as to what could be done in the Shannon area and that it was imperative that some outside authority should be obtained on drainage and problems of the nature that arise in the Shannon Valley.</P>
      <P>It is true that a long time elapsed before the Rydell Report became available, but when I hear Deputy Carty say that there was nothing that could be recommended, that there was no plan that he could suggest, I think he has not read the report.  It is quite clear that, if he has read it, he has misunderstood it because, of course, Mr. Rydell did make very positive proposals.  It is also true that he advised that before his plan would be put into operation a further survey of the tributaries should be made.  The Government of the day then decided that that survey would be made.  They went further&mdash;and this is where I feel the present Government have been deliberately slow in dealing with the problem.  Not only did the then Government go ahead with that survey work but they decided that they would build new houses for the farmers who were prepared to accept transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one of the reports in my hand dealing with the area and showing the number of farmers from the Counties of Galway, Roscommon and Offaly who were prepared to transfer. There were 25 to 30 families in Roscommon, from seven townlands; 20 from the east bank, from the County Westmeath side and 13 families from Glenmoylet, which is on the east side of the Shannon.  In order to expedite that matter, the then Minister for Finance and the Government made a grant of £100,000 to the Land Commission from the Special Development Fund.  It is not a case of having to get the money.  The money was allocated and is there.  Since this <Col N="499" /> Government came into office, nothing has been done about it.  It is true that the Minister for Lands announced that it is there and that they would hope to do something this year, next year or some future year.</P>
    <P>I do not like to have it said that it is because I am in opposition that I am interested in this matter.  I do not think it is far to make that implication against Deputies from that area who were associated with me, whether they were Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or members of any other Party.  All of them were anxious.  Undoubtedly there could be some amelioration of the difficulties.  The people concerned are all willing, as far as I know, to accept transfer.  I never met a single member of the agricultural community in the Shannon Valley who would not move if he had a new house and five acres of dry park into which he could put cattle, stock, hay and turf and where he could live in dry conditions. It is true that some of them would be half a mile away.</P>
    <P>I have here a report which says that there were two estates acquired for this purpose.  They are named.  I should like to know what the Land Commission has been doing in the meantime.  I presume that Deputy Carty has given us the answer, that the plans were reviewed when the new Government came into office and that the Fianna Fáil clubs did not approve of them and that they are having the matter reexamined and a new survey made. That may be uncharitable&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but Deputy Carty says they had them.</P>
    <P>I should like him to tell us exactly what was the necessity for the meetings when this work was done, when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Finance could say: &ldquo;I am glad to inform you that I had not to look for the money, that there is £100,000 which my predecessor has set aside from the Development Fund for this work, and that we can now go ahead.&rdquo; If I were the Parliamentary Secretary I would say: &ldquo;If my predecessor were any good he would have the work done.  He should not have left it to me.&rdquo;  He did not do that&mdash;I do not know for what reason.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> There is no question that the hardship is very great, and I am glad that Deputy Carty has put his finger on a very important fact, that, flooding of the Shannon has taken place for the last 150 years.  I wonder what does that convey to the Board of Works and to the Government ?  It means that when the Shannon was left as the Almighty designed it there was no flooding to any great extent, but it was when man came in and put his weirs, his gates and his locks on it, and started to interfere with the Shannon, that the flooding began.</P>
    <P>It has been said by engineers that if the Meelick weir were opened in time, it would relieve the flooding.  Other equally good engineers say: &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;  For the life of me I cannot understand why, if the bed of the river is seven or eight feet lower at one point, and there is an obstacle holding back seven or eight feet of water at another point, if you take away that obstacle the level of the river will not be lowered by six or seven feet.  I heard this question argued at Shannonbridge, and I heard it argued that the opening or closing of Meelick weir would not affect the flooding at all.  I also heard an old man say that, because a valuable cargo of stout was in danger on one occasion, the level of the Shannon could be lowered by 11 feet to save it, but he said it could not be lowered five feet now to save the farmers' crops. Nobody contradicted that.</P>
    <P>Mr. Rydell in his report gave an estimate, but I do not know from where the figures given here to-day emanate, £10,000,000 has been mentioned; that is a very large sum, but he says that there are two methods of dealing with high floods, by deepening and widening the existing channel, and by embanking. Then he says it all depends on how much you want to lower it, and by widening and sinking you reduce the flooding.  By banking it up and having sluice gates, and possibly flap locks, the water can be let in and out.</P>
    <P>I avail of this opportunity to urge the Minister for Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary to proceed with the plan of their predecessors, and to build houses for the people living in the flooded areas.  That would <Col N="501" /> give immediate amelioration and the people on both banks of the river in County Galway, Roscommon, Offaly and Westmeath would still live within a short distance of their holdings, and would still be able to work them.  It is good land and Athlone potatoes are famed all over the world.  I was surprised to see the distant countries in which I saw Athlone seed being sold last April and May.  These are hardy, industrious people who deserve well of us.  The Government, of which I had the honour to be a member, did their best to ameliorate the conditions that obtained during the last big flood, and everyone gave thanks to the Red Cross, to Colonel Collins Powell and the Army for the service they rendered them.  I think it only right that thanks for their work should again be placed on the records of this House.  The late Dean Crowe also established an organisation, on his own, which was of great benefit.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government that they should proceed with this work as quickly as possible, because they can do a great amount of good without very great cost.  Then, the engineers can take their time&mdash;though I hope it will not take them 150 years, or even six years&mdash;but they can make a survey of the levels of the Suck and divert it lower down.  That, I believe would be one of the greatest reliefs possible.  It has been stated that a hydro-electric scheme could be established on the race-course of the new river which would make such a scheme an economic proposition.  Therefore, I recommend that the Government put these things into effect, things that can be done at an early stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KieranPEgan" hpid="Mr. K. Egan Mr. K. Egan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy from the Shannon valley area, I welcome this motion in so far as it gives the House an opportunity of discussing the very serious problem of Shannon flooding.  Deputy McQuillan has stated that this flooding has occurred for the last 25 or 30 years.  Probably the Deputy remembers flooding only for that period, but it has taken place for the last 150 years, which is quite a long time.  I think the most serious flooding catastrophe that took place occurred on the 8th-9th December, <Col N="502" /> 1954, when some 25,000 acres of land in the Shannon valley were inundated with water.  At a meeting held in Banagher, on the 9th of January, 1955, attended by members of the then Government, and by a large number of Deputies from the area, we were promised by the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, that he would invite engineering experts from the Tennessee Valley to make a survey of the Shannon Valley.</P>
      <P>That survey was carried out, over a short period, by Mr. Rydell, and his report was made available some two years afterwards, on the 20th of August, 1956.  I think that paragraph 3, on page two of that report, is very significant.  It states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The problem of Shannon River flooding has been the subject of much study over the past 150 years. Because of the flat terrain through which the river flows, the almost imperceptible gradient of the stream with its series of lakes and connecting channels, and because of the large volume and long duration of flooding, no simple or obvious solution has heretofore been found&mdash; nor has the writer now found one.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that is the position in which we were left, following the survey by Mr. Rydell.  He goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Investigators have generally concluded that any solution physically practicable of accomplishment would involve extensive and costly engineering works, with which the writer fully agrees.  Finally, the writer believes that sound advice has been given and a wise policy has been followed in directing first attention and priority of national effort to other river basin problems more susceptible of early solution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That last statement is very significant also because it has been stated by various people in the Shannon valley area that the Brosna drainage scheme has added to the Shannon valley flooding; but I believe&mdash;and I have got advice from engineering experts&mdash;that that is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This flooding of the Shannon valley over the years has caused serious losses not only to farmers in the area but to <Col N="503" /> the nation as well.  This year, as Deputy Carty pointed out, many farmers have lost all their hay crop in that area.  The floods came at a very early period in the year, in the summer months, and most of the hay in the Shannon valley was lost.  The time has arrived when this Government will have to take action to relieve the flooding in that area and to relieve the Shannon valley farmers.</P>
    <P>The drainage of the Shannon is a very big problem and it will take long and serious consideration.  It will be very costly to the State and its solution cannot be undertaken immediately.  I understand that, at the moment, engineers from the Boards of Works are making a survey of the Shannon based on this Rydell Report and that their report will take a period of almost two years.  While those who have suffered such great losses are waiting for that report and waiting for the flooding problem to be solved, I would suggest that some ameliorative remedies be undertaken.  The first one I should suggest is the resettlement on higher ground of farmers living in the area. I think that there is a scheme for that at the moment, but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to convey to the Minister for Lands the necessity to expedite that scheme for the resettlement of the farmers in the Shannon area.  There is also necessity to provide houses on higher ground for those farmers who are flooded periodically during the winter floods in the Shannon valley.</P>
    <P>It was suggested on a number of occasions at meetings which I attended, that the Government should undertake the derating of land in the Shannon valley area.  I do not know if that is feasible or not.</P>

      <P>The resettlement of farmers there is one suggestion.  My second suggestion is that the lands in the Shannon valley area be derated. I know that all that land in the area is as highly rated as the best arable land in this country.  When we realise that the land there can be utilised only for 6 months of the year, it is most unfair and unjust that they should have to pay the same rates as farmers living on high ground and who possess the best arable land in the country. I hope that the Government will find some solution to this problem at an early date.</P>
      <P>There are some other suggestions which I should like to make, or which farmers put before me, as an immediate remedy, such as the removal of islands in the Shannon.  There are some islands between Athlone and Meelick and it is thought that if they were moved it would relieve flooding to a large extent.  There is also, as already mentioned by Deputy MacEoin, the question of the weirs at Meelick, that sufficient attention is not paid to those weirs by the people in charge, the Board of Works.  When heavy rain falls, those weirs should be left open so that the flood waters could get away immediately.  That happened on a number of occasions and it is the general belief of the people that sufficient attention is not paid to those weirs and that they are not looked after properly.  In times of heavy rain, they should be left open.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to bring that to the notice of the responsible people in the Board of Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, as we are aware, the Shannon is used for navigation purposes and has to be kept at a high level during the summer months.  As a result of that, when the winter months come there is already too much water in the Shannon basin and <Col N="505" /> when the flood waters come in the winter time they have no alternative but to spread out on the land.  If we are to continue the navigation, we will have to keep the water at a high level; but it is considered that the waters could be reduced to at least one foot lower than they are at present.  I sincerely hope that some measure of relief will be given to those people who have suffered losses in the Shannon Valley over a number of years.</P>

      <P>I support this motion and have the greatest sympathy for the people in the Shannon Valley because of my experience of flooding of farmers' holdings in my own area.  I remember that when a circular went out in 1954 to Macra clubs all over the county, asking for aid for the farmers in the Shannon Valley for the great losses they sustained at that time, I was very pleased to see that the response was widespread and generous from the Macra na Feirme clubs.  The young farmers came to the aid of their fellow farmers in the Shannon Valley <Col N="506" /> when they lost their hay and other property; and the losses, I have no doubt, were pretty severe at that time. However, through lack of organisation or co-operation of one kind or another, I think that the help which was intended at that particular time to be diverted to the affected landowners, did not reach the people concerned. I know that in some instances the money given by the Macra clubs was refunded to them and never reached its destination to alleviate that distress.</P>
      <P>In the case of flooding in an area like that, it is very hard to estimate the amount of damage which can be done.  It is spread over a large area and many families are affected.  It affects not only the life and health of the people; it affects the cattle and the whole agricultural industry.  It is very hard, indeed, to estimate the cost.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6th November, 1958.</P>
