      <P>At the outset, I should perhaps give a brief history of the procedure adopted in the enumeration in the census of population of towns without legally defined boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the censuses of 1926 and 1936 the definition of a census town (i.e. a town without legally defined boundaries) was simply &ldquo;a cluster of 20 or more houses&rdquo;.  With the increased building activity in recent years, involving the transfer of town-dwellers to blocks of new houses adjacent to the old cluster but not necessarily contiguous to it, it became necessary to modify the original definition to include the newly built clusters with the original census town, provided that the residents were still considered to take part in the community life of that town.  This principle was followed at the 1946 and 1951 censuses.  Even before the introduction of the amended definition, the delimitation of a census town was rather imprecise since no direction could be given as to the maximum distance between houses to be regarded as forming a cluster.  The definition placed still more reliance upon the judgment of individual enumerators with the result that the application of the principle varied from district to district.  For these reasons, it was decided to hold a special investigation in conjunction with the <Col N="473" /> census of population 1956, with the objects of (a) determining the extent of the suburban areas or environs of towns with legally defined boundaries and (b) establishing, on a uniform basis, boundaries for census towns. The various boundaries were drawn on ordnance survey maps after consultation with local authority officials whose considerable local knowledge was of the greatest value in the work.  Whilst in previous censuses of population the census town was defined as a cluster of 20 houses or more, on the occasion of the 1956 census it was decided to vary this definition to the extent of including only occupied houses in determining the lower limit of size.</P>
    <P>In the case of Ballybunion town, the boundaries in 1956 census were drawn by the local authority officials.  These boundaries were agreed by the enumerator and subsequently the town was visited by an official of the Central Statistics Office, and the boundaries as drawn by the local authority officials were confirmed as giving a fair representation of the position obtaining.</P>
    <P>In the 1956 census, the town comprised the following areas:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Any changes made in the 1956 census were done in consequence of the general procedure adopted in the <Col N="474" /> enumeration of towns, and to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The acreage figure of 376 acres quoted by the Deputy in respect of 1901 refers to the townland of Ballybunion, while the figure of 4,732 acres quoted refers to the district electoral division of Killehenny (of which the townland of Ballybunion forms a part). It has been confirmed from official records that there has been no change in the acreage figures of these administrative areas as published in 1901 compared with those obtaining in the census of 1956.</P>
    <P>In the census of 1956, there were 799 towns without legally defined boundaries. In the report of the 1956 census there is shown in Table 11 the revised 1951 census figures of towns in respect of which alterations in boundaries had been made.  In the case of 527 census towns the revised 1951 population figures showed an increase on the original figure.  The name of each individual town thus affected together with the changes in population consequent on the alteration in boundaries can be obtained by a comparison with the relative figures published in Volume I (Table 11) of the 1951 census. The extraction of information in the detailed form required by the Deputy would necessitate a considerable expenditure of official time, which in present circumstances, I would not feel justified in authorising.</P>
    <P>The statement which follows sets out the particulars for each county of the number of towns affected by the change in boundaries.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the compilation of town population in the census of population is to show in a statistical form the various agglomerations of population within the State.  The practice adopted in the census of 1956 has standardised the procedure and it is proposed to adhere to it in future censuses.</P>

      <P>The general policy in relation to the determination of wage rates is that they should, so far as possible, be negotiated freely between employers' and workers' organisations. If workers' trade unions desire to ensure equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value, it is always open to them to seek the application of the principles of the convention in negotiating wage agreements with employers.  The convention expressly provides that its principles may be applied by means of collective agreements between employers and workers.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention to introduce legislation in the matter as this would be contrary to the principle of free negotiation.</P>

    <P>The trading activities of the E.S.B. have been undertaken under statutory powers conferred on the board by the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927 and are, therefore, a matter in which I have no function and have no authority to intervene.  I have, however, made inquiries and have been assured by the board that due regard is always had to the legitimate interests of independent electrical contractors.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with a recommendation made by the InterDepartmental Committee which reported in 1946 an approach was made to the United States Department of Commerce in 1947 for an indication of the extent to which an Irish free seaport would be likely to attract American business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> The Department of Commerce reported that they had placed a notice inviting views in the <i>Foreign Trade Letter</i>&mdash;a publication which is distributed to interested businessmen in the New York area.</P>
    <P>The Department of Commerce also stated that they had attempted to obtain an expression of opinion from local businessmen regarding the establishment of such a port, but without success in either case.  The Department said they were cognisant of the value of the establishment of free ports to international commerce but that they did not wish to influence the opinions of businessmen on the matter, nor to encourage the Irish Government to go to considerable expense in the establishment of such a port only to have its facilities used by very few customers; and that in view of the limited character of the Irish market as well as the geographical position of Ireland, they rather doubted that American business would show a great interest in the establishment of such a free port.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider repeating the inquiry?  After a lapse of 11 years, having regard to the changed world circumstances, it might be worth while repeating that inquiry?</P>

      <P>As regards items (b) and (c), beer duty, which applies to both stout and porter, is charged by reference to a standard specific gravity of 1055º and when the gravity is higher or lower than this figure the duty chargeable varies proportionately.  If beer was sold at that gravity the duty content in a pint would be 8.6d.

      <P>Due to a contraction in the reserves of work available at Delgany forest, it was necessary to reduce the staff by seven men.  The reduction was unavoidable and due weight was attached to length of service in deciding what men should be laid off.  There is no immediate prospect of their re-employment by my Department.</P>

As regards Dublin City, the observations of the Department in regard to the findings of the housing survey carried out during 1954-1956, were communicated to officers of the local authority in January last.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>Dublin County Council requested a grant in February last for the carrying out of a scheme under the Local Authorities (Works) Act to relieve flooding in the Dundrum-Windy Arbour area.  They were informed that there were no funds available for grants for schemes under the Act.  No recent proposal has been received from the county council for a grant for a scheme at Redesdale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the matter has been under further consideration arising out of more recent flooding in these and other suburban areas and I have brought the need for action to the attention of the local authorities. When appropriate schemes are in order for approval in respect of the built-up areas concerned, it may be found that their execution will come <Col N="499" /> under the Sanitary Services Acts rather than the Works Act.  In that event State assistance would be by way of subsidy of loan charges and not by way of grant.</P>

      <P>On the Financial Resolution, we regard this Bill as a disreputable smokescreen for the purpose of covering-up the Minister in doing that which he had not the moral courage to do openly and honestly.  We regard this Bill as a smokescreen designed to conceal the fact that, having undertaken to the electorate to increase the guaranteed price of wheat to 82/6 a barrel, the Minister's Party <Col N="506" /> are now, through the instrumentality of this Bill, seeking power to abolish the guaranteed price altogether and to pay this year, and in the years hereafter, not a price guaranteed to the farmer before he sets his crop but a price to be determined later than the 14th July in the year in which he saves his crop.</P>
      <P>I want to recall to the House the repeated protests of the members of the Government Party, in past years, if the guaranteed price for wheat was not declared early in the month of September for the ensuing year.  I remember Deputy Allen used to make our hearts bleed over the cruel dilemma in which the farmers found themselves, vacillating as to whether they should sow winter wheat or not, because they were not told in September the guaranteed price to be paid the following September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>To operate An Bord Gráin, the Ceann Comhairle will remember.  The function of An Bord Gráin is to tell farmers what price they are to get for wheat and they are to be consulted by the Minister for the purpose of determining the price they are to get for wheat, not in the September before it is sown, but in the July after the wheat has been set. That is the job of An Bord Gráin.  They are to have funds placed at their disposal so that they can enter into consultation with the Minister as to the amount by which the Minister will reduce the guaranteed price for wheat some time in the month of July.  That is the purpose.  That is what we are now being asked to vote money for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case the Chair has overlooked it, <Col N="507" /> An Bord Gráin is not to be asked, or they will not want any money to finance an inquiry into, what the surplus is to be.  When he is determining that question, the Minister will consult the Minister for Industry and Commerce, so there is no money in this Resolution for that purpose.  Having reached a decision on that question, he wants money so that An Bord Gráin can set up offices, a headquarters and a staff, to consult with the Minister for Agriculture as to how much the price of wheat is to be reduced in the light of the decision taken by him, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as to how much of the outturn of the wheat crop is to be regarded as surplus and to be sold to biscuit manufacturers at £22 a ton, so that they may be assured of their profit for the home market.</P>
    <P>I must pay this tribute to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are here and there are seven of them.  One of them is from Limerick where they never grew a grain of wheat in their lives.  Another of them is from Clonmel. I see Deputy Nicholas Egan here and I see that Deputy Faulkner is here, but he is so dazzled by admiration for the Minister for Industry and Commerce that of course anything goes with him.  I do not see Deputy Corry here and he was the Deputy I used to hear talking about this question on public platforms.  I do not see Deputy Maher here who also used be voluble about the question in Laois-Offaly, nor do I see Deputy Medlar here.  He is one of the Deputies who were elected to raise the price of wheat&mdash;that is what brought him in here&mdash;but they are not here at all to-day.  Hair or hide of them is not to be found and I do not blame them.  I respect a man who has some sense of shame and these Deputies at least have that degree of decency, that they are ashamed to show their faces when this House is being asked for money to set up An Bord Gráin to discuss with the Minister, in the month of July, how much is to be taken off the price of wheat so that biscuit manufacturers can buy it at £22 a ton.</P>
    <P>This is an occasion when the House <Col N="508" /> is entitled to ask the Minister when he proposes to conduct his discussions with the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the purpose of determining the volume of the surplus.  He did say some months ago that it was his purpose in connection with this levy procedure, for the continuing of which An Bord Gráin is being brought to birth, that this determination as to the surplus would be made in the month of July.  I remember that month particularly, for I remember saying then that nobody but a lunatic would undertake to determine the volume of the outturn of the wheat crop in July and I thought that fact was powerful evidence of the fraudulent character of this whole transaction.</P>
    <P>If the truth were told, I think the Minister makes very little concealment of the fact that he himself believes it to be fraudulent and he said on the last occasion that he was fortifying his resolution to proceed on these lines, because, throwing his mind back over the past 20 years, he recalled that Fianna Fáil had got substantial majorities from the Irish people.  That is an incontrovertible fact and that secured for us the economic war; it secured for us the 1952 Budget; and now in this year it secures for the grain growers of this country An Bord Gráin.  Very well may the Minister for Agriculture say it is a source of consolation to him to have that majority. When all is said and done, he has got a majority in this House and those who gave it to him are going to pay for their folly as they paid before and will pay whenever they give Fianna Fáil a clear majority in this House.</P>

      <P>Let us not argue that. The Deputy is here for quite a while and that is a source of continued disstress to Fianna Fáil.  One of its most acute sources of distress is that the Deputy is here now to ask the Minister when this calculation will be made and, if it is to be made in the month of July, having heard from Kildare Street the pleasure of the millers and biscuit manufacturers, perhaps the Minister would tell us, as the Minister for Agriculture, how he proposes to make his contribution to the discussion.  What does he know or what does anybody else know of the likely outturn of the wheat crop in the month of July?  Is not it manifest to everybody in this House that this is all part of a fraudulent facade behind which Fianna Fáil is going to do what they are afraid to do under the public eye?</P>
      <P>Surely we are entitled to recall, Sir, another Money Resolution that we passed in this House with all the fanfare of trumpets attendant upon this Money Resolution but it was then the milk producers who were to suffer and they were told there was a commission to be set up?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That report when it came out was made the occasion by Fianna Fáil to reduce the price of milk, just as the report of An Bord Gráin, when it comes out, is designed to reduce the price of wheat and in both cases the purpose is to enable Fianna Fáil to assume the rôle of Pontius Pilate and to ask first: &ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo; and then to call for a basin of water and wash their hands in public and say: &ldquo;It is not we; it was the Milk Costings Commission who did the first thing and it is An Bord Gráin that will do the other.&rdquo;  But there is this interesting development that at least the Milk Costings Commission dropped dead when it had served its purpose in one year and was decently buried in oblivion.  An Bord Gráin is to function perennially and, if it takes 6/- off this year, nobody will know until next July, this time 12 months, what it will take off then.  I wonder will Deputy Allen come up next September and thunder here as to why there is not a fixed price provided?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will. I should not like to see him dead or bankrupt or in any way deterred from his regular business.  I should like the Deputy to be here next September and to hear him ask the Minister for Agriculture why he does not fix a price so that farmers will know where they are because next September An Bord Gráin will be functioning and the Minister can fix any price he likes in the certainty that, whatever price the Minister names, An Bord Gráin will be called into operation the following July and they will be authorised to fix any reduction that they can persuade the Minister to accept and they will be given the pleasant assignment of disposing, not of the surplus as ascertained by them, but of such quantity of Irish wheat as the Minister for Agriculture, in consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, may declare to be surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> This year, the biscuit manufacturers have very kindly consented to accept their requirements at the price payable for pollard and that will be met out of the levy.  We do not know what the bakers will be prepared to accept but the Minister for Industry and Commerce will know and the Minister for Agriculture cannot decide the amount of the surplus without his consent.  So, when the millers and the bakers and the biscuit manufacturers have all had their whack out of this business it will then be the duty of An Bord Gráin to arrive upon the scene.  Where will they get the money to meet the requirements of the millers and the bakers and the biscuit manufacturers?  They will get it by measuring the levy to be made on the price of wheat.</P>
    <P>Lest that might come as too great a shock to Deputy Corry's supporters in East Cork and to Deputy Moher's supporters in East Cork and lest Deputy Medlar's supporters in County Kilkenny should get neurasthenia at the news, this year the Minister for Finance tells us that the levy is to be 6/- a barrel and the Act kindly provides that, if that should prove insufficient, the Treasury will lend An Bord Gráin sufficient to carry the baby for 12 months, on the understanding that at the end of that period they will raise by levy again sufficient to pay off the overdraft so kindly provided plus whatever charge will come in course of payment in respect of the coming crop.  Goodness knows, it is hard to believe that fraud and hypocrisy of that kind can so far deceive our people.</P>
    <P>I look back with satisfaction on the fact that when circumstances made it inescapable that the guaranteed price on the domestic market should be adjusted, the Government of which I was a member came into Dáil Éireann and adjusted it, told the farmers what the price of wheat would be, stood over it and saw it paid and that in the following year, when world transport prices resulted in a rise in the international price of wheat, the Government of which I was a member, accepted my advice that the same relationship should be <Col N="512" /> maintained between the world price and the home price and that, inasmuch as world prices had gone up by 5/- a barrel because of freight rates, the home price should be adjusted, and it was.  We accepted the entire wheat crop, and we rejected, the proposition that a large percentage was unfit for conversion into flour.  All of it was accepted and dried, except that which was manifestly sprouting and unfit for use.</P>
    <P>Those who wanted to jettison wheat as animal food were told they would not be allowed to do so.  They were told it was their duty, as a milling monopoly, to filter that wheat into the grist in the following year and to let it be used in the ordinary course of commerce.  What I rejoice in particularly is that we endorsed no fraud.  We told the truth and we faced the mendacious and lying propaganda of the then political Opposition which, I do not deny, was attended with a very high measure of success in Kilkenny, in Laois-Offaly, and in the grain growing areas of this country.  I think that Deputies who were responsible for that fraud should ask themselves to-day what brought about that success.</P>
    <P>Do they really believe that, had they told the farmers of Laois-Offaly, Kilkenny, and these areas, that their plan was not to do as the inter-Party Government was doing&mdash;tell them the facts, guarantee them in September the price which would be paid in the following September&mdash;but that their policy was to set up An Bord Gráin, which would be specifically prohibited from telling the farmers what the price was in the September before the seed was to be set, which was charged by statutory responsibility not to tell the farmers what the price was until their crops were growing, they would have been received in Kilkenny and Laois-Offaly as they were received?  If, in retrospect, they are obliged to admit to themselves that their reception would have been far different, is it not time they began to ask this question: how often can this pitcher be brought to the well?</P>
    <P>If that kind of confidence trick is successfully played upon our people, <Col N="513" /> with the support of a Party newspaper and all the propaganda machinery of one of the greatest Parties in this country, I admit that the consequent disaster is not going to fall upon that Party alone.  The tragedy of the situation is that the ordinary people will begin to associate us all in Dáil Éireann with these despicable standards, and that means they will grow to hate Parliament, and those who are guilty of treason, of suggesting that in this free society our parliamentary institutions are founded on fraud and deception and lies will be listened to, and those of us who seek to repudiate those allegations will find our task made more difficult&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Davern should allow Deputy Dillon to make his statement in his own way. Deputy Dillon is entitled to make his statement in his own way.  I am asking Deputy Dillon to keep to the question as to whether a levy should be put on wheat or not.  That is the question.</P>

      <P>That is the question. Let us examine it home.  I understood that our purpose was to provide a guaranteed price for wheat.  How is the price to be guaranteed if nobody knows until July what the size of the levy is to be?  I am most anxious that the Fianna Fáil Deputies who are voting for this will give us the benefit of their counsel.  Is there a levy to be made on wheat or is there not?  There is the issue nicely joined.</P>

      <P>This is the 15th July.  He is responsible for this Bill.  Am I to ask that the Minister for Industry and Commerce be sent for to find out what he knows?  Is it not an astonishing thing that on 15th July the Minister for Agriculture does not know what the price to be paid for the present <Col N="517" /> wheat crop is to be?  Is that the policy of Fianna Fáil?  Is that to be their policy in respect of every other agricultural produce?  Is it not an astonishing thing that with Dáil Éireann closing down for the summer Recess, probably at the end of this week, the principal Opposition find themselves in a position that they cannot get from the Minister even at this stage what the price is to be?</P>
      <P>Before this House reassembles, according to the Fianna Fáil theory, a large part of next year's wheat crop should be sown.  If this House does not meet until the end of October, a considerable acreage of the winter wheat ought to have been sown before we meet again.  Can the Minister give us any information about any grain crop?  Can he tell us, if he does not know what the price of this year's wheat crop will be, the price of next year's wheat crop or feeding barley?  Does anybody know? If they do not, Deputies appreciate what has happened&mdash;that, under the smokescreen of An Bord Gráin, guaranteed prices for cereal crops have softly and silently vanished away.</P>
      <P>This Bill was brought in as a snark but it is turning out to be a boojum. Do Deputies remember the hunting of the snark?  An Bord Gráin was brought in to be an instrument for fixing a fair price for wheat.  It has the boojum-like quality in that as it emerges the guaranteed price for wheat and feeding barley fades away. Is that the policy of Fianna Fáil?  Is that the policy for which they want money now?  I personally regret the fact but I am afraid it is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have a clear majority in this House.  I cannot force them to tell me.  Unless I am greatly mistaken, they are not going to tell me, the House or the country.  They will say, in the words of the Minister for Agriculture a few moments ago: &ldquo;I do not know&rdquo; and, by implication, they will add: &ldquo;and I do not care.&rdquo;  With a clear majority in the House, the Minister for Agriculture is in a position to say: &ldquo;You will follow me into the Lobby for anything.&rdquo;  It does not matter what programme they were elected on or what promises they made, the whip <Col N="518" /> can be cracked and they will vote for anything.  So long as that is true and we are in a minority, we cannot make them answer, but I should like to remind the Minister for Agriculture that when he was in a minority on this side of the House, I laid down then what I thought was a good precedent.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Agriculture&mdash;everybody knew that I was not deeply concerned for the wheat crop which occupied 3 per cent. of our land which by comparison with the livestock industry did not seem to me to be of consequence&mdash;I adopted the attitude that the democratic policy of a Government would ultimately be determined not by the size of the majority but by the respect and deference it showed to the rights of the minority. Because the adherents of Fianna Fáil were deeply attached to the whole concept of wheat growing, the Government of which I was a member gave a guarantee not for one year or two years, but for five years, of a minimum price below which the crop would never fall.</P>
    <P>I look back with pride on that as the whole are of quality in the democratic character of the Government of which I was a member.  I am entitled now to know the answer to the questions I put to the Minister for Agriculture to-day, but if I judge the mind of Fianna Fáil correctly, I will not get them.  I look back with comfort to the fact that over the past 20 years I have had to deal with arrogant, absolute Fianna Fáil majorities in this House.  Together with my colleagues, I broke them twice and we will break them again.</P>

      <P>It would appear that, apart from the presentation of the Minister and the fact that Deputy Dillon has followed, we shall not derive from the opposite side of the House any illumination in respect to this matter.  The only thing we get is interruptions.  Those who interrupt are not prepared to stand up and declare positively their support of this measure. They will not advance any argument to controvert what is put forward from this side.</P>
      <P>We are asked to-day to vote money for the establishment of An Bord Gráin.  When we were discussing this on the Second Stage of the Bill the Fine Gael Opposition advanced views contrary to those advanced in favour of the establishment of this board.  At that time, the agriculturists, the grain growers, had not definitely stated or given their opinion as to what they thought of this measure.  Surely when we propose, in the establishment of this board, to give over to the wheat producers immense responsibilities in relation to the marketing of surplus wheat, the all-abiding requirement is the co-operation of the growers?  In that respect, since the Second Reading, the wheat growers have completely abrogated any responsibility in relation to what the Minister and the Government propose to ask them to shoulder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked, Sir, to-day to vote money for the establishment of yet another board.  Naturally, a new board means more expense, more appointments and more officials.  On the other hand we have the Minister for Finance, who now and again&mdash;not as much as he used to&mdash;pays lip service to the Government's intention to reduce expenditure by curtailing the numbers in the Civil Service.  This will be another opportunity to follow on the line presented by the establishment of the personnel of the Greyhound Board. This will be following on the line, which is now so positive, of appointing <Col N="520" /> ex-bank managers at £2,500 a year, to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good, Sir.  We are being asked to put a levy on wheat in order to provide money to set up a board which will administer and determine the sale of surplus wheat.  The <Col N="521" /> House and the country have sad experience of the way in which moneys are being spent which were voted formerly for the establishment of boards similar to An Bord Gráin.  The question before the House is as to whether there should be a levy or not.  We say, Sir, as we said on the Second Reading, that there are people interested in this problem throughout the country who would suggest that all other avenues have not been explored. Suggestions which have been mooted in relation to providing a solution to this problem have not been answered by those in office.</P>
      <P>By the voting of this money to-day, the Government are taking the easy way out.  They are ridding themselves of the responsibility of having to dispose of this wheat.  They are bringing in bodies from outside, bodies which we claim are being brought in merely so that the present Government may be in a position to point to them in later years and say: &ldquo;We are not the people who fell down on this job; they are the people, the people who were established on this day when we voted the moneys to create a levy to pay the expenses of the members of this board.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the House was discussing, on the Second Reading, a problem of this magnitude, one would have thought we would have had a number of contributions from the Government Party. We had one solitary contribution&mdash; from a Deputy who was goaded into standing up, by the fact that none of his colleagues showed the slightest interest in this measure.  Again to-day, Sir, we have the same lack of interest by Deputies opposite.  There are occasions on which Deputies&mdash;particularly when they are elected and have secured a mandate on specific subjects &mdash;are expected by the people who elected them, to speak here and give their views&mdash;views which they must hold, seeing that they are elected by those particular interests.  Here in this Dáil in the Government Party there are at least eight members who can trace their election to the whole issue of the wheat price; yet not one of them thought it worth while to speak on the Second Reading and not one of them <Col N="522" /> has given an indication of his views to-day on the Financial Resolution.</P>
    <P>Surely we are entitled to ask that the members who support the ideas enshrined in this measure would give their views to the House on it?  They should explain why they have completely thrown overboard the views they held so forcefully and so recently, and which they voiced so vociferously both in by-elections and at the general election.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister not think that the members of the Fine Gael Party or the members of the National Farmers' Association are the only people who are expressing and expressing forcefully their criticisms of the Government's attitude at the moment.  In North Tipperary, which is a grain growing area, the Minister for Defence went down recently to a Fianna Fáil convention.  There it was said that the question of wheat prices was one in which the Government had let down the people who had elected them.  That convention was fully reported in the local Press.  Let me say it was a compliment to the delegates who attended it, that they came out as strongly as they did in expressing their disappointment, their grave and bitter disappointment, at the way the Government were treating them.</P>
    <P>That was long before An Bord Gráin was thought of.  I wonder what they will say to-day when they find that this &ldquo;strong&rdquo; Government, elected 15 months ago, was not strong enough to handle this problem of disposing of surplus wheat?  The problem is not the sale of surplus wheat; it is the effecting of a substantial reduction in the price of wheat.  That is what this board is charged with.  If it were a serious suggestion, surely this board would be given the responsibility of determining the extent of the surplus, or would have some voice in the determination of the extent of the surplus with which they would have to cater?</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Dillon on this Financial Resolution in repeating that this is a sham and a fraud, designed by the Government to cover themselves up in an action which they do not feel they were competent politically <Col N="523" /> to face.  They hope that by the creation of doubt and uncertainty, in the year or two which are to come they will experience some opportunity of saddling others with a responsibility which they were elected to bear.</P>
    <P>In these days when, having seen the reports for the first six months of the year, we see the country running into an imbalance of payments as a result of which the Government may want to take action, action not open to them since they have completely thrown away the weapons used by the last Government in facing such a situation, they may once again have to turn to the agricultural community to save this country from the impact of difficulties such as those we experienced a year and a half or two years ago and which, due to neglect on the part of the Government, appears to be looming on the horizon again.  Is this the way to treat the farmers who may be the people required to save the country should such an event occur?</P>

      <P>It is a pity the wheat growers could not have a picture of Dáil Éireann while Fianna Fáil are putting this Bill through.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>A rancher?  I do not know what the Deputy is talking about.  It is extraordinary, after all the talk by Fianna Fáil about wheat growing before the last general election and the previous by-election, that we should be asked to set up a board that will collect a levy on wheat.  As has been pointed out, this is a deception on the people.  The Minister and the Government were not big enough to come in and announce what the cut on wheat would be.  Setting up this <Col N="524" /> board is just a means of fooling the wheat growers.  We do not know even at this late stage what the reduction will be.  When the scheme was announced last January we were supposed to have a calculation of what the surplus wheat would be in July. Now in the middle of July there is not a word about that calculation or how it will be made.</P>
      <P>The Minister in introducing this Bill did not at any time make a suggestion or give any outline as to how this surplus would be calculated.  It was agreed in negotiations with the National Farmers' Association that they would have a say in the matter but now it appears that that is not the way in which the scheme will work. The surplus wheat will be calculated in consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the millers.  As a result of that, I am sure we shall have a large surplus because neither the millers nor the Minister for Industry and Commerce have any interest whatever in wheat growing.</P>
      <P>The wheat growers have been completely let down.  During the last general election campaign Fianna Fáil went all over the country promising 82/6 a barrel for wheat.  The wheat growers in my constituency expected to get that last harvest.  We are coming into this year's harvest and they realise there will be a cut but they do not know what it will be.  We merely have this backhand method of dealing with the situation by setting up this board.  This is only a fraud because this board will have only portion of the job it should have to do.  It will only collect the levy and sell the surplus wheat.  If the Minister had an honest approach in establishing the board, he would see that it had a say in arriving at what the surplus wheat would be and also what the levy would be.  The levy, of course, controls the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the board is to have the duty of collecting the levy it should also have a say in what that surplus wheat should be.  We object strongly to the setting up of this board and the collecting of the levy because no honest attempt is being made to face this problem.  It is just a way out for the Minister and the Government.  The <Col N="525" /> problem will have to be met later on as the situation becomes more difficult, as if is sure to become if the present problem of surplus wheat is not faced in a straight manner.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I am not talking about the established customs or habits of anyone.  I am talking about the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann, which, as far as I know, entitle a Deputy to speak as often as he considers it his duty to do so, and it is not possible for the Minister to conclude the debate in Committee on Finance.  On the Second Stage of a Bill or on the Fifth Stage of a Bill, I understand the Standing Orders prescribe the Minister may conclude the debate, but I know of no provision in the Standing Orders to enable the Chair to call on the Minister to conclude in Committee on Finance.  I would urge that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle vindicate the rights of Deputies under Standing Orders.</P>

This has been a tremendous source of satisfaction to me, as one who has been a Deputy for 35 years now, as one who came into this House in 1927 as a member of an Opposition Party, looking at the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, of which Deputy Mulcahy was a member, their conservatism, their attitude towards agriculture and industry, their defeat and despair at that time.  I remember the discussion that took place in this House on the advisability of growing wheat, and I remember the attitude and the mental approach of the stalwarts of Cumann na nGaedheal in those years: it would not grow; the climate was wrong&mdash;too much rain.</P>

We were elected as a Government in 1932 and I remember the same charge being made.  Deputy Dillon came into this House for the first time in 1932 and he has been making that charge of Fianna Fáil deception all down those 26 years.  I would give this advice to the Party which has succeeded Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;it has had many names in between, one of which was The League of Youth; Lord knows, they do not look a bit like it now.  When I was a younger man than I am now I heard Deputies on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches talking about our deception in 1932, 1933, 1934 and 1935, about the annuities, about the economic war and about all the steps that have been taken since.</P>

      <P>I want to warn you because I believe there should be an Opposition in any democracy or deliberative Assembly.  I want to give you the advice that will be of use to you, even if you want to remain as you are.  The country knows it too well; the country understands.  If the people get an opportunity of reading the concern for the wheat growers shown by Deputy Dillon, for example, and his concern for the general policy towards grain growers, they will have memories.  In Irish politics, they have memories and it is well for the Irish people that they have memories. There is no member of the House so conscious of the truth of that statement as Deputy Dillon is.  It is not a pleasure to be accused, but I was in <Col N="530" /> doubt as to whether or not I should make a speech, whether I should take the sort of display made by Fine Gael seriously or whether I should stand up and say: &ldquo;I admit all the charges that Fine Gael speakers have made against me, and I still want these Resolutions.  I want this Bill and that is all about it.&rdquo;  You may go out and quote me or make what you like of that admission or concession on my part.</P>
      <P>I am really indifferent as to which way I should approach the discussion that has taken place.  These Resolutions usually precede the Committee Stage of a Bill and there is not a solitary amendment on the Order Paper in connection with this measure that has been so much criticised by Deputies opposite.  But, of course, they are talkative; they are fluent and like to hear themselves.  They love to use this institution for making speeches in order to cover up their laziness.  They come in to talk on the Resolutions and let off steam in an effort to convince the people down the country and their supporters that they are really active in this House.  But there is no amendment to the Bill of which the Opposition is so critical.  If that is political industry and if it satisfies the consciences of Deputies opposite as regards the contribution they should make, it is a matter for themselves.  It is not for me to worry about it.</P>
      <P>I have said, and I shall repeat, that I am delighted to find Deputy Dillon showing such tremendous concern for the matters to which this measure relates.  I can remember the time when he made all the statements that have been levelled against him here, when he used to talk about the &ldquo;yalla male&rdquo; for £1 a cwt.

I have met organised bodies of people representing farmers before; I have met organised bodies representing other sections and I have discussed serious matters with organised bodies and I sometimes found their spokesmen unable to go back to their own people and defend themselves or defend that which these spokesmen sponsored.  I make no complaint about that.  They are not hardened in the same sense as men in political life are hardened to the road.  If I now find the grain committee of the National Farmers' Association throwing this scheme overboard, it will not be the first case of parents deserting their child.  In this case, the grain committee have given indications that they may be amongst those who would be charged with deserting their child&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputies may trust me completely; I have complete control over myself.  I am saying this with deliberate intent and there is no &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; about it.  It does not matter in the least what the national farmers think now.  Nor does it matter that the members of the grain committee have got cold feet and are unable, or are afraid, to face their own members and defend themselves and their scheme.  There is provision for the scheme in this Bill and the Financial Resolution before the House is designed to provide moneys by which the scheme can be implemented. I am standing over the scheme, no matter from what source it has come. The scheme has now been adopted by me and forms the basis of the Bill which is before the House and which has given rise to the Financial Resolution. Therefore, I stand here, foursquare by it and for it, and let those outside, who have much more responsibility <Col N="533" /> for it than I have, behave in whatever fashion they like.</P>
      <P>Instead of being discommoded or in any way depressed or discouraged by all the contributions that have been made from the other side, I have really enjoyed them thoroughly.  I have studied Fine Gael, Cumann na nGaedheal and the League of Youth from the time I was a young man.</P>

He might, therefore, have reasonably said that, inasmuch as there are only a few days in the difference, he would conceive it to be his duty to take the decision in the second week of July, rather than in the third, so that he might have the opportunity of informing Dáil Éireann before it adjourned.</P>

      <P>(1)  the advance out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of all moneys from time to time required by the Minister for Agriculture to meet sums which may become payable under any guarantee given by him under such Act,</P>

    <P>(3)  the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of any sums which may require to be repaid to the Central Fund in respect of the whole or any part of any moneys advanced by the Minister for Agriculture under a guarantee and remaining outstanding after two years from the date of the advance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is carrying the cavalier treatment of this House to an extravagant degree to move a Money Resolution to provide funds wherewith to implement a levy on wheat, the dimensions of which will control the size of the Vote the Minister asks the House to pass?  If the Minister says: &ldquo;I have bound myself to provide this information within the next 14 days but I shall not give it to the Dáil; I shall not take the decision until the Dáil has adjourned but I shall ask the Dáil to vote me an unascertained sum of money to finance my decision, whatever it may be&rdquo;, he can do that and force it through the House so long as the Government have an absolute majority.  It would be wrong for any Opposition to watch the Minister do that without pointing out the nature of what he is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my experience, the House has always been ready to facilitate a Government where they sought a Vote on the ground that, at this time, it is not possible, by the exercise of any diligence, to give an accurate estimate of what sum may be appropriated under its general authority.  So far as I know, whenever such a situation arose, the Minister has been most scrupulous to say that, at the first available moment, every effort would be made to get the information communicated to the Dáil.  Time and again, we have had Votes here on which Ministers have expressed embarrassment that they were not in a position to give a reply, that &ldquo;it might be £100,000 or £200,000 but it certainly <Col N="537" /> will not exceed such and such a sum, and on that basis we ask the indulgence of the House to give us the necessary authority without the specific information.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think I am doing the Minister an injustice by interpreting his attitude as being that he does not give a damn&mdash;if we do not like it, we may lump it.  He does not care if there is any discussion; he is quite prepared to leave it as it is.  He does not want to challenge any argument; he does not want to meet any inquiry addressed to him, and he accepts no obligation to answer a question put to him by a Deputy.  He tells Deputy Crotty: &ldquo;You may ask questions but I do not have to answer them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Where is that leading to?  Does the Government for a single moment imagine that this Opposition is going to continue to subscribe to this farce of parliamentary procedure?  The whole business of parliamentary procedure depends on the acceptance of certain rules on both sides of the House.  This whole system of Government depends on the fact that the humblest independent Deputy, representing one quota of voters, can come in here and compel the Taoiseach, the head of the Government, to attend and answer any question he sets down on the Order Paper and if any Minister, from the Taoiseach down to the humblest Parliamentary Secretary, throws his hat in the air and says: &ldquo;I will not come,&rdquo; then on that day Parliament ceases to function.  That is one of the elementary rules which Fianna Fáil have got to learn.  Parliamentary Government functions only as a result of all sides accepting certain rules and submitting to certain obligations.</P>
    <P>Some of these obligations are very exasperating and it would be very exasperating if a contentious Deputy forced a Minister to come in here night after night, on the Adjournment, but the Minister does it because he knows if he does not, Parliament will not function. I do not deny for a moment that there is nothing in Standing Orders which authorises the Ceann Comhairle to direct a Minister to answer questions put to him, but Deputies should wake up to the fact that Parliament will not <Col N="538" /> work if Ministers will not submit to that discipline.  I emphatically agree that if Ministers are to submit to that discipline, members of the Opposition also have a discipline to which they must submit and that is to put reasonable and relevant questions.  If they do not, a Minister has no option but to get up and say: &ldquo;I cannot answer that and I will not answer it because it is neither reasonable nor relevant.&rdquo; It is a fair thing for Deputies to ask themselves are the questions being put to the Minister reasonable inquiries for the proper discussion of the business before the House.</P>
    <P>We are considering now a Money Resolution to permit the Minister to do a variety of things.  One is to lend money to An Bord Gráin with which to buy wheat.  Another is to provide from the Exchequer any sum which the board has not repaid to the Exchequer at the end of two years.  These are intimately associated with the actual amount which it is proposed to raise under this Resolution and I do not think I am being disrespectful to the Minister if I say he now knows the information that we have asked him for.</P>
    <P>It may be that he is in the position that he is obliged to say: &ldquo;This matter is a matter for discussion between myself and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and we have not yet agreed on it.&rdquo;  I think that is fair enough.  The scheme lays down that the determination of the surplus is a matter to be arrived at by him, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That places on him no more than the statutory duty to consult and he then takes the decision.  In practice, that usually means agreement between the two Ministers, or referring the issue to the Government for arbitration. If the Minister says: &ldquo;The matter is under discussion between me and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and we have not agreed as to what the surplus will be and on the basis of that I cannot reach a conclusion as to what the levy will be,&rdquo; I think that is a reasonable answer, more especially if he said that he would inform either this House, or the Seanad, what the decision was, the moment the decision was arrived at.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> I want to put it to the Minister that his present attitude simply makes parliamentary procedure unworkable and if persisted in would&mdash;and I say this with the fullest sense of responsibility, as somebody who loves Parliament so profoundly and who believes in its vital necessity for individual liberty&mdash;make parliamentary procedure impossible in this country.  It is appropriate that this Money Resolution should be availed of to deal with one observation which the Minister for Agriculture made.  He said that we were eagerly contesting the Money Resolution but that when you looked at the Order Paper you found that we had no amendments to offer for the improvement of the Bill and that that bespoke a lack of diligence on the part of the Opposition.  If he inquires from his colleague, the Minister for Finance, he will find that where amendment is appropriate, there is no lack of diligence on our part.  I think, if he inquires of the Minister for Justice, he will discover that where amendment of the Solicitors Bill, to assist him to do what he was not fit to do himself, was requisite, there was not a lack of diligence. In fact, there were so many amendments he made up his mind that he could not deal with the Bill in this session.</P>

      <P>The Minister made it on the Money Resolution and I want to reply to it quite expressly.  I refused on behalf of the Fine Gael Party to put down any amendments to this dirty, fraudulent Bill.  This Bill is not susceptible of any improvement.  This Bill is a dirty, fraudulent smokescreen for the Minister's subterranean activities which he has not got the courage to conduct in the light of day.  I am not going to patch his umbrella, <Col N="540" /> or his mackintosh either, and if he wants to equip himself with a mackintosh and an umbrella and a mask, he cannot blame me if I refuse to put patches on them when they leak, and the wetter he gets in his peregrinations under this umbrella, this mackintosh and sou'wester, the better pleased I shall be.  I regard it all as a fraudulent and shameful transaction.  If he had come in here and stated openly and plainly what his purpose was, we would have debated it, would have taken a decision upon it, and that would be the end of it.  The reason we proposed no amendment to this can be stated simply.  You cannot touch tar without smelling of pitch; and we have no desire to acquire that smell from the Minister's Bill.  That is why we did not propose amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, this Bill is specifically designed to set up a board to deal with surplus wheat. This section seems to depart to quite a degree from that purpose.  It seems to me to infringe on the functions of normal trading sections of the community in importing cereal products and animal feeding stuffs.  I wonder why the Minister thought it necessary to include such a section in a Bill of this kind.  Are there not sufficient agencies at present in the normal milling and grain trades and similar trades, to provide sufficient facilities to import the cereal products and animal feeding mentioned in this section?</P>
      <P>I am not speaking on the merits or otherwise of the Bill, but just on this section.  I do not think the section should be included in the Bill at all, if the Bill is specifically to provide for dealing with surplus wheat.  Under this section, the Minister can authorise the board to import feeding stuffs of any description which are normally imported through existing trade channels &mdash;is that not correct?&mdash;and in competition with existing trade channels.  I suggest that this is an infringement of existing rights people have built up over a long number of years and should not be included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be an infringement of the rights to which the Deputy has referred, but at the same time, if the board is to be charged with the responsibility of disposing of surplus wheat, naturally it should have some responsibility for decisions relating to the importation of coarse grain which could affect very detrimentally their whole interest in the task given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister not sufficient powers in his own Department to control the import and export of coarse grains, without giving to a <Col N="543" /> new State-sponsored board power to interfere with the normal trading organisations in the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nobody, even in my Department, who would be in a better position to know just what the position was.  There is no body of people who would be in a better position to make a decision on a matter of that kind, that is, a matter as to whether there should be importation or not at any particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but I do not follow the Minister.  As I understand it, this board is being set up by the Minister to deal with what is described as surplus wheat.  I maintain that the board should confine its activities to that and not obtrude itself on the normal commercial activities of organisations and traders who have built up their business over a long number of years.  If the Minister, as he said, finds it necessary to restrict the import or export of coarse grain and feeding stuffs, I suggest he has already sufficient power as Minister to do that, without giving these very wide powers to a semi-State board.</P>
      <P>This is a very wide section indeed. It says: &ldquo;The Minister may assign to the board such additional functions as he thinks fit in relation to cereals.&rdquo; That may be fair enough, but then it goes on to say: &ldquo;Cereal products and animal feeding stuffs.&rdquo;  I do not think it requires any great stretch of the imagination to visualise a situation in which the board could argue that, in the interests of the community, they had to compete with normal traders and business people in the importation of feeding stuffs.  The traders concerned would have absolutely no redress because there would be an Act of the Oireachtas to support the board's transactions.  I feel very strongly on this point because the Bill is going very far from what I assumed was to be its purpose, the disposal of surplus wheat.</P>

Applications have been made, since I was placed in charge of the Department of Agriculture four or five months ago, for permission to import grain, bran, pollard, barley, oats and other feeding stuffs, and the Department had to have regard to the position of surplus wheat and its disposal.  Surely, if we are setting up a board to look after the disposal of wheat, and to dispose of a levy which will be contributed by the growers, we are entitled to give to that board the same responsibility and the same powers as were previously possessed by Grain Importers Ltd.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Grain Importers Ltd. had not that power.  I may be completely wrong, but I believe other Deputies will agree with me.  Why not continue the procedure whereby applications to import feeding stuffs, outside of coarse grains, were made to the Department?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>In actual fact, the Department has been exercising that <Col N="545" /> power because, from time to time, the Minister has cut down on the imports of wheat and offals when he considered there was alternative feeding stuff in the country, such as unmillable wheat. I am asking only that the Department continue to exercise that function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point which the Deputy is making, but I consider that would not be fair to the producers.  According to the scheme in this Bill, the producers will be called upon to pay a levy to meet the cost of the disposal of any wheat produced in excess of 300,000 tons of dried wheat. A board has been set up to handle that levy and that surplus, and do Deputies think it would be fair to that board and to the producers to say, on the one hand: &ldquo;We make you responsible for financing the disposal of any wheat,&rdquo; while at the same time somebody else is to retain the right to grant permission for imports of coarse grain?  I do not think that would be fair.  I believe the provision here is entirely justifiable and I do not believe any other provision would be justifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, there is no reason why this board cannot advise the Minister to restrict the importation of any type of feeding stuff, but I do object to handing over such sweeping powers to a board of this kind set up to deal specifically with one thing, that is, the disposal of surplus wheat.  I do not see how the producers would be treated unfairly by continuing the practice which has hitherto been effective in the Department of Agriculture, which must have an overall knowledge of the position.  This board may be a very transitory one.  The appointment of its directors is only for a term of two years and that does not seem to give it any permanence at all.  I think it would be wrong to hand over to-it a job that has been done quite well under the aegis of the Minister's Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Russell has the merchants' point of view in this matter and I cannot convince him.  I suppose he would prefer that the position remain as he has stated it to be, but I do not believe that would be <Col N="546" /> right.  I believe that those who will be called upon to make contributions, to accept deductions from the stated price to enable this board to dispose of surplus wheat, should have a right to determine what amount of coarse grain should be imported into the country, and that is what I am providing for here.  I do not suppose I can force Deputy Russell to accept that point of view, but, from the point of view of the producers, it is entirely defensible.</P>

I suggest that if the Minister has made up his mind it will hold office for two years, he must have some idea of the terms he is going to propose to the persons who will be appointed for that term of two years. I am virtually certain that he knows with reasonable precision what recommendation he intends to make in that <Col N="548" /> respect, but he does not want to say so.  He does not want to say what fees they are to get because he is at the moment smarting under the regulation whereby the fees of the chairman of the Agricultural Credit Corporation have been increased by 50 per cent. He has not yet told us what fees are being paid to Dr. Maguire, as chairman of the Greyhound Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister, in reply to a parliamentary question, when he was dealing with the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, gave figures for the financial years 1953-54, 1954-55, 1955-56 and I think he said he had not got the figures as yet for 1957-58.  There was another question addressed to the Minister for Finance, in connection with which the Minister for Finance envisaged larger <Col N="550" /> disbursements in respect of housing in connection with the Housing (Amendment) Bill before the House.  Perhaps the Minister remembers that.  I assumed that some calculation had been made in that connection and, if it were, I thought the Minister might be able to give us the fruits of that calculation on the occasion of this Money Resolution.  Perhaps no precise figure was present to the mind of the Minister for Finance when he was speaking, but he appeared to have made an estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, as to what the Minister for Finance had in mind or, indeed, the context in which he made the reply, I am not quite clear. The best I can do for the Deputy in reply to his original question in regard to this Money Resolution is to give an estimate of what we feel may be the requirements, not for the remainder of this year, but for a full year and in regard to the Housing (Amendment) Bill.  The cost to the Exchequer in a full year arising from increased demands for grants and the increase in the amount of grants, we feel, will be somewhere in the region of £385,000&mdash; that is, for State grants&mdash;and, in regard to the draw from the Local Loans Fund by housing authorities in respect of loans and grants, a figure somewhere in the region of £502,000, again related to what we feel may be the estimate for a full year's operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>This section is dealt with at a later stage in detail.  From the layman's point of view, this section, and a few other sections we will come to, are really book-keeping arrangements within the various Departments of Finance, Local Government and the Land Commission, where certain subsidies of small amounts were being paid out from the Department of Local Government to local authorities to meet commitments entered into by the local authorities in the past and which we are now proposing should be brought into the hands and under the control of the Minister for Finance. Hereafter, we will cease to pay out with our left hands to the local authorities that which the Minister for Finance will be taking back with his right hand, and the same with the Land Commission, or <i>vice versa.</i>  We are dealing with it at a later stage in the Bill and it is merely referred to in this section as a repeal.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that these things are complex, particularly where there are proposals for repeals.  Perhaps the Minister would understand that the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1906, is dear to me, for a variety of reasons into which we need not go.  I just do not know what Section 17 of that Act did.  Perhaps, before the matter is resumed, the Minister may have a chance of looking at the original Act&mdash;indeed I may have that chance myself&mdash;and letting me know what Section 17 of the old Act is and what it is we are dropping.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Book of Estimates, the figure for the President's Establishment is £8,340.  It is only fair that a true picture of the expenditure under this Vote should be make known.  The figure of £8,340 may appear in large print at the top of this Estimate, but we find in small print at the bottom of the same page that the total expenditure for this establishment over the coming year will be £50,876.  It is time we had a little realistic thinking about this expenditure.</P>
      <P>For a number of years, we have heard admonitions from the Taoiseach and from members of the Government that the people were living beyond their means, that certain sections of this community were spending too much and that consequently as a nation we would have to tighten our belts.  It is only fair to suggest, when the hairshirt is being put on the very poor sections of the community because they are supposed to be spending beyond their means, that that same hairshirt should be applied to those in the very highest positions in the State.  Yet we find that over the past ten years we have spent on the President's Establishment the sum of £476,000.  I doubt if any Deputy is in a position to prove that the expenditure of £476,000 in ten years on an establishment of this nature can be justified in the circumstances in which this country finds itself over that period of ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My criticism here is in no way aimed at the individual, for whom I have the greatest regard, who occupies the post of President.  My criticism is levelled at the air of unreality that exists as a result of this expenditure.  When a visitor comes to this country, is taken up to the Park where that huge expenditure takes place and has a good look there, he undoubtedly leaves under the impression that a country which can afford such pomp and ceremony is a wealthy nation.  Any visitor would be justified, if he did not see the rest of Ireland, in leaving this country with the impression that we were a nation that had no serious problems to surmount, that we were a contented and prosperous people and that no skeletons in the cupboard in the line of high <Col N="554" /> unemployment and high emigration existed behind this facade of a presidential establishment which will cost in the coming year a sum of £50,000.</P>
    <P>We are told day after day that there is no money available for a number of very suitable and desirable projects. We are told that the people must tighten their belts, but those very same people are expected to keep up this hypocritical front.  People are expected to believe in this fraud, this front, that we are a nation that can compare with some of the wealthiest nations in the world.  The only comparison we can make is in regard to the facade.  We have the front all right that can compare in luxury and in pomp with some of the great nations of the world, but behind that front, we are a nation dwindling in population and on the verge of bankruptcy as well. We can compare in the gilded trappings with other great nations of the world, but we depend on many of those great nations to give a living to the unfortunate people for whom we here are charged with the duty of seeing that work is made available in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The time is ripe to have the question of the expenditure on this luxurious establishment examined and pruned forthwith.  The public over the years, I am certain, have not been truly aware of the excessive amount of money made available for this establishment and I hope that from now forward people will be told what the exact expenditure will be.  The audited expenditure for last year was £47,000 odd and the total expenditure is expected to be £50,876 this year.  That shows that there is likely to be an increase by the end of this year of over £3,000 on the presidential establishment.  Can anybody in his senses justify that expenditure at present?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I have anything to say.  It is laid down in the Constitution that there shall be a President and an establishment provided for him and so on.  I do not know that we could make any great change.  Of course, there has been a somewhat abnormal expenditure on the alteration and renovation of the buildings here over the last few years, but I think that is almost complete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise one point on this Estimate.  I put a question in this House some weeks ago in connection with the expenditure on foreign fuel to heat this establishment and to heat the Taoiseach's establishment in Government Buildings.  The reply I received was to the effect that, over the past ten years, a sum of approximately £70,000 had been spent on foreign fuel to heat Leinster House and Government Buildings just behind it.  I was amazed last week to read in the daily papers that the Tánaiste took himself off to County Kildare and, at a function in connection with Bord na Móna, proceeded to berate industrialists, manufacturers and factory owners for their failure to use Irish fuel in their establishments for energy and heating purposes.  The Tánaiste got quite annoyed with many of the industrialists and big business people in this country for using foreign fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His criticism would have carried far greater weight in Kildare and the country generally, if he himself and his Taoiseach set the good example <Col N="556" /> before going to Kildare by ensuring that only Irish fuel is used to heat Leinster House and Government Buildings. This is another example of the air of unreality in this country at present.  The attitude of the Government seems to be: Do not do as we do but do as we tell you.  The attitude of the Government is to admonish and criticise those down the country who are still enamoured of foreign fuel, while at the same time they set the bad example by using it in this House. How can we criticise the ordinary businessman for using the fuel he has been accustomed to for years and for failing to change over to native fuel, when the Government themselves are not setting the good example?</P>
    <P>Apart from the bad example, the sum of £70,000 that has been expended on foreign fuel would have provided a certain amount of employment here on our bogs and would have helped to ensure that a few of the men who had to emigrate would have secured work in Ireland.  There is another aspect. We have been told here for a number of years that there has been a disequilibrium in our balance of payments. Indeed, the present Government and the last Government took certain action with regard to imports in order to remedy the unsatisfactory position. But here we have an item appearing as an import which, in its own way, causes disequilibrium in the balance of payments.  That item should not be there at all because the means of heating these houses should be produced here in Ireland.</P>

That is not only natural but also right and proper.  But if we are to have a worthwhile economic service we must do something even if it does cost more money to ensure that statistical information is available more speedily.  Advances have been made in the provision of statistics over the last few years, and all credit for them.  The people, however, in the last three years have developed a much greater awareness of the need for statistics and economic information. That has happened partly because of the deliberate policy adopted of trying to ensure that the economic facts which affect their lives will be appreciated. This is a very good development and I think it a pity that the Minister has not carried on the practice of making more information available about the economic policy, the aims and objects of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although that is a pity, it would be difficult for him in certain respects to do it when he has not got up-to-date statistical information.  Some of the information made available by the Statistics Office is, perhaps, not quite so necessary while some of the vital things that we must know should be made available far more quickly after the relevant dates.  The <i>Statistical Survey</i>, for example, published a fortnight ago should have been available before the Budget debate, if the members of the House were to consider the budgetary policy introduced by the Minister in its true and proper setting. Having been in the Minister's seat, I know that frequently the Minister for Finance has to formulate policy on <Col N="559" /> economic matters without having all the latest data available to him.</P>
    <P>Money spent on the provision of a more up-to-date service would be money well spent and I hope that the Minister will give the matter his consideration in the coming year so that, in addition to having more up-to-date information, he will endeavour so far as possible to ensure that such information will be disseminated more widely than heretofore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Central Statistics Office for the very valuable information made available, not merely to Deputies, but to the people generally.  If I have any regret in this respect, it is that these statistics, which are circulated so freely and publicised by the newspapers, are not generally read by the public at large with the result that when one comes to discuss our basic economic trends one finds that the information which has been freely disseminated has not been read, or certainly has not been absorbed by a large section of the community.</P>
      <P>It would be worth our while&mdash;the method of doing this is not obvious to me at the moment&mdash;to endeavour to develop among our people a greater interest in the economic trends which are shown by the statistical information issued by the Central Statistics Office.  That office has made enormous strides over the past 15 years, a development of which we all approve. I should like the Minister to ask the office to consider in what way they could more effectively publicise the valuable material which they make available.  I agree with Deputy Sweetman that some items of information are much more important than others.  For example, we could wait to receive some of the material in due course after some little delay which would not matter very much.  But there are statistics which it is desirable to get with the utmost expedition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also agree that the publishing of the <i>Survey</i>, say, in the seventh month of the year, seven months after the year closes is really not giving that <i>Survey</i> the priority which I think is <Col N="560" /> desirable.  This is a most valuable publication, a most thorough-going examination of economic, agricultural, industrial and employment trends, and I hope the Minister, with the assistance of the office, can devise some means by which that very valuable publication can be produced much earlier than at present, or that some of the more valuable or urgent information contained in it will be published as a preliminary survey even if we must wait for a later date to get the details contained in the complete volume.</P>
    <P>Subject to these comments, which are intended to be helpful and not critical, I think the Statistics Office does a very good job but I wish the material it disseminates would be more carefully studied by the people generally so that they would know and observe trends in our national development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join in the tribute to the Central Statistics Office. It is a well-run office and the information supplied is very useful and is lucidly compiled.  I agree that we do not make the best possible use of the service, and I think the public generally may be confused by tables of figures.  I wonder if the information coming from the office could be given in diagrams rather than in tables and in sets of figures?  Such a system has been used to indicate trends in other activities.  If the public were more aware of the position, particularly the difficulties of the country, people would give more support to action designed to surmount these difficulties because they would recognise what the Government of the day was up against.  They would be in a position to judge the efforts of the Government of the day to overcome difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Norton that the <i>Survey</i> might be published in two parts &mdash;a preliminary survey which would come out before the Budget and could be used in the Budget debate, the second part coming out, possibly, later on.  We seem unable to get in this House anything like accurate figures for emigration.  I put down a question in the Dáil in the early months of this year and the reply I got was to the effect that the only accurate figures for <Col N="561" /> emigration are those revealed by the census every five years.  I suggest it is not beyond the competence of the very efficient Central Statistics Office to arrive at a reasonably accurate figure for annual emigration in the early months of the following year. They might be asked to turn their energies to that task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I do not think I could agree&mdash;I may not have got exactly what Deputy Norton said&mdash;that the Statistics Department should present their information more attractively, as it were.  That is a matter for journalists, and so on.  If they get the figures, they can pick out things that attract people by giving examples of figures, and so on.</P>
      <P>I quite agree that we should try to get out figures as quickly as possible. On the other hand, it might be unfair to give the impression to the public that we are very dilatory about these figures.  I believe we compare fairly well with other countries.  The <i>Trade Statistics</i> come out on 13th of the month; the unemployment figures come out five days after the week is over.</P>
      <P>As regards the <i>Economic Survey</i>, I admit it does not come out fully until July or August.  However, the most vital figures in that <i>Economic Survey</i> are published at Budget time, around the middle of April.  On the whole, we should be pleased that our Statistics Department are doing very well. At the same time, I do not want to give Deputies the impression that I would not like to see things done better if at all possible.  I am sure that without being urged, they will do that. They seem to be very keen on presenting figures of all kinds and with the greatest possible expedition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any discussion I had about emigration with those in the Statistics Department, they said they cannot see any way of giving a correct figure, except at census time, every five years. That is understandable.  People can go across the Border, for example, and no enumeration is possible of the numbers of people going backwards and forwards.  If there were, they could take the figures of people going out and coming in and, with births and deaths, could give the correct figure <Col N="562" /> every year.  Deputies must see the difficulty of giving a very precise figure on emigration, except at the time of the census.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister <Col N="564" /> not think that the functions of an auditor in relation to Government funds and the functions of an auditor in relation to trading companies are entirely different?  In relation to Government funds, the business of the auditor is purely to see that the funds are paid out only under the authority of the Oireachtas and, in particular, of the Dáil&mdash;and, of course, to ensure that the moneys are not appropriated in any improper respect.</P>
      <P>A trading company auditor, however, can give very valuable advisory services, apart from actual auditing.  Because of such an auditor's wide connection with other companies, he is able to offer assistance to the company in relation to their methods.  I cannot see how the two things can, therefore, be combined unless the Minister makes the case to me that one section of the Comptroller and Auditor General's staff deals solely with company accounts and the other section deals solely with public accounts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to what I might call an impromptu debate on inflation and deflation which we had at the end of the Finance Bill.  I feel we did not <Col N="565" /> deal very adequately with the question at the time and I should like to elaborate a little on it now.  Inflation and deflation are not only of interest to us but are a very vital question in most European countries and, I suppose, in every country outside Europe, too.  I gave an &ldquo;off-the-cuff&rdquo; reply to Deputy Sweetman last week and I might, perhaps, supplement it briefly now by indicating how I regard the present state of the economy and the prospects for the future.</P>
    <P>There was a significant recovery in 1957.  Gross national product regained the ground lost in 1956.  This improvement was due to increased agricultural production.  In the transportable goods industries output over the whole year was slightly less than in 1956 but the last quarter showed a sharp rise of over 8 per cent. above the corresponding quarter of 1956.  The fall in 1956 in the volume of output per person employed was partly made good in 1957.  Towards the end of the year unemployment began to decrease relative to the corresponding period of 1956.</P>
    <P>The increase in the national income in 1957 went into savings and not into consumption.  Provided it is maintained, this increase in savings will provide the basis for a higher level of productive home investment.</P>
    <P>On the whole, economic trends in 1957 were in the right direction.  There still exist, of course, the problems of a high level of unemployment and an insufficiency of productive investment. When introducing the Budget in April last I said that the primary aim of policy must be to secure as much productive employment as possible while at the same time restraining inflationary forces so as to avoid balance of payments difficulties.  This remains our policy.  Its achievement depends on maintaining the improvement in production and the higher level of savings which were gratifying features of 1957.</P>
    <P>The returns available for the present year do not disclose any strong inflationary or deflationary influences at work in the economy.  The trade figures provide the best immediate indication. As expected, imports have increased, but this has been offset to some extent by a further expansion of exports and by an improvement in the terms of <Col N="566" /> trade.  Provided the gap does not widen, external payments this year should not be far from balance.  There seems little prospect, however, of any surplus.  Last year's £9,000,000, following an unbroken series of deficits since 1946, was probably an isolated experience. In any case, our policy is to avoid deficits rather than to build up surpluses&mdash;we want all our savings to be turned into productive home capital.</P>
    <P>The increase of £6.2 million in the import excess in the first six months of the year is not, of itself, alarming.  The position needs to be carefully watched but unemployment is too high to warrant our taking any restrictive measures before it is clear beyond doubt that they are essential to stop a drain on our reserves.  As far as I can judge, we have at the moment neither inflation nor deflation.  What we have to do is to preserve that balance, at the same time increasing our production, and maintaining our savings so as to provide the capital necessary to finance the greater productive investment we require to raise our living standards permanently.</P>
    <P>In my Budget speech I stressed the need for a general review of investment policy to ensure that our development resources would be applied to immediately productive purposes to the greatest extent possible.  I mentioned that a study was being prepared in my Department, with the co-operation of other Government Departments and State bodies, as to how best our economic deficiencies might be remedied and our development opportunities realised.  I have also since then received a report from the Capital Investment Advisory Committee dealing with the principles on which future development should be based.  Our development resources and problems were discussed generally with a representative of the World Bank who visited Dublin recently.  I am confident that the advice received from these various sources will prove of great assistance in the consideration of future policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is wise not to rely on the statement he made at the end of the Finance Bill.  He is wise to have sought the opportunity <Col N="567" /> to-day to expand his remarks on that occasion, or it might be more accurate to say that the Minister is wise to make a more coherent comment on our economic position.  The debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate will start tomorrow and on that Estimate we shall have an opportunity of discussing our economic position.  Therefore I do not propose to anticipate that discussion now except to say that in so far as there is a balance, to which the Minister has referred, between inflation and deflation, it is a balance that has been brought about the worst possible way. It is a balance that has been brought about by an inflation of current expenditure and a deflation of capital expenditure.</P>
      <P>It is because the one offsets the other that we have the position to which the Minister referred.  That can never show any lasting economic progress. On the contrary, it must run down our rate of economic progress rather than accelerate it.  We must remember too, that at the present moment we are in a period in which prices, in so far as imports to this country are concerned, are decreasing and have decreased enormously.  The economic series issued at the beginning of this month shows that they are down some 7 per cent. and at the same time as import prices have decreased some 7 per cent., in the last figures available, that is from April last year to April this year, we find that the cost of living has risen by over nine points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Eleven points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Eleven points now. It seems a strange commentary on a Government that got into office because they alleged, amongst other things, that under the previous Government the cost of living had risen unduly.  In our time import prices were rising but the cost of living was remaining comparatively stable.  In the term of this Government import prices are dropping week by week and month by month and yet prices are rising.  We should have got a great deal of relief on that score, for example, from the enormous fall in shipping freight rates because our pattern is such that there is a small shipping <Col N="568" /> distance for our exports and a long distance for our imports.  In spite of that being the pattern we see, as I say, that our home prices are rising all the time.</P>
      <P>To revert to what I was saying in connection with the capital and current expenditure, I was a little bit surprised by a statement which the Minister made in reply to a question to-day.  He said that the capital Budget for this year would be amended by the passage of the Housing Bill.  How much it is to be amended I do not know and as far as I could follow the Minister he said he did not know himself the extent to which that was so.  Change there may bring up the amount of capital expenditure that is to be made this year.  Whether it will bring it up over and above the amount by which our current incomes were inflated, as a result of the deliberate action of the Minister last year in his Budget, is another question; but we will have an opportunity of discussing that tomorrow on the Taoiseach's Estimate.</P>
      <P>On this Estimate, I wish to refer to one specific matter which comes within its purview.  I do not know whether there is a statutory obligation or not, but whether there is or not, the returns are published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> every week of Receipts Into and Issues Out of the Exchequer.  The pattern of that publication has been settled for a very long time and Deputies and others who are interested have been able, because of the publication, to follow the course of revenue and the course of expenditure. Apparently, some time during the last financial year, the Minister changed the pattern in relation to expenditure, without any public notification.  As far as I could gather from him, the effect of the changes made in the Paymaster-General's accounting system is that this table which is published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, in so far as the issues are concerned, is of no value at all. The weekly Exchequer issues are not now carried in that return and the position now is that the sums come in only quarterly and that quarterly correct balances are included from the point of view of knowing how current expenditure runs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not challenge the wisdom of the <Col N="569" /> change which the Minister has made in the Paymaster-General's accounts.  I do not know what change he has made, because he has not told the House or the country.  I do say that the Minister was very wrong indeed to mislead those who read <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> by making that change, without disclosing that the change had been made and that the figures published did not, therefore, produce a true reflection.</P>
    <P>When I spoke here on the Vote on Account on the 5th March, I had the figures from <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> compared; and the figures that were then available to everybody made it apparent that the position was a certain one between revenue and expenditure.  The Minister did not, even on the Vote on Account, pay the House the courtesy of telling us that the figures published week by week, while they are, of course, correct figures, did not disclose the true position.  I think that is reprehensible.</P>
    <P>It was most unfortunate that Deputies here and people outside were misled in that way.  We should avail ourselves of this opportunity to obtain from the Minister the fullest possible explanation of the changes he has made in the system of making issues from the Exchequer and we should also hear from him what proposals he has to ensure that, in the administration during the coming year of this return, it will bear a true reflection, week by week, of the situation, instead of reflecting it only at the end of each quarter, as is the position at the present time.</P>
    <P>It does not matter so much, perhaps, in the June or September quarters.  It certainly matters an awful lot in the last quarter of the year, when revenue is coming in heavily and when it is essential to balance the two, side by side, to get an appreciation of the situation at that time of the year and, particularly, before the Vote on Account.  I do not understand&mdash;we have not been told and therefore I could not understand&mdash;what changes have been made.  All that the Minister has said is that he has made changes and therefore the accounts cannot be compared.</P>
    <Col N="570" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not clear, from what the Minister said, what the Government's precise angle is on our balance of payments position, as revealed by the returns of the last six months.  Looking at this matter objectively, and without any desire to make political capital out of it, one can see that the balance of payments, even putting the most favourable gloss on it, is still far from satisfactory.  The increase in the deficit on the balance of trade is disquieting at this stage and it is particularly disquieting because one never knows how long high prices are likely to last on the British market for our exportable agricultural surplus.</P>
      <P>The figures revealed in the first six months offer grounds for serious reflection. I am not suggesting by that remark that the Government should fly in the direction either of additional levies or of restrictions on imports; but the basic fact remains that the essential thing to do is to be able to pay for our imports.  No Government, no matter what its political complexion, can look on with complacency at a situation developing in which we are compelled to pay for an excess of imports by running down sterling assets. I am not one of those who regard external assets as sacred assets which cannot be touched under any circumstances. I prefer to see our external assets repatriated here for use in the form of capital goods, in the form of machinery or tools of production, in a form which would give a productive return for the repatriation of those assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be no party to permitting deliberately a situation to develop whereby our external assets were run down for the purpose of purchasing luxury and non-essential articles.  No Government can with equanimity contemplate the continuance of a situation in which our external assets are run down for the purpose of buying luxury and non-essential goods.  Notwithstanding the favourable trend in our balance of payments in the past 12 months, I still think there is need for disciplined buying on the part of our people.  There is necessity to realise the fact that we can pay for what we <Col N="571" /> import only in either of two ways&mdash;by selling more goods to enable us to pay for what we buy or by running down our external assets.</P>
    <P>While external assets could usefully be repatriated for use in this country, until such time as we reach that stage those external assets are valuable for the purpose of providing a buttress to enable us to pay for the raw materials which we must import, if we are to maintain and expand employment at home.  The ultimate remedy for imbalance of payments is to endeavour to expand our production and our exports, so as to enable us to pay for the goods which we must import to maintain civilised living conditions and to provide reasonable amenities for our people.  Until such time as somebody does that, it behoves any Government in office to take all necessary steps to ensure that our balance of payments does not get out of control, and that such steps as are necessary are taken, in order to ensure that the economy is sufficiently safeguarded so as to prevent a running down of our external assets in the purchase of non-essential and luxury goods, and even in the purchase of consumer goods which might be avoided.</P>
    <P>So far as I gathered from the Minister's statement, it is the Government's intention to look at the situation in the light of what had been revealed in the past six months.  I understood him to say that the Government were watching the position, but did not want to take any action in a restrictive way, lest the effect of doing so would be to increase unemployment.  I appreciate that point of view, but some indication should be given on this Estimate, or during the debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate, of what the Government have in mind, in respect of this situation, as revealed by the figures for the last six months.</P>
    <P>This House will be in recess for probably three months and, in a matter of this kind, the people should be taken into the confidence of the Government. The people generally ought to learn that the most vital defence of the nation's economic position is to ensure a balance in its trading relations.  The <Col N="572" /> policy of the Government and of the people should not be different in that respect.  The Government and the people ought to be at one in defending the nation's economic structure, and I would strongly urge the Government to take steps to bring the people into their confidence, so that the people may appreciate the trading trends, and be aware of the steps which it may be necessary to take in order to bring our balance of payments into equilibrium.</P>
    <P>As I said, the ideal solution is more production and greater exports.  When one looks at the volume of our physical imports and the volume of our physical exports, we see a very substantial gap, one which is bridged only by the fact that we get invisible exports in the form of dividends, in the form of emigrants' remittances, in the form of pensions and in the form of tourist traffic.  While that is all highly desirable and valuable, from the point of view of correcting our trading accounts, the ideal situation would be not to have to reply on the perhaps somewhat precarious income from these sources, but to be able to match our physical imports with our physical exports.</P>
    <P>I hope that during the debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate to-morrow the Government will be able to place us in the picture as to their intentions, if this general trend is manifested for the remainder of the year, or if they should find the British market, for one reason or another, is not capable of absorbing all the agricultural products we have to export, or if the British market cannot pay in 1958 the prices which were paid for our cattle exports in 1957.</P>
    <P>Any change on the agricultural front could have a serious result and could produce a serious dislocation in our balance of payments, as far as the cattle trade is concerned, and we ought to know generally what is the Government's plan.  We would like to know what the Government's plan is, if our cattle exports for this year do not fetch in gross income what they fetched in 1957.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has read the papers, as Deputy Sweetman said, has been struck in the past 12 months by the substantial fall in the commodity market.  The prices of raw materials <Col N="573" /> and freight rates have been falling very substantially during that period.  There was a time when to transport a ton of coal from America cost as much as did the coal itself when bought in America, but that situation has completely changed.  It is reckoned that anything from 15 per cent. to 20 per cent. of the world's shipping is tied up because owners cannot get satisfactory charter rates, and can get only charter rates which would involve operating their ships at a loss.  The community does not seem to have got any benefit consequent upon the fall in commodity prices, in shipping rates, and in the cost of raw materials.  Far from getting any benefit, the cost of living index to-day is 11 points higher than it was in February, 1957.</P>
    <P>I think the Central Statistics Office might be asked to undertake an inquiry to ascertain what we might have reasonably expected in reduced prices as a result of the fall in freight rates on the cargoes which we import, and the reduced prices we could have expected following upon the decrease in the price of raw materials.  Somebody is getting the difference between the prices of raw materials to-day and the prices 12 or 18 months ago.  Somebody is getting the benefit of the fall in freight rates, but it is not the consuming public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We might establish that by a certain process, but we ought to know what we could have expected, because decreases in the prices of raw materials, down through the ages, have meant reductions in wholesale and retail prices of commodities in countries which bought these raw materials.  That process now seems to have been arrested and while freight rates and raw material prices are falling throughout the world, the public here are not getting any benefit from the reductions.  We ought to know from the Minister, who is our economic guide in matters of this kind&mdash;and who some people might say is our economic Messiah&mdash;what we are entitled to expect, and if that expectation will be <Col N="574" /> realised in the foreseeable future.  I want to raise another point but I should like to know are the other Estimates being taken separately?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has curtailed that practice by giving us a recommendation for his Estimate this year which is a correction of what he said last week.  If they are all to be taken together, I want to raise two points.  In the Minister's Budget speech this year, he referred to a proposal which had been submitted to heads of Departments for a radical alteration in the present Civil Service structure, and said that he was confident substantial progress would be made in producing whatever reorganisation he had in mind, during the present fiscal year.  I want to ascertain from the Minister how far this question of altering the Civil Service structure has gone, and whether the matter is at a stage at which the Minister could give us some picture as to what he has in mind, and when the House is likely to be able to see something emerge from the plans foreshadowed in the Minister's speech last year and underlined by him in his speech this year.</P>
      <P>Is it intended to simplify the whole Civil Service structure, to reduce the number of grades, to carry out a process of assimilation of one grade, or more than one grade, with another grade and, generally, if the information is available now, I would ask him to give us some picture of what he has in mind in this alteration of the structure, to which he referred in his Budget speech last year and also this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to raise a question <Col N="575" /> on the Estimate relating to superannuation and retired allowances.  Within the past 15 months, there has been, as everybody knows, an increase in the cost of living index figure&mdash;in fact, an increase which has now brought the cost of living index figure to a higher level than it has ever reached.  Many people who retired from the Civil Service, the Army, the police force and the service of the local authorities did so at a time when the cost of living was substantially less than it is to-day.</P>
    <P>In so far as they had retired before 1950, they got an increase in that year to compensate for an increase in the cost of living between the time they retired and the year 1950.  A further increase was granted to them, I think, in 1955.  There has been no increase since, notwithstanding the fact that there has been a substantial rise in the cost of living since the last increase was granted.  In fact, there has been a rise of 12 points in the index figure over the past 15 months.</P>
    <P>While the Government did not inspire the recent national wage agreement, they at least recognised it was something that had to take place and that an adjustment upwards of wages was necessary because of the increase in the cost of living.  People who have served the State, whether in the national or local services, have to live on pensions in the same way as those who work in the capacities vacated by those who have retired have to live. I think that in all equity there is a case for permitting the local authorities to grant increases to their employees where they feel that an increase is justified by a rise in prices and that the State, too, ought to recognise that, if it devalues money by permitting prices to rise, then it is morally obliged to increase the pensions which it has granted to those who have served it for a long number of years.  I should like to ascertain from the Minister whether the Government contemplates any review of the pension increase legislation with a view to providing some compensation for those who retired on pensions which will buy very much less to-day than at the time they retired.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as we maintain our balance of trade, the question of savings and capital investment will be all right because if we maintain our balance of trade, any savings we have must go into capital.  They do not go elsewhere.  In 1957, we had a favourable balance of trade.  As a result, we had a higher allocation in capital than for many years previously.  I do not think what Deputy Sweetman, said is true about a sort of change over, more current expenditure and less capital. In any case, that can be ascertained only when our accounts come to be made up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>For 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy asked what did I mean when I referred in reply to a question to-day to more capital being required for housing.  I just think that, as a result of the Housing Bill where the facilities for borrowing are more favourable in the repair of existing houses and also in the purchase of secondhand houses, more money may be required for that purpose. For that reason, I thought the amount required in the housing field might be higher than last year.  I do not know what that may amount to.</P>
      <P>The figures in regard to this year's balance of trade are not so good.  I must say that I never thought they would be.  I do not think I lost any opportunity last year, when speaking on this question, of saying that I did not expect that for the first quarter of 1958 the figures would be as good as the figures in respect of the first quarter of 1957.  I pointed out on all those occasions that there had been a rather lower export of cattle towards the end of 1956 and an abnormally high export of cattle in the first quarter of 1957. That could not be repeated in 1958. That turned out to be true.</P>
      <P>The figures for May and June are all right.  Our export figures are good and our import figures are all right, too. May and June compare favourably enough with the same months last year.  I expect the remainder of this year will work out much the same as last year, so we are all right.  It would mean that we would work out in or about balancing our payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> External assets are necessary.  There is no doubt about that.  We could not carry on international trade, unless we had some external assets to help us out, but as far as I look at the matter, I do not think we should make a big effort to build up our external assets at the moment.  They are bit low and we should try to build them up some time.  We can build them up at the present time only by taking rather painful methods, by making it difficult in regard to employment and lowering the standard of living somewhat.  I think that with the amount of unemployment in the country, we should not attempt to do that at the moment.  If we can keep things balanced, we are all right and not try to increase our external assets for the time being.</P>
    <P>There were a few other questions raised.  First of all, with regard to the presentation of accounts which Deputy Sweetman raised, I gave him some information in answer to a question some time ago.  Roughly, the position is this.  We do not pay out to the Paymaster-General uniformly throughout the quarter.  We find he is not touched for money until the end of the quarter and at the end of the quarter, it is paid out.  As a matter of fact, the end of the quarter accounts should compare with the end of the quarter accounts last year.  During the quarter, you would not have the same comparison. Deputy Sweetman says he does not object to that, but he thinks that we should compare things more frequently in the last quarter of the financial year.</P>
    <P>I think that, under the present system, we will not be able to do that, unless we can devise some other system of giving more information for the last months of the financial year.  We save under this system a certain amounts of interest on overdrafts or on borrowing, as the case may be.  From the point of view of the Exchequer, therefore, it is a good system.  We save a certain amount of money.  I do not think any Deputy would advocate that we should, as it were, go back to the old system and pay out more for the sake of giving information.  If we can give that information without doing that, all the better.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton raised a question about the reorganisation of the Civil Service.  That suggested reorganisation went from my Department to the heads of Departments on the 17th April.  We have got replies from some of the Departments.  We have not got replies from other.  The replies we got from some Departments differ very much indeed in their comments on the proposed reorganisation and for that reason I think it would be unfair to ask that I should give any more information at the moment.  If we have any hope of getting agreement, first of all, from the heads of Departments and secondly from the organisations in the Civil Service, we shall have a better chance of getting agreement by not making the terms of the reorganisation public at the moment.</P>

      <P>I think this is the correct Estimate on which to raise a matter about which I gave the Minister notice some months ago.  The Acquisition of Land Act provides that in certain circumstances matters may be submitted to a panel of arbitrators. The practice has been for many years to have only one arbitrator.  I do not want anything I may say to imply that I have anything against that arbitrator; I have not.  I am thinking of this purely from the point of view of the system.  How can only one person be a panel?  I suggest the appointment of one official arbitrator alone, when the Act says that a panel of arbitrators must be appointed, is not in accordance with the Act.  I do not know whether the present position is that the present official arbitrator is run off his feet. However, I know of one case where for six months a person has been anxious that an arbitration in relation to the value of land acquired should come for hearing, but there has been no opportunity of that coming for hearing.  If you have only one person, where the wording of the Act is &ldquo;a panel of arbitrators&rdquo;, that is not a panel because the word &ldquo;panel&rdquo; implies a choice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position is that it is possible, for a compounded fee, to get permission from the Minister to publish handmade copies of ordnance survey publications.  The copies in which I am interested, however, are machine made copies, photostats, and I am interested in them, first, when there has been work done on the ordnance sheet and, secondly, I am interested only in parts of the ordnance sheets, not the full sheets. It very often happens that in engineers' offices, in legal offices and also in respect of submissions to local authorities, it is necessary to submit marked ordnance maps.  If, for example, a poor law valuation is to be <Col N="587" /> divided, then a marked tracing has to be submitted to the local authority and has to come forward to the Valuation Office very often in relation to a map on a deed.  The map consists of the ordnance sheet duly marked and then when the deed has to be copied and copies of the deed supplied it is not possible at present to photostat that map.</P>
      <P>I want to make a plea to the Minister to adopt here a system by virtue of which professional people, be they engineers, solicitors or others, will be able, under strict rules, to pay a compounded fee for the copyright of copying, by photostat or other mechanical process, marked ordnance maps.  I want to make it certain that such people cannot sell the ordnance map as such and, therefore, I suggest it should only be part of the map.</P>
      <P>I make the suggestion in the interests of accuracy.  If a map has to be copied by hand, as is permitted, there is a danger of inaccuracies.  If it is photostated there cannot be any inaccuracy and it is often most important that in relation to deeds and in relation to apportionments of valuations, and so on, it would be possible to utilise the marked ordnance sheet in the way I have indicated.  The Minister would lose nothing by it no matter what he may be told, because if the permission is given the Minister will get the compounded fee and if the permission is not given the copy will be made by hand with all the additional trouble and danger of inaccuracy that will involve.</P>

      <P>This is the section whereby local authorities may pay supplementary housing grants where a Gaeltacht grant is paid.  Could the Minister do anything to speed up the payment of the supplementary grant? As the Minister knows, the supplementary grant is not paid until the Local Government or Gaeltacht Housing grant is paid.  The Minister will appreciate it is a hardship on builders and people having their houses repaired because there is a considerable lapse between the payment of the first instalment of either the Gaeltacht or Local Government grant and the payment of the balance; and nothing can be got by way of supplementary until such time as the balance of the Gaeltacht or Local Government grant is paid.  If the Minister could look into it <Col N="589" /> and see if something could be done to speed it up, it would be very advantageous to builders.  There may be some reason why it cannot be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that the whole idea underlying the payment of supplementary grants by housing authorities is, as the Deputy is well aware, that the matter is left to their discretion.  I suppose we could go even further and say that the rules and regulations governing the payment of these grants must also be left to them, unless in some instances it could be shown that the whole idea behind housing grants was being negatived.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most important parts of this Bill, and if the Minister can devise some way of speeding up the payment of grants, he will <Col N="590" /> make this Bill a great success.  My experience, and I am sure it has been the experience of other Deputies, too, is that there is often great delay with the inspector.  I put it to the Minister that these delays would not be necessary at all if the Department could see their way to take a certificate from the local engineers.  The local engineers are appointed by the Appointments Commission and I respectfully submit that they are as well qualified as the Department's men.</P>

      <P>With regard to subsection (4) of this section, there is a hiatus.  Between 1st April and 1st July, where people may have begun the installation of water and sewerage, they would be cut out from the benefits of this section.  Between now and the Report Stage, would the Minister consider amending that to make it retrospective to 1st April last?  If that could be done, it might be of considerable advantage to those who have done what is usually done&mdash;made preparation for the improvement of their houses during spring or early summer, particularly the laying on of water and sanitary services.

Provision has now been made to bring those benefits up to date in a retrospective manner at the old rates.  The new rates will commence as on and from 30th June.  The Deputy is quite well aware that there has to be some date.  The date we took was the date at which it became evident that changes were envisaged of a beneficial nature to the prospective builders of houses or improvers of houses for their own use.  That is as far as I can go.  If you go back another bit, you might as well say: &ldquo;Why not go back to last Christmas?&rdquo;</P>

It is that the Government go back to where they were a few years ago before they succeeded, by way of supplementary grants, in shoving on to the shoulders of local authorities a burden previously borne by the State. That would be to increase the Government supplementary grant and not bother the local authorities at all.  The particular section of the community on whom this burden is being placed at present is the section least able to bear it, the agricultural community.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy O'Donnell and later Deputy Lynch in regard to fixing the date, the procedure in the past has been that the operative date was usually the date of the passing of the particular Act.  In this case we have gone back a little further in an effort to obviate any possibility of injustice.  Rather than take the 14th or 15th July, or whatever might be the date of the passing of the Act, we went back to the 30th June. It is a difficulty that faces everybody in such circumstances&mdash;to decide on the proper date.  I feel, had I followed the procedure in the past, this would be dated not the 30th June but some date in July.  To suggest we should go back raises the question that when you have gone back there may be a better case for going further back.  I appreciate the point but I cannot see my way to agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the speeding-up mentioned <Col N="592" /> by Deputy Lynch I can say that some steps have been and are being taken with a view to speeding-up by streamlining, to some extent, the method of inspection and other procedures that we have had to go through in the past.  We hope that, while not using the method he has suggested, we will achieve the same effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Minister is following precedent in fixing the date as in or about the time the Bill becomes an Act.  But we can learn from experience.  Most people who proposed laying on water or sanitary services or building or reconstructing houses knew the Act expired on the 1st April and endeavoured to complete the jobs before that in order to be eligible for the supplementary grant. But there are also people in between who knew a new Bill was about to be introduced and who had taken certain preliminary steps.  These people were hanging on waiting for a new Bill and if we could do something to assist them by making the Bill retrospective to the 1st April I think it would be appreciated.  However, the Minister is quite right in following precedent but if he could see his way, even now, to look into the matter it would be appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Those people who rushed to get the job completed before the expiry of the previous Act commenced the work this time last year or perhaps last winter so that they would be finished by the 1st April, but they will benefit whether they were finished on the 1st April or not.  If we take the other people who had not got round to making a start before the expiry date and who, as the Deputy suggests, were aware that new legislation would be forthcoming and have taken certain preliminary steps since the 1st April, no matter what preliminary steps they have taken, provided they have not commenced the actual building operations they will come within the terms of the new grants and other provisions.  They will not suffer in any way.  When we talk about creating a hardship or say that people suffer because of precedents as regards commencement dates, I think <Col N="593" /> it wrong to regard it in that light when the benefits are being increased.</P>
      <P>If this Bill were reducing the benefit, I could see the point being made that people would suffer some hardship as a result of the date being fixed at a certain time after which any grants paid would be of lesser amount than those paid before that date.  I could understand people caught in those circumstances being described as suffering but I cannot follow the line of argument that in this case any suffering or hardship is being imposed if they have already taken steps which they felt they were in a position to take.  These additional grants are designed to encourage to a greater extent those who in the past were not sufficiently encouraged or did not have sufficient financial backing in their own right to go on, even with the encouragements that were there.  But if we can bring within the ambit of reconstruction or new building or any other services mentioned in the Bill, people who could not last year see their way to do a job but are sufficiently encouraged, because of the increases in the grants, to commence this year I do not think any injustice can be said to have been done to those who did a job last year, any more than we could agree that it is an injustice to those who did a job 20 years ago, when grants were either non-existent or very small.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can gather, the grants mentioned in Section 16 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, refer to owner-occupiers, that is, a grant in the case of a new house for the person who is erecting it and is going to occupy it, or for some public utility society member.  The Second Schedule of the Act specifies that the grants, which are now being increased, may be paid by the Minister to an agricultural labourer &ldquo;or any other person who derives his livelihood solely or mainly from the pursuit of agriculture and is in occupation of land and buildings whose rateable value or the aggregate of whose rateable value does not <Col N="594" /> exceed £35, reconstructing house in own occupation&rdquo;.  I think that was increased to £50 valuation.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make is that it is possible, and in fact quite usual, for a farmer to have on his land a derelict or semi-derelict house which he wishes to reconstruct for one of his workmen. As far as I understand, at present he cannot qualify for a grant when he does not intend to occupy the house. It would be a very good step to enable a farmer to qualify for a grant for a house or houses on his land so that his workmen could occupy them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason this amendment is put down was indicated by Deputy O'Donnell and myself on the Second Reading.  I believe&mdash;while I am quite conscious of the fact that sub-section (3) of Section 12 of the 1954 Act refers to the grant which can be given by the local authority rather than the grant <Col N="595" /> given by the Department&mdash;that the inclusion of sub-section (3) in Section 11 has the effect of negativing to a very great extent the broadening of Section 12 of the 1954 Act which the Minister has set out to achieve by this section.</P>
    <P>As the Minister indicated in reply to Deputy O'Malley a minute ago, the position is that, under Section 12 of the 1954 Act, the grants payable by the Department, on the one hand, and the local authority, on the other, were&mdash; I am talking broadly&mdash;roughly speaking, payable provided the house being extended or repaired was suitable for occupation by members of the working classes as defined in the Acts.  Under Section 11 the Minister wants to expand that definition by providing that, so far as the Department is concerned, in any event, the grant will be payable in respect of houses of the type or within the definition set out by sub-section (2) of Section 11, which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The following paragraph is hereby substituted for paragraph (I) of sub-section (2) of Section 12 of the Act of 1954:</P>
    <P>(I) (a)  the house to be repaired or improved is certified by the housing authority (or, in the case of an appeal, by the Minister) to be suitable for repair or improvement, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the Minister is satisfied that the proposed works are essential for the purpose of providing suitable housing accommodation, and&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the Minister rested there, it would be an amendment simply of Section 12 of the 1954 Act.  Section 12 then goes on to authorise the local authority to make similar grants.  The point is that if sub-section (3) of this section is deleted entirely, it will not detract from or add one whit to the authority of the local authority under Section 12 of the 1954 Act.</P>
    <P>If my reading is correct, sub-section (3) of the 1954 Act is already a discretionary section.  The local authority may give grants of an amount not exceeding the amount granted by the Department.  There is no compulsion <Col N="596" /> on the local authority to make that grant.  They may or may not do it. If sub-section (3) of the section never appeared at all, the position would be that the amount of the grant would be increased.  The definition of the type of house to which it applies would be expanded and broadened.  The local authority would then be left in exactly the same position, that they may or may not, at their own discretion, give an equivalent grant or a grant not exceeding the amount given by the Department.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I feel that the inclusion of sub-section (3) in Section 11 is unnecessary.  It is unnecessary unless it will be regarded as a directive from this House to the local authority that the local authority, so far as their grants are concerned, should have regard to the old provision which existed in Section 12 of the 1954 Act. I do not believe that the Minister or the House intend giving that directive to the local authorities.  I think the spirit in which this Bill was received by the House and as elucidated in the explanatory memorandum was that the Legislature is anxious that Section 12 of the 1954 Act should be broadened out in the manner provided here and that we do not want to encourage local authorities to apply any more narrow or restrictive definition so far as the operation of their grants is concerned.</P>
    <P>If we allow this section to stand we are inviting, if not directing, local authorities not to broaden the section, as I think this House wants it broadened.  For that reason, we urge the Minister to delete sub-section (3), conscious of the fact that, in doing that, having regard to sub-section (3) of Section 12 of the 1954 Act, he is still leaving it to the discretion of the local authority and is not detracting from their authority in the matter one whit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to suggest that the Minister might retain this sub-section. I think Deputy M.J. O'Higgins overlooked one vital and important matter.  If the Minister takes away some discretion in that matter from the local authority, he then leaves the local authority in the position that they may adopt the provisions in the section and then, in <Col N="597" /> every case, once they have adopted them in principle, they must make the grant.  My fear is that the amount of money then required to pay these grants could conceivably create a situation under which a local authority, where there is likely to be very heavy expenditure under this heading, might say: &ldquo;No, because, once we accept this sub-section in principle, we must apply it generally without any discretion whatever.  We have not got the money.&rdquo;  There is a possible danger there.</P>
      <P>I am interested in this matter because I think everybody here is most anxious to see that repair and improvement work is carried out to the greatest degree possible.  I think our immediate desire is to ensure, as far as possible, that those unable to meet the expense themselves will get assistance both from public funds and from the funds of the local authority.</P>
      <P>I feel there would be this danger.  I feel that local authority representatives might be placed in the position in which, because of the inability to get, through their local council, a decision to meet the whole problem, we might find that, say, we cannot restrict&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that under sub-section (2) of Section 11 the scope of grants is being widened so much this sub-section (3) is put in in order to put beyond all doubt the discretion of the local authorities to limit the grants to persons or classes.  Mind you, there has been a doubt in the past as to their discretionary power in regard to the making of these grants. That doubt has arisen in some cases and, as Deputy Larkin has very wisely said, take away this discretion and you may then discourage the local authority from operating this section altogether. That would be even much more of a disadvantage than the possible disadvantage that Deputy O'Higgins has mentioned, of not going the whole hog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the overriding factor that the local authorities can be discouraged by leaving is so wide.  In addition <Col N="598" /> to that I think it would be wrong to take from the local authority until they prove that it should be taken from them&mdash;and I do not know that they have so proved that, by their operation, in all cases, of the various Acts put at their disposal&mdash;the discretion and vest it in the Minister for Local Government.  So far as this section is concerned the amendment proposed to it would I think have the effect of bringing to the door of the Minister for Local Government every questionable case as to whether or not any person or class of persons would or would not be entitled to a grant.  There could be a separate argument on each of these appeals, and I do not think that would be a good thing to start with.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I should like to point out that the elected members of the local authorities, for whom I have the greatest respect, can operate by way of Section 4 of the Act; they can requisition their manager whose function this would be, to bring in or exclude some or other of these classes of people. That, I think, is as it should be, rather than that the Minister should be the deciding authority with regard to each case.  Naturally he would be responsible by and large, for the admission or exclusion of the particular classes in each of the local authorities proposing to operate the terms of this Bill.  The scope, as I said, has been widened considerably by sub-section (2) of Section 11 and it is, in fact, to make absolutely clear the discretion of the housing authority to limit the grants to persons or classes of a particular category that sub-section (3) is now before the House.  I am commending it to the House in order that that discretion may be left with the local authority.</P>

      <P>As far as I know, and I am speaking for the Limerick County Council, the position is that that county council has not adopted any scheme to pay supplementary grants, good, bad or indifferent.  As the Minister has made provision here, half a loaf is better than no loaf at all.  The local authority can say: &ldquo;We shall give the supplementary grants in certain instances to certain specific classes&rdquo;, and I think that is reasonable. After all, the Minister said at the close of his speech on the Second Reading at column 466, Volume 170, for Thursday, July 10th last:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I wish to reiterate that we are not holding up unnecessarily or unduly for the want of money any worth-while scheme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Certainly it ill becomes Deputy O'Donnell to make any criticism of the Minister or of the Government, in view of the fact that not only did Deputy O'Donnell, when Minister for Local Government, not have the money, but he misled every local authority in the State, and every builder in the State, into the belief that that money was there and would be forthcoming.

He mentioned that heretofore the Limerick County Council have not provided this assistance sought by way of grant, for those desiring improvement grants from the local authority. He seemed to me, in any event, to forecast that, because the Minister is opening the door here, there would be a question of half a loaf being better than none and people seeking this grant from the housing authority in Limerick would expect it to be provided.</P>

      <P>Section 11 seeks to extend the type of houses that will be covered, as compared with those covered under Section 12 of the 1954 Act.  Deputy O'Malley says that, so far as those seeking assistance from the Limerick County Council were concerned, as things stand at the moment, the council were not giving the grants.  I may have misinterpreted that.  I took him to mean that, because of the new Bill, the Limerick County Council would be in a position now to give these grants.  In fact, what is happening in the Bill is that in so far as what I will call the &ldquo;Department grants&rdquo; are concerned, there is a widening out of the definition of houses that will be eligible.  So far as the county council is concerned, there is a similar widening out of the definition, with this proviso, that if the county council think fit, they may go back to the existing position, the old position, so that, from the point of view of those seeking grants from the Limerick County Council, they will not be in any different position, if the council decide they will not implement this section.  What the Minister is doing by sub-section (3) is telling them: &ldquo;If you want to go by the old definition, which is there under Section 12 of the 1954 Act, you may.&rdquo;  I really do not follow Deputy O'Malley's reasoning.</P>

      <P>Deputy Larkin's contribution was precisely what I feared would happen, if this direction were allowed to continue in this Bill.  I believe that the section is a good section, if sub-section (3) is left out.  I believe it is a worth-while effort <Col N="603" /> to broaden the scope of the grants, which will be available to those repairing their houses, from the Department, on the one hand, and local authorities, on the other.  The fear which I expressed on the Second Reading, and when I was arguing this amendment, was that if sub-section (3) were allowed to remain, local authorities would adopt the attitude: &ldquo;Here is an opportunity for us, here is a direction to us, from the Legislature, that we may disregard the progress which it is sought to achieve by Section 11 and we may go back and rely on Section 12 of the 1954 Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister said that there was some doubt as to whether or not the local authorities had discretion in this matter.  I will accept his word that there was doubt, if he says so, but for the life of me, I cannot see how sub-section (3) of Section 12 of the 1954 Act could be regarded as anything but discretionary.  It may be well to refer to the exact wording of it.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a grant is made to a person under sub-section (1) of this section, the housing authority may make to that person a grant of an amount not exceeding the grant made under that sub-section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is clear there, to my mind that the power given to the local authority is discretionary.  It does not say that the local authority &ldquo;shall&rdquo; make the grant: it says the local authority &ldquo;may&rdquo; make a grant.  That is the discretionary word, as far as legislation goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discretion is even greater than that, because it does not tie them to make a grant of an amount equivalent to that of the Department.  What it says is that the local authority may make a grant &ldquo;not exceeding&rdquo; the amount given by the Department.  If the Department grant was £80, the local authority could make a grant of any sum not exceeding £80.  They could grant £5 or £10, or anything up to the amount given by the Department.  I think that should answer the difficulty envisaged by Deputy Larkin.  There is the discretion as to whether a grant will be given at all; that discretion remains whether or not sub-section (3) <Col N="604" /> remains.  There is also discretion as to the amount of the grant which will be given; that discretion also remains whether or not sub-section (3) remains.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that the discretion has been there for a long time.  As an example of that discretion, County Limerick is not paying any grant but County Cork is.  That is the difference.  What I want to get down to here is this: where does anyone think the money is to come from? The ratepayers, as far as these grant jobs are concerned, are being cut down in their income and cut down very considerably.  As chairman of one board of health, I will have to think very seriously about reconsidering our attitude as regards giving grants at all.</P>
      <P>This game of supplementary grants originated here during the first régime of the inter-Party Government.  It was originated by a team who had an extreme anxiety to be generous to someone else, generous to everyone, out of another persons's pocket.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am alluding to the discretionary power given in sub-section (3), whereby a local authority may or may not give a grant.  I say it is time that anomalies like this were ended. It is wrong that one local authority <Col N="606" /> should give a grant and another should not.  I have seen the unfortunate system in regard to those supplementary grants which has crept in through the idiotic action of the Department of Local Government.  Take the case of the unfortunate man wishing to construct a house in Cobh.  If he looks for a grant, the grant will probably be £100 and it will be paid by the ratepayers. We should withdraw the provision whereby supplementary grants are given by local authorities and let the State shoulder its obligations as it did until this situation arose.  That is what is wrong with the whole issue.</P>
      <P>We are legislating here to rob the local authorities and this Bill is giving licence to do that.  The whole system is wrong as it creates differences between one town and another, between one county and another and between one health area and another.  I believe the legislation will have to be rectified by somebody.  Otherwise, we will have a man in Cork saying: &ldquo;I saw in the paper yesterday that the County Limerick fellows are not paying this grant at all.  You are representing me as a ratepayer and paying it out of my rates.&rdquo;  That is what the reaction will be.  The difference between the words, &ldquo;The Minister may&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Minister shall&rdquo; in Acts of Parliament has caused more trouble in this country than anything else.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, I should like to point out that Deputy Corry has a golden opportunity now of backing his views by his vote, if he wants to do it.  He can oppose this section.  He can oppose the entire Bill, if his view is that this type of legislation is not good and that a stop should be put to it.  Deputy Corry seemed to be critical of the inter-Party Government for its legislation, as far as housing grants were concerned.  Does Deputy Corry realise that this section&mdash;and I support it because of what it is trying to do&mdash;is a section designed to expand the application of these repairs and improvement grants, and also to increase the amounts to be paid?  I think Deputy Corry should tell the House whether he is for that or against it.  If he is <Col N="607" /> against it, he will have an opportunity of voting on it.</P>
      <P>I want to say to the Minister that as far as Deputy O'Donnell and myself are concerned, we do not propose to press this amendment unduly.  We would urge that the Minister should accept it, but if he feels, supported by the views expressed by Deputy Larkin, that it should not be accepted, well and good.  We will accept that position, but let us be clear on what we are doing.</P>

      <P>The explanatory memorandum states in regard to what is proposed in Section 11: &ldquo;The effect of these proposals would be that eligibility for repair and improvement grants would be tested by the type of works to be carried out and not by the suitability of the house for a limited class of occupants.&rdquo;  I cannot find in it in reference to the proposals in Section 11, any suggestion that it is intended that this House should, at the same time, give a directive to local authorities to adhere to the old definition under the 1954 Act, and the Minister himself, concluding on the Second Reading, seemed to attach particular importance to the fact that we were going to test the eligibility of houses from the point of view of the suitability of the house rather than the class of occupants.  At column 456 of the Official Report of the debate on 10th July, he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Another change that has taken place in regard to repair and improvement grants is that in future the suitability of the dwelling for reconstruction and repair will be the deciding factor as to whether, in a particular case, a reconstruction or repair grant will be paid.  In the past these houses had to meet certain requirements as to their being suitable for a particular class of person and also that they were of a certain type.  The main point is that in future if a house requires repairs to provide suitable living accommodation, <Col N="608" /> then that will be the test as to whether or not a repair or improvement grant will be paid.  That then may have the effect of bringing into the scope of housing grant aids persons who in the past were left out, such as farmers whose valuations exceeded £50.  Such people whose houses conform to the general conditions that I have already mentioned may in future get these grants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that is the Minister's intention.  I want to express the hope that in relation to this section, if passed unamended, that intention, as expressed by the Minister, will also be operated by the housing authorities throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly it was not the Deputy's fault; it may have been mine. I was trying to remove any doubt that there is discretion available to the local authority in regard to this matter.  I want to make it quite clear that the local authority has discretion.  When I said doubts existed as regards legislation in the past in regard to the application of Section 12, I meant there were doubts in the mind of some local authorities which were backed up in one instance I know of by legal advice that, if they operated the section at all, they had to pay indiscriminately the full grant to everybody who had succeeded in getting a grant under that section from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in order to remove the doubts that existed by reason of the wording of past legislation, and the legal advice tendered on at least one occasion I know of, that sub-section (3) was inserted to make it quite clear to the local authorities that they will have the discretion in future.  The reason we want to make that clear is that we feel that if there was any doubt about the issue, that if they felt that once having started to operate this provision, they would have to pay indiscriminately to all comers to qualify for a similar <Col N="609" /> grant, it would frighten them off to such an extent that they might not operate any part of the section or might not operate it in any way.</P>
    <P>There may be local circumstances which vary from county to county which may make it incumbent on the local authority from year to year to be more conservative than they might have been the year before.  It is to allow for such fluctuations of fortunes, so to speak, from local authority to local authority that we want to make sure they have the discretion, so that they may not be discouraged from operating the section, in some part at any rate, from going as far as they can in their circumstances, rather than frighten them off from not operating it at all.</P>
    <P>The point was made in regard to different local authorities having different schemes of grants&mdash;some with the entire 100 per cent. grants being paid under the various Housing Acts provisions and others having none or only part.  It was pointed out that the discrepancy from county to county should be done away with.  I should be very glad if it could be done without, and if any Deputy has a method whereby we can do away with it and replace it by a better system, I shall be quite happy to do so.</P>
    <P>It is not right to say that because one county does not give the grants, other counties should be prevented from giving grants.  Neither do I believe because one county gives the grants, the neighbouring county should be compelled to give them.  That is one of the things we are endeavouring to safeguard&mdash;the discretion of the local authorities who represent in the main, the ratepayers of their respective areas who have returned them to do a job and watch the ratepayers' money.</P>
    <P>We want them to co-operate with us. We are encouraging them to come along with us.  We believe that the overall argument favours their participation in operating the supplementary grant schemes; that, in the long run, every house that is either reconstructed or built is an additional dwelling in the area of that local authority and thereby lessens the demand on the <Col N="610" /> local authority for further housing.  I think that is the economics upon which the local authorities have been approached in this matter in the past and I trust that is the economics upon which they will be approached in the future.</P>
    <P>The reaction on the ratepayers was mentioned by Deputy Corry.  The ratepayers may feel that Deputy Corry and his colleagues are imposing a burden on them in Cork as opposed to the ratepayers in Limerick.  That is one side of the story but might we not look at it in another way?  The people in County Limerick who could possibly do very well with the additional supplementary grants that could be made available to them by their local authority may point to Cork and say to their local representatives that Cork residents can get double grants and why should they not get them?  That is just as likely to happen as the case outlined by Deputy Corry.  By and large, public opinion will make itself felt through the local representatives to give to the people of a particular local authority area the conditions permitted by law which the vast majority of the public require in that local authority or county.</P>
    <P>I think that is how democracy works. If there is sufficient demand for the grants to be continued or discontinued, that in time will find expression through the representatives on the local authorities concerned.  They will either adopt the supplementary grant provisions or throw them out.</P>
    <P>By way of intervention, Deputy O'Donnell referred to the promises made in 1956 and said all these promises were kept.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that there was not a promise made by the Coalition Government in 1956 that was not kept, but it was kept, not by the Coalition but by Fianna Fáil when they came into office in 1957.</P>

      <P>I am not pressing the amendment, but before asking leave to withdraw it, I want to ask the Minister if there is any way of ensuring that, whatever the local authority <Col N="611" /> do, it will be uniform over a period.  It seems to me that sub-section (3) would enable a local authority to decide in respect of one applicant that his house should have to conform to the old Section 12.  That position might be altered in a month's time.  In other words, no one would know where he stood.</P>

      <P>I do not think that would at all be the position.  The usual practice&mdash;and I do not think it will be departed from&mdash;has been the adoption of a particular scheme for a period.  The least period I have known of is 12 months.  Very often in the past, many local authorities adopted a scheme for the term of life of the particular Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks <Col N="613" /> to delete sub-section (3) of Section 11, to deprive the local authorities of a new benefit.  Deputy O'Higgins referred to Section 12 of the previous Act in great detail and did not seem to appreciate in reading it that under that sub-section of that Act, a local authority was limited to people rather than to the house to which this Bill and this sub-section refers.  We are now able to extend our activities in the reconstruction and repair of houses.  We are no longer confined to the qualification of the person who is to occupy the house.  We are now concerned with the house itself and its becoming suitable for human habitation.  That is the difference between this section and the section of the previous Act.</P>
      <P>We are not objecting to this sub-section in our local authority; in fact, we want it.  We believe a great deal of improvements can be made in the property of the city.  We believe we can bring a great deal of comfort to a great number of people for whom housing to-day is difficult and so forth. Yet, the Deputy wants something taken out because he is afraid that, in the exercise of discretionary power, the local authority will operate against the interest of the people whom they represent. Surely to goodness, that is not to be taken as a satisfactory objection to the sub-section.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding the amendment effected by sub-section (2) of this section, grants by a housing authority under sub-section (3) of Section 12 of the Act of 1954 may, if the authority think fit, be confined to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>(b)  persons executing works on houses of such type or types, as may be determined by the authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if he will <Col N="614" /> consider putting in &ldquo;and/or&rdquo; before sub-paragraph (b) because, in my opinion, it clearly means that, if the authority think fit, they confine these grants to persons of a certain class or persons executing works but, if you execute a certain type of work, you cannot possibly be a member of a certain class.  It could lead to difficulty. I would suggest the substitution of the words &ldquo;and/or&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we are increasing the amounts a local authority can give from £80 to £100 and from £100 to £120 and £140, would the Minister tell me how under this Bill any urban authority can manage to pay a reconstruction grant?  I am taking the largest urban authority that I know in my constituency, Cobh.  A penny in the £ in Cobh brings in £80.  Therefore, it would have to be 1½d. if you were to <Col N="615" /> give a supplementary grant for the reconstruction of a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what brought this unfortunate section in at all.  I will be dealing with the loan charge again.  It is impossible, in my opinion, to make this Bill apply to an urban area where there is any large amount of reconstruction required, which would be the case in any old town, because if you give a reconstruction grant to one person, it represents 1½d. in the £ straightway on the ratepayers.  That is one of the reasons, I take it, why this sub-section reads: &ldquo;The local authority may&rdquo; instead of the usual thing from the Department of Local Government: &ldquo;The local authority shall&rdquo;.  They recognise that it is impossible to work it in the ordinary urban area.</P>
      <P>Take a dozen houses requiring reconstruction in the town of Cobh.  I have seen the local authority in Cobh having to refuse a supplementary grant for reconstruction, for the sole reason that they had no way of meeting it. If you want to provide for the reconstruction of 12 houses in the town of Cobh, you have to levy 1/6 on the ratepayers of the town.  As regards the loans charges of which Deputy Briscoe spoke, you can do that for one year but no longer.  When the 12 houses have been completed, you have to stop. In the town of Cobh, there are at least 500 houses requiring reconstruction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Divide that by 12 and you will get what I am coming at.  I defy the Minister to produce one case of an urban area where supplementary grants have been given.  It is unworkable, as far as urban areas are concerned.  Therefore, this Bill discriminates against the ordinary urban dweller who cannot get what his rural comrades are able to get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reply to the <Col N="616" /> suggestion made by Deputy Corry that the Urban Council of Cobh, in particular, would be unable to operate, for financial reasons, the payment of the supplementary grants as envisaged under this section, and the suggestion that in the past they were not able to do it and, therefore, will not be able to do it in the future.  In the past, the local authorities did have the power of borrowing, but they did not have recourse, nor were they permitted to have recourse, to the Local Loans Fund.  It is quite possible that the urban authority of Cobh, or any other urban authority for that matter, that failed to raise loans for this purpose in the past failed because they did not have available to them the source of loans that could do the job for them. Furthermore, while I appreciate Deputy Corry's plight in Cobh&mdash;which I have been in only a very few times unfortunately&mdash;I would say that Cobh is probably in a position where if they do not avail of these repair grants in order to encourage the repair of their 500 houses about which Deputy Corry speaks, they may be placed in the position that they will need 500 new houses.  That possibly may be another day's work, but it is a day's work that is coming and it will probably be a much more costly day's work for the urban authority than if they made some effort to avail of the Local Loans Fund, now that it has been made available to them for the first time in this matter, and to encourage the repair and improvement of the undoubtedly large number of houses requiring such repair in Cobh.  That would apply equally to many other urban authorities throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The general purpose of the section is to ensure that there will be a widening of the scope of these grants.  The Minister indicated that he was anxious that where the grants were payable, the machinery to deal with them should be speeded up and made more efficient.  I do not see in the section where exactly he can provide for that, because in sub-section (2 (I) (a) it says: &ldquo;the house to be repaired or improved is certified by the housing authority...&rdquo;.  The experience under the previous Act was that <Col N="617" /> an applicant for a housing grant made his application to the local authority for the purpose of getting certification. As far as certain local authorities, principally the local authority of which I am a member, are concerned, this involves inspection by at least three and possibly four different officials. You have an official from the sanitary service to ensure that certain work complied with the sanitary bye-laws; you have an inspector from the public health section; you have an inspector from the architect's department; and possibly an inspector from the engineer's department.  All these inspections are carried out to ensure that the local authority can certify that the work was done properly.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in this section to show how that can be overcome, but I mention it so that the Minister can see whether anything can be done.  We accept, on all sides of the House, that the Minister is anxious to see the provisions of the Bill implemented, that there will be no real delay and that those who are desirous of benefiting from the various provisions of the Bill will have their applications dealt with speedily.  Those of us who had occasion to raise these matters on behalf of constituents came across cases where months elapsed between the completion of the actual work and the payment of the grants.</P>
      <P>One other matter to which I should like to refer is in relation to sub-section (2) (b), which states: &ldquo;the Minister is satisfied that the proposed works are essential for the purpose of providing suitable housing accommodation...&rdquo; I suggest that the word &ldquo;essential&rdquo; is a dangerous word in that section because it can be read&mdash;I do not say the Minister will read it in this way&mdash;as meaning that work that would be of particular value, the repair of a dwelling, might nevertheless not come into the category of essential work.  Consequently, even though the local authority has given a certificate that the premises are suitable for improvement, basically, the matter still comes down to whether the Minister considers the particular work essential for providing housing accommodation.</P>

I also had other much greater fears that, if we took out the form of words being criticised here, we might find somebody coming along&mdash;as they would be well entitled to do&mdash;with a fine house and wanting to build a ballroom, billiard room or some such addition. Without these words, I am assured we would be compelled to give a reconstruction or repair grant in order to provide a ballroom or billiard room to existing houses, and that it would not be necessary for the house to qualify as suitable housing accommodation.</P>

    <P>On Second Reading, I indicated to the Minister and the House that I had handed in an amendment for a new <Col N="620" /> section.  It is obvious that, when the Minister was replying on Second Reading, he did not quite grasp what I had in mind.  I now formally move this amendment for the purpose of getting complete elucidation and understanding from the Minister.  I notice that Deputy O'Donnell put in a few &ldquo;hear, hears&rdquo; to what had been said by the Minister, because he obviously did not know what I had been talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Deputy certainly did not know that night, and probably he will not know to-night, either.  I was making no complaint about the legislation which deals with compulsory acquisition in the City of Dublin or elsewhere, but I was trying to bring the Minister's attention to a very serious difficulty which I thought this amendment would cure.  Having succeeded in compulsory acquisition, having it confirmed by the Minister and having taken every advantage of the Act, in order to get what is called physical possession of the acquired property within a reasonable number of weeks, we find ourselves in the difficulty that we have not got what is called title.  Therefore, we cannot give, or vest in the Church authorities, property which we wish them to have for the purpose of building schools.  We have had long experience of long hold-ups where we had in fact completed our schemes in the City of Dublin and yet were unable to give title, fee-simple, to the Church authorities to enable them to secure the necessary financial assistance from the Department of Education to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is drafted in order to cover the difficulty of securing the conveyance to the corporation of property authorised to be compulsorily acquired.  I do not know what answer the Minister has or how he will be able to suggest we get over this difficulty. It is there.  It is possible that, where we do not have to vest, if you like, a piece of compulsorily acquired property in another body, we can anticipate in due course to overcome the waiting period of having the title transferred to us in the legal way.  I should like the <Col N="621" /> Minister to give me some explanation as to how this business is to be met, so that we can be satisfied that, even if this amendment is not pressed, at least this difficulty will be overcome.</P>
    <P>I certainly want to take the opportunity at this stage of saying that I do not think it is fair to suggest that there is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...some legal gentleman or genius who has instilled into the minds of the lay members of Dublin Corporation and members of this House interested in the welfare of central Dublin the idea that no matter what law there is it is not sufficient to enable the legal department to go on.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister.  We all know we are looking for a method of vesting property authorised to be acquired by the local authority, without the possible delay that may arise in the investigation of title.  It is something of this nature we want, or some other suggestion or direction as to how we are to overcome this problem. I formally move the amendment for the purpose of hearing what way out there is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I might start where Deputy Briscoe left off.  My remarks the other afternoon had to do with what has been presented to me as a sort of helpless attitude in regard to getting title to property in the centre of not only of the City of Dublin but of the cities of Limerick, Cork and elsewhere.  There has been such an attitude and such an approach.  I know it is not the members of the corporations who are building up that attitude. Many laymen like myself, of necessity, must have regard to the legal advice they undoubtedly get.  It was from that point of view that I think four members of this House who are also members of the corporation spoke &mdash;whether on the Second Reading of <Col N="622" /> the Housing Bill or on the Estimate&mdash;in terms similar to those used to convey to me what has been conveyed to me before this debate and before the Estimates debate&mdash;that there was some immovable obstacle in the way of acquiring building sites in the centre of Dublin particularly and other cities in general.</P>
      <P>It was on that basis that I made the remarks I did make on the Estimate to the Members of the House who were also members of the corporations.  I said I was satisfied from what I could gather from the legal experts who have examined this matter in every light that there is sufficient legal power vested in the local authorities to get on with the job of acquiring central city sites for building houses.  Far from there being a question of five or seven years' delay, a figure of five to seven months, I am advised, would be a far more appropriate time.  I repeat that, not as a criticism but as a guidance to members of the corporation who are interested in this to the extent of speaking on these matters in the House.</P>
      <P>I also repeat the offer I already made that if they find, and if they can show me in the immediate, or even the distant future, that the laws are not sufficient and that there are immovable obstacles in their way then I shall be willing to go all the way with them to provide new laws to remove these obstacles.  But I am convinced these obstacles do not now exist.  If they can prove they do exist, that is another day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the amendments moved by Deputy Briscoe, he mentioned that I did not seem to grasp&mdash;indeed other Deputies did not seem to grasp, either &mdash;the intent of the terms of the amendment suggested, and that, in fact, the difficulties that the amendment was about to meet all had to do with schools or school sites and the handing-over of proper title to the various church authorities who proposed to build.  I do not feel that I was shortsighted or lacked vision in any way in that I did not see or could not read from these proposed amendments exactly what it now transpires is the real purport of the amendment, that is, <Col N="623" /> that the Department of Education, in view of its own rules and regulations, has not sufficient confidence in the Dublin Corporation or any other local authority and will not accept their word that they may enter on to a site and get on with the job of building schools because of the fear that in the future somebody will come along and put both the corporation and the school authority off the site.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of housing legislation, I am advised that the amendment, as here proposed, is not relevant to this type of legislation and that, in fact, it is of much wider impact than merely dealing with housing or, indeed, local government, and that it brings in many matters other than those coming under local government and that if such an amendment were desirable it would be appropriate for inclusion in legislation, not by the Minister for Local Government, but by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Leaving that aside, I feel, on the advice received, that there is no need for this amendment either in this housing legislation or in any other legislation in order to make straight the crooked path that now exists between acquiring the site and handing over part of it to the school authority.  I think the difficulty does not require legislation.  It can be dealt with administratively by the Department of Education which is responsible for framing the regulations that are creating the difficulty and preventing the Department from getting on with the job of building much-needed schools.</P>
    <P>If it is any consolation to Deputy Briscoe and others concerned, I shall certainly take up the matter with the Minister for Education on the ground that it seems strange that the Department of Education cannot accept title, cannot accept the word of the corporation that the title is good enough for their purposes, despite the fact that the corporation itself is going to build on the remainder of the site and the Department of Local Government is going to help them to build.  The law is good enough for both of us but it does not seem to be good enough for the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> Strictly speaking it is not one of our babies&mdash;if you like&mdash;to try by legislation to overcome the difficulties created by regulations made by another Department but I do intend to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister for Education in regard to the unravelling of these regulations and getting matters streamlined by the corporation and other local authorities, the Department and the Church authorities concerned so that the right to enter on the lands in question will be recognised as absolute and there will not be this undue delay in building schools in some of the big building schemes in the City of Dublin where, as Deputy Briscoe said the building scheme is completed long before the school is started and all because, apparently, the Department of Education does not trust any of us in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the Second Reading speeches made by some Deputies in regard to the delay and the difficulty in obtaining sites.  As he rightly says, the question of actually carrying out the process of acquisition is basically a problem which should be, and I hope will be, ironed out between the Custom House and the local authority.</P>
      <P>The general question of delay in building in some city areas does not arise from acquisition difficulties connected with the site alone.  Many delays have arisen from difficulties of planning and getting approval for a particular type of building.  I welcome the Minister's announcement that he will do all he can to accelerate the work and assist as far as he can in acquisition proposals.</P>
      <P>On the Second Reading I referred to a matter which the Minister has not mentioned.  It is a special type of problem which has resulted from the fact that a housing project sometimes becomes involved in proposals for road widening or city improvements.  I ask the Minister to look into that and to see whether there is some way&mdash;by agreement with his Department and the local authority&mdash;of securing that the development and the acquisition might not be two separate acquisition procedures but a joint acquisition procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> A major question for many years is that of property which is acquired by the local authority and subsequently by agreement with the Church authorities and the Minister for Education, transferred for the purpose of building schools.  I am very pleased to hear the Minister for Local Government say here to-night that this problem is one that can be handled by his colleague the Minister for Education. However, it is not very much of a solution to hear a Minister make that statement here to-night after the experience in this city of the past ten, 12 or 15 years.  Year after year, thousands of children had to travel morning, afternoon and evening four or five miles from the outskirts to attend their own schools, some in over-crowed conditions, by reason of the fact that the housing development had outpaced the provision of schools by one, two, three and four years.  This did not occur just in a period when this present Government was in office or when the inter-Party Government was in office: it occurred all the time.</P>
    <P>With the development of building on the perimeter of the city, as soon as or even before the ground is acquired, discussions took place as to the amount of land that might be required for school building&mdash;the local authority indicating its willingness to facilitate the development by the school authorities in every way and setting aside whatever the agreed plot was.  The Minister now says that this problem of the Department taking over the land and going on with the building and provision of schools for Dublin children could very easily have been settled administratively in the Department at any time within the past ten or 12 years.  Frankly, speaking on behalf of Dublin citizens, it is a disgraceful situation that here, year after year, children of parents who could ill-afford it were compelled to travel back and forward to be exposed to additional risks of getting wet, of getting their inadequate clothing soaked wet and then having to go back into school.</P>
    <P>We were told all the time that the difficulties arose because the Department of Education would not or could not take over a site and carry on in <Col N="626" /> conjunction with the school authorities the building of these schools unless clear title was established.  It is disgraceful that Deputies and our citizens should now be told that this matter could have been cured by arrangement between the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Education of this or any previous Government.  If that is correct, certainly none of our Minister for Education in the past ten or 15 years was fit to hold his post because of the unnecessary suffering and hardship which was caused to so many children.</P>
    <P>At the present day, something in the neighbourhood of 1,200 children have to travel back and forward to Ballyfermot. Even to-day in Coolock where the local authority, with the assistance of successive Governments, built an estate with 850 houses, the schools are not completed.  Yet we are told that, in effect&mdash;and I accept the Minister's word and that he is making the statement with full knowledge of the facts&mdash; these schools could have been planned and constructed, could have started almost parallel with the occasion when the house-building started.</P>
    <P>Instead of that, the roads were laid in, the houses were planned and constructed and occupied and still no schools.  The Minister may rest assured that Deputies&mdash;particularly those connected with a local authority&mdash;will be glad to take him at his word and to request his assistance and efforts to speed up the procedure in respect of acquisition for the construction of flats, the procedure of rental and referencing and particularly the procedure of seeing that school sites are transferred and that schools are built on those sites.  We shall be more than glad to take the Minister at his word and to come to him very quickly if there is any delay in the matter.</P>

If that is so, it is a shocking <Col N="627" /> attack on the Minister for Education and his legal advisers.  It is something for which the Minister should come in here and answer.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister for Local Government that there is ample law for the corporation to acquire sites in the centre of this city, if they wish. If the Department of Local Government are satisfied and if the Minister and his legal advisers are satisfied, then it is a shocking state of affairs that, as a result of their sanction, houses are built but schools are not being built in the same locality because the Minister for Education is not satisfied that Dublin Corporation have proper title to acquire such property.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Last week on this Bill, I mentioned that tenants of houses by a remission of rates only benefited to the extent of one-third of a year's full remission of rates.  I was wrong in that statement and, as a matter of fact, the tenants of new houses now will lose one-third of the remission of rates.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I had stated they would benefit to the extent of one-third of a year's remission.  It may sound a little complicated, but if you look at the table at the end of page 14, you will see that, on the first year, the tenant would benefit to the extent of nine-tenths; right down to the ninth year, he would benefit to the extent of one-tenth.  That would total a sum of forty-five tenths of a year which would be four and a half full years of remission of rates.  If he was getting two-thirds remission for seven years, which exists at the moment, he would get four and two-thirds remission, so by the introduction of this section, a tenant of a new house will in fact lose the benefit of one-third.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Belton on this amendment.  There are rather similar amendments down in the name of Deputy O'Donnell and myself.  Like Deputy Belton, I was under the wrong impression by reason of a miscalculation, when speaking on the Second Reading, that this new provision in the Table in Part VII of the Bill, would on the over-all mean an additional benefit of approximately one-third of a year's rates to ratepayers.  In fact, it means no such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Belton pointed out, the position under Section 31 is that instead of the ratepayers getting a benefit, by reason of a remission, they will lose, as a result of the legislation which the Minister proposes, to the extent of one-third of a year's rates.  I <Col N="630" /> still think that the idea of a sliding scale, even over nine or ten years as proposed by the Minister, is a step which ratepayers in new houses will probably welcome, because it means that instead of having a sharp increase at the end of the seventh year, there will be a gradual increase over nine or ten years.  Like Deputy Belton, however, I feel that when it is appreciated that what the Minister is doing will, in fact, deprive the ratepayers in new houses of one-third of a year's rates, the welcome which has been accorded to this departure will be somewhat soured.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister, as Deputy Belton did, that instead of adopting the Table which is included in Section 31, he should adopt the Table proposed by Deputy Belton, which would enable this sliding scale of rates to be operated over 20 years rather than over nine years as proposed by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support both Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Belton.  Speaking on the Second Reading, I was under the misapprehension that a ratepayer would save, or gain, to the extent of one-third year's rates.  Actually, Deputy O'Malley interrupted me to say it would be one and one-third years.  I asked him to check it but he did not come back to tell me if my calculation, or his, was correct.  Actually, we are both incorrect.  There will be a loss of one-third rates and I am sure Deputy Corry will agree with us, as we all agree with the Minister, that the aim is to promote housebuilding and house repairing, but now we are to add an additional one-third rates to the burden the ratepayer has to bear.</P>
      <P>We do not mind which one of the amendments the Minister accepts, whether he accepts the amendment in the name of Deputy Belton, or in the name of Deputy O'Higgins, or my amendment.  I understood that under one of the old Housing Acts in the time of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, there was a sliding scale of 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There was such a <Col N="631" /> scheme, but I know nothing about it, other than that I was told it was in existence in one of the early Housing Acts under the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  Whether it was good or bad, I do not know, but the scale was there.  All I would ask the Minister to do is to consider this matter and, if possible, bestow some benefit on the builder or repairer, instead of inflicting another blister on him; and Deputy Corry has pointed out what a blister the rates are.  In my county, they are approximately £2 5s. in the £.</P>
      <P>One knows that a year's rates on a valuation of £15 or £20 is a fairly heavy sum, although spread over the year; and if the Minister can see his way to accept either of these points of view, I think people would be encouraged to accept the benefits undoubtedly bestowed by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry.</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder what those people are aiming at, at all.  They had great sympathy for the ratepayers a while ago.  I come here as a representative of the local authority and the first argument I am told is to look at the extra rates it will bring in, when you come to argue on the supplementary grant to be given to those people.  Number one, they get a grant from the State; number two, they get a supplementary grant paid for by the ratepayers, who in general will not benefit at all themselves.  Then they are to get these two grants, plus, in my county, a loan of the balance of the money from the county council.  They get all three.</P>
      <P>The argument used up to the present to induce representatives of local authorities to pass this was: &ldquo;Look at the extra rates which will come in under this scheme.&rdquo;  Now, apparently, according to one angel over there, they are to get 20 years before they come up to full rates.  We all know what modern houses are.  Five years after the house is built, the repair bill comes in and comes in from then on. In the case of a modern house, at the end of 20 years, you can scrap it.  That is my experience anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, in addition to getting a grant from the State out of the taxpayers' money, a grant from the local <Col N="632" /> authority from the ratepayers, and a loan guaranteed by the ratepayers, they are to get 20 years before they reach the full rateable burden.  That is ridiculous on the face of it.  It will remove one of the strongest arguments I know of to induce the local authorities to give supplementary grants.  I could understand it, in regard to reconstruction of houses, if a step were taken by some of those Deputies to prevent the valuation officer coming on them for ten years.  I cannot understand, however, a man being put in the position that he gets the full amount of his house, the full profit, two grants and a loan, and in addition is relieved of these rates.  Of course, he has to repay the loan charges, but even so, he gets the two grants.  Some sections of the community want all jam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in this amendment.  The case being made for it is that, under the Minister's proposal, the householder would stand to lose over a period of seven years the equivalent of one-third of a year's rates.  I agree he should not lose that, but I think it is a mistake that the Minister should bring in any burden, no matter how small, on those who have taken on themselves the burden of providing houses in the last ten or 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt?  It is one-sixth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether one-third or one-sixth, I wonder whether the proposers of the amendment would indicate the estimated financial effect and what would be the gain if, instead of the ten years, the rates remission period were extended to 20 years.  I made a very rough calculation on the basis of the rates in the City of Dublin at 37/5 in the £ and, taking a valuation of £20, I think the gain estimated &mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;is between £170 and £200 over that period.  I would be interested to know&mdash;when there is relief from rates, somebody has to pay for it&mdash;from the proposers of the amendment, how they think the easement they suggest could operate as far as the local authority is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present moment, the rates in Dublin are 37/5 in the £ and the ratepayers <Col N="633" /> are crying out that the burden is very heavy.  If, to give the relief to a certain section, there is an additional burden thrown on the remainder of the citizens and ratepayers, I wonder what increase there will be in the rates.  I wonder if the proposers have considered that angle.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I think they have not made the case for the amendment. There is a case one can argue, aside from the financial burden that may be cast on the rate-paying community, and that case is this.  To-day, as opposed to, say, the period before the emergency, the valuation of new houses, houses built with the aid of Small Dwelling Act loans and grants, has increased considerably.  The 37/5 in the £ on a house built since 1948 which is coming under a valuation of perhaps £27, is a completely different thing from 37/5 in Dublin from a house built when the valuation for a larger house, possibly a better built house, with more accommodation, was £15 or £18.</P>
    <P>I will give a simple example of that. In 1939, I think, a four-roomed dwelling constructed by a local authority had a valuation of £8.  In the 1950s, the same dwelling had a valuation of over £14. Therefore, the movers can make the case that, where people have been encouraged to enter into a very substantial commitment to provide themselves with homes, the increased valuation, plus the fairly heavy rates at present, imposes a very severe burden, to such an extent that one wonders whether, in these times, the occupiers, the purchasers or would-be owners of these houses in many cases are doing any other than working for the purpose of repaying loans advanced to them under S. D. A. and by public utility societies.</P>
    <P>Years ago, the statement used to be made, with some truth, that too many people were working for the landlord. Certainly if the situation gets any more difficult than it is in the case of people in the middle income groups, and of many in the lower income groups, who have been forced to provide themselves with decent accommodation at what, in the beginning, appears to be <Col N="634" /> a reasonable cost but, over a short period of years, becomes a very serious financial burden, one wonders whether or not we are substituting the State and the local authority for the landlord. In other words these people whom the local authorities are alleged to be assisting are working for a joint landlord.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposal itself I should like the proposer of the amendment to help us here.  Regard should be had to the manner in which this additional finance might be provided without casting a heavier burden on the very people whom the amendment proposes to assist.  I would suggest to the Minister that even one-sixth should not be persisted in.  Perhaps he might take an off-the-cuff suggestion from me that some additional cost might be gladly borne to ease the lot of those who entered into these commitments years ago, without upsetting the scale one way or another, by writing in, in front of that, his own suggestion that the first year of occupancy should be free of rates in respect of nine-tenths of the valuation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section of the Bill relating to the proposed new scale shows that instead of meeting the case which was made very vigorously, A.C.R.A., the combined residents' association, for the adoption of a new scale which would make things easier for the occupants of new dwelling-houses, it has made the position worse for them.  Taking a flat figure of £30 valuation and comparing it with ten years' rates paid under the existing system and ten years' rates to be paid under the new scale, we see that, in fact, under the new scale an occupant will be at a loss of £5.</P>

This will be a grave cause of disappointment to thousands of persons residing in modern dwelling-houses to which comparatively high valuations apply, especially in areas in proximity to the city.  It will make the position worse for people, who will build that class of house, than it already is for people now residing in that class of house who find it almost impossible to pay full rates in the eighth year.  In this case full rates will be payable in the tenth year, and I feel the Minister should either withdraw this section or agree to the amendment now proposed.  There are very good reasons why he should agree to the amendment whereby the scale could be extended over a period of 20 years instead of the proposed ten years.</P>
      <P>One of the main reasons is that valuations applied these days are related to modern conditions and modern facilities, and ratepayers who might be required to make up the difference are possibly residing in better premises which were valued at a much lower figure when money values were much higher.  Money values were much higher then and these people now have the advantage of paying rates on a much lower valuation level.  Similarly, residents of these houses have other fixed charges applied which are related to the level of valuations.  For instance, the E. S. B. charge is related to the valuation level on certain premises so that the residents of houses, which have the modern valuations applied to them, have additional burdens to meet by reason of the high level of the valuations, though the premises in which they are living are not so good comparatively as older premises built of better materials and built in a better way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry, in the course of his contribution, mentioned that he thinks <Col N="636" /> some of these houses will hardly stand for the 20 years in respect of which this amendment seeks a rates abatement.  I do not agree with him on that.  I consider that in general the houses are of good modern construction, providing modern facilities, and I feel that people who had low valuations applied to their houses, at a time when money had a high value, should not grouse at being required to contribute in a very small way to the difference that will arise on a scale covering a period of 20 years in respect of new houses.  I feel it would be fair and people who examine the position would not object to this arrangement.</P>
    <P>This amending legislation, which is an improvement on the existing housing legislation, will not be a starting signal for a vigorous house building programme.  I do not believe that the post-war housing drive will be equalled for many generations to come.  I do not believe that in the next ten years, or even in the next century, we shall have the vigorous housing programme which we had during the past ten years.</P>

      <P>We are discussing the relief of rates and the relief which would be given by the proposed amendment. Houses built since 1st July last will be the houses affected by the scale in this Bill or affected by the amendment proposed now.  If we consider the impact this levy may have on the existing ratepayers, I believe it will be negligible and that we need not be afraid at this stage to bring in a scale which will cover 20 years instead of ten years which would bring a loss.  It brought so much hardships and burdens that even after seven years the people wanted an extension.  There is nothing in this Bill to give those people any hope.</P>

      <P>I feel that the present arrangement is quite generous.  I was hoping that some provision might be made in the case of a local authority ratepayer who has received a State grant but did not receive a grant from the local authority.  Under the provisions of the Bill, it is optional for the local authority to introduce a supplementary grant.  Perhaps the Minister would do something about the matter I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about valuations.  I would agree with Deputy Larkin's suggestion for a modest amendment in the Minister's Schedule. I think it would be of considerable benefit to the tenants if the Minister would agree to amend his table so that in the first year it would be ten-tenths instead of nine-tenths.  I think the difference, although it is a modest one, would be welcomed very much by the <Col N="638" /> tenants.  That would spread it over ten years instead of nine years.  If the amendment is accepted, it will mean that the tenant will benefit, again on a £20 valuation, to the extent of £127 which, I think, is far more than he has a right to expect.  This is in addition to the reasons put up by Deputy Corry. The local authority has to provide services which the owners of these houses will enjoy over the period of ten years or longer, if the amendment is accepted.</P>
      <P>It is a mistake to make things too easy for prospective house owners to borrow money and build their own houses.  As a matter of fact, in Limerick City, the city manager at times has had to save people from entering into commitments which they were obviously not in a financial position to undertake.  The Minister should accept the suggestion of Deputy Larkin which I support.  I would suggest that he make a small amendment in his Table.  It would be of considerable benefit to the people concerned.  It is a reasonable suggestion.  The whole idea of spreading out the abatements over a ten years' descending scale is an excellent one.  Even if there were no improvement at all in their financial position, the mere fact of spreading out the abatements would be greatly appreciated by the tenants. The idea is a good one and I would ask the Minister to accept it as a modest suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, the proposal to spread the rates relief over a 19 or 20 year period is one which certainly would be popular with those who are able to build next year after we bring in this measure, but we must realise that if we are to encourage the local authorities to adopt supplementary grant schemes, then it is necessary I think, that in the foreseeable future some hope should be held out to those local authorities who, having spent the money on supplementary grants and encouraged the building of more houses, expect to get something additional back by way of return for the moneys spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that the local authorities should co-operate in this matter.  I feel it is necessary not <Col N="639" /> to go too far with rates remission in order to keep encouraging the local authorities to carry this burden of supplementary grants to the point at which they will make it workable and give us the increased building which we so much desire and also give us the increased houses, new and old, which we still need in this country.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, to those calculators who have been operating very assiduously here to-night, I should like to say this.  In the first nine years, on a valuation of £15 and at an assumed rate in the £1 of 40/-, it is quite true that over a period of nine years under the proposal contained in the Bill, we find that the ratepayer will have paid £5 more than his counterpart would have paid under the present rates remission in the same period.  He would have paid £135 in that period.  He will be relieved of £135 under the proposal of the sliding scale, whereas in the present situation and on the two-thirds remission for the first seven years, this person in similar circumstances will have paid £130 and will have been relieved to the extent of £140.  How many have taken the first five years under the new proposal and under the present proposal?  Taking the same valuation and the same rate in the £1 as I have used for the earlier calculation, you will find that the present proposal will favour the person concerned in the new house by £5 more than will the present remission of rates of two-thirds, as we now know it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a minute.  You cannot possibly have it both ways.  The whole argument for, and the reason for this graduated scale, even though all Deputies may not agree with the term or the length of it, or the number of years over which it is spread, is that it does relieve and will relieve those people who build houses and who, after seven years, find the total rate coming on them out of the blue.  That situation is being relieved and will be relieved in future under these proposals. That is what commends itself generally <Col N="640" /> to practically all members of the House.  It is the details of it to which some people take exception.</P>
      <P>On the calculation I have given here &mdash;£15 at 40/- in the £ over nine years&mdash; under the new proposals, the ratepayer concerned in that new house will have paid in those nine years only £5 more than he would have paid in the first nine years were the two-thirds remission, which is the present remission, to obtain during that period, but he would, in fact, pay in the first five years £5 less under the new proposals than he would have had to pay in the first five years under the existing operation.  If you take the first year after the completion of a house which I think is a very important year, the first year after it has been revalued or valued for the first time, at £15 valuation, with rates of £30 due at a rate of 40/-, under this proposition the tenant would pay quite a bit less&mdash;£3 as against £10.  In other words, the advantage in the first year of paying rates would be £7 on that basis, in the next year somewhat less than £7 but still favourable.</P>

      <P>If the Minister wants to get the Bill through before 10.30, we are prepared to facilitate him, but I do want to ask him, before he finishes, to deal with the point made by Deputy Larkin and Deputy Russell.  If he is prepared to deal with that, we are not pressing too strongly here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I am sure that on a later reading of the various calculations which I have given, if it is not evident now, it will become evident that the one-sixth of one year's rates that the two Deputies have been advocating the person should be relieved of, is no real disadvantage and, when read against the big advantage of the big reduction in the early years after occupation of a new house bears no comparison with the arrangement suggested and, if it were a case of a choice between one or the other, there is no doubt the person would opt for the present arrangement rather than for making any change.  I feel that that is so.  As I said at the start, regard must be had to the local authority members who, looking at a 20-year period for a <Col N="641" /> return of the money they may expend on the ratepayers' behalf, would feel, as Deputies might feel, that they might not be in the council by the end of that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in Deputy Rooney trying to put wooden legs on hens or talking about dual purpose hens on the subject of house-building. I think it will be a lot more than a couple of score of houses.  The fact remains that we must strike a balance between the ratepayer's interest and the interests of the people whom the ratepayer will help by way of supplementary grant.  It is on that basis, and that basis alone, that this proposal has come before the House in the terms in which it is rather than we should have remitted rates altogether for all time.  We would all like to do that, but it just is not possible, as Deputies on all sides know, and I do not feel that we are justified in making this slight change that is being requested because we are going quite a way in making rates remission much more acceptable to future builders than it was to those who have had to build in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Thursday, I put to the Minister for Finance a question relating to an appointment he has just made to the Board of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited.  I want to amplify certain statements I made at that time and to expose in greater detail the action of the Minister in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly after I was appointed Minister for Finance, in 1954, the then Chairman of the Agricultural Credit Corporation came to me.  He told me that he wished to retire on 31st July, when his term would be up.  He told me that he had informed my predecessor that he so wished to retire because of personal reasons.  I was well aware that that chairman was a strong adherent, publicly and privately, of Fianna Fáil but I believe so much in the principle of continuity, particularly in the chairmanship of a State sponsored body, unless the chairman has in any way <Col N="643" /> misused the trust imposed on him, that I pressed him, in spite of my knowledge of his political affiliations, to continue. I told him that notwithstanding what I knew in that regard I was prepared and proposed to re-appoint him if he would allow his name to go forward. He told me, however, that he was quite definite on the matter and that he would be glad if I would arrange to choose his successor.</P>
    <P>I decided that, when I was going to choose a successor as chairman of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited, I would endeavour to find a farmer who had a wide knowledge of farming, and that, it would also be desirable to appoint someone who had a knowledge of business.  Furthermore, I was particularly anxious to get some one who had a connection with farming organisations.  Not merely in this respect but in other respects, I felt it desirable as far as possible to tie in the work of farming organisations with State sponsored bodies dealing with agricultural matters.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I found that the most suitable person available to me was Mr. Bland.  I appointed him because in my view he was then a substantial farmer who had a wide experience of modern farming, who was experienced in various types of farming and could be described as a progressive farmer.  I was satisfied at the time that, in addition to his experience as a substantial farmer in Laois, he had other qualifications that were entirely desirable for the position.  He had some business experience and he had the tie-in with farmers' organisations which I was particularly anxous to see, in that he was the first President of Macra na Feirme in 1947 and also the third President of Macra na Feirme from 1949 to 1951.  He also had experience in agricultural matters because he had been a member of Laois County Committee of Agriculture for some eight years; he had been a member of the management committee of a co-operative agricultural society; he was a Council member of the Irish Grassland Association and of a cow testing association.  I knew that he had also been a member both of the Carlow and of the Thurles Boards of the <Col N="644" /> Beet Growers' Association and a member of the Central Council of that Association.  Not merely had he been on these bodies, but he had taken a part voluntarily in public life in other respects.  He had been Chairman of the National Ploughing Championships Committee and during the emergency he had served in the Local Defence Force.  Since he was appointed he acted in a voluntary capacity as a member of the Capital Investment Committee and another similar body, without pay or reward, for the purpose of assisting the country to the best of his ability.</P>
    <P>I make no apology whatever for the fact that I appointed him to be the chairman because I considered it desirable that there should be a farmer at the helm of that organisation and highly desirable that the person who was in control of agricultural credit should be someone who knew and understood the efforts that Macra na Feirme and other similar bodies were making to increase agricultural production. I do not think his services as chairman of the Agricultural Credit Corporation can be challenged in any way, and I am glad to know that the Minister himself, when thanking him for his service, acknowledged that that was the position.</P>
    <P>This time last year Mr. Bland was informed that he was not to be re-appointed on the 31st July when the original term of his office was up.  As I say, it has been my belief that it was desirable at all times to have continuity in the administration of important State undertakings such as is carried out by State boards and State companies.  That principle was thrown overboard by the Minister when this time a year ago he decided not to renew his appointment even though in similar circumstances I was prepared&mdash; and so informed him when he came to me in 1954&mdash;to re-appoint Mr. Barton.</P>
    <P>It would be simple enough to deal with this matter if that were the entire story.  The provisions of some of these State bodies is that where a director has been nominated, apart from being elected by the company at its annual general meeting by the votes of the Minister for Finance, he remains on until <Col N="645" /> his successor is appointed.  Mr. Bland when he was informed that he would not be re-appointed on the 31st July was also told that he would remain on under that power until the appointment of his successor.  This year, about a month ago, the Minister informed him that he was making a new appointment and that his services would terminate on the 1st July this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated the other day that the reason for that delay was that he had not made the appointment until he got the person he considered most suitable.  I want to tell the Minister that it was well known in certain parts of the country long before last month that the Minister was going to appoint the present man, Mr. Considine, and Mr. Considine himself was boasting of that fact.  I said the other day, and I want to repeat it, that I can conceive no reason whatever why Mr. Bland was kept on in that way except for the purpose of keeping the seat warm for the present appointee until he had qualified for the maximum pension to which he was entitled by reason of his service in his former position.</P>
    <P>The person who has been appointed now, as the Minister said in his reply, is a retired bank manager.  I do not consider a retired bank manager, no matter how brilliant he might be personally, as suitable a person to be in control of agricultural credit as a person who is a farmer, who has business experience and who has had good contact with farmers' organisations. Even if that alone were the position, the Minister would have done himself, the Government, the people, and particularly the farmers, a grave disservice by changing from a farmer to a person of that sort.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, however, the matter does not end there.  This is a company in which there is a managing director. Notwithstanding the fact that there is a managing director, the Minister has, for the new appointee, seen fit to make a very big change in the terms of appointment.  Last year, in the Budget, and frequently throughout the course of the year, the Minister pleaded for restraint in respect of income increases.</P>
    <P>The Minister and other Ministers told <Col N="646" /> the country as a whole and at large that it was highly desirable that there should be restraint upon applications for increases in incomes, in view of the country's economic position.  Notwithstanding that fact, and notwithstanding the fact that there is a managing director who does all the ordinary, day to day work in that corporation, the Minister chose to raise the salary for the new appointee from £800 per annum to £1,2000 per annum&mdash;an increase of 50 per cent.  That increase is indefensible and it is particularly indefensible in the circumstances in which the appointment was made.</P>
    <P>I told the Minister on the last occasion that I did not propose to make any comment on the personality of the new appointee and I did not so intend until a barrage of interruptions started from the other side.  I do not propose to make any comments on his personal character or qualifications of any sort to-night.  However, I propose to comment severely on the Minister's conduct in relation to this matter.  It is not Mr. Considine who should be blamed; it is the Minister for Finance, who deliberately went out of his way to break the principle of continuity in relation to State-sponsored bodies, who deliberately went out of his way to take from the chairmanship of that body a person who was not a political appointee, who had merely gone in to take up the position when it had been, so to speak, resigned and left vacant by the previous holder, and who had done in that position a really first-class job.  If people are to feel, when they go in with reasonable experience, do a job to the best of their ability and are not put into that job for any political purpose, that they will not be allowed to continue in that position, then you will not get anything except political &ldquo;stooges&rdquo; and mediocrities to serve on State-sponsored bodies for the future.  I find it impossible to believe that the Minister had any reason in his mind for this appointment, except what I said before and I must say again&mdash;that the reason for this appointment and the reason for the increase in salary is that this is one of the worst pieces of political jobbery this House and the country have seen for a very long time.  I told the Minister <Col N="647" /> in the course of supplementary questions on the last occasion, and I repeat to him to-night, that there can be no reason for this appointment, no reason at all except that.</P>
    <P>Leaving the personalities of both people entirely out of it, to change from a farmer and businessman&mdash;and a person associated with one of the organisations on whom the future of progressive farming depends&mdash;to a person who, no matter how eminent he may be, would not have the necessary practical experience, is a disgraceful procedure.  It appears to me shameful and disgraceful in the circumstances in which it has been perpetrated by the Minister, and in which the Minister has appointed a person, deliberately increased his salary by 50 per cent., appointed someone well known as a supporter of his own Party and a person known also to be a relative of a former colleague of the Minister in this House</P>
    <P>I do not think that type of appointment will mean that we will get for public boards, State companies or for any public work, the type of person who will make a success of those boards.  I do not know whether the Minister himself thought of this first or not.  I am positive of one thing, that is, that behind this appointment by the Minister, there is the hand of the Taoiseach.  Anybody who knows the facts as I know them must know that that is so.  May I finally say this? Wherever public appointments are made on a jobbery basis, as this has been made, they will be exposed by me in this House and no editorials in the <i>Irish Press</i> and no shouting down, as was attempted by the Government Benches last Thursday, will prevent me doing that duty.</P>

    <P>I want to say that I am not satisfied <Col N="648" /> with the Agricultural Credit Corporation. I do not think they have been doing very much in the way of giving agricultural credit when we see that in the last five or six years the average amount sanctioned or given out by the corporation was about £250,000 per year.  That is a very small portion indeed of the amount of credit needed by the farmers.  I am not laying the blame on the board; I do not think it is the fault of the board.  It is more the fault of the procedure that has been followed and is being followed in that institution.</P>
    <P>Because of the dissatisfaction on my part and on the part of other Ministers, the Minister for Agriculture and I have had consultations on what should be done.  At one time, I, as Minister for Finance, did suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that we might wind up the corporation or, failing that, that we should put it in a position in which it could do something substantial in the matter of agricultural credit here. We have decided to follow that course. We have decided that they should try to meet, as far as they can, the needs of farmers requiring credit.  In this reorganisation, if I might refer to it as such, it will be essential to have a man who has had administrative experience in agricultural credit.  The Deputy may have his views that in a job like this a farmer would be better than a man with banking experience.  I must say I do not agree with him in that.  In my view, a man with experience in agricultural credit will be more likely to be able to take charge as chairman&mdash;of course, there is a managing director&mdash; of this reorganisation aiming at giving credit more widely and, I hope, meeting the needs of the farmers.</P>
    <P>In due course, I hope the Minister for Agriculture and I may be able to meet the board.  We have put our ideas down but we have not completed the arrangements necessary to put these ideas into operation.  That will entail discussions with other bodies, but as soon as these discussions are complete we intend to meet the board and to go into this new policy, and into future policy also, with them.  If Deputies will wait and if they can take an objective view of this&mdash;that may, indeed, be difficult to expect&mdash;I think they will <Col N="649" /> agree that it will be necessary to have a man with administrative experience as chairman of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>I think the same considerations might apply to the salary.  The man who will be chairman of this board, when this reorganisation goes through, as I hope it will,&mdash;that depends on the concurrence of other bodies&mdash;will have a job that will be practically full-time.  Certainly he will have to report in every day&mdash;I do not say he will have to work an eight-hour day&mdash;for at least a number of hours, just as a governor of a bank or a man of that kind has to attend in the ordinary bank to deal with applications that may come in.</P>
    <P>The Deputy certainly has more knowledge about this man than I have.  I can truthfully say that.  I knew this man some 35 or 40 years ago.  I was in jail with him when we were fighting for our country.  Naturally, I have a high opinion of him for that reason.  I have had very little contact with him since. I presume he is a supporter of Fianna Fáil because most of the people who fought for the country are&mdash;</P>

I ask Deputies opposite, in spite of their opinions at the moment, in spite of their anxiety to make mountains out of molehills, to keep an open mind until we have an opportunity of promulgating our new policy on agricultural credit and see if agricultural credit will succeed better in the future than in the past.  After all, if it does, if we can serve the farmers better than we did in the past, it will be a very small matter whether we appointed A instead of B as chairman, so long as the new policy is a success.</P>
