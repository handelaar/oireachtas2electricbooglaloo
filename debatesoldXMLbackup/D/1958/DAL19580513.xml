      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state (a) the salary, other emoluments and expenses, etc., paid to the Attorney-General for the year 1957-58 and (b) the number of hours he spent on State work as apart from his private practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (for the Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 1st May of last year, I informed the Deputy that the salary of the Attorney-General is £3,000 a year.  He was paid that salary for the year 1957-58, and he was paid no expenses.  As to the number of hours he spent on State work, the Attorney-General is not paid by the hour, and a record of the number of hours is not kept; what matters is that he should be constantly available for State work whenever required, and he has been so available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether the volume of official business decreased or increased in that Department over the last 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach has he given any consideration to the position where a Cabinet Minister is prevented, and rightly so, from taking part in private business outside his duties as Cabinet Minister and an Attorney-General is allowed the privilege of carrying on a private practice?  Does he consider that right and just?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That surely is a separate matter, not arising at all from the question on the Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not arise in this way&mdash;in view of the fact that a sum of £3,000 has been paid in salary to the Attorney-General, would the <Col N="3" /> Taoiseach not consider that such a sum should be sufficient rather than to have the gentleman concerned indulging in private practice as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to frame another question to get that matter answered.  It does not arise at all from the question on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>The latest available information is that obtained from the census of population taken in 1951.  I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement containing the particulars in respect of that year.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>NUMBER of employers and persons working on own account in each industrial group, as returned at the 1951 Census of Population.</P>

      <P>It is not my function to finalise and accept a contract for the Galway harbour scheme.  My approval is, however, required for the acceptance by the Galway harbour commissioners of a tender, since the scheme is being financed by means of a very substantial grant from State funds. Certain legal and technical questions relating to the acceptance by the harbour commissioners of a tender for the work are at present the subject of correspondence with the harbour commissioners and a communication in the matter was addressed to them on 8th May.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy is aware that the difficulty arises from the fact that the lowest tender received, which the harbour commissioners wished to accept, quotes a figure for the work which was well below the figure at which their own consulting engineer thinks it can be done.  There arises the question as to whether it is desirable in such circumstances to rely upon the bond for the due performance of the contract at the tender the harbour commissioners are prepared to accept.  That, I think, would be contrary to practice and could lead to difficulties.  The matter, <Col N="10" /> as I say, has been the subject of correspondence with the harbour commissioners, with a view to getting the situation rectified.  It is clearly undesirable to proceed with the work in circumstances where difficulties are likely to arise in its completion.</P>

As long as the resources available are <Col N="13" /> limited, I am satisfied that the free vaccination service should, in equity, be made available for the benefit of the group in greatest need and that, without due necessity, parents at the higher income levels should not be relieved of their obligations in regard to the protection of the health of their children.</P>

That is the issue and there is nothing else in it.  It is all very well to talk about alarming statements. We do not want to create a panic, but there are some people who are trying to create a panic in the country.  This is a serious business.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that standards for soft drinks have been prescribed in Great Britain.  The question of prescribing standards for the composition of foods generally is a very complex one.  My predecessor as Minister set up a Food Advisory Committee late in 1955 to advise on the measures which might be taken to safeguard the public health in the consumption of food and drink and this committee is at present carrying out investigations with a view, primarily, to the exclusion from articles of food of harmful ingredients.  It will be appreciated that this aspect of the food control problem is one which should receive priority.  When the committee has concluded its present investigations, I shall seek its advice on the desirability of establishing a standard for soft drinks.  The Deputy is aware, I presume, that soft drinks are subject to the general provisions of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950 and 1952 and of the Food and Drugs Acts 1875-1956.</P>

Regarding the second part of the question the latest available information indicates that the estimated cost will be about £35,000.  A Road Fund grant of £18,750 has been allocated to the council on the basis of a preliminary estimate of the cost.  The question of revising the amount of the grant will be considered when a firm estimate of the cost is available.  The Office of Public Works have notified the council that they are not prepared to make any contribution towards the cost, and the balance, after taking credit for the Road Fund grant, will therefore be met by the council.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Development (Encouragement of External Investment) Bill, 1957&mdash;Fifth Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that, in view of the doubts which were expressed <Col N="30" /> during the earlier stages of this Bill as to the results which would accrue from the enactment of this legislation, the Minister should consider publishing a brochure or taking some steps to make it publicly known abroad that this measure has relaxed restrictions on external investments here.</P>
      <P>I think nobody is entirely happy about the Title of this measure and the mere fact that we have not been able to get a better Title during the various stages of the Bill is no reason why the present Title should be accepted as satisfactory.  I would therefore urge on the Minister the desirability of making it known that the amendment has relaxed restrictions in view of the agreed national policy of endeavouring to get external investment here.  Either a brochure or some publicity calculated to convey the information that the restrictions which are imposed here are of a less rigid type than heretofore obtained would I believe probably secure more publicity than the actual discussions which have taken place during the various stages of the Bill have secured.  Certainly, outsiders reading the Bill once it leaves this House, or after it is enacted by both Houses, would be pardoned if they were not aware of the relaxation which is intended.  As it leaves here it is a somewhat intricate measure and, therefore, I would suggest some steps should be taken to make it publicly known, particularly abroad, that the requirements which operated heretofore have been relaxed, at least to some extent, and that we are anxious to attract external investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would it be possible to simplify the Title by excluding the words: &ldquo;Encouragement of&rdquo; and just say &ldquo;Industrial Development External Investment Bill, 1957&rdquo;.  Is it necessary to put in the words &ldquo;Encouragement of&rdquo;?  As Deputy Cosgrave pointed out this Bill is intended to do away with the deterrents in the Control of Manufactures Acts, 1932 and 1934, and to give greater encouragement to industrial development.  I do think that the new brochure issued by the Industrial Development Authority came out too soon, though the brochure is a very <Col N="31" /> attractive one.  It is a pity, however, that it did not include the kernel of this new Bill and that it did not give publicity to the advantages granted by the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I know a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.  I believe it is necessary to keep the two words &ldquo;Encouragement of&rdquo; within the brackets, because the Act we are amending is the Control of Manufactures Act which was well known to have restrictive provisions in it covering external investment in Irish industry.  Merely to repeal that Act, by another Act with reference in its title only to external investment, would not by itself emphasise the fact that the purpose of the Act was to relax these restrictions.  Therefore, I think there are advantages in keeping the words &ldquo;Encouragement of&rdquo; in the Title.  It is true that the brochure issued by the Industrial Development Authority would require to be revised. It would have to be revised anyway in view of the tax changes announced in the Budget which will be incorporated in the Finance Bill.  Consideration is now being given as to how the changes in the Bill, plus the tax changes, will be incorporated in the brochure in future.</P>
      <P>The House is, I think, aware that the Department of Commerce of the United States Government is also publishing a brochure on the &ldquo;Establishment of Business in Ireland.&rdquo;  That will be the title of the brochure and their attention has been drawn to the fact that this Act is being passed through the Oireachtas and will, presumably, be passed in its present form. They are taking measures to incorporate in their brochure details of this Act.</P>

      <P>The amendment now being examined is simply spacing out the arrangements for putting into operation the provisions of this Bill in a slightly different way than was previously envisaged.  It was proposed to bring in the re-enactment of the provisions for the licensing of fishing <Col N="34" /> engines and fishing duties on fishing rods on the 1st December, 1958.  In order not to have confusion with the annual meetings of boards of conservators it is proposed to have a later date for salmon and trout licences for rainbow trout, also for oyster fishing engines and also to cover failure to produce oyster fishing licences on demand.  Six months' notice has to be given in order to provide for penalties and, therefore, it was decided to make the Bill operate from a later date in respect of those.</P>

      <P>Since the Second Reading of the Bill, there have been meetings of a number of boards of conservators and anglers' associations.  I must say that, taking it as a whole, they have shown the most co-operative spirit in that they have seen the necessity to raise further revenue independently of whatever the Minister for Finance can provide.  A number of the boards suggested to us that there should be a district rod licence at a figure less than £4 for a full year.  I feel this is a matter upon which we will need the co-operation of the boards and angling associations.  I shall consider before the Report Stage the possibility of providing a district season licence applicable to only one district at a figure less than £4.  A number of boards actually suggested that figure.  They all realise that more revenue must be got.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-sections (3), (4) and (5).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I press this amendment very strongly.  This section is in my opinion the one section which warrants our opposition to this Bill.  Some time ago the Salmon Conservancy Fund was set <Col N="38" /> up for the purpose of imposing a levy of 2d. per lb. on all salmon exported.  The reason given at that time by the then Parliamentary Secretary was that the amount collected from the salmon levy was to be allocated amongst boards of conservators so that, from the salmon levy, boards of conservators were to be given additional funds for the purpose of providing better protection for our salmon fishing.</P>
    <P>The principle involved was one considered of the greatest possible importance because to impose a levy of that nature on the export of salmon was undesirable and many boards of conservators throughout the country very strongly opposed the Salmon Conservancy Fund.  The fishermen made very strong representations at the time and objected strenuously to the payment of 2d. per lb. on the export of salmon.</P>
    <P>The real idea behind the imposition of the salmon levy was not, as was intended by the Fisheries Department and the Minister, to supplement grants and financial aid to boards of conservators: it was merely to relieve the Exchequer of its responsibilities.  A serious principle is involved in this case.  This House should not agree to allow any section of any Bill, particularly a Bill of this type, to impose a levy on the export of an essential food commodity.  When we see that, when salmon is exported, an export levy must be paid on it, are we not entitled to consider that this is only the thin end of the wedge?  Have we not cause to fear that we shall have legislation later for the purpose of imposing a levy on the export, say, of our cattle or our meat or our eggs or our butter?  Salmon may be looked upon in the same light as beef, eggs, butter, poultry.  It all comes under, let us say, agricultural food.  I feel that not alone is the proposal undesirable but it is wrong in principle.  I feel the Minister is very unwise in the step he is now taking because the fishermen themselves have objected strenuously to the payment of this levy.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will tell us what has prompted him to reimpose the salmon levy?  During the time <Col N="39" /> the Minister for Agriculture was in charge of fisheries, at the request of the salmon fishermen and of a number of boards of conservators and on clear evidence that was available&mdash;the statistics are there to prove it&mdash;the levy was withdrawn.  One would imagine that if all the money that was taken in from the export of salmon were going in the direction of boards of conservators to supplement their incomes so that they might pay additional water-keepers, so that they might improve the wages and allowances of water-keepers, so that they might provide water-keepers with protective clothing or to help in areas where our salmon fisheries have probably been neglected through lack of staff, neither the boards of conservators nor the fishermen would have raised such a serious objection to this levy.</P>
    <P>The people and this House were given to understand that the reason for this levy was to provide additional moneys to boards of conservators.  The position was that boards of conservators got the same amount of money but did not get a substantial increase to cover the amount taken in from the Salmon Conservancy Fund. Perhaps the Minister will be good enough to tell us what has prompted him or on whose representations he has decided to make this Salmon Conservancy Fund&mdash;which was designed, in my opinion, for the purpose of relieving the Exchequer&mdash;a part of permanent legislation?  I want to assure the House that I am speaking not in a very serious tone of criticism, but as a result of views expressed to me by fishermen in Kerry, Galway and Donegal.  I do not know if their views have since changed but I feel they have not.</P>
    <P>I had some evidence of the opposition that existed when I visited County Donegal some time ago.  I met a deputation of fishermen who asked unanimously that this salmon levy should not be imposed as it was ill-designed, achieved no proper purpose and was, in their opinion, unfair and unreasonable. You had that coming direct from the fishermen concerned and, on the <Col N="40" /> other hand, boards of conservators were themselves raising objections to it.  If the Minister looks up the records of his Department, he will find from the minutes of a number of boards of conservators that strong opposition was voiced by the boards in respect of the introduction of this levy. Therefore, I feel that this section ought to be opposed.  That is what prompted Deputy McMenamin and myself to ask that the House delete sub-sections (3), (4) and (5) from this Bill.  I feel they are undesirable and that it is the thin end of the wedge.</P>
    <P>If we agree to this proposal and pass it, I feel that we shall have legislative proposals later to impose a levy on some of our agricultural produce which we have for export.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.  He must have received the same representations as I received. There is only one difference.  Certainly, I am not making a charge against any officers of the Fisheries Department who were always kind, courteous and helpful, but I feel the Minister is being persuaded by the official outlook in this regard.  Neither I nor the Minister's predecessor was so persuaded. We stood on our own feet.  We felt it was wrong and unjust.  We wanted to relieve the salmon fishermen of this additional burden, but the Minister has reimposed it on them.</P>
    <P>It would be unfortunate if an important step of this kind were really taken as a result of what is known as political spite.  I can assure the Minister that we did not remove the export levy on salmon simply because we wanted to be different from our political opponents who had put it on.  We were asked to do so.  We felt it was wrong ever to impose it.  We felt it would not supplement the income of boards of conservators but would, instead, relieve the Exchequer of obligations and responsibilities.  I have often wondered since if political spite was the reason why the Minister came back to reimpose that levy which we had removed.  As I have said, I think it is wrong.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that it is the Civil Service viewpoint that that levy should be imposed.  We all know that a Minister <Col N="41" /> is under a certain obligation to be guided by advice and assistance from the officers of his Department who have a more technical and intimate knowledge of the running of the Department. However, in this, there is a principle of policy.  There is the principle of policy of the export of our produce. If we are asking for more exports, if we are trying to increase and encourage exports, why should we tax our exports and make it more difficult for those engaged in the export business? I shiver at the idea of legislation of this kind passing lightly through this House without serious thought or criticism by Deputies who have responsibilities to their constituents, whether they represent fishing constituencies or non-fishing constituencies.  What is happening to-day in the case of salmon can happen to-morrow in the case of cattle, butter, eggs or poultry.  I feel that in this proposal we have a grave principle, and that is why we take such a serious view of the matter.  I ask the House to delete these sub-sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Just one point strikes me.  This section refers to the Salmon Conservancy Fund.  If I read the White Paper correctly, the idea is that money is made available to that fund from two sources.  The first is the levy, to which Deputy O.J. Flanagan referred, and the other is income from licences.  If the Minister does not get income from some form of levy on the export of salmon, he has to get it either from fishing licences or from the general taxpayer.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is quite correct to say that there have not been levies on agricultural products previously.  In fact, there have been.  There has been a levy on pigs for quite a long time and it is working quite satisfactorily. I give the Minister credit for trying to do the best he can in a difficult situation. We all want to see our inland fisheries conserved and salmon fishing an expanding and profitable industry, both to the salmon fishermen and to tourists who come here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must face the fact that the Minister has got to get his funds from somewhere.  Assuming that the Salmon Conservancy Fund is to operate at all, it must receive contributions from <Col N="42" /> somewhere.  Personally, I am against loading the already overloaded taxpayer with more charges.  I do not think the Minister has any alternative. In regard to the levy of twopence, the only possible suggestion I would make is to relate the figure of a penny or twopence to the value of the salmon on date of export.  If the salmon is valued at 7/- or 8/- per lb., twopence would be quite a small impost; but if the value went down and there was a danger of its becoming an unprofitable venture, it might be quite a heavy percentage of the total value of the salmon.  Personally, I doubt if the danger is as great as Deputy O.J. Flanagan suggests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was opposed to the original levy some years ago.  I am curious about the motive behind this levy.  What will be done with an accumulating fund of this size?  Build up funds for conservators?  What will they do with it?  They have funds already.  Their main function is to pay water bailiffs.  Anybody acquainted with the problem knows that the whole technique of taking fish illegally is now completely changed from the days when a lot of fellows got together at night and went out with weapons of one kind or another to raid rivers. That is dead and gone for practical purposes.  Now the destruction of fish is mainly by poison.  I do not see that any extra bailiffs will prevent that. Some new technique will have to be developed for that purpose.  Money will not do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use building up a fund that is not required.  I can see it fulfilling only one purpose: the conservators can appoint a whole brigade of water bailiffs because they have the money.  The pressure will be put on them locally to appoint Tom Jones or Tim Murphy because they are in a very bad way and the conservators have plenty of money.  The money will be used to appoint these fellows, who will be really useless from the point of view of effective protection of the rivers.  If you had all the bailiffs in the country lined up, you could not prevent what is happening now.  When they put the substance in the river, they could, in <Col N="43" /> the last analysis, walk away and leave the fish lying dead to pollute the river.</P>
    <P>The salmon fishermen on our inland rivers are very poor men.  Are they not ground down with taxation already? Have we not made things almost intolerable for them?  Why should we add another burden?  For the most part, they are married men with large families.  The imposition of this House weigh down on them already.  I do not want to emphasise that because the Minister knows it as well as I do.  There are years when these fishermen earn practically no money at all&mdash;in a very dry spring, when the fish lie out in deep water and do not come into the estuaries because of the lack of fresh water in the rivers.  How are these men to live?  There is no other type of work in the districts where they live.  That should be kept in mind when this matter is being considered.</P>
    <P>If I thought the Minister required this, or that this was a problem that money could solve, I would agree with him.  In the first place, the Minister is not in need of money.  The conservators have all the water-keepers they want.  So far as defeating operations with the new technique is concerned, I find that the water bailiffs are next to useless.  It can be done practically under their eyes and it has been done successfully.  Money is not the remedy for that.  The Department will have to find some other remedy to meet this new weapon.</P>
    <P>We are imposing taxation on a class of people already over-taxed.  Everything that comes into their little homes is heavily taxed and life is becoming unbearable for them.  What we propose to do with money will not be effective. I do not think it is just.  People talk about the amount of money fishermen make out of salmon.</P>
    <P>Fishermen do occasionally get a good year, but how many bad years do they get?  A great number of these men must be having a very lean time, and they must have the utmost difficulty in keeping their homes and rearing their children.  It would not be just to impose a levy and we should not do an unjust thing.  Some years ago, when a levy was first placed on the export of <Col N="44" /> salmon, it was not such a serious matter. When the 2d. per lb. levy was imposed in the year of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth of England, salmon went up to 8/- a lb.  A levy of 2d. per lb. on salmon at that time was only chicken feed.  Now, however, when the price of salmon has fallen, such a levy would impose greater hardship on these people.</P>
    <P>From every point of view, the imposition of a levy&mdash;whatever the amount&mdash;is wrong in principle.  It is all right, of course, to say that fishermen can well afford it.  Most Deputies probably do not know anything about the lives these men lead.  They depend on a couple of months' fishing to raise the money to keep themselves, their wives and families&mdash;and most of them have large families&mdash;for the entire 12 months.  It is a big problem.  Every penny they get is required, and more if they could get it.  I would ask the Minister to view this in a detached way and to drop this idea of a levy.  I do not think it is a wise thing and I do not think he will succeed in attaining the objective he has in view.</P>
    <P>As I said already, the people who adopt this new technique know their way about.  They are out for one purpose and one purpose only.  It is not a question of taking local fellows.  They come in motor cars and that is one of the difficulties in dealing with them. They have their scouts to inform them how the land lies on any particular stretch of water, at any given hour of the day, night or evening.</P>
    <P>I saw a number of cases last summer where one would have thought that the people involved would have been fully convicted.  They were not except in one case.  If I thought the money was solely for the purpose of building up defences against the illegal taking of fish, I would be the very first to support the Minister, but, even then, I would take the money from somebody else instead of imposing a levy on the fishermen in present circumstances.  I believe that with the increased rod licences sufficient money will come into the boards of conservators.  I am particularly familiar with this problem of illegal fishing in my native district.  I do not believe extra bailiffs will be of <Col N="45" /> any extra assistance.  The bailiffs are capable, active men, but they are outflanked in spite of their best efforts. Again, I ask the Minister not to impose this levy on the fishermen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better deal with the speeches made by Deputy McMenamin and Deputy Flanagan separately.  Deputy McMenamin, I think because of some local experience in Donegal, is very pessimistic but I can assure the Deputy that boards of conservators around the country would be horrified if they heard the suggestion made that they do not need more money.  They need more money to provide water-keepers with motor bicycles and motor cars, and also to pay them sufficient so that they can get good men to do the work.  There has been poisoning of a horrible kind on certain rivers in Donegal on a few occasions but I would not say that represented the situation as a whole around the country.</P>
      <P>I have to rely not only on the views of the officers of my Department but also on the views of the boards of conservators.  I have met members of the boards around the country and I am quite satisfied they are keeping abreast of the most modern developments. They desperately need more funds to pay their water-keepers, to reorganise their water-keeping systems, to provide full-time employment instead of part-time employment, and to end the situation where along one stretch of water a man is paid a single fee of £10 for part of a season to act as a water-keeper, which under present circumstances is a ridiculously small sum, unless the happens to be a ghillie and it is in his own interests to act as a water-keeper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy McMenamin is a little pessimistic about the effects of the levy.  Some of the boards of conservators are better managed than others but I can assure the Deputy there are excellent people on the boards and in most cases net fishermen and rod fishermen have collaborated continuously with the boards with the objective of improving the fisheries.  I think Deputy McMenamin exaggerated the effects of the levy on the lives of the <Col N="46" /> net fishermen.  If a netsman does not net so many fish he pays a lesser levy. Average statistics are very dangerous, as the Deputy knows, and so I give this with a sense of reserve.  The average value of salmon caught by a net in a recent year was £250, and therefore, 2d. a lb. in the early part of the season, and 1d. a lb. in the later part, cannot be said to be crippling from a statistical point of view. The average price of salmon per lb. in 1957 was 73d. and I do not think anybody could say I am in the position of a Minister for Finance, on either side of the House, crushing the taxpayers with taxation.  I do not think 1d. on salmon which fetched 73d. a lb. in 1957 would be a crushing imposition.</P>
    <P>I would like to disabuse Deputy Flanagan of one idea.  There is absolutely no connection between any suggestion of a tax on the export of cattle and the tax on the export of salmon.  Boards of conservators have to do the work of developing our salmon fisheries but they are controlled by Acts of the Dáil.  Their operations are, to a considerable degree, managed by the Department of Fisheries and their regulations are controlled.  At the same time the boards are of varying importance and vary in their revenues. Some of them have very small revenues but they do quite important work in salmon development.  Therefore, it is very important to equalise the revenues coming from the salmon industry as far as possible.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Flanagan knows, levies of various kinds have been established to aid exports, including the levy mentioned by Deputy Russell in connection with the pig industry which was approved by the former Minister for Agriculture.  However, the Deputy must disabuse his mind of any suggestion that, because we have re-established the salmon levy, within a week or two the country will be informed of an enormous export tax on cattle. Cattle are not harvested from the water.  They are produced by the farmer.  I honestly believe Deputy Flanagan is not serious when he suggests a connection between the two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We may take <Col N="47" /> that then as a guarantee that the idea of a cattle tax has gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard any suggestion of a cattle tax and I am guaranteeing that there is no connection between the Minister for Agriculture and myself, or any other member of the Government, over this tax.  The Minister for Agriculture is not lying awake at night wondering how soon he can start a cattle tax on exports and watching eagerly the progress of this Bill through the Dáil, having in mind that the moment we have our export levy fully provided for in legislation he will proceed to go on with the cattle tax!  The idea is humorous. It should be in <i>Dublin Opinion</i>.  I am sure Deputy Flanagan would be quite capable of suggesting a cartoon in <i>Dublin Opinion</i> representing this fantastically conflicting idea.</P>
      <P>The Salmon Conservancy Fund is in operation.  The money has been collected. This Bill is designed to make it part of our permanent legislation and to repeal the statute originally passed by the Dáil and Seanad which dealt only with the salmon export levy.</P>
      <P>The next question I should like to deal with is the attitude of those interested in salmon towards this levy. I think both Deputy Flanagan and Deputy McMenamin must be not altogether in touch with those who are concerned.  I am very glad to say that since the reimposition of the levy, and particularly since the Second Reading of this Bill, I have heard absolutely no protests whatever against the decision to make the levy part of our permanent legislation.  There have been no week-end meetings of netsmen protesting, and no boards have protested. About ten boards have met and made proposals to me about other sections in the Bill, but there has been no formal protest from these nine or ten board meetings against the salmon levy and, since I have had the privilege of being Minister in charge of Fisheries, a number of boards have proposed the reintroduction of the levy and, on these boards, the netsmen were represented and offered no objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> The Cork board met in March, 1957, and wanted the levy reintroduced at 6d. per lb.  The Limerick board favoured the reimposition of the levy in May, 1957.  The Bangor board in June, 1957, welcomed the reimposition of the levy.  There were three other boards&mdash;I need not go through the whole lot&mdash;which either indicated their approval or actually passed a resolution favouring the reimposition of the levy, a levy which will bring in a sum of money varying from £14,000 to £20,000 per year and which will be used not only to improve water-keeping but will provide a fund for the development of salmon fisheries and the removal of obstructions preventing the passage of fish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if he received any representations from any salmon fishermen themselves asking for the levy to be reimposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Limerick board in May, 1957, favoured the reimposition of the levy.  The Bangor board in June, 1957, welcomed the reimposition of the levy; and the Dundalk board in May, 1957, requested the reintroduction of the salmon export levy.  Possibly the climate of opinion may partly have changed due to the financial pressure which has been exercised on the public in general. Both sides of the House can consider this for the moment at least without any political rancour.  Taxation has been increased.  Ministers for Finance, representing different Parties, have pointed out that we have reached the limits of taxation and the one ambition I have is to find a permanent revenue that does not depend upon the kind of pressure that can be brought to bear on the Minister for Finance of the day in order to assist the salmon industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to have that industry as self-sufficient as possible and I know that the well run boards of conservators feel very strongly in the matter.  They do not want to have to look forward to the introduction of the Budget to find out whether the Minister for Finance, with all the other claims upon him by other Ministers, has been <Col N="49" /> able to find £14,000 or £20,000 from the general taxpayer.  I do not think the general taxpayer should finance in large measure boards of conservators. The general taxpayer is already providing money for developing lakes and rivers through the Inland Fisheries Trust and through An Bord Fáilte.  In so far as the week to week running of the boards of conservators is concerned, the sooner they are made independent of whatever may be the considered annual opinion of the Minister for Finance about how much he can give them the better.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to inform the House that since the Second Reading of the Bill, boards of conservators in general have been most reasonable and, when we come to discuss, as we shall, the question of salmon rod licences I can mention some further views of the boards but, in regard to this levy, there has not been a single word said, so quite possibly the climate of opinion has changed since Deputy Flanagan had the privilege of considering this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister to clear up one point?  The Minister will agree with me when I say that when the inter-Party Government removed this levy of 2d. per lb. on the export of salmon that did not mean that boards of conservators did not get as good a grant as they had got previously.  They got as much money for protection purposes with the levy off as they got when it was on. Is that not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister not see my point then that the real purpose in principle behind the levy is more or less to relieve the Exchequer in general?  If boards of conservators got as much without the levy, why impose the levy at all?  Is it not really a further additional tax <Col N="50" /> rendering the livelihood of the salmon fishermen more difficult?  Deputy McMenamin was quite right when he said that the salmon fishermen, particularly those engaged in fishing for export, are not rich men.  The majority of them are hard working, poor men.</P>
      <P>As well as that, the price of salmon is not now as high as it was.  There is no doubt that the price will drop considerably and, if it does, those people will still have to carry this additional burden of 2d. per lb. on the export of salmon.  The Minister agrees with me when I say that when we removed the levy that did not mean that any board suffered a loss.  On the contrary, they got as much money as they had ever got and, in many cases, the grants were increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fact, but the position in the coming year is that the Minister is providing a sum of money in addition to the salmon export levies.  It is not that the Minister for Finance is not giving extra.  He is giving extra over and above the salmon export levy and he is also providing an extra £20,000 for inland fisheries development as a whole as between Board Fáilte and the Inland Fisheries Trust.  The boards are getting much more money than they did under the last Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another day's work.  The Minister says that all round grants will be increased and, on top of that, there will be additional funds to each board of conservators allocated from this fund.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The revenue from the export levy will be divided amongst the boards and there will be an additional sum provided by the Minister for Finance.  Salmon rod licence revenue will equally go to the boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( )  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951 (No. 20 of 1951), the powers conferred on the Government by the said Section 23 shall, in relation to offences under this section, be exercised by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment because I feel this Bill should make a concrete effort to right any of the existing wrongs in regard to fishery offences. As I pointed out when speaking on the Second Stage of this Bill, we all hoped the Minister at a very early date would come into this House with more comprehensive and up-to-date legislation. We all realise that the framing of legislation takes a considerable time, and the general public are a little uneasy at present with regard to the manner in which fishery offences are being dealt with.</P>
      <P>I am raising this matter because I gave an undertaking even on the Fisheries Estimate that on every possible occasion I would avail of the opportunity in this House of contributing in a constructive way on the question of fishery offences.  That is why, after consideration, I decided to table this amendment in the hope that, having regard to recent criticisms by boards of conservators, the Minister would not wait for the long-planned fisheries legislation but would avail of the earliest oportunity to end for all time the criticism which, I am sorry to say, is well founded, in relation to fishery offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister's views in this regard.  He stated them in the House time and again, and even when addressing boards of conservators and fishermen in the country, he expressed the views which I re-echo in relation to the manner in which those found guilty of illegal fishing should be dealt with. The very lowest and meanest offence <Col N="55" /> of which any citizen could be found guilty is maliciously and wilfully attempting to destroy our fisheries.  We have organised gangs of poachers in many parts of the country who are earning their living out of nothing else. They are equipped with transport and they have even made attempts to bribe water-keepers.  Now we are getting back again to the question of paying the water-keeper, and the water bailiff, well so that he will be independent and will have sufficient wages or salary not to succumb to the temptations and bribes of organised poachers.</P>
    <P>When the Minister looks up the files in his Department he will find that there are those organised gangs of poachers in a number of areas.  They seem to be so well organised that they attract people of different political views and, no matter what Government is in power or what Minister is in charge, they always have some members with sufficient pull to have the fine either wiped out completely or considerably reduced.  There is no use in the Minister coming here and saying that he stands for the protection of our fisheries and that he is sincere in his efforts to end the poaching of our precious and prosperous rivers, because when offences under the fishery laws are committed the courts, I feel, are the proper places to decide. The view I always held was that the district justices were too lenient, in view of the seriousness of the offences that came before them from time to time.</P>
    <P>I have known cases, and I am sure the Minister is also aware of them, where water-keepers were beaten up. We had one case I think in North or South Kerry, where a water-keeper was beaten up, had to receive medical attention and go to hospital for some time, merely because the man was doing his duty.  If the courts deal severely with people who commit that kind of offence it is a disgrace that any Minister should show the hand of mercy and set himself up as a court of appeal.  Poachers, or those found guilty of offences under the fishery laws, can <Col N="56" /> always appeal to the Circuit Court if they are dissatisfied.  Permitting them to organise themselves for the purpose of interviewing a local T.D. and coming to the Minister for Justice to have the fine either wiped out completely, or considerably reduced, is encouraging this business.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine for the Minister for Justice to say that he will do what he likes, that the power is vested in him to reduce fines, or otherwise.  You have boards of conservators up in arms against this system.  On the other hand you have the Minister for Lands stating throughout the country that he has recommended no mitigation of fines for fishery offences.  I accept the Minister's word and I feel that if the Minister recommended mitigation in any case he would be wrong and would not be discharging his duties, as Minister responsible for the Fisheries Section, to help boards of conservators to stop poaching.</P>
    <P>I do not claim that I set myself up as one who deliberately and on every occasion attacked the poachers but I feel that there are members of boards of conservators and water-keepers who love their job and feel that they have the same obligation to protect our fisheries as the Garda Síochána have to maintain law and order.  It would be wrong to discourage them in any way in that view.  I have always found the officers of the Department of Fisheries very cautious and careful in the advice they gave to any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary in charge of Fisheries, in that respect.  During the three years I was Parliamentary Secretary I do not think I recommended the mitigation of a fine to the Minister for Justice in one single case. I can remember being criticised very much by the Cork Board of Conservators at the time and I also know of a case where a board of conservators passed a resolution asking for the mitigation of a fine.  I can remember, too, distinctly turning down the request that came to me from a board of conservators asking that representations be made to the Department of Justice for a reduction in a fine.  I refused to do it because on principle I think it is wrong to encourage that kind of thing.  The Minister for Justice <Col N="57" /> and the Minister for Lands may work in close co-operation in this matter, but it would be more satisfactory I think if the Minister for Lands had power vested in him either to uphold or reduce fines imposed for fishery offences.</P>
    <P>I wonder is the Minister fully aware of the seriousness of this matter and of the amount of public uneasiness that exists in regard to the manner in which fines are reduced?  A leading article appeared in one of the leading daily newspapers recently from which I shall quote.  It appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> for May 5th last and stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A question of grave public importance was raised at a meeting of the Ballyshannon Fishery Board.  It concerns the practice of the Minister for Justice in reducing fines imposed by the courts of justice on persons convicted of poaching.  It was stated that there had been no fewer than five recent instances of the mitigation of fines in the Ballyshannon board's area.  To what extent the same leniency is extended to poachers elsewhere in the country we do not know.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that that is from the leading article of what I suppose is the most popular and widely read newspaper in Ireland to-day.  I should like to know if it is a fact that in the Ballyshannon area there have been five instances of reduction of fines for fishery offences in recent months and, if so, have those fines been reduced by the Minister for Justice without consultation with the Minister for Lands. I should like to know if the Minister for Lands was asked to express an opinion whether or not those fines should be reduced, did he agree that they should and if he was not asked, why should the Minister for Justice take it upon himself to set himself up as a judge or an appeal board on fishery offences?  That is the reason I propose this new sub-section, so that mistakes made in the past will be avoided in the future.</P>
    <P>The leading article goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This makes nonsense of the pleas made by another Minister to preserve and extend the inland fisheries <Col N="58" /> as a source of potential wealth and as an attraction to tourists.  The fishery boards spend large sums in paying men to patrol and watch fisheries, night and day; and their reward is this strange attitude of the Minister for Justice.  The poacher is, of course, the meanest type of petty thief.  The mischief he does is by no means confined to the fish he takes; very often he does immensely more damage.  Everybody knows that having regard to the possibilities of the industry which is jeopardised by poachers the maximum fines for offences of the kind are nowadays quite inadequate.  Yet the Minister chooses to abate the only penalties that the courts are permitted to impose.  As was said at the Ballyshannon meeting, the price of one fish would pay the fine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of the 4th May, 1958, we find the heading: &ldquo;Minister making Government &lsquo;laughing stock&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The paragraph continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ballyshannon Fishery Board consider the Minister for Justice is making a laughing stock of his own Government.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>After a stormy meeting&mdash;at which criticism of the practice of mitigating fines imposed in the District Court for breach of fishery laws was voiced &mdash;the board decided to write to the Minister for Lands setting out their views.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One member of the board said it was &ldquo;against all law and justice&rdquo; and made the functioning of the board impossible. I should like to hear what the Minister for Lands proposes to do to co-operate with boards of conservators. There is no use in the Minister proposing, as he has told us on the earlier sections of this Bill, to give boards more money from the Salmon Conservancy Fund for protection when the price of one fish will pay the fine for such an offence.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 7th May, we find:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mitigation of Fishery Fines is Criticised:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> Protests against the mitigation of fishery fines by the Minister for Justice were made at Ballyshannon Fishery Board.</P>

      <P>It cannot write nonsense all the time.  That would be impossible.  It must have some common sense, and I saw some common sense in it when I read that, at a meet-of the Kerry Board of Fishery Conservators some time ago, the same matter was raised and I think a similar resolution was passed.</P>
      <P>I do not know what co-operation at present exists between the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Justice in this regard, and I feel the Minister should tell the House and the country where he stands in this matter.  I know he has certain difficulties: I can understand that, and I do not want to criticise unduly or severely.  I found myself in the same position.  I do not know whether the Minister for Lands recommended mitigation in the five Ballyshannon cases where the fines were reduced, but I can say that during the three years I was in charge of Fisheries, I never once recommended mitigation, even where the Department itself might be favourably disposed to such a course, nor did I do so in one instance where I was asked by a board of fishery conservators to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sole responsibility for the wiping out of or reducing of fines for fishery offences should rest with the Minister <Col N="60" /> for Lands.  If the Minister for Lands is actively engaged in providing money for conservators for protection purposes and parading the country from top to bottom condemning poaching and asking the general public to co-operate in preventing it, asking school teachers and Gardaí and civilians to co-operate in protecting the fisheries, then he should let the district justices deal with them as they think fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them do it well, and then the Minister for Justice comes along and he thinks fit to reduce the penalty.  Whether the district justice is right or wrong, he is in the position to decide, and, where he decides to impose a certain fine, it is wrong to interfere with his decision, except in the Circuit Court on appeal. If the law is to be administered through the courts, the courts should have the final say.  I say to district justices, and I hope what I say is published for their information, that they have been entirely too lenient and instead of fines of £3, £4 or £5 or 30/-, they should give six months in prison every time a person is found guilty of a fishery offence.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they are destroying the greatest possible attraction we have for tourists.  We have some of the finest fisheries in the world. The only trouble is we do not seem to get sufficient publicity abroad for the advantages we have in that respect. We cannot allow organised poaching and the bribing of water-keepers or bailiffs and we cannot have these people equipping themselves with lamps and lights and other electrical equipment.  Such gear should be confiscated. I do not know if it would be right to do this, but I think that until such time as they realise the seriousness of fishery offences, the Minister for Lands should circularise district justices pointing out that they are too lenient in dealing with such offences and that imprisonment sentences should be imposed instead of fines.  If imprisonment were substituted for some time, it would be easy to deal with such offenders.  As stated in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the price of one fish will pay the fine now and therefore it pays poachers well to be organised.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the views of the Ballyshannon Board because, apart from the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Justice making a laughing stock of themselves, protection of fisheries is a responsibility which we all share.  I am behind the Minister in all his efforts to stamp out poaching.  I remember a recent speech in which he spoke very strongly and which, as is customary, was reported in the first news on the radio. He expressed the same sentiments as I felt.  The only point on which I disagree with him now is that he has the chance to put himself in the position in which he need not depend on any other Minister.  Every board of conservators, every angling club, everybody who is in any way associated with fisheries and every public-spirited citizen, no matter how small may be his interest in fishing, will be with the Minister in trying to ensure that the raiding and damaging of rivers will be ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid the present system is <Col N="62" /> unsatisfactory: I know that from experience. The boards know it, and everybody connected with fishing knows it.  If an effort could be made by the department to see that these organised gangs of poachers are denied a market for their fish, it would be an important advance.  Representations should be made to An Bord Fáilte to see that hotel owners who accept poached salmon or other fish illegally taken are refused a licence and that the purchasing of such fish is looking upon as a far more serious offence than it is now.</P>
    <P>This matter is the subject of conversation all over the country to-day. One or two instances would not warrant the public attention that has been directed to the seriousness of the matter.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the whole matter and to accept my amendment.  I ask him to take on the responsibility of deciding himself in all cases of fines of that nature.  Too much leniency has been shown in the past and I am afraid that there is no provision in the Bill to improve the position with regard to poaching.</P>
    <P>We have already decided that certain funds will be made available from the salmon levy to assist boards of conservators in their efforts to protect fisheries, but here we have the kernel of the whole situation and we can decide on the manner in which it should be dealt.  It is not fair that the Minister for Justice should be asked to decide on fishery fines.  It should be the responsibility of the Minister for Lands.  He has the responsibility to boards of conservators to put down poaching.  I feel that the Minister for Justice is often too generous in dealing with matters of this kind, and I make a very sincere and genuine appeal to the Minister for Lands to accept this responsibility himself.  If he refuses to entertain representations from any Deputy, or anyone else, with regard to fishery fines, it would be all the better in the interest of the protection of our fisheries.</P>
    <P>Most water-keepers are conscientious and hardworking men.  It is most disheartening to them when they see the success of their efforts belittled by the <Col N="63" /> Minister.  It is most unfair, when they make captures and detect illegal fishing activities, that they should be discouraged in this way.  A special bonus fund should be set aside by boards of conservators to award those water-keepers who detect the most crime.  Instead of being discouraged, they should be encouraged in every way.  An effort should be made to break up gangs of poachers.  Poaching has been described as the meanest and lowest type of offence and for that reason I appeal to the Minister to do something about it.  He cannot say the position is satisfactory because it is not, and every Deputy knows it is not.  It may be a popular thing to say: &ldquo;Do not send anybody to jail,&rdquo; but it is a wrong thing to do, it we are genuine in our desire to protect our fisheries.</P>
    <P>Sterner measures should be taken to deal with poaching.  If the law is to be administered fairly and squarely, it should be left as the courts decide.  It is wrong for a Minister for Justice to interfere in such cases.  It is particularly wrong for the Minister for Justice to reduce a fishery fine, unless the Minister for Lands has already approved of such reduction.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to avail of this opportunity to reply to the leading article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of May 5th.  He should let us know if that article was warranted or not. Does he feel there was a great deal of common sense in the article?  What has he to say to the criticism of the Ballyshannon Board of Conservators? This is a golden opportunity for him to express himself on this.  There is little use in his expressing pious hopes for the future, unless some action is taken.  I am beginning to think that poaching is on the upgrade, more than ever before.  I suppose that the larger number of unemployed may, possibly, have something to do with that.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great care to the case made by Deputy O.J. Flanagan and I am inclined to believe there was a good deal of exaggeration on his part with regard to the <Col N="64" /> seriousness of the position as explained by him.  I come from an area that is supposed to engage quite a lot in fishing, particularly in inland fishing, and I am happy to say that poaching is very much on the wane in that area. I should like to say, and every Deputy, I am sure, will admit, that poaching, as we knew it, and still know it, is not carried on as extensively now as it was some years ago.  First of all, most people engaging in fishing, particularly in inland fishing, are members of angling associations.  Nearly all of those associations have in their rules a proviso that membership is subject to a certain code of conduct.  If a member of an association is fined for illegal fishing under the fishery code, he loses his membership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying this in an effort to show that the need for the amendment is not so great.  Greater protection can be provided by the appointment of suitable personnel at a proper rate of remuneration.  The Deputy referred to attempts made by fishermen&mdash;gangs, as he described them&mdash;to bribe water-keepers.  I am sure similar attempts have been made from time to time to bribe other servants of the State and there is only one way, in my opinion, in which you can successfully defeat a move in that direction, that is, to give the people engaged in the protection of fisheries a proper rate of remuneration, security of employment and some pension rates.  I believe the Minister has made what I might describe as a very formidable attempt to bring about that situation by giving more grants to boards of conservators.  I am rather inclined to suggest to the Minister that this method would be likely to give increased protection.  I feel that the number of prosecutions will be considerably reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various opinions were expressed here as to the inadequacy of the fines imposed by the courts.  The general feeling in my part of the country is that the district justices deal very effectively with these offences and that, in fact, the fines imposed are, if <Col N="65" /> anything, rather on the high side. There is also the question of costs.</P>
    <P>From time to time during my short period in the House, I have made representations to the Minister for Justice and my experience in that regard is not at all on a par with what Deputy O.J. Flanagan reports.  I find that the Minister takes a very conservative attitude in this matter.  As far as I know, the application is referred back to the local board of conservators. In fact, it is probably referred back to the Guards.  Indeed, I have an idea that it is also sent to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries for his views.  My experience is that if the type of offence is not serious, the Minister for Justice is inclined to be a little sympathetic but the degree to which the fine is reduced is sometimes almost negligible.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious question to take away the power from a Minister to review a fine of this kind particularly. I think the necessity for the revision of fines will lessen as time goes on. The fisheries have now come to stay and they are recognised as a national asset.  The history of poaching dates back to the time when most fisheries were vested interests and very few people were allowed to fish them at all.  They are now accessible to most people in the country who are in a position to pay the licence fee and avail of the facilities provided by the angling associations and the boards of conservators.  I think at this stage that the Minister would be unwise to accept as drastic an amendment as that put forward by Deputy O.J. Flanagan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say what I am sure the Minister will say in reply to Deputy O.J. Flanagan's remarks on this Bill and what, in fact, Deputy Moloney said.  I think it would be a very bad thing if the Dáil&mdash;I have no doubt it will not&mdash;accepted the principle enshrined in the amendment.  If it were to apply in respect of lands, as Deputy Moloney says, surely we would expect the same principle to apply in respect of the Department of Health, the Department of Industry and Commerce or any other Department of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> If there is a breach of legislation for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has responsibility, the appeal is not to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If there is a breach of a health regulation and there is a court prosecution, a conviction and a fine, surely the appeal is not, and should not be, to the Minister for Health.  Similar remarks apply in respect of what has been described as poaching.  I do not think that the decision on an appeal should lie exclusively in the hands of the Minister for Lands.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has a particular job&mdash;his job is justice.  He is concerned with seeing that justice is done.  He is concerned with the administration of justice and I think we should well leave that in his hands. I am not conversant with his attitude towards alleged poachers&mdash;whether or not be remits fines <i>ad lib</i> or whether or not he is too lenient with poachers. I assume that, as a responsible Minister for Justice, he uses his common sense, which many of our district justices do not use.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be a good idea if the poachers of this country were to be put into jail for six months. The House should remember that there are two types of poachers.  There is the type of organised gang, so described, and quite rightly, by Deputy O.J. Flanagan, who poach fish for profit.  They use gelignite and all the other appliances to which Deputy O. J. Flanagan referred.  I am sure the whole House is against that type of poacher.</P>

Quite a number of our writers would be at a loss if we did not have the colourful poacher in this country.</P>

      <P>I do not think that Deputy O.J. Flanagan should press his amendment.  Like Deputy Corish, I feel that there should be an appeal to the Minister for a remission of fines. <Col N="67" /> I do not think it is wrong that people should appeal to their deputies to help them in that regards.  Deputies will not help them, unless they feel there is a case to be met.  Perhaps a district justice may have fined a person too heavily.  In regards to appeals in cases of fines by district justices for poaching or other fishery offences, my experience is that you do not get anywhere with the Minister for Justice as a general rule.  It is wrong that the decision should rest finally with the Minister for Lands.  As the case is tried in the courts of justice, it is the Minister for Justice who should have the making of any decision affecting these fines.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Moloney that the incidence of poaching has been exaggerated to a great extent.  Where a person is convicted of poaching and an application made for the mitigation of a fine has failed, I should like the Minister for Justice to be able to exercise clemency.  Not all cases are so serious as to merit some fines that have been imposed.  I know of cases where I thought the fines imposed where possibly too heavy.  In such instances I should be glad to know that the Minister, of his own accord, after having asked the advice of the Minister for Lands and the board of conservators, could reduce the fines, rather than that the aggrieved person should have to appeal to the Circuit Court and involve himself and others in a lot of expenses.  The proper course is the course outlined in the Bill and I think Deputy O.J. Flanagan should not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>Might I be allowed to offer a correction?  I am not making any reference to the Minister for Justice who is a decent man and a man who uses his common sense.  I am simply dealing with the principle.  I was not attacking the Minister for Justice&mdash;far from it.  I had the same difficulty when I was Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <P>From that point of view, Deputy O. J. Flanagan ought to withdraw <Col N="68" /> his amendment.  I listened very attentively to him and the other Deputies who spoke.  I agree with what Deputy Corish said about other Departments of State.  If a man who prosecuted for not paying his road tax, I am sure everybody would agree that any penalty inflicted should be referred, if it is referred anywhere, to the Minister for Justice rather than to the Minister for Local Government. On the general principle, Deputy Corish mentioned a number of similar situations.  What is being done seems to me to be the proper thing.</P>
      <P>If the House were to accept Deputy O.J. Flanagan's suggestion, we might have to come later to the question as to who would initiate a prosecution. It might be a natural consequence of the acceptance of this amendment that such initiation should also be placed in the hands of the board of conservators, to the exclusions of the Garda authorities.  I should like Deputy O.J. Flanagan to visualise the case of a member of a board of conservators committing a fishery offence.  He will find there would be complications there that would be most embarrassing and that would, in my opinion, militate against a due and proper enforcement of the fishery laws. Such cases have happened.</P>
      <P>Taking every consideration into account, I think the present arrangement is much better.  Quite independently of the Minister for Fisheries, I think the Minister for Justice does refer these convictions to other sources for guidance.  I think he takes all the reports he gets from the various persons to whom he refers into account. I am convinced he is in a more favourable position to make a just decision on any appeals that are made to him.</P>

      <P>I think other Deputies have expressed my view in regards to these amendments.  The Minister for Justice must exercise the functions of clemency or refuse to exercise clemency.  It would set a most appalling precedent for Ministers of other Departments if they all had to settle questions of mitigation.  The Department of Justice has its special functions. The officers there are able to give the Minister for Justice advice on <Col N="69" /> legal questions.  I should say also that the Minister for Justice and I have no disagreement about this matter.  As I already informed Deputy O.J. Flanagan on the Second Reading of this Bill, without going into details, the number of mitigations has been very small compared with the number of prosecutions.  Whatever articles he has been reading in the newspapers have been giving him a totally distorted impression in regards to this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice knows my view about poaching.  I do not agree that there are two types of poachers. There may, in fact, be poachers with varying degrees of criminal activity but, from the point of view of the industry, we must be against poaching of all descriptions.  We know, beyond all doubt, that, in spite of the work of the board, salmon stocks are not increasing sufficiently.  We know that every time even an unemployed man takes a fish he will sooner or later eliminate the employment of one of the 5,000 people employed in our fisheries.  If members of the public, whether unemployed or otherwise, were seriously to sabotage a single compact industry employing 5,000 people in this country there would be plenty of public opinion defending stern action against those persons. But, because the salmon industry is diffused because it used to be considered an Irish sport and, in fact, is now a universal form of theft wherever there are salmon, the public is slowly awakening to the need for protecting the fisheries.</P>
      <P>We need a good public opinion and we need the co-operation of anglers' associations.  We should like all anglers to join an angling associations and the Inland Fisheries Trust in order that they can make quite sure that there is co-operative public feeling about poaching.  I would appeal to anglers to join an angling association so that we can have an additional number of water-keepers.  The boards of conservators cannot do this work by themselves. They need the co-operation of anglers and the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House has no need to fear that the Minister for Justice does not fully <Col N="70" /> recognise the importance of the salmon industry.  The mitigations in the past 12 months have been just what I would have expected from a man of the intelligence of the Minister for Justice.  I shall not comment on them: I should not, because they are his peculiar function.  However, I can say that he and I work together in harmony on this question.</P>
    <P>I should like the public to consider this whole question of poaching and not to make specious pleas.  I frequently see cases in which someone is referred to as being in poor circumstances but who, in fact, is known to the whole community as a long-term poacher who made a good thing out of it and who has at last been caught. When people receive appeals for clemency from someone who is supposed to be a poor man very often such a man has been accustomed to large-scale poaching for a long time.  I hope Deputy O.J. Flanagan will withdraw his amendment.  Really, it is absurd to ask for this exception to the universal rule in this and other democracies; the Minister in charge of justice should exercise elemency or else in many cases, or in particular cases, refuse it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1) (b).</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 19 seeks to delete sub-section (2) (c).  My reason for seeking the deletion of these sub-section is that I oppose the right of the Minister to increase the rod licences.  We have not got from the Minister a clear statement as to why he is taking this step, or why it is necessary to increase rod licences. When I was Parliamentary Secretary in charge of fisheries, a proposal was made to increase rod licences, but it was rejected.  No grounds in support of it were submitted.</P>
      <P>The greatest attraction we have for tourists to-day is our fisheries.  We can offer them, not alone the best and most attractive but the cheapest fisheries in the world.  The increase the rod licences is not only to discourage tourists but to make the pastime of fishing a luxury.  I fail to understand why the Minister should avail of this opportunity to increase these licences. They are dear enough at the moment, and no good case can be put forward in support of an increase.  Tourists who come here can return to their own countries and, by making it known that we have the most attractive and cheapest fisheries in the world, attract further tourists here.  We will be killing the goose that lays the golden egg, if we make it more difficult and expensive for the fishing tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of all the tourists who come to this country, the one most welcome to hoteliers and others is the fishing tourists.  He is looked upon as the most easily pleased tourist.  He stays out all day, taking his lunch basket and refreshments with him in the morning. He does not return for his dinner until night.  Then he goes off to his local-hotel or public house to discuss how lucky or unfortunate he was, the prospects for the next week, or to compare the fishery with other fisheries he has fished.  The hoteliers like to see the fishing tourists coming, and they would like to see them coming in even greater numbers.  If we want to encourage them to come, we must prove to them that we have, not alone the <Col N="74" /> most attractive fisheries but the best fisheries in the world.  While we can tell them at present that, no matter what part of the world they go, they cannot enjoy the same sport as here, the effect of our increasing the rod licences will be to make it difficult for us to prove that not alone are our fisheries the best but they are also the cheapest.</P>
    <P>I believe it is wrong to impose this increase.  I wonder was the Minister moved by any political motive or not? We see that his predecessor turned down the proposal; yet he comes along and implements it.  I do not know whether he yielded to a request by the Minister for Finance, or to whom he has yielded in this matter. It is wrong and it does not give very much encouragement to tourists and others.  At present the rod licences are moderate enough, but they cannot bear any further charge.  I am sure the Minister has examined the matter in the same light as the Minister for Agriculture examined it some time ago when he turned down the proposal.</P>
    <P>There are enough people at present making it difficult for tourists to come here without the Minister increasing rod licences for tourists as well.  I have often said that I believe a good many of our hoteliers are responsible for driving tourists away from us and keeping them away from us.  However, we will be able to deal fully with that on another occasion.  The Minister should at least facilitate the fishing tourists by not making things more expensive for them.  If, as a group, they have to pay more for their licences, they may stay here a shorter time.  While we can guarantee them the best fisheries in the world, we should also endeavour to keep to our boast that we have also the cheapest fisheries in the world.  If the Minister increases the rod licence, we will not be able to make that boast.  I ask the Minister to delete these two sub-sections.  If he does so, he will take a lot of harm out of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to leave the licence fees as they are.  I am particularly interested in the ordinary working man, fishing in the <Col N="75" /> area contiguous to Limerick City, on the Shannon and on the Mulcaire.  The Minister will recall that some short time ago he received a deputation from the Limerick Anglers' Association. They brought to his notice certain injustices which are not directly under his control; but I must point out, in the first place, that his obvious answer, or the reason he will give eventually for increasing the rod licences, it that he must get revenue somewhere. I submit that that is a ridiculous contension. There are several ways of getting revenue, other than by putting a further burden on the ordinary working man who, down through the years for generations, with his father and grandfather before him, has enjoyed angling in Ireland at a cheap cost.  It is unjust to that type, who get their sport cheaply, to subsidise the industry as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Minister has other methods.  He has the method under Section 8, whereby he is empowered to increase the levy further, after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  As a matter of fact I would prefer that the existing salmon levy should be increased further than that this burden should be imposed on the ordinary working man.  I cannot see why the working anglers of Ireland should be sacrificed for the well-being of foreign anglers.  That is hard talk, but that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may call it sentimental nonsense, but he cannot get away from facts.  In this section, he is reserving the right to increase the salmon licence fees and the people who will have to bear that burden are the ordinary working men&mdash;not poachers, not people who use gelignite but the ordinary person who has conducted himself down the years.  The sooner the Minister gets that into his head, the better, instead of accusing me of sentimental nonsense.  I did not get up to waste my time or the time of the House and I certainly throw <Col N="76" /> back in the Minister's face his contemptible suggestion.</P>
      <P>If I can finish without further interruptions, some years ago, the previous Fianna Fáil Government brought in a levy of 2d. a lb. on salmon sold for export.  Most of the reasonable anglers welcomed that innovation.  Now it is proposed to give the Minister power to increase the licence fee by 100 per cent. and, at the same time, to retain the levy of 2d. per lb.  Not alone that, but again, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, under Section 8, the Minister may increase the levy further.  I respectfully submit it would be far more fitting to increase the levy to 4d., if necessary, and allow the ordinary man in the street to enjoy his pleasure, by leaving the licence duty as it is.</P>
      <P>Again, if the licence duty is increased as a result of this section, it is setting up a precedent and other Ministers in time to come who want revenue may utilise it and come along with further legislation.  I agree that in the section it is limited to 100 per cent.  If the Minister is anxious to get revenue, I do not know whether it is feasible, but I would ask why An Bord Fáilte cannot make some contribution in kind towards alleviating the position. In the past, it was a <i>sine qua non</i> of all fishery legislation that the rivers of Ireland were primarily for the people of Ireland.  I subscribe to that view.  I agreed with it in the past and I agree with it now, even more so than ever.  The Bill&mdash;and this is directly related to this point&mdash;also tends to abolish the supplementary fee of 10/- payable by salmon anglers who go from one board of conservators to another; but that has really nothing to do with this, as the ordinary angler is not really interested in this supplementary fee, as he can afford to fish only in his own district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, is it not about time that a Minister for Lands had the courage to introduce legislation whereby these sub-sections of Section 15 about salmon charges would deal with the entire matter of fishing? In Limerick&mdash;and I am sure this happens elsewhere&mdash;having paid their £1 licence fee&mdash;or possibly £4 in the future&mdash;they have to go to the E.S.B. <Col N="77" /> The suggestion has been made from time to time that the E.S.B. would be far better occupied in generating electricity than in mismanaging the fisheries.  I have not heard the Minister give any intimation of what action he proposes to take.</P>

      <P>To conclude, the charge of an extra £2 on the ordinary common-or-garden angler will mean a lot.  Evidently £2 does not mean much to some people.  We hear so much nowadays about emigration, and this is just another little kick on the tail, urging those unfortunate people to depart.  I know the case of a member of a family who has three sons and they could not possibly afford this 100 per cent. increase.  If angling is to be preserved for the ordinary people, the ordinary angler&mdash;and previous Ministers of all Parties evidently professed their interest in doing so&mdash;then I think that either this section should be omitted in its entirely or the Minister should give at least some concession and say he will take only the power to increase it by 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister to review his decision in relation to the proposed increase in the existing rod licences which will, if this legislation is passed, be 100 per cent. greater in future.  The increase proposed is, in my opinion, out of all proportion to the value that this amending legislation will bring to the fishermen involved.  The rod fisherman <Col N="79" /> will be asked to pay 100 per cent increase for his licence while the net fisherman will not be required to meet any increase, at the moment at any rate.</P>
      <P>We must examine, first of all, what hardship this increased licence is likely to impose on the rod fisherman.  To come to any sensible conclusion, we must ask ourselves who are the people who mainly hold licences for rod fishing. I agree with the previous speaker, Deputy O'Malley, that a substantial number of our licensed anglers are ordinary working people who are finding it very hard to meet their day to-day commitments without obliging them to pay more for a particular activity in which they engage.  I suggest that 75 per cent. of licensed anglers are ordinary working people most of whom are not fishing entirely for sport.  There may be a certain element of sport attached to the activity, but, in the main, they are fishing in order to supplement their ordinary source of livelihood to enable them to balance the family budget.  There is no difficulty in proving that because most Deputies here, particularly those from fishing districts, are in a position to assess the type of membership in the anglers associations.</P>
      <P>This 100 per cent. increase in licences is certainly exorbitant and will cause hardship on those people who have been fishing down the years and propose to continue fishing.  If there was an all-round increase and some possibility of a substantial return from the increased charges, I could well understand why the burden should be shared by the different interests involved, but I find it very difficult to understand why rod fishermen should be singled out while net fishermen are excluded.  I can forecast the Minister's answer: it is that there are large numbers of licensed anglers as compared with the small number who hold net licences and the Minister is endeavouring to get the necessary increased revenue he is obliged possibly to secure to enable him to rehabilitate the fishing industry.  As Deputy O'Malley said, however, if that is the explanation, that in itself is not a sufficient justification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> This increase will impose a very heavy burden on a substantial number of rod licence holders.  If it is at all possible, even at this late hour, I suggest the Minister should reconsider the proposed increase and reduce it to 50 per cent.  If that causes a deficiency in revenue, which the Minister cannot very well escape, it is only reasonable then that he should direct his attention to the net fishermen.  Most net fishermen are fishing as a business. There is a commercial aspect attached to it.  They have big expenses but, if additional licensed duties are required at this stage, I suggest that the burden should be passed on to the net fishermen.  I appreciate that the levy from salmon will be collected from net fishermen.</P>
    <P>The case was made some time ago to me that almost the entire salmon exports come from net men and that a substantial part of the catch of licensed anglers is disposed of locally to hotels and private individuals.  That is not correct, so far as the constituency I come from is concerned.  The licensed anglers sell their catches to the local fish vendors in the ordinary way.  I know many anglers who consider themselves lucky if they catch 15 or 20 salmon during the season.  Of these 15 or 20 salmon, they never keep one for themselves.  They could not afford to do so.  They are anxious to meet their overheads and compensate themselves for the time they have to spend at this activity.  Some anglers actually stay away from work for the purpose of fishing because they feel it pays them better and they are anxious to increase the volume of their catch. This 100 per cent. increase is entirely exorbitant and I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this proposal with a view to reducing the figure to 50 per cent. bringing the licence from £2 to £3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years all sections of our people have tried and have succeeded in forming anglers' associations and they have devoted a great deal of their time, money and labour to the improvement of the fishing in our rivers and lakes.  It is certainly very unpleasant for them to find now that, from their resources, and <Col N="81" /> some of their resources are very small indeed, they will have to contribute a 100 per cent. increase in their rod licences.  I have an idea that it is not so very long since the rod licences were increased by 100 per cent.  Now there is a further 100 per cent. increase.</P>
      <P>Angling is a favourite pastime of large sections of our people and it is a great inducement to tourists to come here.  The increase in the rod licence by 100 per cent. is a blow to our own people and to tourists whom we wish to attract.  Some boards of conservators passed resolutions asking that the licences should be doubled.  Among those were the Kerry Board of Conservators. At that time, they were under the impression that the increased licences would be given to them to increase their revenues for the better protection of rivers and lakes, but, according to this Bill, the increase is to go into the Central Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>The Press reporters who attended a recent meeting of the Kerry Board of Conservators reported the matter correctly.  I quote from the report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the operation of the new Fisheries Bill, which will become law next January, will mean a loss of revenue to the Kerry Fishery Board arising out of income from rod licences, was the opinion expressed at the meeting of the Kerry Fishery Board, held in Killarney on Saturday, at which Mr. G.A. Foley, chairman, presided.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The opinion was expressed by members of the board.  All members of the board must have gone into this matter very carefully and they had studied the Bill.  One member protested against the increase from £2 to £4 in respect of rod licences when the increase had to be sent to the Central Fund and did not benefit the board.  The secretary pointed out that there was a resolution on the board's books already, calling to have the cost of rod licences doubled, but Mr. O'Donovan pointed out that when that resolution was passed, it was with the intention that the increased revenue would benefit the board and not the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision reached was that the Bill was a serious matter for the boards of conservators, that they would <Col N="83" /> not benefit under the increased rod licence and it was decided to send a resolution of protest to the Minister and also to acquaint the Kerry T.D.s with the position in regard to the financial aspect under the new Act.</P>
    <P>They did not contact us so far.  I do not know what is the exact position, whether the increase sent to the Central Fund will be kept there or whether it will be sent back, as the Minister states, to the boards of conservators.  The increase is a serious matter for anglers.  Anglers' associations are protesting against the increase in the rod licence and are not taking out licences.</P>
    <P>I was glad that Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Moloney, of the Minister's Party, protested against this.  I do not agree with Deputy O'Malley that the levy on the export of salmon of 2d. per lb. should be doubled or increased to any extent.  I do not think it should ever have been imposed.  The Minister got away with a division this evening in regard to that matter.  Now he wants to impose a further increase.  The increase in rod licences is more serious than the other.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear my Kerry colleague, Deputy Moloney, protesting against this increase.  I do not agree with him in wanting to go half way with the Minister and to have a 50 per cent. increase.  I think the section should be withdrawn and I would advise the Minister to withdraw it in the interests of fishing, not only for the sake of our people at home who must be our first consideration, who are doing their best to improve and protect fishing, but also for the sake of tourists.</P>
    <P>Tourism is very important and many tourists who can afford it come here and spend the greater portion of the year fishing.  As the Minister has succeeded in imposing the 2d. per lb. levy on salmon exports, I would advise him to be reasonable now and withdraw this section.  If he does so, he will have the support and good wishes of all people interested in fishing and in the success and prosperity of the fishing industry.</P>
    <Col N="84" />
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say that so far as the rod licence is concerned, the increase proposed for a full season, £2, is equivalent in terms of last year's average price of fish to 7 lb. of salmon.  Taking the price of salmon even as half the average price last year, it is 14 lb. of salmon and it really is not so much of an imposition as it seems.</P>
      <P>I am glad to tell the House, in particular Deputy Palmer and Deputy O. J. Flanagan, who raised this matter, that a number of boards have made comment on these proposals and five boards who discussed the question approved of the principle of an increase in rod licences.  Then they asked for a mitigation of the actual amount proposed.  So far as I can gather from an analysis that has been made, only two boards of those who passed resolutions on this subject seemed to disapprove of the idea of any increase in rod licences.  Of course, it was difficult to gather an exact idea in some cases because of the very wide discussion that took place. So far as the views of the boards are concerned, of those that discussed the matter, more approved in principle of some increase in rod licences than have spoken against it.</P>
      <P>I should like to repeat what I said before, that I do want to take the financing of the boards of conservators as far as possible out of the ordinary run of the mill of actual budget making. I do want to have them receive a permanent income which is sufficient for their needs.  The increase in these rod licences will bring some £9,000 or £10,000 in a full year and the export levy will bring in from £14,000 to £20,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be £24,000, roughly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That money is really needed in order that boards can operate in an efficient manner.  I do not know whether Deputy Palmer heard me speak on the occasion of the Second Reading of the Bill when I pointed out that, with the change in the value of money that has taken place since 1939, the total income available to boards of conservators was <Col N="85" /> actually £3,000 less than what would be required simply to make up for the change in the value of money.  In spite of the great increase in rates and in spite of increases in grants given under various heads, they still lack any substantial development expenditure.  They have very little more than what makes up for the fall in the value of money. What I want is to get for them permanently increased revenues which are not subject to consideration in each Budget and which will enable them to do their work well so that their waterkeepers will have proper means of transport and be well paid, and to make it possible for development expenditure to be undertaken improving the fisheries as well as maintaining their existing character.</P>
      <P>Secondly, perhaps Deputies have not appreciated that there has been introduced into this Bill an amendment which will provide for an all-Republic licence of £3 instead of £4 after the 1st July.  That enables fishermen to fish everywhere after the 1st July, and in view of the decline of salmon fishing in the later season in many rivers and in view of the existence of a number of fishermen specialising not only in salmon but in sea trout, I felt that was a concession to the views of the board who so co-operatively agreed to an increase but thought it was excessive.</P>
      <P>I thought of a still further concession, that between now and the Report Stage I should consider the introduction of a £3 licence for the whole season confined to a particular district as compared to a £4 licence covering fishing in any district.  Most of the boards who approved of the idea of increasing rod licences did advert to the existence of bodies of working men, people who had made a small addition to their salaries, in respect of whom the doubling of the licence fees would be serious for a full season.  I propose to increase the licence from £2 to £3 covering only a particular district, that is, an increase of only 20/-.  That represents some 3½ lb. of salmon for the whole season and is really not excessive as an increase.  I should state that there has been no increase in rod licences since 1925 and that the average price of salmon has gone up since that day from 1/6 to 6/1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> As I have said, the boards really need more than the mere recoupment of the fall in the value of money and I hope these proposals and those which I will consider between now and the Report Stage will go far towards making the boards feel I am not killing the goose that lays the golden egg, that they will get more money, that I will get a good part of the £10,000 for them, that the money from the basic licence fee increase will automatically go to the board where the district licence is taken and that the rest of the money will be spread fairly between them all in accordance with their needs and with what they have received in previous years.  Therefore, the Kerry Board of Conservators need have no alarm.  There will be no subterfuge to deprive the Kerry board of funds.  They obviously misunderstood the Bill and the explanatory memorandum which I sent, but it is quite possible to misunderstand a Bill of this kind.  I feel I have gone at least half way to meet Deputies who feel that these licence fees have been excessively increased and I would like to feel I had the whole of the House behind me in the proposed concessions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was present last Sunday at an annual gathering of Bráithre na Coirbe, the Corrib Brotherhood, who put a certain point of view to me.  I did not have an opportunity of putting it personally to the Minister or by letter and as this is the first opportunity that has arisen the Minister will pardon a Parliamentary Secretary for making representations in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various points have been dealt with by different speakers and it is hardly <Col N="87" /> necessary for me to stress the main point, namely, that local anglers are constrained by the tightness of their purse to local waters and that the concessions of a comprehensive licence could really be availed of only by tourists coming from abroad who know of the high reputation of our angling waters.  I promised Bráithre na Coirbe that I would put that point of view to the Minister and I am doing it now. He has gone a certain way to meet that point.  His offer to give a £3 licence confined to local waters meets it in some way.  I wonder would the Minister, between now and the Final Stages of the Bill, try to work out some slight modification of the restriction of that £3 licence.  Perhaps he might be able to consider including, say, more than one district.  It is possible that a man from Galway might take a holiday in the neighbouring county of Mayo where he might have friends and where there is no necessity to pay, say, hotel charges.</P>
    <P>Another consideration is that the Corrib anglers have the largest expanse of fishing in the country to look after and develop and they have co-operated very much with the Minister's Department in that respect.  At the present time drainage works are taking place in the lower stretches of the Corrib. That has interfered for the past two years and will for the next few years to come with the chances of getting any value at all from a salmon licence, and adds edge to the representations they have asked me to make.</P>
    <P>I should like now to advert to the general principle in relation to discrimination in arranging these licences.  I suggest that if there is any discrimination the Minister should exercise it in favour of Irish anglers. The discrimination prior to the suggested change which he has now announced was in favour of the stranger, the man who would in any event be travelling all round the country.  He got the advantage out of the comprehensive licence whereas the local man could not avail of it.  If the tourist industry is the great advantage which we all know it is, it is hardly necessary to water down a charge like <Col N="88" /> the cost of a licence to fish in order to entice the tourist in.  I do not think that the tourist from outside the country will make a decision to come to Ireland because the angling licence is 10/- less than it was formerly.  If we apply the attitude of others in dealing with ourselves, the boot should be on the other foot.  We have to pay more for steel and coal for our industries to British producers, although I understand that we are one of their most important customers.</P>
    <P>If that principle can be operated in respect of industries such as steel, and the industries in which coal is used, surely we are entitled to get a little more out of our administration of angling fees from those who come in to enjoy what we have to offer in the way of scenery and fishing?  The discrimination should be against those from outside and in favour of our own local anglers.  I am quite certain none of these anglers would begrudge paying a little extra over and above what our own anglers have to pay.  If it was pointed out to them that the arrangement was made in that way most of them would say: &ldquo;That is as it should be.  They are your own waters and surely you are entitled to get a little more money from strangers.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to make certain amendments in the law relating to the administration of the estates of deceased persons with a view to clearing the way for a more comprehensive measure of reform in this branch of the law which is at present under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>Of these amendments, the principal one is that which provides for the devolution of all real estates in the same way, that is to say, on the executor or administrator of the deceased.  Under the law as it stands, real estate, other than freehold registered land, does not devolve on the personal representative but passes directly to the heir-at-law or to the person to whom it has been devised.</P>
      <P>The greater part of the real estate in the country already devolves on the personal representative as it consists of registered land purchased under the Land Purchase Acts, which is treated as personal property for the purposes of devolution.  It is chiefly in towns that there is to be found unregistered freehold land though there is a small quantity of such property elsewhere. In any case, the present differentiation in treatment is an anomaly which cannot be justified and the Bill proposes to put an end to it.  Admittedly, the recognition of an heir-at-law and the privileged position of the eldest son are even greater anomalies but they are more complicated matters which can best be left over for consideration in connection with the more comprenhensive Bill to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other proposals in the Bill consist of amendments of the law of a more or less technical character.  For this reason, there has been circulated with the Bill an explanatory memorandum which goes into the proposals <Col N="93" /> in detail.  The Bill contains explanatory sidenotes showing whether a particular provision involves a change in the law or is merely a provision consolidating existing statutory enactments. And a legend as to the abbreviations used in these sidenotes will be found on page 1 of the text of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is really a Committee Stage Bill and I do not think that the House would wish me to take up its time by going over the ground that is covered in the explanatory memorandum and repeating what is said therein in a different form of words.  The Bill is a non-Party measure and I hope the House will see its way to give it a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this is, to a very large extent, indeed to an overwhelming extent, a Committee Stage Bill.  In fact, I propose to-day to confine myself to remarks on one aspect of it, an aspect on which the Minister touched, but no more than touched.  I frankly confess I do not understand why the provisions of this Bill in relation to real estate have been limited to what I may describe as the technical process of devolution.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that in relation to real estate it will devolve just as personal estate or as chattel real estate.  So much to the good, but it seems to me illogical to do that in this Bill and at the same time not to tackle the problem of the beneficial interest in that real estate.  I would have preferred that the Bill did not even pass the technical devolution of real estate to the executor now and had deferred that until the more comprehensive Bill of which the Minister speaks, rather than that the technical aspect should be dealt with now leaving over the beneficial aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these days I do not think there is any case&mdash;certainly in the country&mdash;to retain the principle of heirship-at-law. Too often one sees in the country a small piece of land that is freehold and attached to it a piece of land that has been bought out under the Land Acts. It occasionally arises, through the machinations of the Land Commission, <Col N="94" /> that they make an enlargement to a parent, freehold holding.  In such a case, whether it is used as part of the same farm, sometimes part of the same field, the freehold portion of the land and the portion of land bought out under the Land Acts go on an intestacy to different people and that causes quite unnecessary trouble.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the provision that arises in respect of voluntary registration under the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act, 1891.  Such a voluntary registration does not mean that the land registered passes as personality, but it continues to pass as realty.  We have also the cases that arose some years ago where land that had been bought from the Land Commission as realty before vesting was declared also to be realty in the hands of the allottees put on it by the Land Commission before they would come under the 1891 Act.  It seems to me that it would be desirable to ensure that all the lands in Ireland&mdash;and by the word &ldquo;lands&rdquo; one includes the word &ldquo;houses&rdquo;&mdash;should pass beneficially in the same way on the death of an owner if that owner had not made a will.</P>
    <P>I hope that it will be possible for the Minister to indicate that he will not wait for a more comprehensive measure to provide that.  He could do so now in Part II of this Bill.  I am completely unable to understand what case can be made for the introduction of Part II before the introduction of a comprehensive measure unless, of course, the Minister has already set his face against making the devolution of real estate the same as that of chattel real property, and I doubt very much if he has.</P>
    <P>This is not a question of Party politics in any way.  The bones of this Bill have been on the stocks for a considerable time; they were there in my time and I know that certain of my colleagues, as well as myself, expressed views from time to time that it would be desirable not to change the beneficial ownership as well.  I should like the Minister to indicate whether he obtained views that can be published on this Bill from the bodies that would be concerned with it once it has been <Col N="95" /> enacted&mdash;the Bar Council, the Incorporated Law Society and so forth.</P>
    <P>If the Bill has been issued without consultation with those bodies in its existing form then I would ask the Minister to have a very protracted period between now and the Committee Stage so as to enable adequate time for consideration to be given to the Bill, not merely by the bodies I have mentioned but also by the general members of the legal profession, barristers and solicitors.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we can discuss various details more accurately on the Committee Stage but with a view to having my mind cleared before that stage, if the Minister is able to answer this question I should like him to do so: is it clear that Section 6, sub-section (1), (b), (ii) has not got the effect of barring the entail?  I think it has only the effect of saying that the property vests in the executor and that the subsequent claimant entail can claim that property from the executor beneficial.  If I am wrong in that, and if the Minister wishes to bar the entail in this way, I suggest it is a very untidy way of doing it.  I think I have interpreted the section correctly but it is desirable that it should be stated beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not give us any indication of when his comprehensive measure is likely to come along.  All Ministers hate to say when further legislation is likely to come but perhaps, as well as dealing with the one feature to which I have referred, the Minister would tell us what other features are under examination for that comprehensive measure.  By giving us such indication we might be able to judge when it is likely he will be able to come to the House with the comprehensive measure.  If the Long Title permits it I would suggest very strongly that between now and the Committee Stage the Minister should change Part II in such a way that the beneficial interest will follow the technical devolution to the executor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather chary about talking on a Bill such as this, as it deals with an extremely complicated <Col N="96" /> matter and it is rather difficult for the average layman to understand.  This Bill seems to be a copperfastening sort of measure, to make it easier for the State to get taxes out of those who are liable to pay them.  It also seems to be one of those pieces of legislation to bring us into line with British legislation. Whenever the British introduce new legislation, it has been the invariable custom here to follow it closely.</P>
      <P>The principal reason I rise to speak is that, as a mere layman, I have always felt that death duties are an imposition on the public, although it is the estates which pay them, and they do not redound to the benefit of the country as a whole.  When the Minister is introducing legislation such as this, dealing with estates, it leads to a lot of preparation and concentration, at considerable expense to the State; and it seems a pity that, if there is to be further legislation&mdash;and, unfortunately, I missed the Minister's opening speech&mdash;there is no reference to any change with regard to death duties.  We are not a very big country and we are not overburdened with wealth, so our aim is to encourage people who have money to spend to come and live in Ireland.  That is what we want.  I cannot help feeling that were we to amend the death duties, it would be a considerable incentive to people to come and settle here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am personally conversant with cases in many different walks of life, in which considerable hardship&mdash;and, I may add, considerable unemployment &mdash;has been caused by the iniquitous system of death duties.  I do not know who was responsible originally for thinking of death duties, but I suppose that in the dim and distant past some brainy politician or administrator thought of them as being an easy way of raising taxation.  When a man is dead he cannot protest and it seemed an easy way of getting money for the benefit of the people as a whole.  That has proved to be entirely wrong.  In the case of a big business combine&mdash; and the tendency in the modern world is for businesses to become bigger and bigger&mdash;when the owner or principal director dies and half his estate is <Col N="97" /> seized by the State for the death duties, his business is unable to continue as heretofore and there is considerable unemployment.  I think we have reached the stage in modern thought when everybody is beginning to realise that.</P>
    <P>Added to that, there is the fact that there is no great incentive to the people who can save, to save when they feel that when their time comes and they pass along it will be pinched by the State.</P>

It says that the law is being amended to provide that an administration bond shall include provisions for the payment of death duties, income-tax and surtax.  What could be plainer than that?  The object of this Bill is to enable the Department of State to recover death duties more efficiently than they did before and therefore I maintain I am entitled to talk about it.  If you rule that death duties do not come into this, perhaps the Bill means that no one will be asked to pay them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question of death duties, Section 9 says, in effect, that nothing in this part of the Bill shall affect any duty payable in respect of real estate or impose any additional duties thereon.  It seems to me that, as Deputy Esmonde said, the reason for bringing this forward may very well be a consideration in the collection of death duties and that is a fair point enough from the point of view of the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>There is also the point which Deputy Sweetman made; and I think it is the kernel of the thing.  This Bill deals with the mechanism of devolution and does not touch what happens the property itself.  It seeks to keep the old story there and still modify it.  I notice that in the White Paper there is a phrase that the amount of non-registered land that would go to the heir in the country is small.  I do not know whether it is small enough not to matter.  Perhaps Deputy Sweetman could say how far the problem in regard to the heir-at-law is a practical problem.  I gather that Deputy Sweetman, from his experience, feels that it is of sufficient interest to warrant the introduction of a Bill of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In my small practice, I have three cases going through at present where it is a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="99" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I can certainly see that in the cases such as Deputy Sweetman mentioned, where there is a freehold which would devolve on the heir, that is, ordinary freehold and a statutory equivalent in the form of registered land, where the land is parcelled up and moving towards the beneficiaries in two different ways, it is very hard to argue that that situation should not be adjusted.  If we are not prepared to defend the proposition that the heir-at-law should inherit as heretore and if we are prepared to go as far as we do in this Bill, I am inclined to reiterate the question as to whether the whole thing should not be dealt with in one neat sweep.  If we merely change the mechanism and still leave the old complications, I am afraid we may solve one problem at the expense of bringing in others.  Reading the Bill itself will be, as one of the speakers said, a question for Committee Stage, but the White Paper in this case serves a very useful purpose because, by taking it in conjunction with the Bill, it will sometimes raise the problem more clearly than the Bill itself.</P>
      <P>One thing strikes me on looking at the White Paper.  We read in the intention, as submitted by the Minister in his White Paper, that he proposes that a person's real estate should be administered in the same way as personal estate and be subject to the same liabilities for debts, costs and expenses, but the order shall not be changed. Later on, when dealing with paragraph 9, there is an implication that the intention is not to change the mechanisms.  I ask at this stage&mdash;I know it is a matter for the Committee Stage but I throw out the suggestion now&mdash;whether we might examine it much more closely?  I agree that if you go into this Bill in detail, you may get into contradictions, for the reason that you are not fundamentally removing the difference between registered land and freehold land which would descend to the heir.  That distinction still remains there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal of case law and, indeed, statute law in the form of the Statute of Limitations and other enactments.  One might get involved. <Col N="100" /> We need not go into all the possibilities.  We should ask ourselves whether we are simplifying the situation or giving cause for further litigation. Are we not complicating the situation at this stage?  Admittedly, where small problems arise, you will get the intention worked out very often, but if anything substantial arises, that is what makes law.  I still have the feeling that if we leave the anomaly there, that registered land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I mean Land Commission land.  In that case, you could have a parcel of land that, for all practical purposes, would be one wholly up to the death of the proprietor.  It is very probable that in that case the intention, and also the natural sequence of facts would be such as to indicate a single, simple devolution, but if that owner died intestate you would then have by force of subsequent law, quite apart from administration or anything else, a partition.  That would be the net effect.  Would I be right?</P>

      <P>There again you go into more complications, the &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and the &ldquo;buts.&rdquo;  These are the things that will make the case.  Take the simple case that I have tried to indicate.  You do not solve anything.  The fact that it all comes in to the one executor does not seem to have any great advantage, except from the point of view of people collecting testamentary debts and expenses.  Except from the point of view of death duties, it does not seem to be of very great advantage to do it this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister, therefore, between now and the time when the Bill is ready for Committee Stage, consider that possibility and whether it would not be advisable to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to cover that <Col N="101" /> point?  I know off-hand that it is rather a frightening thing to consider changing the law to that extent, but, in practice, it will be found that the interests of the heir-at-law have remained simple and uncomplicated.  In fact, it has been so clear that all the amendments and changes to get outside it have left the law itself essentially simple in regard to the heir-at-law. I may be wrong.  If that is the case and if it were decided that a proper State policy would be to change the law in regard to the contingent interest of any heirs-at-law to the situation which rules in regard to registered land or&mdash;to put it this way&mdash;put freehold on the same basis as any other kind of property, perhaps the neatest and quickest way of doing that would be in this Bill.  If we thought that desirable, the job would not be such a difficult one after all and it would not necessarily entail further extensive legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not know what kind of Bill the Minister envisages as a more comprehensive measure at a later stage.  What is this Bill to embrace?  The problem of the heir-at-law could be dealt with in a simple Bill which could not be classified as an extensive measure.  It could be taken as part of an extensive reorganisation of the law in other Departments.  This item stands so isolated as to enable it to be taken into this Bill.  Could we at this stage inquire from the Minister whether amendments in that sense would be in order on Committee Stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question?  At page 2, second paragraph, of the White Paper, it says that the duty is now to be payable by the executor.  Is it clear that the duty in respect of real property will be paid by the executor out of the real estate and not out of the personal estate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

      <P>Generally speaking, this is an initial effort to meet with the demand that has been made from time to time from all sides of the House to bring about a reform of the law and this is only a first attempt at that. It is, so to speak, something in the nature of a step forward.  We have got to creep before we start to run. When the comprehensive Bill is being dealt with&mdash;it is on the stocks at the present moment&mdash;the whole law of intestacy may be discussed.  Deputy Sweetman asked me when that Bill would be ready.  I cannot say definitely when it will be ready.  I do not like mentioning a specific date but it is possible that we may be able to bring it before the House before the end of the year.  I should not like to go any farther than that.  I may perhaps be a bit optimistic but I can assure the Deputy that the Bill is under active consideration.  It is being examined by the people who are dealing with the matter and I know that from time to time there have been discussions on the proposed provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill before the House we are not tackling the question of the descent of real estate in intestacy, but that problem will be covered in the larger Bill.  The present Bill will give the Probate Office and the district probate registries time to alter the existing practice as to the grant of probates and administrations so that everything will be in order when the comprehensive Bill is enacted.  I agree that the institution of the heir-at-law is out of date and that all property should pass in the same way but there <Col N="103" /> are a number of other problems in connection with intestacy that have to be solved in the comprehensive Bill.  As I said, this latter Bill should be available about the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (1) (b) (ii) is not designed to bar an entail.  I think Deputy Sweetman made a query about that particular point.  Between now and the Committee Stage I shall examine the point the Deputy made to see if the provision requires clarification.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question Deputy Dr. Esmonde raised about death duties, the law of death duties is a matter for the Minister for Finance and we are not, in fact, dealing with it in this Bill at all.  It is true to say that there are references to death duties in the Bill but the law is not being altered. Alleviating the burden of death duties might bring several people of property here though it is problematical whether it would or not.</P>

The technical matters raised in the course of the discussion will be examined and they can, if necessary, be covered on the Committee Stage.  However, I doubt if in the present Bill we should go much farther than we have gone.</P>

    <P>The income of the Social Insurance Fund is estimated at £6,454,000, consisting of £5,886,000 from employment contributions and £568,000 in income from investments of the fund.</P>
    <P>The difference between the expenditure of £10,665,000 and the income of £6,454,000, that is £4,211,000, is the amount that has to be made good by the Exchequer in respect of the deficit on the working of the fund for 1958-59. To this sum is added an adjustment of £2,000 due by the Exchequer in respect of late payments under the former national health insurance scheme. This brings the total to be provided in 1958-59, in accordance with Section 39 (9) of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, to £4,213,000, which is the amount of sub-head A of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>The State subvention to the Social Insurance Fund of £4,213,000 for 1958-59 is £274,000 lower than the corresponding provision for 1957-58.  This is mainly due to an anticipated decrease of £190,000 in benefit expenditure and to an anticipated increase of £100,000 in contribution income.  The main variations giving rise to the net decrease of £190,000 in benefit expenditure are reductions of £150,000 and £117,000 in unemployment benefit and disability benefit respectively, offset by an increase of £69,000 in the provision for widows' and orphans' contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>Both the reduction in the provision for unemployment benefit and the increase in the provision for contribution income are based on the expectation of an improved employment situation in 1958-59.  The provision for disability benefit for 1957-58 was inflated by about £120,000 as a result of the influenza epidemic last year.  It is not <Col N="107" /> considered necessary to make provision for expenditure of a similar nature in the current financial year. The increase in the provision for widows' and orphans' contributory pensions is due to the normal increase in the number of pensions in operation.</P>
    <P>As regards social assistance, the Estimate of £20,561,000 is £1,000 lower than the corresponding provision (including Supplementary Estimate) for the previous year.  The reduction of £1,000 is the net result of increases and decreases in the provisions for the various assistance services.</P>
    <P>The main increase is one of £275,000 under the children's allowances sub-head. This increase is principally attributable to the provision for a full year instead of ten and a half months of the increased rates of allowances which became effective last May and, to a lesser extent, to an upward trend in the number of children in respect of whom allowances are payable.</P>
    <P>Decreases of £140,000 and £101,000 are shown in the provisions for old age pensions and unemployment assistance respectively.  It is expected that the average numbers of old age pensioners during 1958-59 will be somewhat less than in the previous year, with a consequent reduction in expenditure under this head, which last year was estimated at £10,540,000.  The decrease of £101,000 in the Estimate for unemployment assistance is due to an anticipated reduction in the numbers applying for assistance during the current year.</P>
    <P>One other decrease which I should mention is a reduction of £17,000 in the provision for welfare of the blind. This is principally due to the fact that the provision for 1957-58 included a special grant of £15,000, payable in that year only, towards the initial working capital of the Board for the Employment of the Blind which was set up in April, 1957.</P>

      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary said, this is quite a formidable sum of money.  Of course, it is true that it embraces three different Votes, but over all it means that, for what people generally classify as social <Col N="108" /> welfare, this House is asked to provide the sum of £25,250,000.  Recently, and even from some of the members of the Government, we have been getting the impression from some sources that so much of this money is wasted, there is a case for cutting down on social welfare.  In recent years, we have had various accusations and generalisations about fraud in what is generally termed social welfare, even though it embraces social insurance and social assistance.  The impression amongst certain people that everybody receiving money from any of these three Votes is a rogue or a robber should be knocked on the head.  The persons who can knock it on the head are the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>We spoke from these benches before about that type of allegation and we pointed out that if there were frauds &mdash;isolated cases&mdash;there were also isolated cases of fraud in respect of grants given or received through other Departments, through the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Local Government.  I do not at all concede that there is any widespread abuse of social welfare which many people allege there is. These allegations come from people who do not want to pay anything by way of taxes or rates to help people who can ill afford to keep themselves and their families from week to week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance spoke here last week in reply to the Budget debate, he challenged the Labour Party that they had not voted willingly for the moneys which he alleged he provided to increase social welfare benefits. It is true, of course, that social welfare benefits were increased by one shilling, or up to two, three and four shillings where there were big families.  The Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party, however, have given the impression that out of the food subsidy money saved last year, approximately £2,000,000 has been devoted to social welfare, social insurance and social assistance.  Such is not the case at all. The Fianna Fáil Government saved that £2,000,000.  At least, if they did not save it, it was not devoted as a <Col N="109" /> sum of money to the Vote for Social Insurance and Social Assistance because the figures the Minister has read out, as compared with the figures for last year in the Book of Estimates, show there is an amount of £289,900 less provided for these three social welfare Votes this year.  I wonder why.</P>
    <P>I know that, in framing this type of Estimate, it is extremely difficult to estimate accurately, especially for such Votes as social insurance.  We know that, in theory, there is a legal obligation on the Minister for Social Welfare to pay out certain benefits, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit and allowances to widows and orphans.  We know that if there is a big wave of unemployment, as we experienced in the last few years, or if there is a sickness epidemic, the Estimate, of necessity, will be far out.  I believe that happened in the last year or two, but I believe there is a legal obligation on the Minister to make certain payments to people who are sick or unemployed. I suggest, however, that in an effort to keep within the Estimate other methods have been devised, other methods are in use and are practised to ensure that, under certain heads, the Estimate will not be over-expended.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made a speech some six or nine months ago which got wide publicity, part of which speech he afterwards corrected.  He spoke about frauds and abuse in respect of unemployment benefit.  That, in my opinion, gave a lot of people the excuse to cry &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; and &ldquo;robber&rdquo;, where such was not the case.  I wonder if that speech by the Parliamentary Secretary, and speeches like it from other people outside the House, have built up the situation wherein the majority of the men applying for unemployment benefit are now suspect. As far as my experience has gone, over the past six or 12 months, an unusual number of cases have been held up and are being treated with suspicion.  I know there is suspected fraud and proven fraud in some cases, but I do not believe there should be a generalisation, and I do not believe that an unusual number of cases should be regarded as suspect and held up for weeks on end to the detriment&mdash;and <Col N="110" /> should I say it?&mdash;to the loss of the persons making the claims.  If a claim is pending for three, five and even six weeks, we do not find the local authority very charitable to men who claim unemployment benefit and sickness benefit.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Parliamentary Secretary can do to remedy this, unless he suggests to the deciding officers that they should be prepared to make decisions on their own, and not incur unreasonable delay in sending every application, or the bulk of applications, to head office.  Sending applications to head office naturally entails delay.  Delay is inevitable if head office is cluttered up with files which necessitate decisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for home assistance.  I do not mean he is responsible for the money, but rather the administration of home assistance by the local authorities.  Certainly, local authorities are not very generous when they come to the assistance of people who are deemed, and who are known, to be destitute.  The experience of local authorities over the past few years, during which there has been so much talk about economies, is to cut down not so much on the things which can bear a cut but on such things as home assistance, or different other cash forms of assistance, administered by them.</P>
    <P>There is a decrease in this Vote, Social Insurance, under the heading of unemployment benefit.  Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister and the Government will be relieved to a certain extent if emigration continues at the same pace as last year.  If that happens, there will be a saving in the Vote for Unemployment Benefit and in the Vote for Social Assistance.  I must make some complaints in respect of sickness benefit.  It is pathetic to see people approach their local T.D.s. or local representatives, asking why they were cut off from what they call national health insurance.  Some of them have been in receipt of sickness benefit for two years and the very fact that they have received it for two years may have given some official the impression that they were malingerers.</P>
    <P>The attitude is that it is impossible <Col N="111" /> for anybody to be sick for such a length of time, impossible when the Department has to hand out money to them.  There should be a relaxation of restrictions on those who examine these sick people.  Every Deputy will agree that in some cases people have been struck off the sickness benefit list in recent months.  I know that was done in the past, but it seems to me that many more are being struck off at present.  Now, the health of the country has not improved so vastly in the past few years that we have to pay out less in sickness benefit in 1958.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there should be a switch round of examining doctors.  At the moment, a person is struck off the sickness benefit list and a medical referee is sent down.  The person is examined and deemed fit for work.  In three months, there is an appeal and the same medical referee is sent down. That happens time after time and year after year.  These medical referees should be switched round from district to district.  It is not abnormal in medical practice to have a second opinion, but, as far as the Department is concerned, a second opinion does not count.  The person's own doctor may deem him or her to be incapable of working, suffering from this, that or the other.  That is not accepted by the examining doctor sent down by the Department.</P>
    <P>Are we trying to save money on this to the detriment and discomforture of sick people?  You may call the inter-Party Government extravagant, inasmuch as there was not that same clamp down under them.  When a Supplementary Estimate was required it was provided, and that was that.  There is a legal obligation on the taxpayers, because of legislation passed here, to pay to people who are not capable of working and who have the necessary insurance qualifications a sum determined from time to time in relation to sickness or disability benefit.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary reports, and we can see in the Book of Estimates, that old age pensions are reduced.  The reason given is: &ldquo;It is expected that the average number of <Col N="112" /> old age pensions during 1958-59 will be somewhat less than in the previous year.&rdquo;  Is that a phenomenon?  It seems to me that we should have more old age pensioners; at least, we should have more aged people.  Whether or not they are pensioners is a matter for decision by the Minister.  Despite the fact that expectancy of life has risen, and is still rising, we are told now that we will have fewer old age pensioners this year and we are saving £100,000 because of that allegation by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>According to the Parliamentary Secretary's statement, unemployment assistance has decreased by £101,000.  I should like to make a special plea to the Parliamentary Secretary in respect of certain people who should be eligible, in my opinion, for unemployment assistance.  This time last year, the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;he is now Minister for Agriculture&mdash;very rudely misinterpreted, whether deliberately or not, I do not know&mdash;the point that we endeavoured to make from these benches.  One problem with which I was confronted as Minister for Social Welfare and which I desired to see resolved was the question of the means test for self-employed people.  I refer to the salmon fisherman who works for a season.</P>
    <P>He starts in April and he becomes unemployed in September or October. By reason of the fact that he is self-employed and is deemed to have made so much money within the six months, he is automatically disqualified for unemployment assistance.  If he were working in insurable employment and even if he did not qualify for unemployment benefit, he would still be eligible for and would receive unemployment assistance, and he could be a man earning £8, £9 or £10 per week.  I know this is a problem.  It has been a problem for various Ministers over the past 25 years, but I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to have that aspect of unemployment assistance considered, because it is, in my view, an injustice to those people who, like seasonal fishermen, become unemployed and do not qualify for unemployment assistance by reason of the fact that they are self-employed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> The Minister adverted to the reduction of £17,000 in the sub-head dealing with the welfare of the blind.  Perhaps he would expand that a little further in his reply and say what progress has been made towards establishing a workshop for the blind.  Members of all Parties, especially those on the Dublin Corporation, have interested themselves deeply in this problem, especially in view of the difficulties the various associations for the blind have run into in recent years.  I know that both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are sympathetic towards the proposed new projects.  I should be very grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would say what progress, if any, has been made in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made no reference to the free fuel scheme. The amount provided for that scheme has been decreased by £17,750.  That represents a reduction of approximately 9 per cent. or 10 per cent.  Why there should be that reduction, I do not know.  Whether the price of fuel has been reduced or whether other costs have been reduced, I do not know.  There is one little problem I would ask the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to concern themselves with and that is the regulation &mdash;by whom imposed, I do not know&mdash; whereby two fuel vouchers are not given to the one householder.  That presents a problem in the City of Dublin and I know cases down the country where two people, not tied by any relationship, live in different parts of the one house.  The assistance officers have refused to give two vouchers in such cases.  We know that it is not always easy, especially for old people, to live together in the one room and sit in front of the same fire and, where there are two unrelated people occupying different parts of the same house, the assistance officer should not be reluctant to provide each with a fuel voucher.</P>
    <P>On the Estimate last year, I raised the question of the free footwear scheme.  If I make any criticism of that scheme, I do not want to give offence to anybody&mdash;the Minister, local officials, home assistance officers, <Col N="114" /> superintending assistance officers or anybody else.  The plain blunt fact is that the administration of the scheme is not satisfactory.  I suggested to the Parliamentary Secretary last year that he should ask the local authorities to name the latest date for receiving applications for vouchers for free footwear, and I think he did that.  I know that some local authorities adopted that suggestion, but I am sorry to have to admit that that was not satisfactory either.  I know it is difficult to please everybody, but there seems to be a fair amount of dissatisfaction about the distribution of these vouchers.  I have come across people who did not get vouchers and who, in my opinion, were very deserving, as against others who got the vouchers and who were not so deserving.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister has a small amount of money to distribute, about £37,500, and that he cannot do a great deal with that, but perhaps he would consult with his officials and the officials of local authorities to see what method could be devised to ensure that the most necessitous children get vouchers.  It is a very difficult problem. In the position which he now holds, with the advice of his officials and the local authorities, he may be able to devise a better scheme.</P>
    <P>A sum of £25,250,000 is a formidable amount of money, but, in my opinion, every penny of it is well spent.  It is given to people who spend the money in this country.  It is not money that goes abroad; it is not money that goes to purchase a lot of&mdash;if any&mdash;foreign-made articles, clothing or food.  It represents a circulation of money given by the taxpayers and ratepayers to help unfortunate people who cannot fend for themselves and, generally, it is money well spent.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning of my speech, if there are frauds, there are not widespread frauds in social welfare schemes or in schemes administered by any other Department.  My only grouse is that in respect of many of these benefits, such as old age pensions, unemployment assistance, widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions and <Col N="115" /> blind pensions, there is not more money provided in the Vote for Social Assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though the total of the three Votes £25,262,600, shows a reduction of £280,900 on the Estimate for 1957-58, it is a colossal figure.  It is almost one-fourth of the total sum required for the various services administered by all State Departments. While the cost of administration may be regarded as being high, it must be remembered that there is a sum of £25,000,000 to be dealt with and that thousands of cases must be investigated individually.  I do not suppose that the cost of administration could be reduced to any greater extent than it has been reduced this year.  It is well to see that there are 27 fewer posts. As time goes on, I take it that officers of the Department who retire on pension or on marriage and so forth, will not be replaced until there has been a considerable reduction in staff but that, at the same time, the efficiency of the Department will be fully maintained.</P>
      <P>There is a reduction of £140,000 in the sum allocated for old age pensions. The Parliamentary Secretary has given the reason for that.  I do not know how he has calculated it, but I take it that the Department has gone into the matter very minutely and that that reduction can be taken as being genuine.</P>
      <P>The vexed question of old age pensions is spoken of at various times by Deputies and people throughout the country.  It is a very popular thing to demand an increase in old age pensions, blind pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions.  It would be a very good electioneering point to promise to increase these pensions, but people should seriously consider what an increase of 2/6 in old age pensions would cost.  It would be in the neighbourhood of £1,000,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>People must accept their responsibilities.  If increases are given in social services, it means extra taxation on drink, cigarettes, petrol and so on.  Old age pensioners and <Col N="116" /> persons in receipt of social benefits should remember that if they get an increase of 2/6 per week, they would lose in other ways, in buying a few drinks or tobacco.  Our social services compare very favourably with the social services in any other country that we know of, and we can claim that they are better in many cases.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy knows that there are many special cases where an old age pensioner or blind pensioner may have no means but the pension.  That applies also to certain widows and orphans. Some means should be devised whereby such persons could get something over and above the amounts given to persons living in their own homes who have members of the family or relatives to help them.  In the cities and towns especially, there are such very needy cases.  I know that there would be a difficulty in doing that.  I am not sure if the local authority in such cases can provide extra benefits.  That perhaps would be the only way in which something extra could be given, because the home assistance officers could investigate means and make the necessary recommendations.  People should be very slow to ask for any increases in the social services as at present fixed, unless they are prepared to accept higher taxation, and saturation point has been reached in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the unemployed and unemployment assistance, we have often heard people state that perhaps a quarter of those on the register as unemployed would be unemployable and nobody would give them work.  I do not know how far that is true, but certainly there must be a fairly large number.  If they are unemployable or incapable of work they must get some benefits and the benefits that such people receive by way of unemployment assistance are not sufficient to keep body and soul together.  However, there are, I am sure, a number of people in receipt of unemployment assistance who are not really deserving of it.  People who are pretty well off have been knows to draw unemployment assistance, commonly called the dole.  That may be regarded as one of the frauds referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary and, if such frauds <Col N="117" /> exist, it is only right that these cases should be not strictly examined.  If such people were not drawing benefits of that kind to which they are not legally entitled, there would perhaps be such a sum left over as could be devoted to increasing the benefits for those who are genuinely unemployed and genuinely looking for work.  If anybody is entitled to generous benefits, it is those who, through no fault of their own, cannot find employment in this country and who are genuinely seeking it.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Corish stated, a vast sum of money is being provided under this Vote, but I am sure it is all quite necessary.  Even if there are some people receiving benefits to which they are not entitled under the three sections of this Vote, I am sure the amount would not be very much when compared with the total of over £25,000,000.  Still it is only right that the Department should so carry out the administration that there will be no frauds.  Let us hope that when the financial situation allows, this House will make even better provision for those who are entitled to those benefits.</P>
    <P>Increases have been given during the past eight or ten years, but they are not at all sufficient to keep up with the increase in the cost of living.  I suppose we have to understand that the benefits given through these social services were never meant to enable people to live in any kind of comfort, but only as a help.  Even at that, let us hope that at some future time we shall be in the happy position of being able to increase the benefits to those who deserve them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickPGogan" hpid="Mr. Gogan Mr. Gogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one occassion on which we can congratulate the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and also the ex-Minister on the improvement that has been effected in the administration of the Department during the past couple of years.  There is little or no delay now in the investigation of claims for old age pensions or qualification certificates.  The payments of national health and unemployment insurance are made promptly and inquiries to the Department are dealt with with every degree of courtesy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> Two years ago when this Estimate was before the House, I raised the question of the recruitment of home assistance officers.  The Minister at the time, Deputy Corish, was quite sympathetic to the views I expressed on that occasion and I hope to get the sympathetic ear of the Minister now. The time has long passed when the methods of recruitment should be changed.  We have set up in our universities courses of study in social science and we have qualified for these diplomas emigrating and taking up remunerative posts in England and the Colonies.</P>
    <P>The post of home assistance officer is one that requires a specialised knowledge of social welfare and the Health Acts and, more than anything else, a fund of sympathy and tact.  I hope the Minister will in his replay give us some form of assurance that in the near future such appointments will be made by the Local appointments commission rather than by those selection committees of the boards of health or boards of assistance.</P>
    <P>I should like to take the opportunity of drawing attention to some administrative difficulties which have arisen in the City of Dublin under the 1929 Public Assistance Act.  When the Act was brought into force, the regulations that were framed were framed to cover the needs of the whole country.  For years, those regulations, as far as Dublin was concerned, were more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  They prescribed the conditions under which home assistance should be administered and issued, that assistance should not be issued to an able-bodied persons for a period of more than four weeks and to any sick or disable person for more than three months.</P>
    <P>Those regulations were left in abeyance by the boards of assistance up to recently, but I understand that they are being put into force again. The public assistance authority in Dublin, I understand, has made many requests to the Department for a revision of the regulations without any satisfaction and I would urge on the Minister that it should not be left on the long finger any further.  For years, <Col N="119" /> it has been admitted that a person who was disabled and unable to support himself, but who was living with relatives who supported him was eligible for home assistance under Section 18 of the Public Assistance Act. I regret that lately there has been a tendency to discharge from home assistance that type of case and to throw the complete onus of supporting such a person on relatives who should not have to do so.  I would ask the Minister to give some ruling or instruction to the authorities as to what exactly is the definition of a poor person under Section 18 of the Act.</P>
    <P>There is another problem which none of the Ministers for Social Welfare has tackled.  That is the question of a person who is 60 years old, or ever, and who is no longer able to work, but who still continues to draw unemployment assistance.  I know of a typical case of a man who has been certified as suffering from chronic bronchitis and myocardities and who still draws his 19/- unemployment assistance.  By no stretch of imagination can you imagine such a man being available for work. Might I suggest to the Minister that the regulations might be framed to enable that man to continue to draw his unemployment assistance, until such time as he is transferred to the disability allowances group?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to pay tribute to the geriatric section of the Irish Red Cross for the work they have done to alleviate the position of old age pensioners in Dublin, by organising parties, concerts and outings.  The Minister should make some contribution to that section of the Red Cross to enable them to carry on their good work.  I trust that as the Minister is able to tell us here now that there has been a saving on old age pensions, the position will be kept under constant review and if there is any opportunity, even during the year, of increasing old age pensions, it will be done at the first opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to hold up the House for very long, but I feel constrained to say that from some of the statements which are made from time to time by Deputies and by people <Col N="120" /> outside the House, one would think that social welfare benefits of every description were a necessary evil, were benefits that the State should face up to paying only when there was no other way out.  The idea created by statements by Deputies, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries to that effect, is that people who are drawing social welfare benefits of any description are in the nature of some kind of parasites and are battering on the community generally.</P>
      <P>The atmosphere has been created in which very many people forget the fact that a large proportion of our people who draw social welfare benefits are contributors towards that scheme. They forget that the word &ldquo;insurance&rdquo; comes into it and that the whole cost of paying unemployment benefit and disablement benefit does not fall on the Exchequer solely, does not fall solely on the taxpayer.  Both the employer and the employed person have to pay contributions towards that funds and they have, in fact, insured themselves against the ordinary hazards of illness and unemployment.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to bring our minds back on to the rails in that connection and to get rid of this false impression which is being fostered, apparently, in many places that the taxpayer has to finance the whole scheme of things from start to finish.  It will be readily agreed that in so far as organised workers have, from time to time, advocated an increase in social welfare benefits they have said on many occasions that they are prepared to pay the increased cost. Nobody should endeavour to create the impression, as one previous speaker did, that people were shouting for more, so long as they could get somebody else to pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, since he has assumed office, has not been helpful in this respect.  He gives the impression from his public utterances that he is obsessed with this idea that there is wholesale malingering, wholesale fraud and wholesale irregularities in the matter of claims for benefits of one kind or another.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the Parliamentary Secretary deliberately set out on a campaign with that idea in view, but <Col N="121" /> he does appear to have become obsessed with that idea, if we are to judge from the number of occasions on which he referred to it and the manner in which he has referred to it.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any Deputy who would not give the Parliamentary Secretary, or the Minister, every possible assistance in eradicating any fraud or any false claims.  We would all be at one in such a campaign, but I do think the Parliamentary Secretary has overstepped in this connection and has again created that atmosphere whereby people, even genuine claimants for one type of benefit or another have apparently been branded as at least suspect.  A claimant is regarded with suspicion the moment he goes in to claim the benefit to which he is entitled and for which he insures himself.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to have a look at the situation again and see if he has not done more harm than good in the campaign he has pursued since assuming office.</P>
    <P>A point which I made in previous years and which I will repeat now is that there is still too much centralisation in the administration of the Department. I readily agree that it would not be possible in small centres to deal with all aspects of insured persons' claims and thereby do away with the delays we sometimes experience.  I suggest that in large centres like Cork, Limerick and Waterford, and the bigger centres generally, more authority could be given to the local office of the Department and that claims should be handled almost <i>in toto</i> in these centres.  I cannot see why claims from a large area where you have so many insured persons, such as Cork, must be shuttled up to Dublin for consideration with consequent, and in many cases quite unnecessary, even if sometimes unavoidable, delays.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there are very grave difficulties in this but I think that, if there was a will to tackle the problem, some advance could be made.  We are not advocating wholesale change overnight but we should aim at decentralising the administrative end of the Department and endeavour to give provincial centres greater autonomy to the benefit of insured persons <Col N="122" /> and, I suggest, eventually, to the benefit of the Department and the taxpayers, if costs can be reduced in that way.</P>
    <P>I have some complaints to make regarding delays in the payment of disability benefit but I must say they are not very widespread in my area.  It appears they cannot be regarded, however, as isolated cases in which there was certainly undue delay.  From inquiries I have made, I have convinced myself that the delay was in no way attributable to the local offices.  I inquired about a particular case at one period where people claiming disability benefit were waiting for six weeks before they received the first payment.</P>
    <P>The thing that mystifies me about this was that when I eventually asked the Parliamentary Secretary the cause of the delay&mdash;and I did not make any inquiry until the first payment had been made, the six weeks had elapsed and everything was righted because I wanted to assist the Parliamentary Secretary in pinpointing this sort of thing&mdash;it took the Parliamentary Secretary four weeks more to reply to me. After taking four weeks to investigate the matter he came back with a reply such as: &ldquo;Certain inquiries were necessary.&rdquo; I knew that must be the case if it took six weeks, but the object of my question was to ascertain the real cause of the delay.  The reply I got in another case was that there was difficulty in tracing the insurance number.  Five weeks to trace an insurance number and three weeks for the Parliamentary Secretary to find out that that was the cause of the delay!</P>
    <P>Eventually I had to put down a Parliamentary Question in an effort to get some satisfaction.  I did not enjoy doing that and certainly I did not do it to embarrass the Minister or anybody else but I suggest that while delays, so far as my area is concerned, are not widespread and while I feel that the local offices act as one would expect them to act, there are still delays in very many cases which I regard as unreasonable and which could be avoided if we had further examination and tightening up of the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to <Col N="123" /> congratulate the Minister and his predecessor on the general improvement that has taken place in the past few years in our social service code and particularly on the increased efficiency achieved in the Minister's Department in Dublin and in the various branches offices in the country in handling the matters that come within the scope of the Department. That is very satisfactory and we welcome it from the point of view of public relations.</P>
      <P>I have noticed that the Minister very wisely suggested that the House should allow him to take the three Votes together, Votes 61, 62 and 63.  That arrangement simplifies the general discussion that may take place on the Estimate, which deals mainly with the Social Welfare Act of 1952 and any amendments that may have taken place in that Act since.  That was a very fine piece of legislation and a very comprehensive measure.  So far as the administrative machinery was concerned it repealed all the former Acts covering unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, national health benefit, old age pensions and all other benefits under the social code.  To a great extent it simplified the legislation and amalgamated the various Acts more or less into one.  I am sure it also simplified the administration of the Acts.</P>
      <P>A noticeable feature of the Act in question was that the number of contributions necessary for an insured person to qualify for benefit was reduced to a minimum of 26.  That was a definite advance in social legislation and I am sure everybody associated with it felt very happy that the Minister was able to limit the qualifying contributions to that figure.  Unfortunnately, it has gone a little bit in the opposite direction since and we now find, having heard the Parliamentary Secretary's speech this evening and also having listened to him introducing certain Supplementary Votes, that he complains of widespread fraud, particularly in connection with unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and national health benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt there are good grounds for such complaints but I do not think <Col N="124" /> fraud is as widespread as the Parliamentaray Secretary believes.  One Deputy said that the Department of Social Welfare was rather obsessed with the idea of the existence of wholesale fraud.  I think that, however, would be a slight exaggeration.</P>
    <P>About three years ago the Department, in the light of its experience at the time, noted that claims for unemployment benefit particularly showed an upward trend.  It was right that the officials of the Department should investigate to find what were the special circumstances responsible for such a situation.  It would appear that during that preliminary investigations they discovered a number of people in various counties&mdash;apparently more in some than in others&mdash;were getting benefit, particularly unemployment benefit, for which they were not qalified.</P>
    <P>The main trouble evidently arose after the recipient had first exhausted the initial right to unemployment benefit. He then proceeded to qualify for continuation benefit.  One of the requirements of the Act is that he would need to have a further 13 weeks' insurable contributions to his credit before he could go back on continuation benefit in the case of unemployment benefit, and sickness benefit, or disablement benefit as it is described, in the case of national health.  The Department state that, as a result of investigation, it has come to light now that quite a a large number of people took the liberty of affixing stamps for employment that was not insurable or that did not exist.  The Department deal with those claims by refusing benefit, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>I have some personal experience of the administration of this social welfare service and I know that always there has been a suspicion that the current claims were not 100 per cent. genuine.  There was always a rather watchful eye kept on the payment of benefit, particularly by the former Unified National Health Society when they had separate control of that part of the organisation.  After some years of investigations and special inquiry into the incidence of sickness benefit claims, the situation was largely <Col N="125" /> cleaned up.  There was quite a lot of hard work put into the special investigation made at that time&mdash;about ten years ago&mdash;and certainly up to the passing of the Social Welfare Act of 1952 I would be rather surprised if the national health part of the organisation had not put their house very well in order.</P>
    <P>The 1952 Act certainly made it somewhat easier for a person who did not qualify under the old Act to come into the line of benefit.  Like all good things, which are abused, we can assume that a number of people took advantage of the situation.  I have no objection to having claims that are under suspicion investigated.  I do, however, suggest to the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary that the time spent on investigation is far too long.  I mean that the time which elapses from the date the claimant lodges his claim for benefit, whether that be unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or national health benefit, until the claim is cleared is far too long.  Evidently, when the claim is listed for investigation, it is sent to the local social welfare officer, through the usual channels. As far as I can understand, these officers are more or less obliged&mdash;certainly encouraged&mdash;not to go out on a claim or two in a particular district. Evidently, they wait for a week or two, or perhaps for three weeks, until sufficient claims accumulate for the particular district.  I think the idea is to keep down travelling expenses; and that is all very well in its own way.</P>
    <P>An overriding consideration should be the financial circumstances of the particular applicant.  The people who normally claim unemployment benefit are ordinary working people.  They must be such, as otherwise they would not be eligible, since they would not have cards stamped.  When they have to go on unemployment benefit, particularly, they are on rather bare boards.  They are unemployed and quite a large percentage have no other means of support.  Probably they are mainly, if not entirely, dependent on the benefit from the stamps&mdash;to which they themselves have contributed, as well as their employers and, of course, <Col N="126" /> the State.  I seriously suggest to the Minister that some arrangement should be made whereby claims listed for special investigation would get priority and be dealt with within a few days from the time they are sent to the local officer.  If the investigation is carried out promptly, the decision follows very quickly, as a rule, and the claimant knows where he stands in a short space of time.  That would remove some of the present hardship attached to a situation of that kind.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which must be looked into sooner or later is that the officers who investigate these claims, whilst they want to be perfectly fair to the claimants, are nevertheless inclined not to give the benefit of the doubt where doubt exists.  It appears to me that the natural slant for an official in a matter of that kind is to report that there is more than a doubt.  I have seen cases where there was certainly a very strong doubt and the report given was unfavourable to the claimant.  That report goes to the central authority here, where a deciding officer deals with it and makes his decision.  The decision is then conveyed to the person concerned and he gets the right to appeal.  That right of appeal is a very treasured right of every person who is aggrieved, but I have noticed that there is also a tendency in the Department to have the appeal disposed of summarily by the appeals officer, without giving the appellant the right to go before an oral hearing at a local centre.  That is very wrong.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister very specially to look into that point.  Those affected are inclined to complain a good deal and, indeed, they are inclined to exaggerate what they term as the unfairness of the decision.  There is probably a good deal in what they say.  After all, in the normal course of events, there are appeals taking place in various provincial centres every other month and I see no reason why all those cases of appeals for special investigation should not be referred to a local and oral hearing.  At that session, the appellant could bring his witnesses and make his case as best he could. An appeals officer, no doubt, will give <Col N="127" /> the decision in the light of the facts as explained to him.  I must say that my experience is that, where there are doubts, these appeal officers seem inclined to give the benefit of doubt to the applicant.  The point I want to emphasise is that a local hearing is not only desirable but necessary to satisfy the aggrieved person that he has got every opportunity of making his case and, if possible, winning it.</P>
    <P>Another Deputy said that a certain allowance, so to speak, has to be made for the making of claims that are not quite correct.  I suppose the explanation is that employed people contribute their share to this fund, and if it appears to them that their claim is in order, they have no apology to make for lodging it.  Employers contribute and the State contributes, but I think we should at least make a certain allowance where claims, which are described as being fraudulent, are coming along and you will find it hard to credit that.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which might help partly to eliminate that practice, that is, the co-operation of all Parties.  It is the duty of all Members of this House to tell any people who come to them with representations that, if their claims are wrong, the practice is dishonest and immoral.  We should set our faces against this thing.  I feel, at the same time, that it would be wrong for Deputies to act in any way as judge and jury in this matter.  Once I find that the ordinary avenues of appeal are fully explored by an aggrieved party, I am perfectly satisfied from that forward.</P>
    <P>I have a word to say to the Minister in regard to unemployment.  A piece-meal investigation seems to have started in recent months in regard to the recipients of unemployment assistance. The first category of recipients attacked seem to be people who have not engaged in any insurable employment for years.  Naturally, one of the conditions of the payment of unemployment assistance is that the recipient has to be capable of and available for work.  It is only proper, when the local branch manager finds some person on his register has not, <Col N="128" /> in fact, committed himself to any insurable employment for a number of years, that he should queer the pitch.</P>
    <P>I find that during the course of investigations into a matter of this kind, the tendency seems to be to suspend benefit.  I found that taking place in a number of cases.  It is wrong.  Though those people have been paid benefits probably for many years, the fact that the local officers feel that the position should be checked up on now is not a good reason why benefits should be discontinued at the moment.  It is more serious to discontinue the benefit in that case than it is to discontinue benefit in the case of unemployment benefit.  After all, the people on unemployment assistance are certainly worse off as far as circumstances are concerned than people on other benefits.  The vast majority of that type of people have probably no other source, of income, good, bad or indifferent; they are trying to manage from week to week with whatever unemployment assistance they get, supplemented probably by certain help in the form of assistance they may get from their holdings if they have any, and from the neighbours, if they have not got holdings.  It is a step in the right direction, I will admit, that recipients of that nature should be questioned as to why they have not worked over a certain number of years, but there, again, no hardships should be imposed, because it is quite possible that, when the investigation into that matter concludes, the officers will be satisfied there was no case for a withdrawal of benefit.  I think we might ask the Minister to ensure that, where such investigations take place in the future, benefit will be continued.</P>
    <P>In the case of old age pensions, I notice from a return which I obtained some time ago that the percentage has gone up considerably since 1922, when the State was first formed.  Nowadays, the percentage of old age pensions as against the total population over 70 years of age seems to be up almost to 80 per cent.  One might truthfully say that 80 per cent. of the people over 70 are in receipt of old age pensions. Nevertheless, I think there are still cases of hardship.  Whilst I accept the <Col N="129" /> views given here by a previous speaker &mdash;I think the Minister referred to the matter also&mdash;regarding the cost, it would be a pity that there should be any small number of individual cases lagging behind of which we are not able to dispose.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, the then Minister introduced a concession which was undoubtedly very welcome at the time so far as landowners were concerned, whereby a holding with a poor law valuation of £30 or less could be handed over to a son or daughter, without a marriage, and the former owner would qualify so far as the holding is concerned for an old age pension.  That was a very valuable concession.  It is one which, I am sure, is appreciated.</P>
    <P>It does not extend to people in certain other occupations, small shopkeepers and business people.  If they have a concern or a business equal in income to or even less than a holding of £30 (in so far as its return is concerned) they are out, for the purposes of an old age pension.  I have come across a couple of cases where shopkeepers carrying on a small line of business, which might not make £3 per week, were unable to get the pension, whereas a farmer with a holding of a valuation under £30 was able to qualify.  There is some inconsistency there.</P>
    <P>I think a Deputy would be entitled to suggest to the Minister that he might review that matter and see what could be done to meet the requirements of that very small category of people.  The number, I would say, would be one in 1,000 of the land-owning category.</P>
    <P>There is also, in my opinion, too conservative an attitude on the part of the Department in accepting some claimants for old age pensions, if they have disposed of certain moneys.  That situation mainly arises with the land owner who gets a fortune on the disposal of his land or with the claimant who, because of hard work and thrift, has accumulated a certain amount of money prior to the disposal of the holding.  He may have a family.  The case I refer to is where money is handed over to members of the family.  The transfer is looked upon usually with a <Col N="130" /> lot of suspicion.  The ground that seems to be put forward by the Department is that the money was handed over for the purpose of qualifying the applicant for a pension.  That may be as broad as it is long.</P>
    <P>Country people, undoubtedly, when handing over their properties would be well-advised to dispose of their entire financial affairs together.  They are inclined, however, to be rather conservative in that connection.  There are, probably, other reasons for it.  It has been put up to me on many occasions that they do not like doing the whole job together.  They want to look about.  They have only a limited amount of money.  They just want to see how things will go with a view to disposing of that amount of money in the most equitable form possible to the other members of the family.  Either way, the transfer of money takes place to a member of the family.  It is quite wrong for the Department to take the attitude that it has been done to enable the claimant to be excluded from the value of that money.</P>
    <P>We all know that members of families in rural areas work many years on their parents' holding without getting anything in the line of a direct wage.  We further more know that if they happen to be lucky enough to get some allocation of money from their parents, it would be a very hard job to divert that money back again to the parents.  Quite a lot of hardship has been caused to claimants in that connection. Whilst I appreciate that the investigation officers have to be careful and probably have to be very conservative, too, in accepting statements from claimants in that connection, I think they are inclined to carry the official attitude a bit too far.  These people are entitled to the benefit of the doubt. Where there is any reasonable ground for believing that the money was transferred, it is no longer in the person's name&mdash;he cannot get it back&mdash;I do not see why it should be debited against the claimant of an old age pension.</P>
    <P>I want to make a very special appeal with regard to the insurability and also with regard to the assessment of means for outworkers, particularly fishermen. I am sure every Deputy is seriously <Col N="131" /> concerned about this question.  Probably the best contribution a Deputy can make is to deal with the aspect of the matter as it applies to his own constituency.  In my constituency, the main people affected are inland fishermen. There are a few deep-sea fishermen also.  The normal period of occupation in the inland fishing business is from April to about August.  There is no commercial interest available locally to exploit the fishing potentialities of the area and to take people into employment. The only way they can secure employment is more or less to employ themselves.</P>
    <P>A number of these people come together, select one as the head&mdash;he is called the skipper of the boat&mdash;then proceed to buy a boat or, if they have one, to repair it, or to renew one, as the case may be, take out the licence and buy the net.  In nine out of ten cases, they are not in a financial position either to take out the licence or to buy the net.  They have to depend on the help and co-operation of the local fish vendor, who usually advances the money.  From their catches, he collects each week what he is entitled to.  After paying off for the nets, contributing to the licence fee, and so on, the money is divided equally between them.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, I understand the skipper is obliged to have the members of his team covered by social insurance.  There is a special contribution rate of 3/- a week.  This is 2/6 less than the ordinary rate of contribution, but the contribution that is affixed excludes the right to the holder of the card the draw unemployment benefit when he is unable&mdash;in other words, when the fishing season is finished&mdash;to obtain employment.  The holder of this card does not qualify for unemployment benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="132" /> There is another reason why this present situation imposes undue hardship: I emphasise &ldquo;undue.&rdquo;  The people who work in that way are at a complete disadvantage when their means are being assessed for the purpose of unemployment assistance.  Evidently, they are treated the same as all outworkers, in so far as they are debited with income which, in practice, is no other than wages except that it is received in another form.  In my opinion, the greatest hardship is imposed in that direction.  I have a particular fishing centre in mind where 30 or 40 fishermen are employed: it is a tradition with them to fish as they have been doing it for centuries.  They have little or no land.  They try to carry on by going into debt for six months, thanks to the generosity of the local shopkeepers.  They work hard at the fishing trade for the next six months and pay off, sometimes not in full, the amount of debt that has accrued. Those people&mdash;particularly since the 1952 Act was passed&mdash;have been dealt with, in the matter of unemployment assistance, in a manner that is very unsatisfactory and certainly in a manner that puts them at a complete disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to refer to that point when he is replying and to say if he can hold out any hope that some amendment will be made in the existing code, whereby these people who are working in the ordinary way &mdash;I submit they are no different from a person who is employed&mdash;will receive more, satisfactory treatment.  After all, they are only making a living wage, if they are in fact making it. Their position should be considered with a view to having them assessed, so far as means are concerned, in the ordinary manner as a road-worker is assessed, for example, or, for that matter, in the manner in which a person getting £10 a week is assessed.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is very important.  However, it does not leave a sufficient margin of profit to any of those people to enable them to accumulate something for the rainy day. They are very lucky if they break even and pay some of the debt&mdash;possibly all of it, if they can&mdash;that has accrued <Col N="133" /> against them during the previous year. I have tried to indicate how they are affected in both ways&mdash;in unemployment benefit and in the assessment of means for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The people I have in mind were all subjected to a special inquiry some months ago.  I thought on that occasion that the calculation which seemed to have been adopted was entirely out of order.  I approached the Minister and asked for a reinvestigation of the whole question.  The Minister very kindly granted a reinvestigation but I am sorry to say when it ended the position was worse than when I reported it.  Not alone did the reinvestigation establish the means which were heretofore assessed against the particular parties, but it increased the means with the result that the rate of unemployment assistance is being reduced and in some cases completely cut out.</P>
    <P>I would like to appeal to the Minister in connection with the establishment of the local agents of the social welfare insurance, formerly the national health agents.  According to the Book of Estimates the number of officials in that category is 266.  It appears that 43 of that number are pensionable, due to the fact that they were employed in a pensionable capacity by the former National Health Insurance Society. But we still have 266 hanging on. Those people are neither here nor there.  They are not established and they are not civil servants.  The whole position of their unemployment is very precarious.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of remuneration. In the days when they were working under the National Health Insurance Society their remuneration was fixed annually and related to their live membership.  For obvious reasons that arrangements has been departed from.  Under the 1952 Social Welfare Act it would not be practicable for the Department, or fair to expect them, to have the same system of calculation. Under the new Act, once a person becomes insured generally speaking that person continues for a very indefinite period.  Under the former Act they only continued to get free membership for a year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> These particular officials have been employed in the national health insurance section since 1934.  The vast majority of the number I referred to have been there since the unified society started operations in 1933 or 1934.  Their position is no more definite now than it was then.  It was shelved from year to year waiting for this and that development.  The 43 people selected originally for pension are happy enough.  At least 50 per cent., of the 266 left are employed in a full-time capacity.  They have no other occupation and are depending mainly on this work for their livelihood.  Some of them are getting on now and the position should be settled as far as superannuation is concerned.  It will have to be faced sooner or later and I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that he might be able to do something about it during the current financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is undoubtedly a large one.  It deals with a very complicated Department and a very close scrutiny is needed when dealing with such a vast amount of money.  Most of that money is well spent and must be spent to provide for our old age pensioners, the infirm and the destitute.  In regard to old age and widows' pensions, I believe the State is doing reasonably well.  If we were better off, we would be able to do a little more.  The pension officers throughout the country, however, always allow a pension if they can; if there is a doubt they hold up the case for a while to see if that doubt can be resolved.  On the whole I think they are doing their best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to home assistance, I believe there is a class in this State who are in a very bad position and something should be done for them by the State and the county councils. They are almost in a semi-hungry condition. They are living on home assistance, and I believe they are not getting enough.  One can almost see the hunger in their faces.  Were it not that charitable societies like the Saint Vincent de Paul Society, and some decent neighbours come to their aid, they would be hungry and almost <Col N="135" /> ragged.  We do not want that in a Christian country such as ours.  They are the most deserving people we have. They are unable to help themselves. They have to fall back on the State, and I believe the State could have come to their assistance to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the bold and manly statement he made in the country&mdash;a statement long overdue.  I give him every credit for it.  I refer to the statement in which he said that he knew there were grave abuses in connection with unemployment and the dole.  There is not the slightest doubt about it.  Since then there has been a good deal of tightening up.  I have seen where many of those people drawing money, who should not have been drawing it, got a tap on the shoulders from the Guards and were told, &ldquo;If you go any further we will prosecute you.&rdquo;  People were drawing the dole who never should, people who had comfortable farms of land.  Instead of trying to work them, they set them and tried to get work under the State. When they did not get the work, they got the dole.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to see the dole doubled to those people who need it, but these abuses must be wiped out. Many people throughout the country see these abuses and know what is going on.  In some cases they report them but nothing is done.  I know a man myself who got a splendid farm of land with outoffices and appurtenances worth £2,000 or £3,000.  Those people are permanently working with the State.  When the work is knocked off, they go on the dole.  I want to know how they get on the dole.  You have these farmers drawing State money for nothing, yet for genuine cases our doles are very small and meagre.  They could be far bigger, if it were possible to have some tightening up.  The genuine claimant, who is unemployed and cannot get work, should be helped in every possible way until he does get work.</P>
    <P>I know men who could get work but who will not work.  They are proud to <Col N="136" /> say in their public-houses that between the dole and other State services they are far better off.  When the rabbit plague was here, they would not work at all.  All they wanted was the dole and State assistance; then they went out with snares and traps and they were well off.  It is only right we should have a tightening-up and that justice should be done.  People who are in genuine need should get these benefits and get them in abundance so far as the State can give them.  When I see what the poor unfortunates on home assistance are getting and what the loafers who should not be getting it at all are getting, I almost cry.  Big bounders who could work but will not work are drawing doles, setting their farms to their nearest neighbours and having a royal time, while people in their vicinity are hungry.  No wonder people cry out about heavy taxation.  I would ask the Minister to tighten matters up.</P>
    <P>There is more abuse in regard to the social welfare scheme&mdash;not the real scheme but the dole side of it&mdash;than there should be.  We have too many loafers trying to get easy money and get away with it.  Very few of them are brought before the courts.  They should be brought to court, prosecuted and, if not able to pay in cash, they should be made to pay in jail.  Those in genuine distress should get home assistance.  That is why I stood up here, boldly and openly, to tell the House that there is great abuse.  The Parliamentary Secretary is doing his best to stop abuses; when they are stopped tens of thousands of pounds will be saved.  I do not want the money thus saved to go to the Exchequer; I want it to go to those genuinely in need. Let us do something for families who really need assistance.  Let us do something in a practical way.</P>
    <P>It is a poor state of affairs when you see a man who travels in a high powered car signing for the dole, when you know that man has 20 acres of land set.  If he is hard up let him sell the car.  Whom do you see first when you go into a public-house at night? Is that not the type of man?  Whom do you first see when you go to dances, carnivals and that sort of thing?  It is <Col N="137" /> time we put a stop to all this.  I am not saying that this is widespread throughout the country, but it has been widespread in the midlands and I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on making that statement.  We should see that those who need money get it. This is a small, poor State, badly run. Run properly, as a Christian people we would be able to do far more for those people who are old, sick and infirm. Those are the people whom the State should aid.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a circular sent to the Garda barracks, and to other people in charge of these services, to ensure that the dole is paid only to those entitled to it and to see that the malingerers will not get it.  These are honest, straightforward words and the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am sure, will support me.  There is too much easy money got by the wrong type of people in this country.  If we could prevent their getting it, we could give more money to the genuine cases.  I have known of men who left decent, good jobs because they were the lazy type and they wanted to live on the dole and on children's allowances. They left good jobs after three or four months knowing full well that the jobs would have lasted had they stayed in them.  Those people are no credit to the country.  Between them and the gangs of hookers going around the country at night time, this is quickly becoming a sorry State.  I want to see a consciousness of Christian duty brought back into this House.  I want to see that money is spent only on those who need it and who should get it.  I am satisfied that if that were done tens of thousands of pounds would be saved.  I do not want to cut down on anybody entitled to it, on the widow, the orphan, the infirm, or any genuine applicant, but we must cut out the malingerers.  There are too many of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make only a few points with reference to social welfare generally.  One relates to a matter to which Deputy Moloney has already referred, the question of share fishermen on inshore craft.  I shall not cover the ground he has covered with regard to unemployment <Col N="138" /> benefit, and the obligations on the skippers of those small craft to have contributions paid weekly.  I want to deal with the question of assessing the fisherman with the full amount of his earnings when he comes to apply for unemployment assistance later on.</P>
      <P>A man who works for the county council resumes his application for unemployment assistance immediately his work terminates.  If, however, an applicant is a fisherman, his earnings for the period during which he fishes are assessed <i>in toto</i> against him when he renews his claim for unemployment assistance.  I never could quite see where is the equity in that.  A salmon fisherman, who fishes from May to July, usually finds himself unemployed in the following winter.  He has a right to apply for unemployment assistance but he finds that his total earnings during the period in which he fished for salmon are assessed as part of his annual income.  By the time he has received the last payment he has not saved 1d. to make allowance for the gear and necessary fittings required for fishing for the season.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to examine that position to see, whether or not, within existing legislation it would be possible to amend the system of investigation whereby that fisherman's allowance for the seasonal fishing would not be assessed against him <i>in toto</i> during the year, but that he would be treated as a man who works as a labourer for a county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question has been raised regarding the investigation that is being conducted at present.  It has been mentioned that a great deal of fraud has been disclosed.  Everybody will be at one in complimenting the Parliamentary Secretary in so far as he has been able to detect genuine fraud and put an end to it, but what we all feel is the case of the honest man who pays the penalty for the man who is malingering, who is dishonestly applying for and receiving unemployment benefit.  One of the things that may have caused a good deal of alarm on this question of unemployment benefit was the increased number of claimants since the introduction of the last <Col N="139" /> Social Welfare (Amending) Act of 1956 which increased benefits.  Since then I think the number of claimants and the number of contributors must have increased considerably.  The intention to defraud the State of funds is not entirely the underlying reason for that.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, when a man worked casually as a labourer he did not put his employer or himself to the trouble of affixing stamps to his cards for the sake of one or two days a week but, when he found stamps had a certain value, the casual employer insisted, whenever he got employment, that his first employer during the week had the obligation to have the stamps affixed to his card.  That arose as a result of the change in the system arising out of the 1956 Act.  The number of contributors must have considerably increased and it is probably assumed in official quarters that the increase in numbers is due to a desire to defraud the State of the funds available for unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I am not making a case for those who may have been detected&mdash;as a previous speaker said&mdash;as malingerers, but I do know of genuine cases being victimised as a result of the investigation conducted at present.  I think there are a number of ways in which a better approach might be made to alleviate the distress arising out of this investigation. One way would be&mdash;it is done, it is to the credit of the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;to have unemployment assistance paid in the meantime until a case is duly investigated.  All of us know cases of people who, so far back as November, had their claims subjected to investigation and have not had decisions yet.  Meantime, no money has been paid and that has created a rather serious problem.</P>
    <P>There have been instances where men who worked for farmers and who had contributions to their credit over a number of weeks have had their cases investigated.  The investigation officer called and, after giving the necessary caution, questioned the farmers as to the validity of these contributions and subjected them to an interrogation with regard to the days on which these <Col N="140" /> men were employed and the type of work they did.  In some cases, that employment took place two years before and it is not very easy for a farmer to remember what days a casual labourer was in his employment back in 1956.  Yet, the farmer is asked to make a statement which may be used in evidence subsequently, and that has created a serious situation.</P>
    <P>The result is that in many cases farmers are reluctant to take back these men into their employment because they regard them as a source of trouble and annoyance.  I have had the experience of a farmer coming to me and asking me, if he employed so-and-so, would he get into any trouble; he had had the investigation officer asking him where the man worked, what he did, and the number of days he worked.  Such a farmer does not keep a set of books setting out the date on which a man worked with him on the bog, cutting seaweed, stacking hay, or anything else.  While it may not be easy to separate the wheat from the chaff, this type of investigation has gone on sufficiently long now to enable the officials to have arrived at some system or rule whereby they will create the minimum hardship to those who are subjected to this interrogation during an investigation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the payment of widows' pensions, I want to draw attention to the position in which a widow finds herself when her husband is drowned and the body is not recovered. A death certificate is necessary to qualify for pensions.  In drowning tragedies, the widow has to wait seven years, if the body is not found. Some shorter period should be fixed, at the end of which a certificate might be issued, presuming death, so that the widow may benefit.  It is a great hardship and we all know cases where public charity has had to come to the aid of dependents, following drowning tragedies.  I suggest the State might be a little more lenient in presuming death and not insist on a certificate. I should like to have some comment from the Parliamentary Secretary on that when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Recently I came across another <Col N="141" /> problem.  I came across an individual in receipt of two pensions&mdash;a widow's pension and a blind pension.  When she reached 70 years, the blind pension and the widow's pension ceases and she is compelled to take the old age pension.  Now, this woman was in receipt of £1 5s. blind pension and £1 3s. 6d. widow's pension.  At 70 years of age, she was obliged to drop both and draw the old age pension of 25/-.  She lost £1 3s. 6d. per-week.  It is, to say the least of it, a little difficult to adjust one's economy to a drop of 23/6 per week at 70 years of age. It is a rather unusual type of case but I had personal experience of it this week.  Possibly it is a matter which might be adjusted without the need to resort to amending legislation.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again the position of the share fishermen.  If that could be adjusted, we would like unemployment assistance to be paid on an equitable basis.  This is one case in which a great deal of inequity exists&mdash;the inshore share fisherman who fishes for a short season has the full amount of his earnings assessed against him as means when the claims unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>I will fight to the finish.  There will be another day. What I say may be as useless as what ex-Deputy Murphy said.  Perhaps what I say now may be as useless as what he would have said had he been with us here to-night because there is a Government in power with a big majority. It does not expect a general election for four years and one cannot, therefore, expect very much.  But they will play safe in the fourth year and give a <Col N="142" /> few &ldquo;bob&rdquo; then all right.  When the people were asked to vote for independence, many promises were made to them.  They were told of the golden opportunity they were getting.  They were told the people would be, brought back and everyone would have work. The people were deceived.</P>
      <P>Deputies talk about frauds drawing social assistance.  We cannot pat ourselves on the back.  We told the people they would be better off if they voted for independence.  Had they remained under the British&mdash;I am not advocating it&mdash;they would now have the same benefits as obtain for the people in the North.  Ours have lost considerably on the transaction.</P>
      <P>Every time I think of ex-Deputy Murphy, I wonder if there will be many here who will follow suit, because I am quite certain his resignation must prick the consciences of all those people who never seem to trouble this House or talk on any matter.  When it comes to drawing money to which people are not entitled, a good many Deputies here draw money to which they are not entitled.</P>

      <P>Practically one-third of those who are drawing wages or salaries have got an increase because of strike action or threatened strike action.  Another one-third who are not members of trade unions have been granted the 10/-.  Yet another one-third will receive nothing.  Speaking of the unemployed, I want to remind the House that there are about 50,000 between the ages of 14 and 18 who do not appear on the register and who are not working.  They are running around the streets and standing in groups at every corner.  Add that <Col N="143" /> 50,000 to the 75,000 unemployed when considering the state of the country.</P>
      <P>Some time ago the Taoiseach stated that we could not afford to grant additional social benefits.  At that time no promise had been made to give additional money to civil servants.  Yet, that money was founds.  It is surprising how, when people have to do a thing, they are able to do it.  Those other unfortunates, of course, are not organised.  They cannot strike.  They are a minority, a kind of forgotten, unwanted people.  It amazed me that the Labour Party gave them such little assistance, beyond pious resolutions and remarks.  They could have had a general strike on their behalf and make the Government sit up and realise that these people were entitled to some consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister, seeing that his mind is made up, not to condemn the innocent as well as the guilty.  There have been allegations that numbers are drawing assistance to which they are not entitled.  He should agree to give an increase pending an inquiry in each case.  Could he not save money in that way and perhaps it would not cost the State so much in the end?  In that way he would do justice.  I ask him to consider that aspect, to inquire into every case that he wants to inquire into.  I am not here to support fraud.  Let him inquire into every case and let him agree to be generous with home assistance where there is evidence that the case is an upright case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a large number of old age pensioners who have no other means. There are others who have incomes of some sort.  An old age pensioner is entitled to an income up to £2 a week, that is to say, he is entitled to draw full pension and 15/-.  What about all those old age pensioners who have no <Col N="145" /> other income?  Surely we can be a little generous towards them.</P>
    <P>With regard to unemployment assistance, I can understand the Minister's attitude towards single men who, perhaps, could emigrate if they wanted to, but I cannot understand his attitude towards married men.  It is not easy for a married men to emigrate. In order to keep the two homes he has to slave in England, to work overtime. He cannot keep two homes on an ordinary eight-hour a day job.  That has been explained to me.  These people are expected to emigrate.  That is what they are being asked to do.</P>
    <P>We should be a little generous to old age pensioners who have no other means and to married men on unemployment assistance who have families.  These people could be segregated from single men or old age pensioners who have other means.  We should help the people who are on the floor.  That is why I suggested to the Minister that he should have granted somethings extra pending inquiry in each case.  I do not like segregation but, as the Minister has made up his mind that he is giving nothing, I come back to it and ask him to be generous in all cases where home assistance is applied for by married men with families.  A man and his wife cannot be expected to live on 30/-.  If there is a family, they get an extra 11/- or they may get 5/- or 10/-.  Even if they get the maximum, how can a family be expected to live on a total income of £2 10s. a week?  We could be a little generous with families.</P>
    <P>All the increased costs will have to be met by these people.  It is estimated that the additional bus fares will cost families living out of town as much as 10/- a week.  If an unemployed person has to come into town to draw the dole, it is 7d. a trip.  We could have been a little generous in some cases.</P>

I feel like my friend Jack Murphy.  I would ask the Minister, again, to consider the case of old age pensioners who have no other income and the case of married men with families who cannot go to England because they cannot keep two homes unless they slave and work overtime and that should not be expected of them.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to remember all the mighty promises that were made to the people as to what freedom would mean to them.  I do not think I will bother saying any more, as I do not think it worth while.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever one may think of the financial difficulties, I do not think we should try to delude anybody by saying that recipients of social welfare benefits or social assistance are being generously treated.  If any Deputy were to suggest that the level of benefits and assistance could be taken as an indication of generosity, the citizens would come to the conclusion that we did not know what we were taking about.  It may be a figure which is difficult to surpass in the present economic circumstances but that has nothing to do with generosity. I would commend Deputy Loughman, when referring in future to this matter, not to think that 30/- to a man and his wife, with which they are required to provide themselves with all the necessaries of life, is generous under present cost-of-living conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from having to provide shelter, heat, food and clothing for themselves, we hope that as human beings, they <Col N="147" /> are entitled, even though they are in receipt of assistance, to something more than animals.  Certainly the scale of assistance granted to human beings in this country is something less than the amount expended on animals about which we think so much.  One would not willingly see a dog or a cat, much less a horse or a cow, go really short of food; the farming community would think it a very serious offence if animals were not provided with a stable and straw or a byre and some bedding.  The main criticism of this Estimate is a criticism that can be levelled against all the Estimates for social assistance for many years&mdash;that successive Governments alleviate only in a small way the hardships to which a, very considerable proportion of our citizens are exposed.</P>
    <P>On this subject, as on a number of other subjects on which I venture to raise my voice in this House, I do not pretend to speak with any personal knowledge of conditions in rural areas. Many Deputies can tell us of the struggles that old age pensioners, widows and orphans and those in receipt of insurance benefits and social assistance have in meeting the living expenses which they cannot avoid in those areas.  However, I do know that it is a heart-breaking thing to see the extremities to which the same type of citizens in the urban areas are driven because of economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>The question I want the Parliamentary Secretary to answer in replying to this debate is whether these hardships are or are not intensified by this Government-blessed drive for economy, by an intensification of means investigation, by either direct instruction or suggestion to local authorities and to all those who deal immediately with those in the social assistance classes, with all those who apply for the various grants covered in this Estimate, that every possible avenue should be explored with a view, if possible, to depriving those people of assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a lady coming <Col N="148" /> to see me about two weeks ago.  She had a husband unemployed and one daughter employed.  Two other daughters, one 29 years of age and another 30&mdash;who were still children in mind, never having developed from childhood&mdash;had been in receipt of a 10/- grant because of a certain medical disability. Without any warning whatsoever, they were advised they would no longer qualify under this heading. When the mother applied to have the case examined with a view to receiving assistance the most rigorous means test was imposed.</P>
      <P>This lady was the mother of ten children, of whom these girls were the eldest.  The mother had to mind them as she would mind an infant of two or three years.  She was unable to go out anywhere in the evening.  The other members of the family had married and gone away and set up their own families.  Therefore, the mother had to stay at home with these girls or accompany them wherever they went.  A sum of money going into the family to help to provide for them was struck off and the mother had to fall back again on public assistance and had to undergo a most rigorous means test.  At this stage, she came to me.  She had been refused the assistance she had previously enjoyed, before the bringing in of the Act under which these girls got the particular grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that officers immediately dealing with this type of case had not changed their mentality and had not, overnight, become inhuman machines whose sole purpose was to find some loophole by which to deprive those who applied for public assistance, or for any benefit under these Acts, or to grant them as little assistance as they possibly could.  I will ask the Parliamentary Secretary to state whether or not that that is, in effect, what is happening.  I do not know what is occurring in the rural areas, but I know that the number of complaints being received by Deputies from the urban areas, and particularly from the city, and by public representatives in other walks of life, is growing considerably and that the efforts that <Col N="149" /> have to be made to ensure that the recipients of this public assistance at least get the miserable sums to which they are entitled, are becoming more difficult every day.</P>
    <P>Twenty-five million pounds is a very substantial sum of money.  I wonder what the cost to the State would be if the very substantial number of persons of the type I have just mentioned were left entirely to the State to look after. I wonder what the cost to the State would be if those fathers and mothers and those married sons and daughters &mdash;and there are hundreds and hundreds of them&mdash;who are, depriving themselves of legitimate amusements and of small luxuries, and in many cases depriving their children of some of the necessaries of life in order to care for a members of the family&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who is unable to provide for himself, adopted the attitude, that fortunately is rare, of letting the helpless ones go to the State. Deputy Loughman again interrupts.  He is getting good at that and I hope he keeps on interrupting.  These people do not to it just for Christian duty. They do it because they love their children, they love their parents, but the State should not go out of its way, or the minions of the State or of the local authorities should not go out of their way, because of a sense of false economy, to make that situation much worse than it is.</P>
      <P>Any member of this House who has even the least connection with or the least knowledge of the Public Assistance and Welfare Acts of recent years knows that a gradual tightening up is taking place.  If it was good enough four or five years ago to recognise the difficulties of our citizens, and to recognise the difficulties of families, and to be human in our approach by permitting a reasonable assistance to be given from public funds, surely it is equally good enough to-day when the economic situation of the majority of our citizens has worsened.  If this Government, and this Dáil, by deliberate action impose hardships on the general citizen, at least they should see that those who are helpless get a little better protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> Twenty-five million pounds, as I say, is a lot of money, but for the average individual and the average family affected by many of these Votes to-day it is not a question of £25,000,000.  It is not a question of £25,000, or of £2,500.  It is a question of where and how they can get sufficient to provide themselves with the barest necessaries of life.  It is easy to talk here in terms of millions &mdash;sometimes I get confused when we get into the rarefied atmosphere of millions&mdash;but when we go out of this House and meet the type of family Deputy Sherwin has referred to, and when they tell us they have only the 30/-, or only the old age pension, and that the outdoor assistance has been cut off, and ask if we can do anything about it, it is not in terms of £25,000,000 we are talking then.</P>
    <P>My main appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary under this heading is to endeavour to ensure, in the name of the Government which he is now representing, in the name of this Dáil, that if there has been a decision to intensify the means investigation to the extent that severe hardship has been caused to those whose only means of keeping the breath of life in their bodies and shelter over their heads are these miserable sums they receive, that decision will be reversed.</P>
    <P>These people cannot purchase clothing. I have never known of a case where a family with an income of 30/- a week could buy clothing.  If they get it at all, it means that they have got a voucher from the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  Therefore, if there has been this decision as to intensification of means investigation, let the Parliamentary Secretary, in the name of this Assembly, do what is proper and have that decision reversed.  Where appropriate, let him issue directions and where directions are not appropriate, let him give a gentle hint, indicating that, whatever our financial difficulties may be, human beings are entitled to be treated as such.</P>
    <P>I believe, in speaking on this Vote, we are not allowed to refer to the fact that the economic situation of many families has been worsened by emigration.</P>

      <P>The only point I wish to make is that in circumstances of continued unemployment, where the wage earners of a family are compelled to leave the country, the situation of those whom they leave behind is bound to become worse, particularly amongst the assistance classes.  That happens because all those who emigrate are not fathers of families concerned and responsible for the people at home.  Even in the case of fathers, the difficulties are great because when they emigrate, they must maintain two homes, and it is clear that people forced to tolerate this unnatural division of their families, in the main, carry out their responsibilities.  Many youths emigrate, however, and I am afraid it must be admitted that too high a proportion of these boys and girls find that they have little left, after providing for their lodgings and expenses, and are unable to send very much, if anything, home.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the fact I periodically complain about the high administration cost of Government Departments, I think the Department of Social Welfare is to be complimented on its internal organisation resulting in an administration cost that does bear a reasonable relationship to the Vote as a whole.</P>
      <P>Complaints have been made here about investigation of the various aspects of State assistance.  I would have no complaint whatever in this respect if the investigations were universal and if the desired objective were to give more to the needy and less or nothing to those who do not deserve it but I am afraid that the investigation, while the various officers are doing their very best, is having a somewhat disastrous effect on the morale of the people.  There is a feeling abroad, which should be corrected forthwith, that this investigation is directed only against particular persons in particular areas, from information supplied from sources which leave nobody in any doubt as to where they come from.</P>
      <P>I should like if there were, both in the Department and in that portion of it administered by local authorities, some common standard of means test. There are various paradoxes which come to light from time to time, where people have the same valuation, the same number of animals, the same amount of poultry, the same amount of commonage attached to their holding and the same opportunities existing for each, yet the amount of State assistance obtainable by one is not so readily obtainable by another.</P>
      <P>The departmental officials throughout the country have their difficulties.  I know how they are pulled and dragged this way and that way from time to time, but I must say that it is my experience, with one exception, in my constituency that the officers of this Department do their work extremely impartially and extremely well.  That one exception is known to the Department as a result of complaints directly made by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> It is a matter of regret that the Old Age Pensions Vote has been reduced on this occasion.  I regard those elements in our community made up of old age pensioners, widows and orphans and the blind as those really deserving of the State's assistance. During the course of the speech I made here on the Budget, I referred to the depreciation in the value of money and perhaps it would be no harm to refer to it here again on this Vote, with particular reference to old age pension allowances.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question put by Deputy Michael O'Higgins some time ago, in relation to the present purchasing power of the £ <i>vis-a-vis</i> its purchasing power in 1938, the answer was that the present purchasing power of the £ is 7/4.  In 1938 the old age pensioner had a maximum of 10/- a week, for which he purchased 10/- worth of goods by the standards of that time.  Now, as a result of the efforts of all of us &mdash;and in my experience, the increases were more substantial under the two régimes headed by Deputy J.A. Costello than under any other régime&mdash; he has now got 25/- maximum per week.  Anyone who works it out on the basis of the £ now will find, taking the purchasing power of 7/4 and the 25/- which is paid at present, it produces 9/2 worth of goods; so he has gone back 10d. in purchasing power over 20 years.</P>
    <P>That is something which should be taken into account, because these are the people in our community who have no other way of supplementing it. Either through old age, through infirmity or blindness, or through the general helplessness attaching to a widow and children, there is no other way of supplementing this allowance. It is for that reason I regret any decrease in any of those allowances. Even though money might be tight and scarce, it is to that section of the community that people should direct their attention first in largesse, before any effort is made at paring down. There is nothing further I would care to add on this Vote except to emphasise the points I have made, not by repeating them but by asking the Parliamentary Secretary to take particular cognisance of them.</P>

      <P>There is a duty on an employer, when he employs an employee, to ask that employee for his insurance card; and it is the duty of the employes to yield up the insurance card.  When the work ceases, be it for a day, a week, a month or six months, it is the duty of the employer to hand the card back to the employee and it is the duty of the employee to see that he gets his card so that he can lodge it in the labour exchange or the nearest branch employment office.  If that were fully understood and done, all these matters complained of by Deputy Brennan would not occur. There is an admission in the Deputy's contribution to the debate that men were employed on a contract of work, that the law was evaded and there was no stamping of cards.</P>
      <P>We want the full national co-operation in working out the Social Welfare Acts.  If we had that, a number of the abuses complained of and delays in investigation would not occur.  We are gradually getting that co-operation, but we would like it to be greater and more full.  Therefore, I appeal for everybody's co-operation&mdash;that of employers and employees&mdash;in this matter. We do not regard social insurance as an evil or a necessary evil.  We regard it as one of the social benefits of the modern State and we want to see it administered properly.  What we are against is abuse and fraud.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish made political play with figures in his contribution to the debate when he said the Vote was less than last year.  The Estimate for last year for the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare was £474,700; for Social Insurance it was £3,655,000; and for Social Assistance is was £18,539,000. The comparable figures this year are £470,800; £4,251,000; and £20,561,000; a total of £25,282,800, as compared with £22,668,700.  He bunched in the Supplementary Estimates which came in during the financial year, to prove his contention.  That did not prove anything.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 14th May, 1958.</P>
