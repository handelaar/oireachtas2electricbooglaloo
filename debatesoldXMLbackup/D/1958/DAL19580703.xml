      <P>Before the Minister continues, I should like to ask a question.

If the Minister has any information on the subject, I should like him to give it to us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt last night very briefly with the suggestion made by Deputy Dillon that plans for the expansion of our fishery industry might obliterate the employment or livelihood of some 1,600 permanently employed fishermen and I should like to repeat that our efforts, in common with those of other <Col N="1234" /> small countries in the process of development, are directed towards the creation of maximum employment and towards expanding the industry without eliminating its present features.  I think that should be clear to everybody.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies suggested we could not do very much more than last year, because we did not have sufficient money.  I want to make it quite clear that, as compared with the original Estimate in 1956-57, before it was increased by means of a Supplementary Estimate, the increase available for the industry is some £92,000, and although I hope that will be inadequate in future as some of these plans develop, nevertheless it shows that the Minister for Finance and the Government regard the fishing industry as of importance and have given some additional funds in order that we can make some progress therein.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies referred to my observations on a certain number of fishermen who appear not to be fishing for as long as they might, not fishing to the optimum, and Deputy Dillon seemed to be surprised to hear that there were fishermen paying on the hire-purchase basis for boats who were in arrears with their payments.  I want to make it very clear to the House that there is a considerable number of fishermen in arrears, and in arrears up to 20, 30, 40 and 60 months.  In some cases, it is because of bad luck or a breakdown of engines, or due to personal circumstances, but there are still other cases where similar fishing boats manned by the same kind of fishermen with the same experience and the same background are able to pay their instalments in time fishing on the same grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not insulting fishermen: I was simply making an appeal as all Ministers in charge of production have done for the past 20 years irrespective of the Government of which they were members, asking those who take part in the industry to do their utmost to increase production, to make it economic, to make it thrive by every means in their power, by utilising every scientific advance and by greater effort. All Ministers have been doing that for years and it applies to the fishing <Col N="1235" /> industry as to any other industry.  I should like to remind the House that my actual words&mdash;I shall not repeat them all now&mdash;were: &ldquo;The operation of boats issued on hire-purchase is not completely satisfactory.&rdquo;  That is not a condemnation of fishermen in any particular port, in Killybegs, or anywhere else, as a whole.</P>
    <P>I found it difficult to follow Deputy O.J. Flanagan's speech.  He seemed to imply that, in relation to the speech I made on the first Estimate of which I had the privilege to be in control and in relation to other speeches which I have made since, nothing new was happening in the fishing world and that anything that was happening had been initiated by his Government. There is no question that different Governments have made some contribution towards the fishing industry. When I came into office, I inherited quite a panoply of services and ideas put into operation at different times. Deputy Bartley, when Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Department, contributed quite a good deal to the progress made, but, nevertheless, it is not true to say that we are not now making further progress.</P>
    <P>There are new ideas being put into operation.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara has increased advances and subventions from the State.  There are plans for ice-plants in some four or five centres and for further machinery for the processing of fish, for storage and workshops.  All those plans are going ahead this year and there will be a remarkable increase in the supply of ice.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the new training scheme for fishermen is not an extension of any other training scheme that we have had.  It is a new effort to train fishermen so that they can secure a certificate which will enable them to become skippers of vessels allocated by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Here is an advance of technical education to the fishing world which is definitely long overdue.  I know of no reason why we should have fewer fishermen possessing the second-class certificate issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce than any other maritime country <Col N="1236" /> on the western seaboard of Europe, and I may say in passing that the lack of technical competence is a factor which affects the whole economy of this country.  That fact is now being deplored by all Parties and by all Governments in this country.</P>
    <P>There are excellent fishermen without the training who can earn quite good livelihoods in this country and there are others coming along who will take An Bord Iascaigh Mhara boats when we have trained them, so that in future the fishing intake will be greater, the income greater and the reward can be greater for the younger fishermen. I hope I have now made that position clear.</P>
    <P>Another entirely new step has been taken in the effort made during the past 12 months to end the long-standing dispute between An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the wholesale merchants. There have been disputes before this between private organisations and State bodies in other spheres, but there never has been anything like the bitterness that has arisen over the past ten years between the wholesale trade and the board which has been in the position that fishermen who take boats from it on the hire-purchase system have to give to the board their catches for marketing.  The board is unlike other State companies in that in this way it would appear to be in competition with the private wholesaler.  Most of the activities of the other State companies are definitely restricted by legislation or by the fact that they are selling products, such as turf or sugar.</P>
    <P>This dispute has arisen because of the clause of the hire-purchase agreements whereby fishermen must sell their fish, save through exceptional circumstances or where they get special permission, to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  It has created the impression in the minds of the wholesalers that here is a State company, in a privileged position, which draws fish to itself and prevents them from making what they consider their rightful profits.  The whole conflict arose because of an illusion, created between the two wars, that wholesalers were to be regarded as a class of thugs and robbers who ruined the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> In that period between 1924 and 1939, all commodity prices were fluctuating and wholesalers and purveyors of produce of every kind took the usual attitude of doing their utmost to make increased profits.  All over the world, those concerned in producing primary commodities, unprotected by modern economic devices which cushion them against fluctuating prices, were being treated in the same way as our fishermen were being treated, except that our fishermen felt the effects more severely because their numbers were small as compared with the rest of the community and they did not seem to have any special political protection or support.</P>
    <P>The Sea Fisheries Association, which was largely promoted by a Fianna Fáil Government, did a considerable amount of good.  It did assist the fishermen and helped them to sell their fish and enabled them to get modern boats. One of the big aids given to the fishermen was the prohibition of imports of foreign fish.  There was also the expansion of fishing during World War II. As I have said, this dispute arose because of various factors and there was a misunderstanding in regard to the position of the wholesalers who were only acting in the same way as other wholesalers.</P>
    <P>I hope the agreement which I believe will shortly be finally authorised will end this dispute.  I have had the sincere promise of the private wholesale trade that, if agreement can be reached on this matter, they will make a bigger effort than ever before to expand retail outlets throughout this country. That should result in creating competition between all the interests concerned and it should encourage far more extensive retail outlets throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister leaves that point would he say has any aspect of this dispute affected the distribution of the packeted quick-freeze fish from Killybegs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be able to answer that straight away.  It would be very difficult to answer it off the reel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say how the packeted quick-freeze fish from Killybegs is being disposed of, and is it available on the Irish market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the fish is bought by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and put into quick-freeze until an opportunity offers to sell it at a time of extreme scarcity, and some is taken for the export market.  I do not think the operation of that installation is affected by this dispute to any great degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that installation being used to any extent and what is the annual production from it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be impossible for me to give such figures off the reel at the moment.  Another good feature has been the procuring of the Icelandic fisherman who has very great knowledge of modern fishing methods, a man who has been found excellent in other spheres, and who I hope, will stimulate the minds of our fishermen. I know an Irish fisherman who could go abroad and stimulate the minds of foreign fishermen, but I hope this Icelandic fisherman will give useful advice because fishing techniques are changing all over the world.  If you read the fishing Press, you will find constant exchanges of advice, of opinions and of techniques, and I hope this man's work will aid our fishermen.</P>
      <P>The appointment of a harbour consultant who is experienced in the fishery development of harbours is also a novelty.  Good work has been done by the Board of Works in past years but to have the full time services for a period of a person whose mind has been devoted completely to designing fishery harbours, as such, I think will be of great assistance.  He will be working closely with the Board of Works and there again I think we can make progress in that way.  There have been tremendous delays in the development of our fishery harbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon suggested that a complete survey had been made of the harbours of this country during his time in office, but, in actual fact, this was confined to a more or less preliminary <Col N="1239" /> survey of three harbours, and the administrative machinery for continuing the work was stopped in 1956. It was confined, with the exception of one harbour in Cork, to harbours in County Galway, so that all the major work of planning as to what should be the best harbours for development, and making the decision where we should concentrate upon, remains to be done.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that we are in process of constructing an exploratory boat which should be of interest. Some Deputies referred disparagingly to the export trade, but I do not know how we will progress in the fishing industry if we do not export more fish. We might as well say: &ldquo;Eat more beef&rdquo;, because the eating of fish in this country confers no special economic advantage on the country.  If anything, fish replaces eggs.  What is needed is the double development of home consumption as well as exports. In that connection, one of the extraordinary deficiencies in this country, under all Governments, has been the complete absence of canneries, canneries for mackerel, herring and sprat. These fish are teaming around our coasts and we have never had established a large-sized cannery for exports.  The export of those three types of fish is world wide and it is even a matter of exchange.  The British export tinned pelagic fish and import tinned pelagic fish, and one of the greatest advantages of tinned fish is that the traffic in it is two ways.</P>
    <P>I hope that some of the projects that have come before the Department will mature.  I do not like to talk about projects until I see the foundation stones laid, but, if some of the projects mature, I can say they could readily absorb anything up to one-eighth or one-sixth of the total quantity of fish landed in this country at present.  As I have said, I am not going to refer to them until I see the foundation stones laid and it is possible that some of them may not mature.  I can say this, that there are more live projects for export in the Department of Fisheries, promoted by serious firms of known reliability and known success, than <Col N="1240" /> ever before in the history of the Department.</P>
    <P>I am making every effort to stimulate and direct the attention of people in the cannery world to the facilities offered to them under the Undeveloped Areas Act and under the Industrial Grants Act, because I believe there is great hope for considerable employment if we could get these canneries going.  I am prepared to take any steps, even to visiting the companies myself, as I did last summer in the case of one particular project, and I am prepared to go anywhere I can see some hope of developing this industry, because each of the developments, the canning of fish, the quick-freezing side, and the curing side of the industry all offer good prospects for the future.</P>
    <P>Again, in connection with the export trade, Córas Tráchtála Teoranta is making a survey for us on a bigger scale than ever before.  We have an officer of the Department engaged in nothing but developing exports.  We have secured concessions in British Railways freight rates which are absolutely essential and vital for the trade from the south coast to Billingsgate and other centres, and negotiations are continuing for further bulk freight rates in connection with the export of fish from other centres.  We are sending officers abroad to explore markets.  We are appointing a special officer to explore markets and I might add in this connection that all this work is absolutely essential because the marketing of fish is tremendously complex, due to variation in prices, competitive features, and the gluts and scarcities that occur.</P>
    <P>The whole development of quick-frozen fish is lined with pitfalls but I want to draw the attention of all Deputies to the fact that any plant with the right kind of quick-freeze, any bacon-curing establishment, any meat-packing establishment plant is capable of the double development of quick-freezing for fish, vegetables and meat, and that industry has an enormous turnover of millions and millions of pounds in Great Britain and in the United States.  We have the vegetables, the meats and the fish.  Again, as I have said, it is a matter of very <Col N="1241" /> careful marketing and very great efficiency. It requires great efficiency to make quite sure that the quick-freeze plant is used to the maximum extent.  I hope Deputies will do their best to advertise the need for this particular type of triple quick-freeze process because I find that most of the firms in Great Britain, for example, do not confine themselves exclusively to fish but can all the products.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that there is one project which I think is really certain to mature which does include both fish and agricultural produce.  It is obviously to the advantage of the country to have the three of them worked together.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the herring market and I hope that fishermen will not take his words pessimistically. There was tremendous fishing in Dunmore East last season.  The reason is that the herring fisheries in Scotland are not progressing so well as might be expected, the East Anglian fishing has declined and recently there was a tremendous reduction in the Norwegian herring intake.  The herrings move around our coast during nearly the whole of the year.  There is always somewhere a limited herring season as well as a major herring season.  I believe that there are very great prospects. We had no difficulty whatever in disposing of part of the herring catch last autumn at enormous prices, prices that I do not believe could continue under normal circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do agree with Deputy Dillon that if the herring industry is to progress, it must be associated with all the processing features.  Herring must be sold fresh and cured in half a dozen different ways and canned and, if necessary, there must be additional fishmeal plants to take herring that are in surplus supply after purchases for all these other purposes have been filled, but I do believe that there is a good future for the herring industry, although I agree with Deputy Dillon that everything in the fish trade is risky.  Fish do move away and come.  It is a risky, speculative industry.  That is why the State has to give aid and make contributions. In that connection, I <Col N="1242" /> might add that the facilities of the Undeveloped Areas Act and the Industrial Grants Act are available for fish curing alone and also for fish canneries and for quick-freeze plants.</P>
    <P>Another Deputy suggested that activity in the boatyards is declining.  Eight boats have been approved and are a-building.  This applies to 50 to 56-foot boats.  One has been approved and not yet been laid down and some six applications are under consideration.  Seven small boats are about to be laid down. There is no shortage of work in the boatyards, either Bord Iascaigh Mhara boatyards or at least one of the private boatyards of which I am aware.  We hope that there will be more fishermen applying for boats.  There are too few fishermen applying for boats from the South and from the West of the country, exclusive of Donegal.  It is one of the sad facts of the last few years that out of 29 boats allocated to fishermen regarded as suitable, some 14 came from the east coast, seven from Donegal and the remainder from the whole of the south coast and up the west coast.  I hope that there will be more fishermen applying from the South and West in order to continue the tradition there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the dangers attending upon the introduction of a fleet of 72-foot boats or a fleet of larger trawlers in flooding the home market.  The position had been reached already under his Government and under the previous Government with the institution of the 50- and 56-foot boats.  We now find that they do not go out sufficiently in bad weather and that they go out and fish very heavily in calm weather and that already there are gluts at one period and scarcities at another.  There is no way of fulfilling the one absolutely essential objective of providing regular supplies of fish throughout the year and of making it possible to retail fish throughout the country profitably unless, first of all, we have quick-freeze plants, but they cannot solve the whole problem.  Some people will not eat quick-freeze fish.  It is not always economic to quick-freeze.</P>
    <P>As I said, first of all quick-freeze facilities are required and holding <Col N="1243" /> storage facilities and, secondly, we need to have fish on sale to the public at periods when the weather is not of extreme gale force and when larger boats can fish.  I fully recognise that we must at the same time have the export outlets or we might flood the market.  Even with our quick-freeze plants and even with their capacities to absorb surplus supplies of fish and even with fishmeal plants available, we must have export outlets to prevent the market becoming disordered.  I might add that it is very difficult to prevent a disorderly market in the fish world. You have it in Great Britain with all the organisations that exist, the Herring Fishery Board, the White Fish Board, the Deep Sea Trawler Federation. They still have gluts at certain times.  Even the fishmeal plants are sometimes overloaded.  If we do not make the effort we will simply remain a country which catches 10,000 tons of fish as compared with 106,000 tons caught by other nations around the coast.</P>
    <P>May I once again say that the fishing industry in some respects is the same as any other food industry in this country?  We are not going to survive as a nation, we are not going to expand our resources unless we can beat our competitors, unless we can overcome all the difficulties of extra freight rates on our fish to Great Britain, either by taking lesser reward for it and accepting a lesser standard of living, simply in order to overcome that one difficulty that will always face us, or else by greater output, so that we can afford to pay the freight rates.  The fishing industry is exactly the same as any other food industry.  Unless we overcome the difficulties facing us as competitors, there can be no expansion.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are difficulties facing us as competitors.  The price of fish in England is affected by the price of deep-sea fish, which can be low at times.  We have to make quite sure that we enter the market at the right point for all the different varieties of fish, that our transport is efficient, that the fish is well packed, presented and graded.  It is a problem that affects the whole country in regard to agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> Some observations were made about my remarks on foreign fishermen. I hope we will have a greater number of applications by young men to join the training school than we have had up to now.  The allowance is satisfactory. It enables a young man to live away from home.  The income possibilities are quite reasonable.  Only 32 applied, and 24 were regarded as suitable for examination and 16 were found on interview to be suitable for training.  We need far more.  When I spoke of foreign fishermen, I was referring to the possibility that we might develop some of these processing plants.  I am speaking of processing in the form of canning.  If the processors cannot get their full requirements, mainly for the export trade, from Irish fishermen, I would naturally be obliged to license foreign fishermen to come in and to take part in the operation. If I find that there is an inadequate number of fishing vessels to cater for the whole of the processing trade, the home trade and the export trade, the same thing applies.  As soon as these opportunities are afforded Irishmen should be encouraged to come along to be trained knowing that the quotas cannot be filled because of the expansion of the industry.  As I have said, all that depends on a number of projects succeeding in the future which are still under examination.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon suggested we would have steam trawlers here.  I do not think any steam trawlers are being built.  They are all diesel trawlers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he said we should have no trawlers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he said if they came, they would be steam trawlers. They do not build steam trawlers now but diesel trawlers.  I should like to give some idea of what a well-trained skipper and crew working for a period of 40 weeks can earn on a 56-foot boat. These are men with a gift for fishing. An industrious fisherman working under a competent skipper can earn as much as £50 for a good week's herring fishing.  Over a working period of 40 weeks, his earnings may average up to £18 a week which is the equivalent of £14 a week for a full year.  These figures are additional to the cost of food while <Col N="1245" /> on board the fishing boat.  The fishing week at present rarely exceeds five days and the average is probably less than four days.</P>
      <P>A skipper can earn anything from £1,000 to £1,500 a year after paying all his dues on a 56-foot boat.  Those are the actual records of boats on hire-purchase from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  We know the figures.  Perhaps there is an element of good luck in some returns, but at least trained skippers and trained fishermen can earn a good living.  This should be an inducement to anyone who has a taste for an occupation that is dangerous but which can be tremendously interesting to a person who has a taste for the sea. I am giving these figures as an inducement to young men who like the sea to take up training and to join our fishing fleets.</P>
      <P>With regard to the need for more fishermen, I can give some idea of the number we require.  Our landings of demersal fish, that is to say, exclusive of mackerel, herring, sprat and other pelagic fish, in 1957, were 260,000 cwts. If we were to increase this figure by 50 per cent, by means of boats each of which would land 4,000 cwts. a year and carry a crew of nine, we would need 300 additional full-time fishermen. We have now reached a critical point where we barely have enough applicants for Bord Iascaigh Mhara boats for the last three years simply to make progress with the present small but steady increase in the fish intake which has taken place since 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope there will be more applicants because, whereas there was a period when the boatyard capacity was not sufficient to supply boats, over the past three years, there have been just sufficient applicants regarded as suitable for the boats, and this year we are looking for more.  I might add that no one could be discouraged from taking a boat by the results of either the 1956 or 1957 seasons.  There was nothing either in the value or the amount of fish caught to discourage anyone.  Both showed an increase. There was no sign of a coming slump. There was no major disaster of any kind in the fishing market at that time.  The fish market has been <Col N="1246" /> extremely good in this country, with the exception of very short periods.</P>
    <P>It has been much too good for the consumer recently because the fishing has been very poor over the past two or three months for ourselves and for the British in the Irish Sea and off the south coast, due, it is believed, to the very poor weather conditions and to the east wind.  Good prices have been given for the fish that have been caught.  Some fishermen have found it very difficult to make good catches and the prices of many fish have been very high.  Nevertheless, taking the whole period over the last three or four years, there is nothing to discourage young men from coming forward to join the fishing industry.  We certainly need more of them.</P>
    <P>Many observations have been made about the three trawlers that were purchased.  One would think that the occasion of the purchase of these offshore trawlers was the only one in the history of the State when a State company undertook some transaction of an experimental character and made considerable losses on it.  To hear Deputy Dillon talking, amusingly, but, I think, rather insultingly, about Deputy Bartley's efforts in this direction, you would think it was the only time a State company had made a mistake. State companies and private companies occasionally find that their efforts in a particular development are not successful. I admit the history of these trawlers has been rather unhappy.  I do not think anybody expected that the engines would break down or that there would have been difficulties in their maintenance.  Anyway, the facts are that they are operating now and being used for training.  They have been found suitable for fishing on the eastern coast and I think the money recently put into re-engining them will be worth while from the point of view of their capacity for training.  This will be as economic a method as any other for providing fishing capacity for training purposes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde referred to Kilmore Harbour.  Kilmore has been inspected by the harbour consultants. He made a suggestion, I think, that we might adopt the use of second-hand boats.  We find that a great many of the second-hand boats mentioned to us are out of date, though there may be exceptions, and we do not encourage the policy of issuing loans for second-hand boats.</P>
      <P>Deputy Palmer and Deputy Desmond referred to the fact that frequently fish is not available near seaports and that fish is not available in a great many centres.  There has been an increase in the number of retail outlets for fish in the past year.  Obviously, we could not increase the intake of fish by 41 per cent. unless these outlets had expanded.  Far more are needed.  I hope the ending of the dispute between the wholesale interests and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will result in the expansion of retail outlets and more trade in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason fishermen send their fish to Dublin is twofold.  In the first place, they are accustomed to work with a particular auctioneer and they feel they will get the best price for their fish in Dublin.  Secondly, in outlying places, they fill a lorry completely with fish, as far as they can.  The more fish they put in the lorry going to Dublin, the less it costs each fisherman for his <Col N="1249" /> fish.  Therefore, you get cases such as in Castletownbere, for example, where very little fish is retailed in the neighbouring district because the lorry leaves two or three times a week for Dublin.</P>
    <P>The fishermen get accustomed to their personal contact in Dublin.  There are Bord Iascaigh Mhara agents in most of the important ports who will arrange for the auctioning of fish locally, who will arrange to dispose of it locally.  The difficulty is that there are far too few private merchants who are prepared to pay what the fishermen consider to be the Dublin price and to take the fish in their vans and distribute it throughout the country. The fact that this goes on in certain ports shows what can be done.  The irregular supplies of fish make local retailing difficult.  A man may be accustomed to take his van to a seaport on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.  There are overheads in connection with this operation.  He has to make his rounds.  If, in bad weather, there are very considerable periods when no fish are left over, after Dublin has taken its requirements, it does not pay that man to go looking for supplies of fish which are not available. The only possible solution is more fish, more regularly supplied, with less acute periods of scarcity due not always to disastrous weather but simply to poor weather conditions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne referred to fish landed at Helvic.  I am given to understand that fish can be sold either to private buyers through the agent of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara or sent to Dublin.  I have not heard any suggestion of any kind of racket that exists whereby only a certain amount of fish will be bought.  I should be very glad to have more information from Deputy Kyne about that.  This is the first occasion in the past 15 months that I have been told that, in a particular place, the only persons to whom the fish can be sold refuse to take more than a certain amount and that there are no other outlets.  I should like further information on that matter because, from my point of view, it is a most unusual experience.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies referred to the need for improving the cooking of fish.  I am <Col N="1250" /> glad to say a circular is now about to be issued from the Department of Education. It advocates that vocational education committees should approve a course in fish cookery in their curriculum. Fish cooking is not taught in a great many technical schools.  In view of the importance of the industry, I hope the cookery courses will include fish in future.  Advertisements of fish recipes have been published jointly by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the merchants, which have been very highly praised.  Cookery books have been issued.  A lot of work has been done in that regard but I think probably more should be done in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles was rather unkind to the fish retailers in the Midlands.  If he makes inquiries, I think he will find that recently the retail outlets, at least in Navan and Kells, have improved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are retailers in Navan who are even purchasing fish daily from the Dublin wholesale markets.  I agree with the Deputy that we need to make further extensions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moloney referred to some difficulties of fish marketing in Dingle. In that connection, about half the fishermen of Dingle sell their fish on commission and the other half by means of a fixed price arrangement. The fixed price arrangement is not satisfactory.  I do not think it is of any ultimate advantage to the fishermen. Probably it will slowly be given up.  I do not think it has been at all successful, in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the fact that, at some meetings of fishermen, no Opposition Deputy was invited.  I have had more invitations from associations of fishermen than I can possibly accept in a short period. I have been around many of the fishing centres, on the invitation of fishermen's associations or a local development association, or a combination of the merchants and the fishermen.  I leave it to the association to make the arrangements when inviting local Deputies.  That is the normal thing. Occasionally, I have had purely private conferences on rather more technical matters when there was no question of <Col N="1251" /> a Deputy attending unless he particularly wanted to.</P>

      <P>I leave it to the association to issue the invitation.  Sometimes they notify county councillors. At other times, they feel the nature of the meeting will be such that the county councillors need not be notified.</P>
      <P>Deputy Palmer said no boat had been awarded in the Kerry area.  Recently, we issued a 56-foot boat to a Kerry fisherman.  The question was asked whether the boats built in Irish yards are more expensive than those built elsewhere.  I am told that the costings in the boatyards are under constant review and that the prices are reasonably competitive.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan and Deputy Cunningham raised the question of two harbours in County Donegal, Killybegs and Greencastle.  I am very glad to say that in connection with the initial work of the harbour consultant it has been found possible, in those cases, to proceed with some development work which will not in any event conflict with the harbour consultant's report on later development.  If I can find any other instances where improvements can be effected without waiting for the major plan of the harbour consultant, in respect of the major harbours, I shall see that the work is expedited as far as possible.  In those two cases it appears to be possible to go ahead.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies asked about grants for harbour work.  They are subject to a contribution of 50 per cent. by the county council and have to be maintained by them.  I shall make every effort to encourage county councils to make these contributions to harbours which are regarded as satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> Deputy Coogan asked for information about the Galway ice plant.  Here was a case of a plant of a particular size which, in fact, need not have been as large in the first instance.  It was authorised some time in 1953 or 1954 as a National Development Fund project and the project was taken over by the Government which took over in April, 1954.  It was up to that Government, before they put the project in its final form, and before they encouraged An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to go ahead with the plan, to make quite sure that increasing supplies of fish would be available to a greater degree, and whether the plant in that particular form was of the right size.  In fact, there was only one application for a boat from the Galway area in 1954 and 1955 and the building did not commence until some time in 1956.  It was up to the board, first of all, in my view, and secondly up to the Minister in charge of Fisheries, to look into the project and ask: &ldquo;Should this be so large, if there are insufficient applications for boats and no sign of the fish intake showing some signs of expansion?&rdquo; If that had been done, they might have proposed that a smaller plant could have been built.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there was a change made in the character of the Gaeltacht boat scheme.  The Gaeltacht boat scheme was not initiated by Deputy Dillon.  He seems to forget that sanction for the £80,000 was issued in the time of the Fianna Fáil Government, before its fall in 1954, and, I am glad to say, was taken on by the new Government.  In connection with that scheme it was felt that it would be good to have a number of fishermen, in the first instance, from Galway working together and speaking Irish over the radio telephone to one another.  These were expected to increase the intake of the processing plant.  A change was made and fishermen from all parts of the country were chosen and the potential capacity of the Galway plant was reduced in that way.</P>
    <P>I hope every effort will be made to use the Galway plant.  I hope fishing will expand in Galway.  I hope we shall have more applications for boats from the Galway area.  It is my hope <Col N="1253" /> that the plant will become useful in time, but I am afraid it was the responsibility of the board, and the Department of Fisheries, at that time and before the plans were finally sanctioned, to look again at the potential fishing capacity in Galway because the plans could have been modified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have very few applications from that area, and, as the Deputy knows, most of the harbours in the Mayo district are not suitable for the large boats.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Coogan also asked for more protection for the oyster beds.  He seems to have forgotten that in the new Fisheries Act, which is about to be signed by the President, arrangements have been made for the Galway board of conservators to protect the oyster beds.  Our experts are down there fairly constantly doing their best to maintain the oyster production, and research is being carried out in Clew Bay to see what more can be done to expand the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the officials refuse to commit themselves, except to speak <Col N="1254" /> of a limited success.  It may be very difficult to restore the oyster beds.  At one time oysters were a penny each and were the poor man's food.  In the last 100 years, they have become a luxury food due to diseases and so on. Deputy Coogan asked a question about the Lough Corrib Canal intake.  The cost of keeping the water from seeping through the swallow-holes would be very high and would even result in claims for damage from people with water rights.  The water coming into the swallow-holes quite possibly supplies wells several miles away.  It would be a most expensive and difficult procedure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan referred to the speed with which the Erne inquiry was conducted.  There were 28 days left to appeal against the decision and no effort was made to appeal.  Once again I should say the by-law prohibiting fishing in the tidal waters was for the purpose of restoring the livelihood of the fishermen concerned, because runs of salmon had reached a dangerously low level.  Some Deputies asked me again to assert that the revenue from the increased rod licences, and the Salmon Conservancy Fund, would go back 100 per cent. to the boards.  I should like to repeat that since the rod licence fees have been changed, we have ways and means of securing that each board will continue to receive a fair proportion of the revenue and there will be no reduction in the revenue received, as between one board and another, as a result of the change.</P>
      <P>One Deputy referred to Dingle and to hire-purchase instalments.  Instalments should be paid regularly by fishermen.  The board found it necessary to see that the fishermen had a clear sheet before they entered new transactions and that they would honour their obligations.  The arrangements for credit sales are quite reasonable and most fishermen appear to be able to discharge their obligations in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Giles referred to the difficulties in the Boyne river.  Research has been continuing in regard to that, and Bord na Móna are showing the utmost co-operation. <Col N="1255" /> I hope some progress will be made.  In the meantime, fry have been put into the Boyne river to restore the position as far as possible. The mussel industry will not be destroyed by the drainage operations in Drogheda harbour.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wycherley referred to the work of the Inland Fisheries Trust in County Cork.  He was being a little pessimistic.  The work will be done in County Cork for inland fisheries.  The Reenydonegan lake will be closed from the sea for the purpose of developing sea trout there.  Lough Avaul has been the subject of predatory removal and work has also been done on Inchigeela Lake.</P>
    <P>I think that is all I need say on this Estimate.  I have covered almost all the important points raised by Deputies.  I should like again to thank the House for the many sympathetic observations made.  I should also like to indicate again that when I speak hopefully of progress in the fishery industry and when I make statements indicating that great progress can be made, I do not underestimate the difficulty.  It is one of the most complex industries in the world&mdash;the fishery industry in all its aspects, from the catching of the fish to its processing and retailing.  I believe there is hope for the future, and the plans which have been put into operation this year should, I think, contribute to the prosperity of our fisheries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,147,410 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission (44 &amp; 45 Vict., c. 49, sec. 46, and c. 71, sec. 4; 48 &amp; 49 Vict., c. 73, secs. 17, 18 and 20; 54 &amp; 55 Vict., c. 48; 3 Edw. 7, c. 37; 7 Edw. 7, c. 38 and c. 56; 9 Edw. 7, c. 42; Nos 27 and 42 of 1923; No. 25 of 1925; No. 11 of 1926; No. 19 of 1927; No. 31 of 1929; No. 11 of 1931; Nos. 33 and 38 of 1933; No. 11 of 1934; No. 41 of 1936; No. 26 of 1939; No. 12 of 1946; No. 25 of 1949; No. 16 of 1950; No. 18 of 1953; and No. 21 of 1954).</P>
      <P>In opening the debate I shall commence with some references to the major sub-heads which are very familiar to Deputies from rural constituencies. I shall then give an account of the progress made last year and, after that, I shall go on to deal with the main aspects of administration connected with this important Vote.</P>
      <P>The net total of £2,009,380 for 1958-59 shows a decrease of £26,890 on the corresponding figure last year.</P>
      <P>The provision in sub-head A for salaries, wages and allowances shows a decrease of £11,088.  Normal incremental increases for staff are more than offset by a welcome reduction of 33 in personnel which has been achieved since last Estimate through improved methods and the general progress made in the vesting of lands in tenant purchasers. Incidentally, staff reductions totalling 189 have been effected since 1950, notwithstanding the fact that the overall volume of current land division has remained substantially the same.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the rate of expenditure in recent years, a reduction of £1,500 in sub-head E, for legal expenses, is considered feasible this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head G, for collection of warrant fees, was raised last year by £3,000 to provide against an anticipated increase in the scale of these lodgment <Col N="1257" /> fees for county registrars' and sheriffs' services.  The increase has not materialised and it is expected that a provision of £6,500 will be sufficient this year.</P>
    <P>The group of sub-heads, H (1) to H (4), represents the large annual recurring liability of the taxpayer towards service of land purchase debt, incurred by Land Bond issues since 1923.  The total of the group comes to £855,050, representing almost 43 per cent. of the net total of the Estimate. The group includes&mdash;£720,000 for halving of annuities; £88,400 for Price Bonus to Vendors of Tenanted Land; £28,800 for Costs Fund; £17,200 for resale losses on Land Bank and analogous estates dealt with in the 1920s.</P>
    <P>The increase of £14,500 is entirely attributable to the halving of annuities on current allotments on lands taken over under Land Acts, 1923-54.  The current Land Bond interest rate is 6 per cent. and the current annuity rate is 6¼ per cent. per annum.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I provides the funds required for improvement works on estates taken over in the course of land settlement.  These works include the equipment of new holdings with buildings and the construction of roads, fences, drains, etc., which are essential for satisfactory land settlement schemes.  Over 30 per cent. of the net total of the Estimate is chargeable to this sub-head.  The expenditure under sub-head I last year amounted to £623,761.  The Estimate provision for this year is £605,105, which is £18,656 less than the amount expended last year.</P>
    <P>With improved arrangements and insistence on reasonable contributions of self-help from allottees who stand to benefit greatly and permanently, it is envisaged that at least as much effective work will be secured from the slightly reduced Estimate provision for this year as was forthcoming heretofore.  If it should become clear during the year that additional funds are desirable to facilitate the early disposal of acquired lands, then I shall have no hesitation in putting forward revised proposals.</P>
    <P>Sub-head Q which shows an increase <Col N="1258" /> of £1,400 is another accumulating statutory commitment.  Its purpose is to make good to the Land Bond Fund and Local Loans Fund certain deficiencies which continue to arise under Land Act, 1950.  Formerly, where the Land Commission acquired a large vested holding for division, the existing purchase annuity was redeemed out of the owner's purchase money and the Land Bond Fund or Local Loans Fund was recouped if that annuity had been payable to either of these funds. Since 1950, existing annuities are no longer recoverable out of owners' purchase moneys.  Instead, the existing annuities are formally terminated, being replaced by the new comprehensive annuities payable by the allottees. Cesser of such existing annuities has to be made good to the Land Bond Fund and Local Loans Fund to keep them in balance.</P>
    <P>Sub-head R provides a limited amount of cash to enable the Land Commission to purchase lands in the open market for migrants and rundale purposes.  Operations under this sub-head were at a standstill as an economy measure between July, 1956, and March, 1958.  I have recently authorised a reopening of this business and it will be given a further trial at about the same level of funds formerly provided.</P>
    <P>Sub-head S provides the money to pay gratuities to persons displaced from their employment on estates as a result of acquisition by the Land Commission. There has been a downward trend in the size of acquired estates and the number losing employment has fallen.  A total of £14,643 has been paid by the Land Commission by way of gratuities to 137 persons since the system was introduced in 1950.</P>
    <P>The other sub-heads are mostly self-explanatory and unchanged from last year.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the general work of the Land Commission in the course of the past year.  On the tenanted land side, the process of completing land purchase, that is, the conversion of tenants into proprietors of their holdings, is continuing at a satisfactory rate.  Of 112,000 tenanted holdings <Col N="1259" /> which vested in the Land Commission since 1923, only about 12,000 now await revesting in the tenants.  In other words, 90 per cent. of all tenanted holdings which vested in the Land Commission under the Land Acts, 1923-54, have been resold to the occupying tenants for advances being repaid by long-term purchase annuities, leaving an outstanding residue of 10 per cent., comprising exceptionally difficult cases, mostly in the western congested districts.  As far as 1923 Act tenanted land is concerned, the work has been virtually completed in the 14 counties of Carlow, Cavan, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow. The outstanding residue of tenanted land is made up of 12,000 holdings under the 1923 Act and an ultimate residue of 4,000 holdings on estates of the former Congested Districts Board. These outstanding 16,000 tenanted holdings represent the pending residual hard core of over 400,000 State-conducted sale transactions.  Completion of the outstanding 16,000 cases is not an easy or inexpensive task.  About one-half of them are in rundale.  They are all affected in some way by projected acquisitions, migrations, rearrangement negotiations or other improvement schemes.  Their completion is being pushed ahead as rapidly as the available resources in land and staff permit.</P>
    <P>As regards land settlement, the provisional returns are that, in the year ended 31st March last, an area of 27,813 acres was acquired, resumed, or taken over by the Land Commission, and an area of 29,604 acres was distributed amongst 1,686 allottees.  The corresponding figures for the year ended 31st March, 1957, were 28,756 acres taken over and 30,510 acres distributed amongst 1,452 allottees. Taking account of late seasonal weather, the allotment programme extended into April and May this year, and the total area allotted in the 14 months, 1st April, 1957, to 31st May, 1958, inclusive, was, in round figures, 41,000 acres.  The total allotment in the previous corresponding 14-month <Col N="1260" /> period, viz. 1st April, 1956, to 31st May, 1957, was 36,000 acres.</P>
    <P>There were 438 holdings in rundale or intermixed plots rearranged during the year with the co-operation of the tenants, this result being quite satisfactory. The number of holdings which can be rearranged is largely beyond the control of the Land Commission, as the work depends on voluntary co-operation of the tenants themselves. Rearrangement is very delicately-poised work calling for much patience, tact and resourcefulness on the part of the inspectorate.  Difficulties and delays are inevitable and lack of co-operation on the part of an individual tenant can often result in the postponement or revision of an entire scheme.</P>
    <P>As the work of rearrangement proceeds and as the hard core of intermixed holdings is being reached, the problem of dealing with outstanding cases inevitably becomes more difficult. My investigations have revealed that the precise reasons for this vary from one district to another.  Generally speaking, however, the main factors impeding progress are the scarcity of suitable land, in the rundale districts, with which to enlarge the small holdings and reluctance on the part of suitable rundale holders to migrate to other districts, as well as sometimes a want of full co-operation on the part of the tenants.  Nevertheless, over the past eight years, a total of almost 3,500 rundale holdings has been rearranged by the Land Commission, the vast bulk being substantially enlarged in size and equipped with necessary buildings and other improvements, in the process of rearrangement.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware, of course, that the great bulk of land settlement is centred around the nine congested counties, viz. the five counties of Connacht and Donegal, Cork, Clare and Kerry.  Of the total area of 29,604 acres allotted in the year ended 31st March last, about 21,000 acres were distributed in the nine congested counties.</P>
    <P>During the past year, 40 long-distance and 35 short-distance migrations were effected.  Migration is inseparable from rearrangement of rundale, it being absolutely essential to take out a few migrants from almost <Col N="1261" /> any group of intermixed holdings before a satisfactory rearrangement scheme can be formulated for them. As far as practicable, the Land Commission endeavour to find migrants who are already proficient farmers above the average, but, to deal at all with rundale villages, the field of selection of the migrants is rather limited.  Migration is completely voluntary and it is not always the best farmers who are prepared to move.  I am confident that the number of migrants during the current year will show a substantial increase on last year.</P>
    <P>More than 1,100 turbary rights were provided by the Land Commission. Some 6,500 properties&mdash;comprising holdings, parcels and rights of turbary &mdash;were vested in tenant-purchasers during the year.</P>
    <P>There were 212 new dwellinghouses and 264 outoffices built by or with assistance from the Land Commission, the total expenditure on buildings amounting to approximately £273,000.</P>
    <P>I referred last year to the question of Land Commission housing designs and stated that, before going ahead with some new plans which had been contemplated, I wished to get the views of the Irish Countrywomen's Association.  As a result, revised plans have been drawn up, following collaboration between architects of the Office of Public Works and the Irish Countrywomen's Association.  The construction of prototypes, on an experimental basis, according to the revised plans, will shortly be put in hands.</P>
    <P>As I announced some months ago, the Government has decided to provide relief measures for the farmers whose holdings in the Shannon Valley, between Athlone and Meelick, in counties Galway, Roscommon, Westmeath and Offaly, are liable to flooding.  Planning of technical details for the individual cases is well advanced.  Some migrations and resettlements will be involved, as well as the construction of buildings on about 70 farms seriously affected.  The cost of the works, as distinct from land, will be in the region of £80,000 to £100,000, which will be defrayed from the National Development Fund.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1262" /> The position as regards collection of land purchase annuities continues to be very satisfactory.  At 31st March, 1958, arrears outstanding amounted to £141,690 being a reduction of £872 on the corresponding figure last year.  The efficiency of the collection organisation has been maintained at the usual high level during the year.</P>
    <P>In my statement on this Estimate last year, I expressed concern about delay in the allotment of land taken over for division.  I had, at that time, given directions in relation to the early disposal of unallotted lands in two of the principal counties, namely, Roscommon and Tipperary.  I am glad to be able to inform the House now that good progress has since been made towards the disposal of lands on hands &mdash;especially arable lands&mdash;in these counties; and the achievements to date reflect great credit on the officials concerned.</P>
    <P>In County Roscommon, an area of 2,100 acres was allotted in the year ended 31st March last&mdash;compared with 1,135 acres in 1956-57&mdash;and in County Tipperary, an area of almost 1,000 acres was allotted last year compared with 874 acres in the previous year.  In both counties, the areas allotted in 1957-58 were almost entirely arable land.  Further areas of 2,700 acres in Roscommon and 980 acres in Tipperary were allotted during April and May, 1958.  The effort to dispose of the backlog of lands on hands will be sustained; and I have directed that arable lands acquired before 1st April last in all counties should generally be disposed of by March, 1960.</P>
    <P>The allotment of lands acquired by the Land Commission in the future will be hastened to the utmost, so as to ensure that approved allottees are put into possession of their parcels speedily.  There will necessarily have to be some exceptions&mdash;for example, relatively small lots of land taken over for rearrangement purposes cannot be finally allotted until full rearrangement proposals are integrated for the particular neighbourhood, with the co-operation of all concerned.</P>
    <P>Examination of the overall position regarding lands on hands inevitably <Col N="1263" /> took some time, and the results of my directions for their disposal will not be really evident until the end of the current financial year.  The allotment figures for April and May, 1958, however, suggest that the prospects for the whole year are very bright.</P>
    <P>With a view to securing greater output from lands divided by the Land Commission, every effort must be made in future to ensure that allottees avail themselves to the full of the advisory services provided by the Department of Agriculture and county committees of agriculture.  In the case of migrants, it was felt that some advance instruction on good farming methods might stimulate them to seek this valuable assistance.  Accordingly, prospective migrants were encouraged last autumn to take advantage of two short courses provided at Athenry Agricultural Station by arrangement with the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>A number of prospective migrants attended these courses&mdash;the cost of which, per individual, was a nominal £2 a week for maintenance&mdash;and it is hoped to arrange a further series of these special courses in the coming winter.  The majority of migrants come from small holdings, generally comprising poor quality land, and the change-over to working a Land Commission standard holding may be a considerable one for them, especially in the early years following migration until they settle down in their new environment.  Courses on practical farming such as those arranged at Athenry should be very beneficial in equipping them to meet the challenge of their new holdings but it will not be possible for a few years to assess the full advantages of these courses.</P>
    <P>Land Commission allotments are made to selected applicants on moderate repayment terms.  The funds available for land settlement are necessarily limited and, in order to secure the maximum land division from the amount of money available, it has been decided that future allottees of parcels given as enlargements will be required to make reasonable contributions by way of labour and materials towards essential improvements works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> Special consideration was given during the past year to the problem of minimising the disruptive effects of the compulsory acquisition powers of the Land Commission.  Despite the long-term benefits resulting from the acquisition and division of land which is not being worked satisfactorily, some detrimental effects can occur from time to time during the period in which the acquisition process is under way.</P>
    <P>At 1st April, 1957, the Land Commission inspectorate were faced with the formidable task of inspecting and reporting on 938 properties which were on the books for consideration with a view to acquisition.  Of these cases, 516 were at a preliminary stage and 422 were at a more advanced stage. The total number represented far more than the inspectorate could hope to deal with expeditiously.  With the constant addition of new cases, the overall position was seriously disimproving. In effect, it meant that almost 1,000 existing landowners and several thousand potential applicants were in a very unsettled position.</P>
    <P>After a thorough examination, substantial procedural changes were introduced in the course of the past year. They relate to the period preceding the commissioners' decision as to whether, or not, to negotiate for purchase or institute acquisition proceedings. After that stage, the procedure is largely governed by statute.  Under the old system, both voluntary and compulsory subjects generally underwent the same two successive report stages, namely, (1) preliminary and (2) suitability and price.  That system involved two visits by the reporting inspector.  A detailed valuation of the lands was invariably made at the suitability-and-price stage, although further progress may not have been indicated.</P>
    <P>Under the new system, voluntary and compulsory subjects receive distinct treatment, there being only one report stage, namely purchase and acquisition.  This new arrangement generally involves only one visit by the reporting inspector compared with <Col N="1265" /> two visits previously.  A detailed valuation of the lands is omitted, unless there are sound indications that further progress towards purchase is feasible.  Obviously, the new system has decided advantages from the standpoint of efficiency.  The general aim will be that each acquisition case will be investigated and completed, up to price-fixation, within about six months.  It is of the utmost importance that effort and expense will not be dissipated, particularly on trivial cases.</P>
    <P>Having improved the inspection procedure, the next step was to afford the inspectorate an opportunity of clearing off the accumulated arrears. With about 45,000 acres arable on hands and with over 900 pending acquisition cases in the queue, it was time to be realistic.  The investigation of new compulsory acquisition cases had to be temporarily suspended but any lands offered voluntarily were not affected.  This course has been fully justified by the results.  By 31st March, 1958, the figure for acquisition reports outstanding had fallen from 938 to 372&mdash;a reduction of 60 per cent.  After another few months, it is expected that the arrear on the acquisition side will have been entirely eliminated.  In some districts, clearance of arrears of work has already been accomplished. A return to normal working has followed in these districts.  Elsewhere, the position is being kept under close review.</P>
    <P>I also expressed concern last year about the long time which may elapse between the inspection of an estate and ultimate payment of the purchase money.  On investigation, I have found that the time-lag is divisible into two stages&mdash;first, the period up to the giving of possession to the Land Commission; and secondly, the period from possession onwards.  Up to last year, when the procedural changes to which I have referred were introduced, the average time taken in completing the first and second stages was three years and two and a half years respectively, or a total of five and a half years.  Statutory periods for objections and appeals cannot be set aside by the Land Commission and allowance <Col N="1266" /> must be made for adjournments granted to objectors and applicants in the court proceedings.  Nevertheless, I am confident that the procedural changes referred to earlier will help to shorten substantially the initial period of three years up to possession.</P>
    <P>Only when the second stage is reached, that is after possession of the land is obtained, can allocation of the purchase money arise, and there the average delay of two and a half years is something for which the Land Commission are not responsible.  It is for the owners themselves to see that they give their solicitors prompt and effective instructions about title.  My Department is at present in communication with the Incorporated Law Society in relation to this side of the business.</P>
    <P>I should like, at this stage, to say a few words about the extent of the congestion problem confronting the Land Commission and also to consider the practical steps which can be taken towards its alleviation in the immediate future.  I speak of alleviation rather than solution, simply because congestion in this country cannot be solved in terms of land alone.  According to the latest available figures of 379,000 holdings in the State, 215,000, or nearly 57 per cent., have rateable valuations between £2 and £20.  In the nine congested counties, some 87,000 holdings are between £2 and £10 rateable valuation.</P>
    <P>Since 1939, the aim of the land settlement policy of successive Governments has been the relief of congestion, with special emphasis on the scheduled congested districts.  The Land Commission have been migrating as many tenants as possible each year as part of the answer to the congestion problem.  Likewise, they have been engaged in the rearrangement or enlargement of about 1,500 small holdings annually.  These measures do much to ease the extensive congestion in western districts.  It is estimated that there are still about 8,000 unvested intermixed holdings in the nine congested counties and, at the recent rate of progress, it will take 15 years to complete their rearrangement.</P>
    <P>Some idea of the magnitude of the <Col N="1267" /> general problem of small holdings uncovers itself in the figure of 165,000 as the number of holdings above one acre but not exceeding 30 acres: to enlarge these by no more than a dozen acres would require about 2,000,000 acres, that is one-sixth of the total area of arable land in the country.  The fact is that the amount of land available for land settlement purposes is limited but the demand is almost unlimited. The current Land Commission programme catering for an intake and division of about 25,000 acres annually is as realistic as overall conditions permit.</P>
    <P>For many years past, in the more western parts of the congested districts, the Land Commission have worked to a standard of £10 rateable valuation, that is to say, they have aimed at creating new units of that size or enlarging existing units as far as possible to that size.  It has often been suggested that this standard is too low and, therefore, I have had this whole problem re-examined.  Unfortunately, I have found that in most districts the intensity of congestion and the scarcity of land for division make it quite impractical to raise the standard.  Indeed, in many areas the Land Commission have found it quite impracticable to achieve even this modest standard and have been obliged to adopt a lower one.  For almost all these districts, therefore, there can be no question of going beyond the £10 rateable valuation standard.</P>
    <P>In my examination of Land Commission problems, I am bound to face the unpleasant fact that the size of what is considered an economic farm has increased since the war.  In this we must be realistic.  While there will always be ancillary employment on public works, the income from these, in the long run, will not prevent the tendency for farms to become larger as the decades pass&mdash;even if the total population remains stable or slightly increases.</P>
    <P>Unemployment assistance, moreover, should not be included in the computation as a permanent income, particularly as it does not appear to restrain emigration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> When I ask the question in the Midlands: &ldquo;What is an economic farm?&rdquo; most reply, &ldquo;50 to 60 acres&rdquo;.  But, of course, one-third of the farmers in the 30-50 acre class are making the incomes of one-third in the 50-100 acre class through greater use of fertilisers.</P>
    <P>In examining the position, the prevailing standard of £10 valuation in the congested areas seems abnormally small.  This very low standard can be looked at from two standpoints.  It can be said that each beneficiary is given a good start and can progress from there onwards; at least the beneficiaries have a sound foundation in the shape of a good home and a compact farm.  Or alternatively, one can say that the valuation is absolutely too low.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that the £10 standard should be raised wherever practicable and this will henceforth be done up to a limit of £15. Because of the scarcity of available land in these acutely congested districts, I am not overoptimistic as to the results.  In the remaining parts of the country, the standard of 33 acres of good land remains in force and, again, if the farmers selected are ambitious, a reasonable income can be secured.</P>
    <P>Concluding on the subject of farm size, I might point out that all European countries carrying out consolidation of holdings have had to keep their standards low&mdash;notably France, Sweden and the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the congestion problem be regarded with great realism.  The number of 50 to 200 acre farms is increasing; not so the farms above 200 acres.  I mention this point because occasionally I hear reference to big farmers increasing their property. There are, of course, also sales and sub-divisions to balance these enlargements.  Consolidation of small holdings by the management of a number of farms by one person has proceeded rapidly in the western areas.  The number of women left on the smaller farms irrevocably dictates the growth in the number of larger farms 30 years from now.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission is most unlikely to secure greater subventions in <Col N="1269" /> the future for its work.  The pool of badly worked land is almost certain to diminish.  I asked the Land Commission to tell me whether, without limit to staff or finance, the intake of land could be substantially increased, assuming, of course, that the same regulations applied.  While it is difficult to be definite I have been given an opinion that the intake might increase for a time by about 25 per cent. but it will be clear to all that the amount of land which can be acquired is limited.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear beyond all doubt that the Government stands for the free sale of land when properly worked.  Any agitation or interference in the normal pattern of land sales will be resisted as in the past.  The Land Commission work has been confined in the past decade and will be confined in the future to the problem of alleviating the intense congestion in the West and to acquiring the larger tracts of badly worked land and of voluntarily offered land for this purpose and for the relief of local congestion.  The result of this work, involving gifts of £400 to £3,000 per holding, must be directed so as to secure greater production as an investment in providing total employment.</P>
    <P>I am doing all I can to see that the pattern of land division will conform to this concept more and more in the future and that the available funds are spent in the most productive manner.</P>
    <P>Looking back on the results of land division in the past, while there can be seen many enlarged or new holdings producing more than before, the general picture as reported by the late Seán Moylan could not prove that production on small farms had increased.  Thirteen per cent. of the land allotted in a sample area is now let.</P>
    <P>I have made a close examination of the Land Commission methods of allocation for some years past and quite obviously as the pool of land has diminished the emphasis on the farming competence of potential allottees has been steadily increasing when allocating land.  For example, I have been reading recent reports on allottees in order to analyse the reasons for including sub-standard landholders and I have noted that the frequent use of fertiliser is noted <Col N="1270" /> together with other technical features. This would seem reasonable.  A small farm can reap just as good a harvest of grass or crops from its use as a big farm.  Credit for fertilisers, I am told, is available to most in one form or another.  The size of the farm does not make it more difficult to use fertilisers.</P>
    <P>If land settlement is to achieve its purpose, two objectives must be secured.  Badly worked land must be acquired to provide a better living for progressive uneconomic landholders. The allottees who receive a large gift, the largest the State offers to a family unit for social purposes, of from £36 to £87 per acre, should, by far greater production, help to employ some of the thousands who, as in other countries, will inevitably leave the farms to secure employment in industry.</P>
    <P>The farmer creates the purchasing power which makes possible the employment of some of his family who will leave even if he secures a larger holding because on 33 acre holdings there can be no sub-division.</P>
    <P>The standard of competence required should relate to the higher standards achieved in the general area, to the improvements in techniques carried out during recent years and allowing for local conditions of soil and exposure. In other words, under present practice the best group of small farmers in the area naturally set the standard for the remainder in the area when land is being allotted.</P>
    <P>I have informed the Land Commission that the increasingly high standard of competence required of potential allottees&mdash;quite clearly emerging from allotments made in the last decade&mdash; can be continued and applied progressively. Having reviewed the general facts relating to land tenure in the country, I can sum up by saying that the demand for land is beyond the capacity of the Land Commission to satisfy.  The same position obtains in many other countries.  Not only do sub-standard landholders press for consideration of their claims but there are demands from landless men and sons of farmers for land.</P>
    <P>With such a heavy burden of claims already, I should make it clear that to add these other classes generally to a <Col N="1271" /> land inspector's list from which to make a choice when dividing an estate only aggravates the already difficult task of relieving existing congestion.  While there may be exceptional cases, the fact remains that in any ordinary land division the number of applications from the local uneconomic landholders exceeds the supply of land and a careful choice has to be made.</P>
    <P>In the last 12 months, some farmers' organisations and individual commentators have been adverting to the need for providing a farming ladder by means of which young farmers with a belief in scientific methods could save money and secure land in the open market.  Many interested in land usage have commented on the unique systems of conacre and 11 months grazing which give no security to the taker and too frequently reduce the fertility of the land.  It is evident that a large proportion of the land affected is being let as a matter of temporary convenience and that the Land Commission, under the law, could not take successful acquisition proceedings in a very large number of these cases; in many others they would be proceeding for very small areas for allotment to one or two individuals&mdash;a completely uneconomic and socially undesirable policy.</P>
    <P>I have been addressing my mind to the subject of the letting of lands in order to help the progressive landless farmer and to stimulate the better working of let land.</P>
    <P>The existing law leaves it possible for the majority of landowners to make lettings for a term of years subject only to Land Commission approval and I would like the public to know that the Land Commission will readily grant approval to suitable letting contracts except, of course, where they see too much land being concentrated in the hands of one person or of persons not ordinarily engaged in agriculture.  I feel that landowners, with surplus land for letting, can profitably avail themselves of this facility both for the better working of their own lands and in the interests of national production and rural progress.</P>
    <P>In order not to interfere with the <Col N="1272" /> relief of congestion, these provisions will mainly operate outside the scheduled congested districts.  Within these districts applications for permission to let lands will have to be considered in the light of the Land Commission's need to acquire land for the relief of local congestion.  I hope that this encouragement of longer lettings will result in significant changes for the better in the general pattern of landholding, soil conservation and overall production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's account of the working of the Land Commission for the past 12 months follows the pattern which has obtained for the past six, seven or eight years.  The amount of land taken up is 27,800 acres and the amount allotted is almost 30,000 acres.  The amount of land rearranged is 438 acres and that figure appears to me to be down somewhat. The number was in the neighbourhood of 600 acres.  I suppose the Minister will tell me that because the work of the Land Commission has been brought down to the hard core, and to the more difficult cases, the work of the inspectors is more difficult.  I quite admit that.  That must be the case, but I would be more pleased if the number he gave us as rearranged last year was a bit higher.  I should like to hear the Minister on that point when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said that 3,500 holdings have been rearranged and I take it finally settled.  Even if it took eight years, since 1948 when I first came in close contact with the Land Commission, to do that it is a big bite out of the hard core.  The Minister says there are 16,000 holdings outstanding yet, but I have always questioned the accuracy of that figure because in the congested areas, and in the uncongested areas also, each holding that has a receivable order in the Land Commission, or a folio in the Land Registry Office, is counted as a separate living for a person.  Such is not the case.  I am sure the Minister is aware it is not.  I know one person who has 11 receivable orders and, therefore, that is counted as having 11 holdings.  I contest this figure of 16,000 holdings as I believe the number is much smaller.  The only way <Col N="1273" /> to tackle this question and to resolve it would be to ask the Land Commission inspectors to give the Minister an accurate return of the lands needing rearrangement, and the number of lands each man has.</P>
    <P>In the case I have mentioned this man had 11 receivable orders, some as low as 6d. and 9d., and they amounted to something in the region of £3 10s. for the total.  The Minister would be well advised to look into that question.  No doubt the figures are 16,000 holdings according to the Land Commission, but that does not mean there are 16,000 families needing rearrangement. That would be a formidable figure at this time of the world's history.</P>
    <P>I did not hear the Minister lay any emphasis on the relief of congestion, and I hope that was only an oversight on his part.  I admit the Land Commission was not established to relieve congestion.  In the dim and distant past when its purpose was, No. 1, to make the tenant farmer his own proprietor and, No. 2, to fix a judicial rent, as that work was cleared up other work was found for the Land Commission.  The Land Commission found that making a tenant farmer a proprietor on a holding of a couple of shillings valuation was not good enough, and in 1907 or 1908 it was realised that a farmer had to have a holding of reasonable size on which to live.  The Congested Districts Board or the Estates Board at that time had to turn their attention to that problem.</P>
    <P>Knowing the congested districts, and knowing the uninformed criticism that the Minister and his Department are likely to meet, I want to say I sympathise with the Minister in the job he has on hands.  I would advise him not to mind any of the uninformed criticism and to go ahead with the work.  It is slow and tough work but the Minister should not pay any heed, even to Deputies, who advise steamroller methods.  I do not know what the intentions of such Deputies are.  I can only form my opinions from the words they have used as recorded in the Official Report, and year after year they have been advising Ministers for Lands, before my time and after my <Col N="1274" /> time, to take a short cut.  The short cut is adopted only in one country in the world and that is Russia and we do not want Russia's method adopted here.</P>
    <P>I should be greatly surprised if this debate concludes without a reference being made to the Land Commission as antiquated and out-dated, and that it would be a simple solution to grab the land and divide it.  I expect Deputies who make these statements mean well. I suppose that is their solution for settling the question, but I am sure the Minister will give heed to what I said to him last year during the course of this debate when I told him he was the custodian of what is very dear to every farmer in Ireland, namely, security of tenure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is the custodian of that right and I would ask him to let the advice I am sure he will get during the course of this debate slide off his shoulders, as I let it slide off mine.  I remember a Deputy saying in this House he would not agree that any farmer should own his own land. I remember Deputies trying to fix a limit on how much property a man should own.  That is very annoying if a Minister is genuinely interested in going ahead with the work of relieving congestion.  I know it is a slow job and I have every sympathy with the Minister if he has to put up with that kind of criticism on the one hand, and if he gets very little help on the other hand from the sources of that criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to adopt the attitude of criticising and preaching piously to the Minister but I do want to make one suggestion to him.  This suggestion comes from a realisation that, as time goes on, the acquisition of lands is becoming harder and more difficult. I have often been puzzled that the Land Commission have succeeded in acquiring as much land as they have acquired with the method employed. They have only one method of acquiring land and that is by due process of law.  They have another method but they have never asked this House to sanction it.  I would suggest that the hard core of congestion that remains <Col N="1275" /> would be something in the region of 11,000 or 12,000 holdings, rather than the 16,000 the Minister has mentioned.  I am speaking of house holdings rather than land holdings which receive receivable orders under the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I think the time has come to finish the problem of congestion once and for all and I suggest that the Minister use Section 27 of the 1950 Act to a large extent for three, four or five years.  If necessary he should spend a fairly large sum of money, no matter what it costs.  He should purchase 1,000 holdings each year for four or five years and have migrations on a big scale out of the remaining congested areas.  Each holding may cost £1,000, and in the case of the Land Commission may cost £2,000 each.  At the rate of 1,000 holdings a year that would cost £1,000,000 or £2,000,000, but even though it cost that much for three or four years it would settle the question once and for all.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider that suggestion and see if it is feasible. I know he will have the Department of Finance facing him like a stone wall but there is no use in letting the remaining 10,000 or 11,000 vanish.  All these people on small holdings have to make ends meet.  They give half their attention to their little holdings but, in order to make a living for themselves, their wives and families, they have to find outside work with the county council, with the Department of Forestry or with any other source of employment that God happens to send into their localities.  We shall lose 10,000 or 12,000 of our very hardiest people if we do not take steps to provide them with holdings now.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said the £10 valuation ceiling is to be raised to £15 wherever practicable but I wish he would be more definite about it.  You cannot give what you have not got. You cannot increase the size of a holding from one of a valuation of £5 to one of a valuation of £12 or £15 if you do not get the co-operation of the tenants.</P>
    <P>I do not want to criticise the Land <Col N="1276" /> Commission or the Minister, or to praise them.  I want to make a concrete suggestion that may help the Minister.  It would cost a lot of money to do what I say.  The Minister will be told that if he goes into the open market and purchases 1,000 holdings in any year, he will inflate the price of land, that the moment the Land Commission inspectors appear at the auction, the price goes up.  When I was Minister for Lands, during the passage of the 1950 Act, the darkest and gloomiest prophecies were uttered from this side of the House as well as from my own side.  None of those prophecies has materialised.  The Minister has the means.  I left machinery in the 1950 Act&mdash;Section 27.  Let him purchase the land for cash.  There is no question of the disposal of the holdings because the lands purchased under Section 27 of the 1950 Act can be used only for migrants, No. 1, or for rearrangement, No. 2.  The machinery is available to the Minister and all he needs is the money to do it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably saying to himself that I could have done this during the period I was Minister.  At that time, it was not so difficult to get land by the ordinary process of acquisition and resumption; but, according as the pool of land is drying up and while the legal profession find loopholes in the various Land Acts, it becomes increasingly difficult for the Land Commission to acquire land, which causes delay in acquisition and resumption.  The Land Commission are being brought virtually to a standstill. The only remedy is to scrap the old method of relieving congestion and to adopt a new way.  It will not hurt anyone.  It will not get people's backs up or cause a scare amongst people that their lands will be acquired, if the Minister goes into the open market to purchase land advertised in the papers.  A bold bid should be made for two to five years.  The work of the Land Commission in relieving congestion could then be brought to a close.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that he has closed down on acquisition and resumption for the present in order to enable him to dispose of what is on hands now.</P>

      <P>While I often ground my teeth in anger at delays in land division, damage can be done by too hasty division in certain cases.  It is not always an easy matter for the inspector in an area to settle an estate or portion of an estate.  Sometimes land is kept on hand for what seems a long period before it is allotted because they are waiting to get sufficient land in the locality so as to be able to make a decent rearrangement scheme. If the Minister hustles the inspectors too much in such cases, they will be able to make only a half-settlement or a bad settlement, whereas, if a little patience were exercised, a good and lasting settlement could be made. While speed is admirable and the Minister is to be applauded for it, in some instances, he should be guided entirely by the inspectors who know an area well, who know what is likely to happen.  To rush out and settle an area for the sake of wiping it off the slate might result in a very poor settlement being made for the townland concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The funds available for land settlement are necessarily limited and, in order to secure the maximum land division from the amount of money available, it has been decided that future allottees of parcels given as enlargements will be required to make reasonable contributions by way of labour and materials towards essential improvements works.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister mean that the allottee will be asked to fence and drain the land and carry out improvement work that the Land Commission have carried out heretofore under sub-head I?  If that is the case, the Minister does not understand the difficulties besetting the type of people he is setting out to relieve.  Let the Minister consider the kind of livelihood a man would have whose valuation is £3, £4 or £5, whose holding is a mountainy <Col N="1278" /> holding, who has to maintain a wife and family and who has to spend six months of the year in England in order to supplement his income.  Is that the type of person he will ask to contribute?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Not that sort of people. Only in a limited way, where it is reasonable, and not in the rearrangement. I do not think it could be done in the rearrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Without being critical, I want to give the Minister the benefit of my opinion.  That may save a penny all right, but, by prolonging the work of the Land Commission, it will cost £1.  I do hope that tenants in the congested areas will not be asked to contribute.  The Congested Districts Board, during the first world war or about that time, when the British Government found money was scarce, tried to get the tenants to improve their allotments.  It proved a ghastly failure.  It is not easy for people living on small holdings to keep their own fences in repair, much less to make a new fence on a new piece of land.</P>
      <P>On the question of the £10 valuation ceiling, while holdings of that valuation in some areas are quite economic, in other areas they are not.  For instance, a holding with a valuation of £10 in Rush, within easy reach of the City of Dublin, where there is a first-class market for farm produce and which is farmed intensively, would be a reasonably good holding and might give a very good livelihood, whereas holdings of that valuation in other areas might be absolutely below the level.  More power to the Minister in raising it to £15 and to £50, if he could.  I would have done the same. The fact is that the Land Commission can give out only what they have on hands.  A shopkeeper cannot sell goods he has not got.  The same applies to the Land Commission.  They cannot give out more land than they have. The Minister could remove the £10 ceiling and it would not make the slightest difference.  The Land Commission will bring it up as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter to which the <Col N="1279" /> Minister did not advert.  I do not think any Minister has adverted to it for a long time.  It is the money which is held by the Public Trustee which represents the price of land taken over by the Land Commission.  Would the Minister take this opportunity to make a statement in order to clear the air on that question?  I know all about it. The Land Commission is blamed for holding the money.  I should like the Minister to make a forthright statement as to who is at fault.  I do not care who gets hurt.  The landowners are being fooled, on the one hand; the Land Commission are being blamed, on the other hand.  The real culprits have never yet been exposed.</P>
    <P>If I remember correctly, there is something like £600,000 land purchase money lying in the hands of the Public Trustee.  The Land Commission have paid out money on the taking over of the land.  They have nothing further to do with it.  It is obviously the responsibility of the landowner to get that money out, but in many cases he does not understand what is preventing him from doing it, and he is inclined to blame the Land Commission.  The Minister should make a forthright statement regardless of whom he hurts.  He will not hurt anyone except those who deserve to be hurt badly.</P>
    <P>I hope I will not fall foul of the Chair in what I am going to say now on the question of the building of Land Commission houses.  The Minister for Local Government has decided not to give a water and sanitation grant, to which the builder of every house was entitled, to those who build houses with a Land Commission grant.</P>
    <P>I suppose this idea saves about £300 or £400 a year, if it saves that, to the Government.  There are two people side by side in the same townland.  One builds his house with the Local Government grant and gets a water and sanitation grant, £40 for one and £20 for the other.  As regards the other, the Land Commission are making a rearrangement to take him out of his poverty because he cannot do so himself. They give him a grant to build his house, but the Minister for Local Government will not give a water and sanitation grant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> The Minister should point out to his colleague how ridiculous and stupid that regulation is, no matter who made it.  It was probably made by some bright angel in the Custom House who suddenly spotted that a man who gets a Land Commission grant gets £60 or £80 more than the man who gets a grant from the Department of Local Government.  That money given by the Land Commission represents an inducement to some poor man to build a dwelling house which he could not afford otherwise.  However, the joke of it all is that if this man in the course of the erection of the Land Commission house bores suitable holes in the wall and then plugs them up with plaster, he gets the full Land Commission grant and then the water and sanitation grant from the Department of Local Government.  I have advised all I come in contact with who are building Land Commission houses to make their plans for a bathroom and lavatory and for a septic tank while the house is being built.  However, there are some cases of people building Land Commission houses who are denied this water and sanitation grant, through some trick thought up by some bright boy in the Custom House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be beyond his power.  I should like the Minister to give us a detailed account of what it is hoped to do there.  When the disastrous flooding occurred there in 1954, plans were formulated and ready to be implemented.  At the time, an expert sent by the American Government <Col N="1281" /> very graciously gave us an opinion of what should be done in the Shannon Valley, taking into account the water power and all the other factors.  Plans were formulated and I must express appreciation of the quick way the Land Commission prepared plans for migration and for the removal of tenants to dwelling houses on suitably high ground in the case of farmers who did not want to leave the valley.  I wish to know what the Minister intends to do now.</P>
      <P>I was sorry to see the Minister made a cut of £20,000 in sub-head I, which is really the principal sub-head of the Vote under which the Land Commission carries out improvement works. In fact, if ever anybody wants to strangle the Land Commission, all he has to do is to reduce sub-head I to a token amount of £5 and the Land Commission will be frozen stiff.  I am sorry that the Minister has done this under pressure from those who do not understand the work of the Land Commission and deliberately do not want to understand it, over the years. I am afraid the Minister will find in this connection that he has agreed to something that will land him in a lot of trouble by next October or November.</P>
      <P>I want to repeat that it is high time to use sub-head R of the Vote on a big scale and to complete the work of the relief of congestion.  There are some cases of congestion down in my county.  We have the estate of the Marquis of Sligo, and the Dowd and Moore estates in the West.  These estates have been on hands for a long time.  A certain amount of good work was done for the relief of congestion in my time and has been done since I went out of office, but a lot remains to be done.  These estates were virtually untouched since taken over under the 1923 Act.  There are actually three estates there comprising all the land west of Croagh Patrick right up to Clew Bay and Killary harbour and back to Galway harbour.  That is where the poorest land in the country is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people there are living in very bad conditions and it is in these districts that we have the most serious <Col N="1282" /> flight from the land, because the people have nothing to live on.  Sometimes, if they are lucky like last year, when we had an exceptionally dry season, they might be able to sell turf but there is very little county council work being done there.  I established a few forests in that area and I hope the Minister will help to increase the work there as a supplement to the people's earnings.  About 70 or 80 of them who are lucky enough to be near the forests are employed there, but forestry work alone will not keep them, and unless something is done to improve their holdings we will lose all these families to England.  It is a strange thing that although there is great poverty in these areas the finest and healthiest children seem to tumble out of the national schools at closing time.  I do not know how it is done but it is a credit to the parents that they have done it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It would take more than fresh air to make them as good as they are.  I have mentioned certain areas in the Kiltimagh and Swinford districts that are under resettlement. I should like the Minister to ask the commissioners to speed up the work in those areas.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to pay particular attention to my principal suggestion. I think it is the only way to do it.  I know that, as Minister for Lands, I would have a serious falling-out with the Government of which I was a member if I did not get my own way in certain matters.  We have been reading recently in the daily papers that the work of the Land Commission has gone on for a long time.  It has.  If the relief of congestion side of the work were brought to a close, it would not be one bit too soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the pool of land available for acquisition drying up, with the fact that big farmers seem to be working their lands much better than formerly and with the fact that local acquisition difficulties are multiplying day by day, the work of the commissioners is being brought to a standstill.  The day they cannot get a pool of land on which to work will be a sad day for them <Col N="1283" /> because they will not have the raw material with which to get ahead with this very urgent work.  During the war years&mdash;from 1941 to 1948, I think &mdash;land acquisition was virtually closed down and the work of the Land Commission came to a standstill.  Only a small hard core still remains to be tackled.  We shall have to be more liberal.  The raising of the valuation from £10 to £15 will not help a lot. We should spend a little extra money for a few years and get the job done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>We are often prone to criticise the Land Commission and its work, especially when we do not realise the difficulties with which the commission and its inspectors have to contend. When we become experienced in the matter and appreciate the many problems that confront the local inspector in his job&mdash;for example, the unwillingness of rundale tenants to migrate or agree to a resettlement scheme and all the other difficulties that crop up from time to time&mdash;maybe then we are not so critical of the Land Commission. I have often criticised them for their delay in getting rid of holdings and estates which they acquired.  However, when I see the Land Commission in operation, and the nature and extent of the problems that arise, I am inclined to feel more sympathetic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a paradox which I have noticed in the past 12 months in the operations of the Land Commission. While the Land Commission is busy trying to relieve congestion in the West of Ireland by breaking up ranches, the opposite process is taking place in other parts of the country&mdash; the mass amalgamation of small farms. This mass amalgamation of small farms has been referred to somewhere as the &ldquo;cheque-book evictions&rdquo;.  It means that, in time, we shall have the problem which we had in the past; we shall have the large ranches reappearing in the east.  That will not help to arrest the great problem of our time, the decrease in our population.  Rather will it accelerate and accentuate that decrease.  The Minister should address himself to that matter.  If at all possible, he should put some ceiling on the buying of land.  The small farmer <Col N="1284" /> is the king-pin of our economy and the backbone of the nation.  If he disappears, everything we hold dear will disappear.  At all costs, he must be preserved.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a number of matters in which I am interested in his introductory statement.  He referred to the plans for Land Commission houses.  Deputies have been very critical of Land Commission houses and of the plans drawn up by engineers and architects attached to the Land Commission. Last Sunday I was in Laurencetown in my constituency.  I was shown by the local county councillor the Kenny estate, which was divided three years ago.  Nine houses were built on that estate at that time and four of them are still unoccupied because prospective tenants would not agree to go into the type of house provided for them by the Land Commission.  I went to the trouble of inspecting one of the houses.  It consisted of four rooms.  The only two bedrooms available in the house were so small that you could not put a double bed into either of them. Whatever engineer or architect attached to the Land Commission drew up those plans, and whatever senior official approved of them, should have their heads examined.  Steps should be taken to avoid a repetition of that kind of bungling.  In the three years, four holdings have been allowed to stand there unoccupied.  I was told by people in the Laurencetown area that inspectors have been travelling all over the countryside in an attempt to get people to take over the four fine holdings but nobody would take them because of the type of house provided on them.</P>
    <P>I was also shown the fencing done on the same estate.  It is absolutely disgraceful. How it passed an inspector of the Land Commission is more than I can understand.  No farmer, no matter how poor he might be, would put up a fence of the type provided on the Kenny estate, Laurencetown, by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to learn that it is proposed to take steps to relieve the flooding in the Shannon basin.  I think the Minister stated that the 70 farms affected will be relieved to the tune of <Col N="1285" /> from £80,000 to £100,000.  This money will come from the National Development Fund.  The Minister did not mention the nature of the relief to be afforded to the tenants of land liable to flooding in my constituency.</P>
    <P>In the past year another development has taken place, with the appearance of the syndicates.  They have purchased holdings in the Midlands and other parts of the country and have divided them into suitable farms and sold them to suitable applicants as residential farms, or non-residential farms.  This is an indictment of the Land Commission.  Why could the Land Commission not engage in an activity of that kind?  Apparently these syndicates were able to go into the open market, purchase a large tract of land, divide it up into holdings, and sell the holdings to suitable applicants for a reasonable sum, and make a profit on the transaction. I wonder could the Land Commission be empowered to engage in that type of activity?  The Minister might give the matter consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a problem which has received much attention during the year from farming organisations and; as he said himself, from individual commentators.  It is the problem of the young landless farmer.  During the year I read a very interesting article in Volume 1, No. 2 of the <i>University Review</i>, where the young landless farmer is defined as a &ldquo;young landless man who has a definite vocation for the agricultural calling and a remarkable aptitude for it.&rdquo;  He has a certain amount of capital but he is unable to get enough to purchase a farm.  I am sure that the Land Commission could, in some way, through its own efforts, be able to come to the assistance of that type of man.  I understood some years ago that the landless man occasionally got land, but nowadays very few of them are put on the inspectors' books and their chances of getting land in competition with the congests or the rundales are small indeed.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider fully the suggestions made in this article, which is a very thought-provoking one and which, I am sure, would give him some ideas on how to <Col N="1286" /> help the young landless farmer.  The National Farmers' Association, too, made a very useful suggestion when they advocated a farming apprenticeship scheme.  The Minister stated that annually about 1,500 holdings are allotted by the Land Commission.  The National Farmers' Association have been very conservative in their demand. They ask that, of these 1,500 holdings, about 50 would be made available to suitable farm apprentices with a certain amount of capital of their own.  Consideration might well be given to this suggestion.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look into the matter of the advertising of certain holdings.  In my own county large estates are advertised and I&mdash;and other Deputies, I am sure&mdash;have taken steps to notify the commission that these holdings are on the market, but when the commission tries to purchase the estates they are immediately withdrawn from the market.  That has happened in my constituency at Derry hivney near Portumna, and at another estate at Rathville between Loughrea and Athenry.  The owners appear very unwilling to dispose of their lands when they hear the Land Commission is interested in purchasing them.</P>
    <P>I come from probably one of the most congested counties in Ireland, Galway.  In that constituency there is an area on the slopes of the Slieve Aughty range from Derrybrien and Loughatorick to Sonnagh, Kilnadelma and Kylebrack where most of the farmers have holdings of very small valuations.  No serious effort, as far as I know, has been made to do anything for them, down through the years.  Yet not 20 miles away, towards the east, and on the shores of the Shannon in the Laurencetown-Meelick-Eyrecourt area, upwards of 2,500 acres of land are held by three families.  I understand that the Government, and previous Governments too, have taken a stand on the matter of private property, and rightly so, but the Land Commission and the Government could make inquiries and find out if these lands are being properly worked. If necessary they could use the compulsory powers which the commission have and which, as far as I know, they <Col N="1287" /> are very reluctant to use, or have been reluctant to use in the past six or seven years, and try and relieve the acute congestion that exists particularly in the southern part of my constituency.</P>
    <P>I hope, too, that in the course of the next 12 months the Minister will live up to the promise he made in this House last year that estates which have been in the hands of the commission for a long period would be disposed of.  There are plenty of them in my constituency, at Dalyston, St. Clerans, and Dunsandle, to mention but a few which have been in the hands of the commission for a long time and which they have not yet disposed of.  I trust that they will be disposed of soon and that the Minister will see to it that all the other estates in their hands will also be divided as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the biggest problems in land division is to see that the most suitable people get the land. It is one of the biggest problems which the commission have to face and I fully realise the problem of the local inspector, in finding such persons among the applicants entitled to get land in his locality.  The commission have fallen down in the fact that they display little interest in those people after they have got the land.  My experience is that the commission seems to lose interest immediately.  That should not happen.  They should keep a close watch on how those farms or portions of land are being worked afterwards.  It has also been my experience that in some cases, not all, those people make no attempt to farm the land which they have got.  They continue to set it.  That is bad from the national point of view and very demoralising from the point of view of the people who have failed to get land. They are naturally very sore when they find that some people come along and get land, by a decision of the local inspector, and, when it is given to them, they make a very bad job of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I often wonder why the Land Commission do not go back over a number of years and see how these farms are <Col N="1288" /> being farmed.  It would make very interesting reading&mdash;what the results have been and if the farming has been successful; what number of those people are farming properly and making a good living.  It is very disheartening to see those people setting their land again.  I know of cases which occurred quite recently.  In one case, a man got 30 acres of good land.  He was not in a position to farm that at the time; he was actually working with another farmer.  For the past three years, he has continued to set that land.  There were applicants in the district who would have been much more suitable and would have made a success of it.  Naturally, those people are very annoyed to-day when they see that happening.</P>
    <P>I know it is not general, but there are cases, and the Land Commission and the local inspectors should guard against that practice.  Possibly, there are only isolated cases, but I think it is happening too often.  There is not enough of attention paid to the type of person receiving this land.  It seems that, if the applicant is convenient to the land and has five or ten acres of land himself, he is in line for a portion of the farm, whereas there may be men outside that regulation who are debarred. It is time for the Land Commission to change, to examine this situation and see if the right type of applicant is receiving land.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the landless man and a farmer who is not eligible for land because he is outside the regulations.  The Minister said he must remain outside because the number of uneconomic holders is so large. I wonder is it a sound policy to stick rigidly to that type of uneconomic holder?  There has been a movement&mdash; the last speaker referred to it&mdash;by the N.F.A. to devise some scheme for the farmer's son who is not eligible.  There are quite a number of those people in the country.  They would make excellent farmers.  They have been working on their fathers' farms since they left school.  There is no prospect whatever of such people owning a farm.  The father is not eligible for additions to his land.  He may have a 40- or 50-acre farm.  With two or three sons working <Col N="1289" /> on the farm, he will not be in a position to buy those young men land.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission should seriously consider giving those people a chance.  They are the backbone of the country, excellent young men, with a first class knowledge of farming, who, if they were given a chance, would make a success of it.  It need not be a matter of handing them over a farm at a low rate.  There should be some security given by the Land Commission for the purchase of the land.  If they got time, those young men would be able to pay back the Land Commission, pay the market value for the land.  I should like the Minister and the Land Commission to consider something on those lines.  I thought the Minister would have made some reference to these negotiations with the N.F.A.&mdash;I think he was at this conference himself&mdash;but possibly he may refer to it when concluding.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of migrants being brought over to my constituency. So far, there have been isolated cases; and I think the isolated case is wrong. You might as well bring a man from China as bring him from the West of Ireland to Carlow-Kilkenny.  We had a case of a man being brought from Galway.  He told his neighbours when he was brought over that he had been completely deceived by the Land Commission. He did not expect anything like what he had been landed into.  The first thing he said was: &ldquo;There is no fishing here at all.&rdquo;  He thought he would be near the sea.  He said: &ldquo;You could not make a living out of this farm.&rdquo;  The Land Commission supplied him with seeds and fertilisers to start him off on this good holding.  I understand that he sold both the seeds and the fertilisers locally, and the next thing he did was to pop off to England and leave his family behind him.  That is very bad for the local people.  They felt they were entitled to this holding.</P>

      <P>This is a case in South Carlow.  While a number of migrants <Col N="1290" /> may be satisfactory, bringing isolated cases into my constituency is very bad policy.  It annoys the people eligible for land to see this happen.  They feel they are entitled to the land.  Then, somebody is brought over from the West and he makes no attempt whatever to farm that land properly.  He is put in amongst very good farmers and he has no knowledge whatever of the type of husbandry going on in the district.  The migrant looking for fishing in Carlow will be a long time waiting for it.  This man said he could earn £10 or £15 per week fishing in Galway.  The Land Commission had a right to leave him fishing in Galway.</P>
      <P>There is also the matter of the land in the hands of the Land Commission which they have not yet divided up. There has been objection to that from all sides of the House over a number of years.  But another extraordinary policy is the continuation of the setting of this land for tillage year after year until the fertility of the land is exhausted.  When that happens, the land is divided amongst the applicants. It is a very bad policy.  The Minister has stated he is trying to get this land divided as quickly as possible.  It would be very good if that were done and if the policy of setting it for tillage year after year were discontinued.  One would expect a Government Department to give a proper lead in this respect. To continue to run down the fertility to such an extent is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of a Land Commission farm advertised and set for tillage on 19th May of this year.  The people in that district are laughing at the idea that the Land Commission knew so little about it that they set the land for tillage on 19th May.  That land had to be ploughed and a crop put in after 19th May.  The result was that the land was set at £1 or 30s. per acre&mdash;land which should have made much more. The very latest date for putting in a proper corn crop would have been around the end of April, but it was only put up by the auctioneer on 19th May.  It is a disgrace and it has a very bad effect generally on the people. They say that the Land Commission do not care and are not interested in the land, that it will do any old time. <Col N="1291" /> The Minister referred to the difficulty of acquiring land and to the fact that the pool of land here is drying up.  Deputy Blowick also spoke of the difficulty of acquiring land and he recommended to the Minister various ways in which he could succeed in acquiring it.  It is extraordinary to hear the statements here by the Minister and at the same time realise what is happening in Carlow.  There were two big estates there up to recently&mdash; one of 750 acres and another of 1,600 acres; and a foreigner has come in and purchased them.  This land was sold on the open market.  The Land Commission were quite aware of the situation there, but they made no attempt whatever to purchase it.  It appears that they were not interested.  At the same time, we have the Minister saying to-day that the pool of land is drying up.</P>
    <P>In the first case, the Brownshill estate, 750 acres, it is six years since that farm was sold.  At that time, it was offered to the Land Commission and they did not interest themselves in it. A foreigner came in and purchased it at a low price, as there was not very much competition for a farm of that size.  He has continued to crop that land since then; he has corn on it year after year.  Early this year, that man sold portion of it, which he had divided up into 100-acre farms; and he sold them at a very high price.  At the time, the Land Commission were asked to interest themselves in it and take over the land.  There are quite a big number of uneconomic holders in the district.  The Land Commission have not sent an inspector down there to investigate the case.  Those people have never been interviewed and no check has been made on the position. After years and years of continued cropping on that estate, this same gentleman this year bought the beautiful estate of 1,600 acres beside it.  That land was purchased for £50,000 and the timber on the land is supposed to be valued at £20,000.  The land is working out at about £20 an acre.  Of course, there were no local people able to buy that land.  The only people who could have competed against this gentleman were the Land Commission, so this man <Col N="1292" /> had the land at his own price.  He is going to continue the same policy there.  This year, he has 900 acres of wheat sown on that farm.  Previously, there was a large herd of cows there and it was properly farmed.  The herd supplied milk to Carlow town.  That has all gone now and the herd has been sold off.  The policy there now is to be continued&mdash;the continual cropping of the land until it is run down and then it will be offered again in the public market.  The Land Commission are standing by.</P>
    <P>The people there are very annoyed about it.  The local people have tried everything to get the Land Commission interested, but they have made no move and never seem to take any interest.  At the same time, we find the Minister saying to-day that the pool of land is drying up.  The sons and daughters of those people will definitely have to clear out.  They are industrious people and they are trying to carry on, on small holdings, by taking conacre for tillage and grass, while they see this land being taken up by the foreigner.  The demesne walls are there for generations, of course, and it was the first hope of these people that they would be allowed inside those demesne walls and have this land for themselves.  The Land Commission are not prepared to take action, although pressure was used in every direction.  Outside the people immediately concerned, a petition was signed by the business people of Carlow town&mdash;I think it was sent to the Taoiseach&mdash;protesting against this situation.  It is the most disgraceful thing that has happened for many years.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to big estates being offered in the public market and said that the very minute the Land Commission seemed to be interested in them, they were withdrawn. This is a different case altogether.  This land was offered on the public market.  It was not withdrawn because of Land Commission interest.  The Land Commission never interested themselves in it and they even went further than that.  They sent a notice to the auctioneer, when this farm was being offered at the previous sale, saying they had no <Col N="1293" /> interest in it; and that notice was read out at the sale, that the Land Commission had no interest in it.  That seems an extraordinary thing and I hope the Minister will give an explanation of it when he is replying, as the people in that district require an explanation.  The local people are anxious to see this land divided.  The people who would be likely to get some of it have been very patient so far and, undoubtedly, they have been treated very badly by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>At least, an inspector should have gone down to investigate the position, but I understand nothing has happened. There was a deputation to the Minister early in the spring about this and no action was taken.  The Minister was not prepared to interfere.  He talked about the right of ownership and the right of those people to do whatever they wished with the land. I am completely in agreement with the Minister on that&mdash;the right of ownership and free sale.  I am 100 per cent. behind him, but this situation is quite a different one.  It is a most unusual situation, where two big estates are offered on the open market and the Land Commission will take no action.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Land Commission from time to time investigate cases which there is no reason at all to investigate.  I cannot understand their policy on that.  Take the case where the owner of a farm dies and the children are young.  An inspector comes along, because that farm is being set on the 11 months' system for a few years, until the eldest son is fit to take over.  The Land Commission pester the widow and threaten that they may acquire the land.  That is a terrible worry, naturally, to the woman left in that position.  I should like to contrast that with the attitude adopted towards these two large estates I mentioned, which were given no attention at all by the Land Commission. When the Minister is replying, I hope he will give a reason for their refusal to take action in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more or less disappointed in the Minister's statement, because, being a young Minister and <Col N="1294" /> a new Minister, I expected a new approach.  Not alone I, but every farmer's son will be disappointed. Reading the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> over the past year and listening to speeches and also listening to the Minister, we were convinced that some new scheme was being worked out whereby the farmer's son would be catered for, but we find that that is not so.</P>
      <P>In past years, I was critical of Land Commission policy; and I make no apology for being so, as I had good ground for being critical.  The Land Commission got off to a bad start.  Too many irresponsible people got land and it sickened almost every decent man to see the type that got it, how they refused to work it and what they did with it.  We in the eastern counties, where migration was started and was continued in a big way, were disappointed in the initial stages of migration to our county, because the wrong type of migrant was brought in. That was a bone of contention for many years.</P>
      <P>Another great problem was created by giving tenants holdings that were too small.  At that time, anything from 19 to 22 statute acres of poor or fair land were the maximum.  We know that in many parts of the country one cannot live on 19 acres, especially if one is placed on that farm with very little money or credit.  I am glad that in recent years there has been an improvement and at present holdings of 33 to 35 acres are being allotted, with good houses, good out-offices and good roadways.  The Land Commission are doing good work, getting good tenants, both native and migrant.  In the last five or six years, the Land Commission have done really good national work and I give them credit for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dividing an estate, the Land Commission make every effort to see that the amenities in the neighbouring villages are helped out.  I recently approached the Land Commission in County Meath in connection with the village of Summerhill and helped the local body to get a Gaelic playing pitch.  Also in regard to a hard tennis court, the Land Commission met us fully and gave us the facilities needed. That has meant an immense improvement <Col N="1295" /> in the district.  They also met the county council and gave four or five acres of land for housing which tends to make these little villages worthwhile. I am thankful to the Land Commission for this work because we want to build up our villages and towns, and, if the Land Commission help in doing that, they are doing good work.</P>
    <P>In connection with the acquisition of land, however, I think they have fallen down on the job, as far as Meath is concerned.  They could have acquired far more land.  Perhaps money was tight and if that is the case, I will forgive the Land Commission, but too many gentlemen have got away with increasing large holdings.  The Land Commission should have seen to it that these people did not acquire the land when it became available in the area. I know the pool of land is diminishing of late and I know it is harder to get land, but are the Land Commission doing everything possible?  I would ask the Land Commission to try to ensure that in the next four or five years land division will be completed. If so, we will have a well-balanced economy with good tenants working their land to the utmost.</P>
    <P>Many large holdings in County Meath have been taken over and divided, but there are still too many large holdings where the land is not fully worked.  I do not want these holdings taken from the owners, but I want them pared down.  The man with 800 or 500 acres who is able to work only 200 should not be allowed to continue on that basis.  It is time for the Land Commission to step in.  The man who has only 200 acres and works it can make a splendid living.  The balance should be allotted to the people who are looking for land.  I am not against the farmers who have 1,200 or 1,400 acres and work that acreage to the utmost, employing 22 or 25 men all the year round.  We have seven or eight of those in my county and I would not touch one of them, and I would not expect the Land Commission even to look across their boundaries.  They are doing good work, perhaps better than if the land were divided, but too many mediocre people are getting <Col N="1296" /> away with very little tillage and half of their lives are spent abroad and their land is left with a few bullocks roaming through it and the grass almost up to one's knees.  We should not stand for that.  I would ask the Land Commission to get these estates which are not giving proper employment pared down.  That is work the Land Commission should do and I would urge them to do it at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>I also suggest the Land Commission should purchase land in the open market.  If a farm is advertised, of a suitable type, in the right place, I do not see why the Land Commission should not go in and purchase it at a reasonable price.  If one or two big men with cheque books want to pay dearly, let the Land Commission make them pay dearly.  I think the Land Commission are sitting down on the job there.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to hear&mdash;because I know it will be bitterly opposed&mdash;that farmers are not to be included in the allocation of land.  In my county, where we have suffered much, it is hard to think that a farmer living beside a large estate with five or six sons, able to put up only £100 or £200 and no more, will be ignored by the Land Commission.  These farmers' sons are probably members of Macra na Feirme or Muintir na Tíre or other lively organisations that are rising up here. It is hard to think that these men are excluded from owning land and it is unnatural that they should have no hope of being able to purchase land because at present even the smallest farm goes to £2,000 and £8,000 to £10,000 is not unusual.  The wrong type of people are buying these places and the farmers' sons in the locality have no hope, except to go back as labourers or get out of the country.  If there are openings in Canada or Britain, those young men go there and they are a national loss.</P>
    <P>It would be better to have such young men settle down here rather than have the men with the cheque books purchasing the big estates.  What good are they to the country?  They are just fly-by-nights and we do not want <Col N="1297" /> them.  Let us place the proper type of people on the land.  If we put a farmer's son on a holding near his family and if the family helps, after four or five years he will be a fully-fledged farmer.  He will marry and settle down and acquire his own tractor or horses and work his farm to the utmost.  Such types are excluded at present, but I believe it is within the Minister's power to exclude instead the other type of people from outside.</P>
    <P>I would strongly appeal to the Minister, and I know my colleagues on the other side from County Meath will join with me in this, to end the present situation which is unfair. Hundreds of migrants are brought up from the West.  We have no objection to them.  They are good, honest, decent people and they have every right to get land and, when they get it, I am sure they will work it to the utmost. They are a credit to our country and to the West, and I say that as one who opposed the migration policy; but when it is a national policy, we must give credit where it is due.  These people have fitted in well in County Meath and blended with the local people and are now Meath people themselves and just as good as we are.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I would strongly press the Minister to make some effort on behalf of the landless men, the farmers' sons.  If the Minister does not do this, he will do a great injustice to the country, and I would say that whether the present Minister or his predecessor is in office.  Something must be done because, slowly but surely, the people to whom I have referred are leaving the country and they never come back because they are sick and tired of waiting to see if something will turn up.  Why should we lose the services of those men and lose the national tradition that is behind them and, at the same time, allow a lot of place-hunters to come in here, buy up large ranches and give employment only to a man and a dog?  That is what is happening.</P>
    <P>I am not against migration.  It must go on as national policy.  There is a dense population in the West of Ireland that is unable to live there and I am satisfied that the Government is <Col N="1298" /> doing its duty in trying to make the small holdings in the West as economic as possible.  However, I am also satisfied that in our county we have a problem.  There are very large estates there to be divided within the next year or two and some of our men in County Meath, the good type of farmer, should be placed on that land.  It makes no difference to me what their policy or their creed or their outlook is.  If the Government do that, they will be doing good work.</P>
    <P>I was under the impression that the Minister had a different outlook from past Ministers.  Deputy Blowick was a good Minister, but, like the rest of them, he had his mind set on the West of Ireland and it did not matter about the people anywhere else.  These people from the West of Ireland were welcome in County Meath because they were decent people, but I expect that some consideration should be given to the representations not only of Deputies but of clergymen of all denominations. We do not want to let the farmers' sons leave this country.</P>
    <P>The houses being built by the Land Commission have improved immensely in recent years and I hope that the amenities given to other people will also be given to these and that they will have the same water, sewerage and lighting facilities as other people. I hope that this improvement in housing will continue and that we will not have a standard pattern of houses but that we will have a variety.  I am proud of the fact that the people who got these new houses made a very good job of the surroundings.  The way the approaches and shelter belts have been devised is a credit to those who did it.  It has changed the face of what was once nothing more than the Pale where the large landowner owned everything and where the small man was nothing more than the serf who stood on the doorstep and touched his cap to the landlord.  That day has gone and we are now placing the ordinary Irish in their rightful place on the land of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the past, the Land Commission made some shockingly bad roads, but in recent years there have been improvements. In County Meath, we <Col N="1299" /> have embarked on a scheme of taking over every road leading on to main roads and this will cost us something in the neighbourhood of £250,000 or £275,000.  We expect to get these roads from the Land Commission in good shape and to have them made into proper approaches to the main roads without any blind turnings.  I hope we will have consultation between the Land Commission engineers and the county and local engineers in this matter.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see consultation between the Land Commission and the county councils with regard to the erection of pumps.  We have a big problem in County Meath with regard to water and it is desperate to see the Land Commission sinking a pump for a new allottee and the county council sinking another pump a short distance away for the occupants of new cottages. Consultation in that connection would lead to economies.</P>
    <P>Fencing by the Land Commission has greatly improved.  The old sod fence was a waste of money and time and the new concrete posts with the thorn quicks are an ideal solution of the problem.  We had too much of the sod fence and when the big white-headed bullock got at one side of it with his horns, the sod fence did not last very long.  With the concrete posts and the thorn quicks, great improvements have been made.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission in recent years have done good work in correcting the mistakes made in the past.  In the past, men got land who never should have got it.  They sold it and it made no difference to them to whom they sold it.  All they wanted was the money.  Now they are back where they started.  They started off with nothing and they have ended up with nothing. They were not land-minded.  It was not in their blood to be farmers and it was a waste of national money to have the Land Commission give £2,000 or £3,000 to each of these men.  We have found out our mistakes now and we hope they will not happen again.</P>
    <P>I would like the Land Commission to pay particular attention to County Meath.  There are some men there <Col N="1300" /> who have from 1,000 to 2,000 acres of land each and they are not working the places at all.  They were allowed to buy up land all over the place. Between Dunshaughlin and Navan, there are stretches of road where you will find land with nothing on it but the white-headed bullock.  These men are just ranchers and nothing more and this land should be given to the ordinary farmer who will work it.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest disgraces of the last number of years was the sale by large landowners in County Meath, who would not work their farms themselves, of their farms to speculators. All types of machinery were brought on to the land and it was mined and bored for years for the growing of wheat. That land is only a dust bowl at the moment, with nothing on it but dirt, scutch and weeds.  These persons should have their big estates pared down.  If you do that, you will be doing good work, and, if the Minister does that in County Meath, he will have at his disposal a fine pool of land for allocation. There is no use in the Minister saying that there is no land for allocation. If a man has 500 or 800 acres of land and is working only 300 acres of it, why should the remaining 300 or 400 acres be left to him?  Let us cut down those big estates, but, if they are good farmers, we should leave them alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to this very important debate will be confined, in the main, to the activities of the Land Commission, with emphasis on the acquisition and subsequent sub-division of large tracts of land.  I come from a county where the Land Commission has been particularly active for a considerable period, and where the present policy of allocation has been the subject of very adverse criticism. <Col N="1301" /> Therefore, I am very much concerned with the future and with the effect of the policy of the Land Commission in regard to the sub-division of land in Meath, and I am anxious to have this opportunity to express my views on this matter.  It is the duty of the Government to ensure the land is used to the best advantage for the benefit of the nation.  I do not mean that the Land Commission should waste time examining mistakes that may have been made in the past where the question of allocation of land was involved, but the Land Commission should take all possible steps to ensure that holdings will be allocated to those people who have proved they can make the best use of the land.  It is only by making the best use of the land that prosperity can be achieved for the nation.</P>
      <P>It would be foolish, of course, if the Land Commission did not see that the land was used to the advantage of the nation as a whole.  It is of primary importance that the very best use should be made of the land by those people who are lucky enough to secure holdings.  Probably that was not the policy in the past.  There are cases where tenants are undoubtedly not making the best use of their lands and, no matter what precautions are taken by the Land Commission, there will be cases where the best possible tenants cannot be found.  For years past, the policy has been to give priority to uneconomic holdings.  That policy may be of advantage in certain parts of the country, but there are large areas in which I suggest a more flexible policy would give better results.  Consideration should be given to local conditions and to those areas in which the best advantage is not achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not at all wish to criticise to any great extent the present policy of the Land Commission or of the Government with regard to the selection of allottees, or to criticise the policy of migration, though I represent an area where there is a small percentage of local applicants and where very few of them succeed under the present policy.  I do suggest to the Minister, however, that there should be a definite change in the present policy, <Col N="1302" /> because I know the enormous expense of migration, caused by the Land Commission over the last number of years, and I do not feel that the migration has justified its enormous expense.  There is quite enough land, at least in County Meath, which could be acquired by the Land Commission and I do not agree with the Minister when he states that the pool of land available for acquisition is drying up. Deputy Giles has dwelt on that point very forcibly and, might I say, very intelligently.  There are very large tracts of land in Meath that are not properly worked and the Land Commission should take cognisance of that fact and give that land to people who will work it.</P>
    <P>There have been cases where people have got large tracts of land, and they avail of opportunities for having that land reclaimed and drained through the use of large grants.  Then they sell that land and make a profit on it, having secured the grants.  Others will come in and erect a couple of houses on it and have a stud farm for a couple of mares so that the Land Commission are not able to acquire the land from them.  A lot of that is a sham.  I know a couple of farms in Meath, not very far from the City of Dublin, where that is applicable, where people erected a couple of houses, had a couple of mares and were supposed to have a stud farm.  It is a bad policy to allow that state of affairs to continue while so many people are anxious to have land and work it.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed that the Minister, in his opening statement, did not indicate that he would give some concessions, or at least make some change in policy, to bring farmers' sons within the category eligible for land.  Many farmers throughout Meath and other places have two, three or four sons and they are not in a position to purchase a farm of land for each one of them.  Many of those young boys have had vocational education, in the hope that some day they would qualify for a parcel of land.  They are hard-working young men who stayed at home until such time as they decided to go out into the world, but then they found they were unable to secure a farm of land of any worthwhile size, <Col N="1303" /> because at the present time, due to the value of land, they would need a capital of £2,000 or £3,000.</P>
    <P>It is rather unfortunate that those people should be overlooked.  They are the backbone of the nation; they are the people who really would work the land.  They have studied agriculture from their infancy, and have taken courses in agriculture in the hope that some day they might be the owners of their own farms.  Now, I notice, the policy of the Land Commission will not be changed and a considerable number of these young men have no alternative but to leave the country.  A farm of 50 or 60 acres is not large enough to maintain a couple of young men and they must get out in the world.  They are ambitious and anxious to make a living for themselves, to get married and settle down.  When they leave the country, they are a definite loss to the nation.</P>
    <P>No matter how industrious they may be, they could never buy large farms in Meath.  Most farms there are sold at from £3,000 to £4,000.  Most of the farms in Meath are in the region of 150 acres upwards.  Many of them are let on the grazing system.  There are various people who have taken grassland over a number of years.  There are others who are called landless men but who, over the years, have taken land on the 11 months' system and have considerable stock.  When the Land Commission takes up a particular farm, such men must dispose of their stock and get out, which is a very grave hardship. It is unreasonable that men who, through hard work and initiative have accumulated a handsome sum of money, are unable to buy a farm which they took on the 11 months' system. When that farm is taken over and divided, the cattle are put out on the road and must be disposed of and the men must leave the country.  These two types of people should get reasonable consideration and I would ask the Minister to take particular note of that matter.</P>
    <P>I know of a couple of cases in Meath where men have gone into milk production. They have no land but take <Col N="1304" /> land on the 11 months' system from year to year and have built up a nice little dairying business.  When the Land Commission takes the land they must get out and they have no alternative but to leave the country.  These people also should receive very serious consideration.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable number of cottiers in Meath and they also come into the picture more or less.  They have been given labourers' cottages and they have an acre or two of grass on a convenient farm.  Some of them have large families.  They availed of the opportunity to have a cow or two to provide milk for their families. When the land is divided, they also are excluded from getting a parcel of that land.</P>
    <P>During the period of office of the first Fianna Fáil Government, quite a number of these tenants of cottages got accommodation plots of approximately five acres.  That was very useful. In some cases, there was abuse, but many of the tenants worked that small piece of land to good advantage. Men working convenient to an estate that is being divided, particularly those who work on the estate, and who have a cow or two, should also receive consideration from the Land Commission. There may not be very many.  I know there is not sufficient land for everybody, but there are cases of extreme hardship where men have a couple of cows and have to dispose of them when the land is divided.</P>
    <P>The size of an economic holding has often been mentioned in this House. Conflicting opinions have been expressed. In County Meath, where cattle raising is the chief occupation, a farm of less than 35 acres is, in my opinion, inadequate.  In most parts of County Meath, milk production has increased considerably over the years. On small farms, six or eight acres are under crops and up to ten acres are required for meadow, which reduces the size of the farm considerably, particularly on a milk farm, because cows need a very considerable run.  A small dairy would require at least nine cows. An economic holding would be at least 35 acres.</P>
    <P>In the early stages of land division, <Col N="1305" /> 25 acres were the maximum.  Those who received those holdings are now applying for an addition of land where land is divided convenient to them. They are also excluded because they already have received a holding from the Land Commission.  Any man who has received 25 or 26 acres of land and who has proved a very good farmer, who has worked that land and who has had to take grassland or meadow in order to supplement his crops, is entitled to at least a few acres if it is possible to give them to him.  He has proved beyond all doubt that he is worthy of what he has received from the Land Commission and has derived benefit from it for himself and his wife and family and for the nation generally.</P>
    <P>On the question of the making of roads by the Land Commission over a number of years, the Land Commission should put those roads into proper repair.  County Meath has been at very substantial expense in the last couple of years in taking over such roads and maintaining them.  By-roads were handed over in a most deplorable state.  More precautions should be taken by the Land Commission.  The ratepayers of County Meath have quite enough to do to keep the roads in repair without having to bear any further burden.  They had no alternative to taking over these roads. Most of these roads serve small farmers in the dairying business.  Some of the roads were in a deplorable state, almost impassable for the farmers who had to come to the high road with milk.  We had to spend £30,000 or £40,000 last year and the year before to put a number of these roads into proper repair.  When the Land Commission are handing over these roads, they should see to it that they are in a reasonable state of repair.</P>
    <P>The sinking of pumps is another matter which has been referred to.  I hope the Minister will take note of it and will see to it that where there are five or six farms together, they will be supplied with a pump.  Pumps have been sunk in some cases but the water was so bad that the pump was not used.  Proper care was not taken to see that the water was fit for human consumption.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> Many roads have been made without consultation with the county engineers and each county engineer has his own planning for the future upkeep of roads.  There should be more coordination between the Land Commission and the local engineers so that those roads would be made the proper size and in the proper way.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take note of what my colleague has stated in regard to the bringing in of farmers' sons and so on.  The system that operates is most unfair and unreasonable and has created very bad blood in County Meath amongst a number of people there.  If the policy is not changed, they may have to take very strong action and appeal to the Minister. There are a number of farms in course of division and I have had deputations from various people, even those who are not interested in land but who are very much interested in the changing of the policy of the Land Commission in respect of farmers' sons and other classes.  We cannot expect the Land Commission to do impossibilities. It is very difficult to satisfy everybody, but I know there are several people in the categories I mentioned who should at least get some consideration.  I hope the Minister will take action in that direction.</P>

      <P>If one is to approach this Estimate in any kind of objective way, it must first of all be realised that the Minister, in conjunction with and by direction of the Government, is responsible for land policy in general and that the Land Commission, on the other hand, being a body constituted as it is, is entirely independent of the Minister and the Government in the working out of the details of Government policy.  It must be clearly understood that, in matters of land acquisition and land allocation, the Minister or the Government has no function. That is a fact which has operated over the years, certainly as a theoretical fact.  It is one that has been reiterated by several Ministers and particularly by the present Minister in what might be termed a ruthessly realistic approach in speaking on this Estimate last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> In his introductory speech to the Estimate on this occasion, there is a trace of that ruthless realism still operating. Many matters have been discussed both by the Minister and following speakers from all sides of the House, but first I should like to advert to the question of land purchase by the payment of land bonds, very often payment being made by bonds which have dropped considerably in value and the yield from which is extremely poor.  I would say that the time has passed&mdash;rather than say that it is high time&mdash;when there should be a revision of the whole land code and from that revision a consolidating measure presented to this House whereby there would be uniformity of approach in the matter of acquisition and allocation, and especially in the kind of payment made.</P>
    <P>It seems hardly fair that one person whose lands are being acquired will be paid in cash, market value, and that another person whose lands are being acquired for the same purpose will be paid in land bonds which have considerably depreciated in value.  That is something to which the Minister should direct his attention in the matter of policy and then leave to the Land Commission, as he very properly must leave it, the details of its working out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On what basis is the decision made as to whether payment is made in land bonds or in cash?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on what sections of the different Land Acts they are being paid under.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The cash is very limited, as the Deputy knows&mdash;only £25,000 a year compared with £500,000 land bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulty but the Minister will appreciate that the differentiation operates quite unfairly.  I know it is not the fault of the Land Commission, or the fault of the Minister or his predecessor.  It is the fault of the machinery that has been worked out to bring this about. I should like to see a situation where everybody would be paid in bonds, on <Col N="1308" /> the one hand, or paid in cash, on the other.  Of course, having regard to the limitation there is upon actual cash, I think one would have to revert to bonds.  It might give the bonds a greater value if the unfairness of the cash system did not operate side by side with it.  However, that is the situation with which we are confronted and one which requires examination, revision and ultimate consolidation. There can be no doubt that there are various gatherings of different societies some of them old-established, some of them new, with a growing interest in land, land cultivation and division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest is growing in the land and in the cultivation of the land by the young farmers' groups in their various voluntary bodies.  A considerable amount of attention has been directed here this morning towards the necessity for giving land to landless men, but the landless men have been reduced by most of the speakers to one category, namely, farmers' sons.  There are other people who could come into the category of landless men and have the same interest and the same knowledge begotten of experience and training in the working of land as any farmer's son might have, through the practical knowledge and training he has obtained in the working of his father's land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Land Commission have the power already in some of the enactments to give land to people of this type.  I cannot give the exact reference at the moment, but I do know there is a paragraph of a sub-section in the Land Act of 1931&mdash;I am subject to correction&mdash;which sets out the classes of people to whom the Land Commission may allocate land.  The paragraph to which I refer is paragraph (f) of the sub-section in the section of that Act, and it says: &ldquo;Any other person or persons who in the opinion of the Land Commission should get land.&rdquo;  That provision is wide enough to bring in the landless men, be they farmers' sons with practical experience or <Col N="1309" /> others who have gained experience and knowledge from other sources.</P>
    <P>I think the exclusion of people such as those has been a matter of deliberate policy with the Land Commission by reason of the fact that if they were admitted as an eligible group to whom land would be allocated, it would increase considerably the number, when added to the congests, whose cases are being considered all down the years and at the moment.  I should be inclined to agree with that policy if it is, as I say, a deliberate policy or, if not deliberate, certainly one that has a practical operation&mdash;that the congests, in so far as the Land Commission can do it, should be eradicated from the economic life of this country in relation to land and land tenure.  Once the situation has been worked out to the ultimate relief of congestion, in so far as it can be done, you come to the stage of considering, from the pool left and the land coming on to the market from time to time, whether it would be feasible or practicable to include these persons in the category to whom allocations should be made.</P>
    <P>I believe in free sale.  I believe a man should be free to dispose of his land. I believe a man should be free to hold on to his land, if it is being properly worked.  In that respect, from my experience, not alone political experience but also professional experience, I must say the Land Commission Courts are always extremely reasonable in their approach to the objector, if he shows he requires the lands for his own support or if he shows that the lands are being worked in a proper manner.  There are times when it is essential to take over a holding of land or some holdings of land in an area so that the scheme for rearrangement will not alone be possible but be a good scheme of rearrangement.</P>
    <P>There is always reference to migrants being brought from the West of Ireland to the various eastern and midland counties.  While not discounting in any way or taking from the truth of the allegation made here this afternoon by Deputy Hughes of Carlow in relation to a migrant brought there, I agree with the Minister's observation at the time when he said he thought <Col N="1310" /> Deputy Hughes was quoting an extremely isolated and unusual case. I have visited very many times the holdings of migrants in Kildare and Meath, particularly the holdings of migrants who have come from my own County of Mayo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <P>What about the Galway men?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>After last Sunday's performance in Tuam, I have no brief for the Galway men.  I must say that the lands allocated to these migrants are being worked in such a manner as to enable the Land Commission to take very just pride in their method of selection.  From County Mayo, certainly, and I am sure the same would apply to Donegal, parts of Galway and even the whole west coast, you can get people from smallholdings who have experience not alone of the difficulty of working such a smallholding but, in addition&mdash;due to seasonal migration for work on bigger farms in England and, even now, in this country on farms in the South and East&mdash;have a very specialised experience in and knowledge of the working of lands such as those of Counties Kildare and Meath.  Having that experience and knowledge, they could hardly fail to be a success.  I am satisfied they are a success.  I am satisfied they are people of whom the Land Commission must justly be proud, in their reaction to the State's effort to help them. There can be no doubt now, after Deputy Giles's speech here to-day&mdash; having regard to his utterances of the past, which he freely acknowledges&mdash; that the success of the migrants is enshrined forever in the Reports of this House in what might be called Deputy Giles's Conversion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hughes mentioned isolated cases and isolated people.  I think what he had in mind was that they should be brought as communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the migration system as operated up to date, with this particular exception, the truth of which I cannot doubt, has been a success and will continue to be a success, as long as the Land Commission continue to exercise the excellent discretion by way of selection which they appear to have exercised in the past.</P>
      <P>Somebody mentioned grants for housing generally and for amenities and the distinction between the Department of Local Government and the Land Commission.  Deputy Blowick brought that peculiarity to the notice of the Minister in the course of his speech.  It is something of which I have knowledge myself.  It is something to which the Minister would do well to direct his attention and collaborate and consult with the Minister for Local Government in that regard.</P>
      <P>There is one thing which I do not understand.  When the Land Commission are doing a scheme of resettlement in an area, they build houses for some and give houses to others&mdash;all the same kind of people and the same kind of holding.  When somebody is being upset, as it were&mdash; being moved too far from his original place&mdash;the Land Commission will build a house for him.  Where the site of the house is not too far removed from that of the old one, the person gets a grant instead.  That causes a lot of dissatisfaction.  There can be no doubt that the building of a house by the Land Commission, which is then given free to the occupier, will cause some jealousy to the person who has to build a house on the present grants available, which I am sure everybody will agree are not adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subject of roads, I can hardly refrain from keeping one road in my home village out of my mind.  Originally, the Land Commission built the roads notoriously narrow.  Repair was difficult.  The cart track was never able <Col N="1312" /> to be moved very much one way or the other and repair and maintenance were very difficult.  I fail to see why the Land Commission say, when they come to a village again after ten, 15 or 20 years, on rearrangement, striping and building, could not do something with a road which was theirs originally. Having put it into good shape, it might be possible to get the local authority to take it over.  In that way there might be initiated the system to which Deputy Giles referred and which he said is operating in Meath on a large scale.</P>
    <P>To come back again to the relief of congestion, apropos of the pool of land being small, I do not think it is as small as the Land Commission make it out to be.  The real truth of the matter is that the Land Commission have not got enough money at their disposal to purchase all the land they would like to purchase each year.  I would say that probably had something to do with their reluctance, or possibly their inability, to intervene in the sales of these estates in Carlow, to which Deputy Hughes has referred. Perhaps they would like to intervene because nobody wants to see syndicates, combines or large investors, be they individuals or corporations, coming in and taking over land and cropping it to death over a prolonged period and then selling it to the people around the area, in such a robbed condition.</P>
    <P>There is another way to help in the relief of congestion and I have adverted to this before.  I have spoken with certain officials of the Land Commission, principally the outdoor men, the inspectors, about this.  There are areas, particularly in the West, and more especially in Mayo, which have the appearance of bogland but which really are not boglands at all.  They are areas which are quite capable of cultivation and if the Land Commission would only take a cue from the successful operations of peatland at Glenamoy, initiated by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Blowick jointly, they will see how much can be done by way of cultivation on virgin bogs.</P>
    <P>The tracts I have in mind are not like that at all.  They are almost a cross between bogland and land which has been lying fallow for years.  I <Col N="1313" /> know of cases where the Land Commission are having difficulty in getting people in villages to move, people who would be only too glad to go a distance of two or two and a half miles to this kind of bog, which could be allocated to them in suitably sized holdings, and which they could work now with less difficulty than their forefathers who had to work with spades.  Now that we have rotovators, bulldozers and the like it could all be done very cheaply.</P>
    <P>I seriously suggest to the Minister, and to the Land Commission, that they could set up four holdings in such a manner at the cost of one in either Kildare, Meath or Carlow.  They would have a happy contented people.  The Land Commission's experience must have been the same as mine, that while there are some people clamouring to go to Carlow, there are an equal number who, if they were offered the chance, would want to stay where they are.  They want to stay in the environment in which they were brought up; they want to stay near the sea or near the bogland and turflands, in the environment of their forbears.  If the Land Commission want a particular instance, they have it in the Carter estate in the townland of Doolough where they are operating at the moment.  There are people there who are willing to move the two or two and a half miles to bogland and fallowland, which could be extremely fertile, and bordering on which there is one fertile holding which, down the years, has been cultivated from the same land by hand labour, with the spade and shovel and with sea manure.  It would be possible to put four people there at a cost of bringing one to Meath and it would probably do something to save that western population and particularly the Gaeltacht village there and keep that community together.</P>
    <P>With regard to vesting, there are many instances in which the Land Commission rush into vesting rather too quickly.  Anybody with legal experience, or practice, knows that it is very hard to find a valid objection to a proposed vesting order.  It is extremely difficult and very often we have to put up reasons that are not valid, legal reasons but nevertheless <Col N="1314" /> reasons which persuade the Land Commission Court&mdash;very often in its reasonableness, and only in its reasonableness and not for legal reasons&mdash; to postpone the vesting until some of the problems regarding turbary and so on have been finalised by the Land Commission inspector.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning of my observations, it is good to realise that the Minister and the Government are responsible for policy and that the Land Commission is completely independent in the regulation of its own operations.  I should like the Minister to make it very clear, as he did last year, to Deputies of all Parties, that that is the situation and that there is no point, as I said last evening on the Estimate for Fisheries, in the Minister making pious utterances of that kind, utterances which, I would go so far as to say, he himself believes to be correct while, at the same time, Deputies are giving the impression in their constituencies that the ultimate acquisition and allocation of land&mdash;which is the same as boats in the Fisheries Estimate&mdash;depend on whether you support a particular Deputy or not.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion to complain in my constituency, since the formation of this Government, about the impression which it was being sought to create by my colleagues in the constituency, and by the publication of replies to questions by the Minister.  The impression which it was sought to create was that the Minister, and the Land Commission, were doing what they were doing, at that time, as a result of persuasions by the Deputies concerned.</P>
    <P>I remember one time, I think it was at the time of the 1954 general election, when some comments were made in my constituency about the political loyalty of five or six families of migrants who had been moved from the area some time before, and who drove a long distance by car to come back to the polling booth in the constituency where their votes were on the register.  I heard Deputy Calleary say: &ldquo;That is the least they could do. Did I not get the holdings for them?&rdquo; While that is going on, there is no point in the Minister trying to preserve the independence of the Land Commission and preserve the independence <Col N="1315" /> of those isolated and defenceless people scattered all over the country, the outdoor staff of the Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy think he got the holdings for them or did he merely pretend he got the holdings for them?  That is another good game, you know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the kind of thing to which I am adverting.  There are people who do not play that game. The Minister does not like it.</P>
      <P>As we are on the subject, I should like to advert to page eight of the Minister's speech, under the heading &ldquo;Collection of Annuities&rdquo;, in which he states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The position with regard to the collection of land annuities continues to be very satisfactory.  At the 31st March, 1958, arrears outstanding amounted to £141,690, being a reduction of £872 on the corresponding figure last year.  The efficiency of the collection organisation has been maintained at the usual high level during the year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Note those words: &ldquo;The efficiency of the collection organisation has been maintained at the usual high level during the year.&rdquo;  This is where the pretence comes in.  In my constituency, there are lots of co-owners, usually in large tracts of mountain farms.  In a particular instance, brought to my notice only last Sunday, there are two co-owners on the holding.  One of the co-owners, either being unwilling to give his share of the annuity to the other man or the other man being unwilling to give it to him, sent to the Land Commission, through his solicitors, on 11th June of this year a money order for half of the annuity.  And the Land Commission, by letter dated 23rd June, 1958, and addressed to this man's solicitors in the town of Ballina, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Land Commission to refer to your letter of the 11th June, 1958, enclosing money order for £2 4s. on behalf of E.M., one of the co-owner tenants of the <Col N="1316" /> above holdings and to state that your client and E.K.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;I am deliberately using the initials&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;are jointly and severally responsible for payment of the annuity, the annual sum payable out of these holdings, and payment by Mr. E.M. of a moiety of the amount due would not absolve him from any liability for the amount outstanding or give him immunity from any proceedings which might have to be taken for recovery.  Accordingly, the money order forwarded by you is returned herewith.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There were no proceedings for recovery necessary, there were no arrears&mdash;and the money is returned.  Listen to the next paragraph, which is a violent attack upon the ruthless realism of the Minister defending non-interference in Land Commission business.  This is the paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am to point out that Deputy Seán Doherty recently made representations in these cases and, at his request, Receivable Orders were issued in his name as he undertook to endeavour to have the instalments paid in their entirety each half year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What are we coming to?  What is the meaning of this new form of bailiff? There is one good explanation for this. The explanation is that the gentleman who interviewed Deputy Doherty in this House some weeks ago&mdash;I saw him here but I did not know at the time what he was at&mdash;now would be able to say to his neighbours: &ldquo;I made the other fellow give my man the money,&rdquo; accordingly enhancing the prestige of Deputy Doherty as a person who had such tremendous influence with the Land Commission that he could get a Receivable Order in respect of land of which he was neither the owner nor occupier in his own name at his request on the fraudulent representation that he was representing these two men.  Listen to what the paragraph says again:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am to point out that Deputy Seán Doherty recently made representations in these cases...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to inform the Minister and the Land Commission now, on behalf of the man to whose solicitors this letter <Col N="1317" /> was sent by the Land Commission, that not now or at any time will 1d. of his money be handed to Deputy Doherty for collection.</P>

      <P>It is; and I would advise Deputy Browne to go down to his Party room and speak to my colleagues and try to get them to lift themselves up to the standard of public representation in County Wexford. I am perfectly aware that the putting of a man's name on a Receivable Order does not give him any right, title, estate or interest in the lands; but there are people who would believe that it gives a right or title to an estate or interest in the lands, and there are people who believe that the prestige resulting from the policy of pursuing a course of fraud of this kind on the public is something that should be sought after and something to which due homage should be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land tenure and dealings with land and the fight for land have been part of our history.  The people are extremely sceptical of any unauthorised dealings <Col N="1319" /> with their land.  We in the West of Ireland have had bitter experiences of lands getting into the hands of business people by means which were often doubtful and which were often sinister. I am not suggesting that that is the case here but the case here is an effort to show the great influence some people have with a body which the Minister says nobody can influence. That is the part of it to which I object and that is the part to which the man who has authorised me to speak on his behalf here takes exception.</P>
    <P>When I brought the matter to the notice of the Land Commission, they asked me if I wanted these Receivable Orders withdrawn.  I said: &ldquo;No; I do not want them withdrawn; I am not making any such request; what I want to know is whether there is any statutory authority for the issue of Receivable Orders in such circumstances; and, secondly, were representations made to the Land Commission that the particular Deputy was representing the two co-owners?&rdquo; The answer to the first question was &ldquo;no&rdquo; and the answer to the second question was &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There being no statutory authority and they being issued on the basis of a fraudulent representation, I would urge the Minister that, if he does not do it in public, he should seriously admonish privately the Deputy of his Party who lends himself to that kind of thing.  It will have no result, in the collection of annuities or anything else, but the lowering of the prestige and the standard of integrity of the Land Commission down to the level to which Deputy Killilea would like to bring it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I welcome the efforts of the Land Commission in the division of estates which are on their hands for quite a long time.  I am glad an effort is being made to speed up their division.  I heard Deputies, not merely to-day during this Vote but down the years, advocate the fixing up of landless men with land.  I have always held that the purpose for which the Land Commission was established was to deal with uneconomic landholders.  If landless men are to be fixed up, I am afraid <Col N="1320" /> another body will have to be established to do that job.  All of us are pretty well aware that the amount of land available for division is very limited.  It would never cover more than a very small fraction of the tenants who are on £5, £6 or £7 valuations, or less, at the present time. Therefore, the question of dealing with landless men must be left to some other body.  Perhaps that might be done; but I would not like to see the Land Commission deviate from their principal job, that is, the bringing of the tenants on small valuations up as near as possible to an economic standard.</P>
      <P>There is one very strong objection most of us have at present.  Where holdings are up for sale and we remind the Land Commission that their acquisition would help to relieve congestion in a locality, the Land Commission ignore our representations and give some type of excuse which is plausible for the moment and so avoid taking over those lands.  That course will lead to the moneyed element stepping in and purchasing holding after holding; then they will become ranches again and the Land Commission problem will not be solved for another generation or two.  Even now, these estates are tending to become very large again and this question will have to be tackled again at a later stage.</P>
      <P>The question of housing is certainly something which requires immediate attention.  The houses built by the Land Commission to-day are not nearly as good as the labourers' cottages built by the county councils.  It is deplorable to see the types of little bedrooms that have been provided, into which people are asked to go, where there is not accommodation for a man and his wife and one or two children.  Everyone knows the small farmers have pretty large families and require a better type of house than that.</P>
      <P>In my constituency, there are very large tracts of turbary which we have been pressing the Land Commission for a long time to take over, so as to provide the tenants with turbary.  That is not being done and the representations to the Land Commission seem to be useless.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the Dublin pilots have stated publicly that they have not been given a fair and reasonable opportunity to submit statements and evidence in support of their representations to him under the relevant sections of the Pilotage Act, 1913; and whether in view of that complaint he will now take steps to have an inquiry by such means as may be considered best into the representations of these pilots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statement referred to.  The Irish Pilots' and Marine Officers' Association, in a letter to me dated 24th January, 1958, indicated that they were invoking Section 18 of the Pilotage Act, 1913, on the grounds that the extent to which the Dublin pilotage authority was recommending an increase in pilotage dues was inadequate in relation to the claims of the pilots.  In support of these representations, the association furnished me with a copy of the very voluminous submission made to the pilotage authority in the matter.  I considered these representations very fully, in conjunction with the detailed observations of the pilotage authority on the submission, but I was unable to find any reason which would justify me in refusing to sanction the increase in pilotage dues proposed by the pilotage authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 18 of the Pilotage Act provides that wherever the majority of the pilots at a port; or six or more persons who are masters or owners or insurers of vessels using that port; or any dock or harbour authority, other than the pilotage authority, object to any by-law in force at a port, or desire that any by-law should be in force at a port which is not in force, they may make representations to that effect to the Minister.  If the representations <Col N="1322" /> appear to him reasonable, the Minister, after giving the pilotage authority, and, if he thinks fit, any other person, an opportunity to make representations, may, by Order, require a pilotage authority to submit to him for confirmation a by-law for the purpose of giving effect to the representations.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the Pilotage Act, 1913, does not provide for an appeal, or an oral hearing, and I did not find it necessary to ask for any oral discussion to supplement the very comprehensive material submitted to me by both parties.  It is quite clear that the section does not confer on me any power or obligation to act as arbitrator between pilotage authorities and pilots in matters relating to pilots' remuneration, and I would consider it to be an abuse of my powers under that section to attempt to use them to force a pilotage authority to make substantial increases in pilots' remuneration against the decision of such authority.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the sanctioning of the increase in pilotage dues, proposed by the pilotage authority to provide the increased remuneration to pilots on which the authority had decided, does not preclude the authority from reconsidering the adequacy of the pilotage dues at any future time.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the representations of the pilots to the extent of my statutory functions, and I do not propose to intervene in aspects of the matter which are properly the concern of the Dublin pilotage authority in the exercise of their statutory responsibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated that an inquiry is not possible would he consider affording the pilots an opportunity of presenting their views to him in the same way as he has done on some occasions in the past in the case of pilots at various ports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, I want to make it quite clear, in view of a statement which was made that Section 18 of the Pilotage Act, 1913, was used on previous occasions by pilots in other ports, that I have had a search made in the records of my Department <Col N="1323" /> and I can find no trace of any representations under that section ever having been made.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to make quite clear is that the proposition that was made to me, as I understood it, was that I should refuse to sanction the increase in pilotage dues for which the pilotage authority sought sanction in order to force the pilotage authority to give a much greater increase in remuneration than they themselves were prepared to give.  I would consider that, as I said, an abuse of my powers under the section.  I, therefore, sanctioned the increased dues which the pilotage authority sought and that was the end of my statutory function in the matter.  As I have pointed out, by doing so I closed no door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has indicated his statutory function and as, in his view, he has gone as far as his statutory function permits, would he, at the same time, be prepared to consider giving the pilots an opportunity of submitting these representations to him, not under any specific section of the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of remuneration of pilots is one for the pilotage authority.  I have no function in the matter and I would not interfere with the discretion of the pilotage authority except in circumstances where the trade of the harbour was adversely affected by some development. My concern is solely in the operation of the port.  The remuneration of the pilots is a matter for the pilotage authority and I have no power whatever to force a pilotage authority into any course of action in that regard.</P>

I would ask the Minister to pay reasonable attention to representations I have already made to the Land Commission in connection with a number of those so that the matter would be speeded up.</P>
      <P>It was rather interesting to listen to Deputy Lindsay's speech in which there was a little bit of jealousy.

      <P>Deputy Doherty was trying to fix up a grievance between two of his constituents.  It is the Deputy's duty, if he can, to try to stop the Land Commission from bringing the full powers of the State on top of such people.  I think a Deputy does a good day's work if he tries to stop all that labour and expense and, if the Land Commission will listen to such efforts to straighten things out, nobody should try to put a stop to such a practice. Deputy Lindsay apparently does not see much of his constituency and does not know much of the worries that exist in it.  That is a sample of the things we all have to do from day to day.</P>

      <P>No, but you will always get people who will try to fix up a grievance between two other people and the Land Commission will always meet one half way in a matter of that sort.  I have got people to accept responsibility for the payment of an annuity where an individual had left the country temporarily.  I hope the Land Commission will continue to meet us half way in matters like this when we try to fix up any such grievances. It would make things very much easier for the tenants concerned and would save considerable expense where the Land Commission might otherwise have to put in a sheriff's officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Dillon would probably do.  The Land Commission are right in meeting Deputies half way in matters of this nature.  Our duty is to try to relieve the worries and troubles of our constituents if we can do so and there is no reason why we should not make every effort to iron out grievances of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would again stress the urgency and importance of dealing with lands put up for sale.  I do not see any reason why the Land Commission should not become more active and take a greater interest in the purchase of such holdings for division amongst congests in areas where no other land is available and where there is no hope of <Col N="1332" /> solving the uneconomic land problem. It has come to our notice that in different areas a man having 50 acres can purchase another 50 and again, some time later, purchase another 50.  The poor people cannot look at that land. Somebody must come to their rescue and the only body in whom they have confidence is the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions, I have almost had rows with the Minister himself and with the Land Commission because they did not travel in the direction I thought they should have travelled.  There were occasions in which I was afterwards proven right and they were wrong.  There is the case of the Newell estate in Newgarden. I made strong representations to the Minister and to the Land Commission for the acquisition of that land.  They told me other lands would be available in the area, but now it has turned out that these other lands are not available, as I knew they would not, when they first told me that.  Any Deputy who knows his constituency fairly well knows the conditions that exist in it and knows what lands are available for the Land Commission. It is up to that Deputy to make representations to the Commission, and it is the duty of the Land Commission to take cognisance of those representations.  The Land Commission should not take heed of fake reports sent into them from time to time.</P>
    <P>On the subject of bogs, I have in mind one bog on the Boora estate in north Galway.  For 15 years, I have been endeavouring to get the Land Commission to take over that bog.  At the same time, there have been certain turbaries on the Clonbroonagh estate, on the Purcell estate, at Clanbricka and Glenaneem.  There is not a sod of turf there, but there are 100 acres of bog adjoining but we cannot get an acre of turbary.  That is something which could be easily rectified by the Land Commission in a very short time. There is also the McDonald estate outside Tuam, where at the moment we have not got turf, where there is no hope of getting turf except at enormous expense and yet this bog remains undivided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> I know it is not the fault of the local officials that things are not being done. I believe that in County Galway we have got the best type of officials one could find in any part of Ireland, men who are prepared to go a long way to try to remedy any grievances amongst Land Commission tenants, and I compliment them on the very huge job of work they are doing and trust they will continue on those lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is one in which people outside the House take a great interest because the Land Commission is associated very much with the question of land in the country and, in the eyes of the people, is responsible for the acquisition and division of land. In regard to the division of land, the Land Commission have been pursuing their policy of rearranging and acquisition over the years.  In connection with the applications which they receive, and the way in which these applications are dealt with, I think there is too much rigidity in regard to the distance limit within which applicants are considered.  I know that as a general rule the limit laid down is a statute mile for smallholders.  They must be within a mile radius of the estate to be divided and very often there are deserving cases just a short distance outside that mile limit.  I know it will be said that if the limit is extended by one-tenth of a mile, then it can be extended by two-tenths, and so on, but it is a fact that very often in cases where estates are being divided, young married farmers who happen to be outside the mile limit find they will not be considered for land division.</P>
      <P>Another limitation which I think is not desirable is that a single man, who owns an uneconomic portion of land, is not looked upon with such favour as a married applicant.  The argument against that limitation is that such a man might very well leave the country.  In a good many of these cases, young men own small portions of uneconomic land, due to the tradition of the system of land tenure in this country.  They have only ten, 12 or 15 acres of land and would be unable to marry and settle down at the present time, unless there was a prospect of their obtaining an additional ten or 15 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> The third class of people referred to is that class which is known as landless.  The stock answer of the Land Commission in dealing with people in that class has been for a long period: &ldquo;We can do nothing for them.&rdquo;  Down through the years, small farmers in this country have raised large families and there will be a great many cases referred to by Deputies here to-day of young farmers who have been brought up on the land, who have served their apprenticeship to land management, who are excellent in regard to management and the use that could be made of land, but who, because they have not got land at the present time, are not considered for a holding.  Because of that, there is no hope for a very large number of people who would be able and willing to work land well.  We see them leaving the country, or, as has been mentioned already, going to the cities to take up work there, though they are far better suited to work on the land.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to deal with the problem of delay in allotting lands.  I have heard other Deputies refer to the number of estates in the hands of the Land Commission.  I addressed a question to the Minister previously in regard to an estate in my constituency and the very large number of people expecting some consideration with regard to portion of those lands.  An industrial concern got a farm in another part of the county, but, having got it, they exchanged it with the Land Commission and secured an area of land contiguous to the City of Limerick.  People there had been looking forward to portion of that division and, at the present time, there is still a portion of that estate unallotted. I think it has been in the hands of the Land Commission for upwards of five years and perhaps the Minister would be able to indicate if the remaining portion of that estate will be made available in the near future for the enlargement of uneconomic holdings and for division among suitable applicants in the area.</P>
    <P>There was also another holding which I cannot say was offered to the Land Commission, but of which the Land Commission has been aware for practically <Col N="1335" /> 12 months.  It is between Askeaton and Rathkeale, an estate on the Langford lands, in an area which is very congested.  Admittedly, the land is not good.  It is perhaps stony and craggy, and not the kind of land which the Land Commission would ordinarily feel inclined to take, but it is just as good as the land which the people have there at the moment, and on which families have been reared for generations.  This land has been let for years and I do not think there would be any difficulty in acquiring it and dividing it amongst people there.  It would benefit them very much and would raise the standard of living of the people in the area.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a statement to-day in regard to leases.  It was something I was not aware of and I think it is a very useful thing.  Perhaps the Minister would give us an indication of how long these leases might run for.  There have been in the past, there are at the present time and there will be in the future, people who take land for dairying and for working in the cattle business and over the years these people have been paying rental on the 11 months' system.  In one case a family engaged in dairying for over 20 years.  Last year the farm was sold and these people, who had spent years on it and had paid a large sum annually, were classed as landless. They had not the money to buy the tract of land or portion of it.  It was felt that the Land Commission might acquire the lands.  They did not and these people were left without a living and had to move elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There are people who have taken land for grazing on the 11 months' system.  It would be of great advantage to them if they knew that they could acquire lands on a long lease. That would enable them to make a long-term arrangement in regard to their problems of housing and so on.</P>
    <P>Last year I approached the Minister about the question of the banks on the Lower Maigue.  The Minister met me very readily and assisted farmers in that area.  The banks were inclined to give way.  The Minister on that occasion said that he would do something. <Col N="1336" /> There are some lands along the Lower Maigue which are still in the possession of the Land Commission. Where the Lower Maigue enters the Shannon, the river becomes silted up and when the waters reach the main embankment they are held there. There is often flooding in that area after rain and the people suffer great hardship and inconvenience.  I know that the funds available to the Land Commission are very inadequate for the job that has to be done.  There is a promise that the embankments will eventually be transferred to the Office of Public Works.  Until that is done, the Minister should consider what he would be able to do to alleviate the postion of farmers in the area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the portions of lands in the hands of the Land Commission, I am glad to hear the Minister say that an attempt is being made to get rid of those lands as soon as possible. Where lands are held for a time and are let year after year, two things happen in regard to them.  First and foremost, the people who feel that they may have a chance of acquiring portion of the land are inclined to bid rather heavily for lettings.  Secondly, the longer the lands are kept the more discontent there will eventually be and, of course, the less value the land will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one point at the outset.  It is a point that I made on the Estimate last year and possibly the year before.  If a Deputy writes a letter to a Department, other than the Department of Lands and the Department of Social Welfare, he will receive an interim reply.  One of the main purposes a Deputy has is to serve the interests of his constituents.  I have never been able to understand why the Department of Lands cannot do the same as any other Department. It is freely accepted that, if you make representations with regard to any matter concerning lands, it may take a considerable time for the case to be investigated.  It is only fair to a Deputy, if he does make representations in writing, that he should get a proper acknowledgment to that effect. What the Deputy gets is a small slip of paper saying that the letter has been received.  He would get that if he <Col N="1337" /> were not a Deputy.  If a Deputy has any particular function in making representations to this Department, I fail to see why they should not send a proper interim reply.  They have a wholly unenviable record with the Department of Social Welfare in this respect.</P>
      <P>As far as I know, these two Departments are the only State Departments who do not reply.  It may be answered that if one writes to the Minister's office one will get a reply.  That is perfectly true.  I do not see why the Minister's Private Secretary should be bothered every time a Deputy wishes to make representations.  There is staff in the Department to deal with such matters.  They have a big enough staff there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Deputy would send me particulars because, as far as I know, in the ordinary way, interim replies are sent.  I should be glad to investigate the matter if the Deputy would send me particulars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall answer the Minister straightway, that I have never received an interim reply from the Department of Lands yet, except a small bit of paper saying that they have got the letter, a communication which the ordinary man in the street would get.  That is the answer to that. I can say that I never had an interim reply to any letter that I ever wrote to the Land Commission.  I get a reply eventually, when investigations are carried out, which may be a month later, when one has nearly forgotten what it is about, except that you have the name of the person concerned to whom you can send it.  I am glad the Minister has intervened and I hope that in future when I or any other Deputy writes to the Secretary of the Department they will have the courtesy to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not get the little acknowledgment in Irish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  You get that even if you are not a Deputy.  Deputy Corish may not want an acknowledgment that he can send to the person concerned to indicate that the matter <Col N="1338" /> is being investigated.  Normally speaking, it takes a month for the Land Commission to investigate.  I do not think any the worse of them for that because these things are often very complicated.</P>
      <P>I also regret that I have to refer again to the Courtown estate, to which I referred on the Forestry Estimate, as a public utility.  Although this estate belongs to the Forestry Division, I crave the indulgence of the Chair in bringing it up on the Land Commission Estimate.  The reason I do so is that when the Minister was replying to the forestry debate on the 26th June&mdash; Volume 169, No. 6, column 889&mdash;he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deputy Dr. Esmonde referred to the Courtown estate, and I reply to him by saying that on 27th February, it was intended to offer parts of the estate which are arable or semi-arable for sale by public tender.  The total area involved was 77 acres and the Land Commission have informed the Forestry Division that they are not interested in the land.  It would be difficult for me to discuss a Land Commission question on a forestry debate because, as I have often indicated, I must leave these matters to the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter now purely for the purpose of giving the Minister the opportunity of replying in the Land Commission debate to the matters to which I referred as a public utility.  I will not weary the House by detailing all that went on over the Courtown estate, where there are still 77 acres of arable land of which the Forestry Division or the Land Commission or somebody has possession but which is not to be divided among the numerous smallholders in that district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore it rather surprised me when the Minister in his statement made a long reference to the acquisition of land, the amount of land that is available and how he would like to raise the valuation of land he is to distribute among smallholders.  One must have every sympathy with the Minister in that matter, but it is hard to be sympathetic when you know that parcels of arable land have repeatedly <Col N="1339" /> been offered to the Minister's Department and they will not take them.  It does not make sense.  We all know there is a shortage of arable land and of the great desire to get it for the Department so that they may accommodate as many smallholders as possible and make uneconomic holdings economic.  Seeing that the Minister is in charge of both land and forestry, I cannot understand why, if the forestry section say to the Land Commission that they have so many acres of arable land, the Land Commission cannot take it.</P>
    <P>Sometimes in Wexford you have a belt of arable land in a forest.  I regret to say in some cases it has been planted, but I am not concerned with that in this Estimate.  Some machinery should be contrived whereby that arable land can be transferred to the Department of Lands and divided amongst smallholders.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate what machinery exists in his Department and how many officials are concerned in this transfer.  It takes weeks and months before an inspector comes to look at the land, and when he does come to look at it another long period elapses while the matter goes through the hands of another half dozen civil servants.  I am not blaming civil servants. They are doing their duty in carrying out this feudal system that has existed for years in this Department. Somehow a system has grown up of spending sixpence to try to save a penny.</P>
    <P>The only person who can redress that system is the Minister himself.  I am not suggesting that the system is peculiar to the Minister's period of office.  Ever since I have been in public life, it has been there.  If you go to the Land Commission it takes you a long time even to discover who is dealing with the particular matter and, when you do discover that, you find that nothing definite has been done one way or the other.  I think that is the experience of a great many Deputies.  I cannot imagine that there are any great legal problems involved which cause the delay between these two Departments under the one Minister, <Col N="1340" /> although I believe they have different systems of finance.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister a couple of months ago how many estates in County Wexford were in the hands of the Land Commission.  I know there is one estate in their hands since the 9th December, 1955.  I asked him about another estate, the Bolger estate, as to whether it was proposed to divide it or not.  There are smallholders surrounding this estate, or if not immediately adjacent to it they are within a few miles of it.  It is a rich tract of arable land which was offered freely to the Land Commission on that date in 1955.  Having taken over that land the Land Commission relet it and I am informed it is relet again this year.  What is the purpose of the Land Commission acquiring that land, as they did, on a free market if they will not divide it amongst people around it who are willing to take land there?  It is nearly three years now since this land was taken over.</P>

      <P>I read the Minister's speech.  That is why I am raising these points to make it clear that there is something wrong in my constituency. It is my function to come in here to speak on such a subject as this, to get land divided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another estate in South Wexford, the Dean Estate, consisting of 227 acres of land.  I know the matter is being examined.  I do not know for certain but I imagine a scheme must have been submitted in that case for quite a considerable time.  I also know that there is a family there who recently have had their house burned down and as far as I can understand, they have been advised that they will <Col N="1341" /> get a holding of land there and have a house built for them.  They were expecting this scheme to come through this year and that they would be able to get a house built in order that they would have a roof over their heads. The same answer is given to every parliamentary question: &ldquo;Proceedings are there; the scheme is being prepared&rdquo;, and so forth, but nothing has happened. The Department have had that estate less than a month after the one I have just mentioned, 4th January, 1956.  There is nothing to prevent that land being divided.</P>
    <P>The place is bristling with smallholders but the land is let again this year and I am told it is very doubtful if it will be divided at all before the end of this year.  In fact it has no chance of being divided before next spring.  Therefore in spite of what the Minister says in his cheery optimism in his opening address about trying to divide that land as quickly as possible and trying to get more land, and so forth, it does not seem to me that the scheme is moving as it should move. I can only give the position as I see it myself, and even though we are told here that schemes are being pushed forward, that these matters are under consideration, I have a suspicion that many of these estates have not even got as far as the commissioners.  I have a feeling that this very complicated machinery folds them up on the way through as otherwise smallholders would not have to wait three years for something to happen.</P>
    <P>One of the things which I think rather militates against the Department in procuring land is that, very often, for some reason or other, when the Department buy land, they do not pay auctioneer's fees.  The normal procedure with land now is that when it is put on the open market, the Land Commission buy it on the open market.  When farmers put land up for auction, the Land Commission put a bid on it without interfering in any way with the sale, which is correct. That is free sale.  That is what people fought for, for generations&mdash;the right to do what they like with their land and to abolish the old system.</P>
    <P>If the Land Commission acted like a <Col N="1342" /> normal buyer and paid auctioneer's fees, they would be able to get land more easily.  Naturally, an auctioneer will try to sell land where he can get fees rather than hand it over to the Land Commission from whom he will get nothing.  I do not see why they should not behave like ordinary people when buying land.</P>
    <P>The Department of Lands have given up acquiring land in Wexford.  I would never be keen on the Department of Lands acquiring land if anybody was actually dependent on it.  I have in mind, for example, an elderly widow or somebody who might be dependent on the rent from a farm.  It is only fair to leave it there during her time, for instance.  However, there are cases of people who do not live in this country drawing rents from farms.  There are even some people in the United States who are renting the land here.  They are no benefit to the country, one way or another.  That is a normal case&mdash; particularly if there are no kith or kin in this country to inherit the land.  I think that would be a suitable instance in which the Department should take the land.</P>
    <P>So far as I know, there has been no acquisition of land for the past 12 months or so due to some order.  In his opening statement, the Minister said they are not acquiring any land now as they are trying to divide the land they already have.  I believe they are not dividing it as quickly as they ought to.  There is a very big staff in the Land Commission.  There is a considerable financial provision for the Land Commission in this Estimate.  Is it necessary to have such a big staff there?  At times, I wonder if it is necessary for the Land Commission to exist at all.  We might get on just as well if we had a Finance Department to cover it.  We could still have the commissioner system to see that land is fairly divided and I suppose we would require a few people to inspect land on behalf of the Department.</P>
    <P>With so much land already divided, as time goes on, there will be less work for the Land Commission.  Therefore, I do not see why we require this enormous Department.  The Minister <Col N="1343" /> pointed out in his introductory speech that the staff has been reduced by 33 in the past 12 months: it has been reduced by a couple of hundred in the past ten years.  In view of the fact that some annuities must now be paid off on farms which were once the property of the Land Commission, in view of the fact that the amount of property under their control is growing less and less, as less land is available for division, one would expect some reduction or diminution in the numbers in the Department.  I do not suggest putting people with families dependent on them out of employment, but the Minister should see to it that there will not be an increase in the staff and that the numbers will be kept down as much as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about speeding-up the division of lands.  Saying a thing does not actually achieve it.  He should give us some indication of how he proposes to speed up the division of land.  We might not then have so many parliamentary questions from infuriated Deputies asking why land is held for so long and not divided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Land Commission system is completely wrong.  By the term &ldquo;the present system&rdquo;, I mean the system operated by the Minister and his predecessor.</P>
      <P>The system of land division in North Tipperary has been very unfair to cottage holders and landless men for a good many years past.  They are people who should receive a certain amount of the land that is being divided.  The present Minister and the former Minister will tell us there is nothing in the land Acts to debar landless men or cottage holders from getting land.  If you follow up the matter closely, you find that landless men and cottage holders are the very last on the list of persons qualified to get land.  If any land is left over after every section of the people has been catered for, the landless men and the cottage holders will then qualify for a portion of an estate.  Surely that is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the system operating in this country for a long number of years, the Land Commission do not acquire a farm unless it is not being properly <Col N="1344" /> worked.  Take, for example, a farm of 200 or 300 acres.  In the good times, the owner was able to employ five or six men.  As times became harder and harder, he had to lay them off until he had perhaps only one man or two. Someone notified the Land Commission who then stepped in and told the owner he was not working his land to the best advantage and acquired his farm.</P>
    <P>Under the law, the one workman or the two workmen in occupation and working with that owner may possibly qualify for a certain amount of the land, but the other men who had worked on it for one, two or three years do not qualify.  That is very unfair. In all those estates, you have people and small farmers' sons who marry and, having no holding to get at home, apply for cottages and get them built on the estates.  Yet, when the estates are being divided, they do not qualify for a portion of the land.  They may qualify if land is available over and above what everybody else wants. It is obvious that the present system of land division is completely wrong.</P>
    <P>If we are to keep people in rural Ireland and help them to rear a family in healthy conditions there, every cottage-holder living on every estate being divided should qualify, as they did some years ago, to get five, six or seven acres of the land in question, that is, if they qualify to the extent of being in a position to work and to stock those seven or eight acres.  When I say &ldquo;stock,&rdquo; I mean to have a cow or two, which will help them to rear a young family.  Under present milk regulations in the country, 90 per cent. of the farmers are not allowed to sell milk and in rural Ireland we have the position that agricultural labourers are finding it very difficult to get supplies of milk, because if a farmer supplies them he can, under certain regulations, be brought to court.  The Minister should try to change this position and give those landless men five or six acres on which they can keep a cow and which will help to make them a little more industrious.  If they have a cow, it means that they can have a calf and also that they will have milk for <Col N="1345" /> the family.  That would help to stem the rush from the land.</P>
    <P>In North Tipperary, we have a vast number of small farmers with perhaps a valuation of £12 or £13 and who have four, five or six sons but none of those will qualify to get conacre, because it is the owner of the farm who has to qualify, and if he has a valuation anywhere around £12 or £13, he gets no land at all.  The result is that agricultural labourers and farmers' sons have to emigrate.  There is nothing to keep them at home and they have no interest in the land.  Since I became a member of this House, I have put down questions regarding the Land Commission and when I was a Senator, I also made inquiries about their activities.  The Minister tells us that he has no control over the Land Commission.  It is very wrong if a Deputy cannot get a reply from the Minister regarding the activities of that body.</P>
    <P>I do not know how this House can accept responsibility for providing a vast amount of money, year after year, for the Land Commission, over which we have no direct control.  I am not advocating that the Minister should have complete control, nor am I suggesting that he should have control in the sense that he could direct their activities, but I am suggesting that any member of this House should be in a position to ask the Minister about the activities of the Land Commission, in any part of the State.  That is very important because we see things going on, and I do not mean in North Tipperary alone, about which we should be able to ask questions.  When we hear things about the Land Commission, we do not know whether they are actually true or not.</P>
    <P>In North Tipperary, we find that the Land Commission are very backward. They are not so backward in the matter of acquiring farms but in the matter of dividing them.  We find that they also take over a farm from a farmer because he is not working that land to their satisfaction.  I have a case in mind where a man was not farming his farm to the Land Commission's satisfaction. He was setting it in conacre and had been so setting it for about three years.  The commission came <Col N="1346" /> along and, after acquiring the farm, they set it for another three years. There was no question of title because the man from whom they had acquired it had bought it only three years previously and the title was completely in order.  This case was in Lower Ormond, North Tipperary, 90 per cent. of which comprises tillage land.</P>
    <P>Anyone who takes conacre has no interest in it except what he can get out of it.  He is not going to put fertilisers on the land over and above the amount he may get from the crop which he grows on it.  The commission came along and set this land as low as £1 an acre.  The land became so poor that the people would not take it at even £1 or £2 an acre.  After setting it back for the last couple of years, they proceeded, a fortnight ago, to hand it over and the people who have got it are now burdened with 12, 13 and even 20 acres of stubble ground, which will not grow a crop for at least the next ten to 12 years.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister what is the position.  You buy a farm of 100 acres for £1,000, or maybe £1,600 or even £2,000 and you start to set that every year.  Is it possible to get back the purchase price paid to the previous owner, before he hands it over to the small tenants, who are getting land which gives them no return for a long number of years?</P>
    <P>This position may not actually occur in other counties, but it does occur in areas where tillage is predominant, such as in Lower Ormond.  Provided that the title and such matters are in order, I hope the Minister will do his best to get these farms which the Land Commission take over divided out amongst the people who want to get some benefit out of them.  The people will have to pay rent and rates on the portion of land which they get, and it will be ten to 12 years before they get a return of one penny.  I am not blaming this Minister for that position.  No matter what Government is in power, I think it is very unfair that a farm is acquired and the Land Commission then set it and keep setting it, in an effort to get back all the money, or threequarters of the money which they have paid for it</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> With regard to pumps erected by the Land Commission, I find that I can get no reply from any official of the Land Commission when I ask them who is responsible for the repair of those pumps which are put up on farms.  The same applies to the roads which they have built in my area.  No one seems to have any responsibility for them.  The Land Commission are not responsible; the tenants say they are not responsible; and the county council in my area refuses to take over a Land Commission road.  I raised the matter at North Tipperary County Council and the manager rightly pointed out that those roads are not made up to the standard required for a county council road and that it would be a terrible burden on them to acquire them.  I would ask the Minister to try to put those roads in the required good order and then make it compulsory on the county council to take them over.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the question of drainage by the Land Commission. Within the last couple of weeks, I had occasion to get in touch with the Land Commission in regard to drainage carried out by them in North Tipperary.  In the subdividing of an estate in my area, the Land Commission cleaned a vast amount of bog, with the result that it flooded three or four farmers on good arable land at the lower end.  This has been going on for a long time.  The three farmers did everything humanly possible to get the Land Commission to finish out their drains in order to get an outlet for the surface water brought down but nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission went so far as to offer one of the tenants a farm in another part of North Tipperary.  His land was so badly flooded that he agreed to remove to this farm.  After giving his consent to the removal, he found that the Land Commission changed their mind and said: &ldquo;No, we cannot give you this farm in North Tipperary, but we will give you one in Laois-Offaly.&rdquo;  He refused to go to Laois-Offaly and, because of that, he is left there now.  A fortnight ago, he told me that nothing could be done because he had refused a farm in Laois-Offaly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> If the Minister does not mind my saying so, I think there should be a little more common sense in the activities of the Land Commission. This House votes a vast amount of money to the Land Commission.  When we try to get answers to certain things, we are told the Minister has no responsibility for the work of the Land Commission. It is a wrong system that the House which votes the money has no power to see whether it is spent wisely or not.  I should like the Minister to make some statement about the rights of all Deputies in this matter.  I am not blaming this Minister alone; the other people were just as bad.</P>
    <P>I know there is nothing in the Land Acts which debars a landless man or a cottage holder from getting land.  It is like telling a working man he will not be debarred from going into the Gresham Hotel.  The only thing that will debar him is the amount of money in his pocket.  A landless man can get land only when everyone else in the locality has been completely satisfied. In other words, you can bring a man from £5 up to £12 and then bring him from £12 up to £20, and still leave the landless man out.  I think we are all interested in keeping our people on the land.  If the Minister is interested&mdash; and he may be more interested than many people&mdash;he should make it clear that when any estate is being divided cottage holders or landless men living on or adjoining the estate will get at least six or seven acres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not usually get in on this Estimate, but I felt I would not be doing my duty to my constituents if I did not speak on this occasion. During the past year, we had an extraordinary case in Carlow.  It concerned two estates, one of them called Browns Hill and the other Oak Park.  Browns Hill had been purchased by an Englishman some six years ago for the sole purpose, not of carrying on good husbandry, but of just working out the land by tillage, and, after that had been done, after the land had been stripped of all its goodness and fertility, selling the land again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After carrying that on for six years, the person concerned bought another estate put up, Oak Park, consisting of <Col N="1349" /> 1,500 acres.  The normal person in this country could not possibly buy that estate.  It was an ideal opportunity for the Land Commission to come in and buy it.  The estate surrounds the town of Carlow.  The former owner carried on very good husbandry there and kept a very large number of cows, between 110 and 120, I am informed.  The people of Carlow brought this matter to the Minister's attention, but he made no effort whatever.  He said that if there was agitation, he would not touch it at all.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement to-day&mdash;I gathered from one sentence&mdash;the Minister said he would not interfere with the normal practice of land sale.  I quite agree that is a proper attitude to take, but is this not an abnormal land sale in this area&mdash;the sale of 1,500 acres?  That does not come on the market week after week or month after month in Ireland.  It was an ideal opportunity.  People badly off for land and the Minister just would not raise his hand to do anything in that case. As a matter of fact, I was asked by the local people to go on a deputation to the Minister.  I went with some of the other Deputies on that deputation.  The Minister was very good to receive us, but he pointed out he was not going to interfere in the matter.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Tierney said, we had a case where a man purchased a farm and, because he put most of it into tillage for three years, the inspectors went down and the farm was taken over by the Land Commission.  Here is an estate of 700 acres owned by a person who does not reside there, who has no roots whatever in this country, who just comes over here from London, Surrey, or wherever he lives, stops a night or two in the local hotel and moves back again when he sees everything is going all right.  In the first case, because the land was put under tillage constantly for three years, the Land Commission felt they were justified in taking it over.  In the other case, the land was five years under corn crops and one year under beet.  There was no provision for rotation for six years.  Whatever the cause, the Minister did not move.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned in his <Col N="1350" /> opening statement that the demand for land is beyond the capacity of the Land Commission to satisfy.  Is that right&mdash;with 1,500 acres coming on the market and the Minister having no intention of taking it over?  The Minister is not doing his job as Minister for Lands.  When he went in first, we heard a lot about his being young and energetic and it was said there would be a big change.  Instead of that, as far as we down the country see, he has done nothing.  These people have been under grave aggravation, but have remained very quiet.  They have asked me to bring this question up here, as they felt this was the proper place to have it ventilated.  The previous owner kept a considerable number of cows and sheep and generally carried on proper husbandry.</P>
    <P>This man has 900 acres now under tillage and is completely taking away the fertility of the soil.  After that, he may sell it to some people around the area.  This is an ideal place, surrounding the Town of Carlow and it could provide 30 or 40 new farms.  It would be a great help to the town to have those new families settled around it.  The Minister does not seem to think it is an extraordinarily large holding for any one man, but no ordinary person in the country would agree with him.  If this man had his roots here, there would be something to be said for allowing him to purchase a large estate, especially if he were going to work it in the normal way; but he is working this solely and simply as one might work a factory, taking out what is there, crop after crop, without putting any fertility back.</P>
    <P>For the past fortnight, the Minister for Finance has been putting a Bill through the House to deal principally with dividend stripping.  A fortnight has been spent on that debate and the Minister had to bring in a special Bill. The present Minister does not require any special Bill to prevent fertility stripping.  These people are actually stripping the fertility of the farms there.</P>
    <P>Now that the purchase of that farm is all over, I would ask the Minister to consider sending down his inspectors. <Col N="1351" /> When we put up that case during the interview, he said he had no inspectors to spare, that they were all engaged in dividing the land at present held by the Land Commission.  On the other hand, I was here when Deputy Giles raised a question about a certain farm in Meath and the Minister said that, if he got the name, he would send inspectors down immediately.  Deputy Giles gets that promise, whereas three Deputies on a deputation are told he has no inspectors to spare.  It is hard to know why the Minister will not interfere with the taking over of this farm.  Now that matters have cooled down, I would ask him to take it over and divide it into 30 or 40 decent farms which would be of great help to those who would get them and which would be an addition to the town of Carlow.</P>
    <P>In regard to estates which have been divided already in Kilkenny, I should like to mention again the question of Land Commission roads.  Several people who were allotted land on these newly divided estates, having handed up their farms in other areas to provide for uneconomic holders, have found the roads in very bad condition. They come to me, a member of the county council, and ask that the county council should take them over.  I went to the county surveyor and he told me that if the Land Commission put the roads in reasonable condition he would recommend to the county council to take them over and be responsible for them in the future, but he says that these roads have been left by the Land Commission in very poor condition and he is not prepared to remake them before taking them over.  If the Land Commission would put them in reasonable repair, he would take them over. I think that is a fair request from the local authority.  When the Land Commission are doing a job, they should do it properly.</P>
    <P>On the question of rights of way, the Land Commission inspectors and engineers should make up proper rights of way when they are dividing farms. Absence of that provision causes litigation, and, even worse, ill-feeling between neighbours.  If there were proper rights of way, these people <Col N="1352" /> would live in harmony; but when they are not mapped out and people do not know where they are, there is friction, often resulting in assaults and litigation. It is only proper that a Department of State, when dividing an estate, would leave it in such a way that the people can live in harmony on it.  As regards fencing, there should be proper boundary fencing set down when these new estates are being dealt with.</P>
    <P>I hope my appeal is not falling on deaf ears.  If the Minister fails to deal with the estate I have mentioned, he is not carrying out his job as Minister for Lands.  He should take over that estate in Carlow and divide it, so as to make it available for 30 or 40 Irish families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, when we left office in 1957, I understood that the Land Commission was carrying out an inquiry with a view to determining whether an equitable system could be worked out whereunder the sons of farmers should have farms made available for rent.  I do not know whether that inquiry has progressed or not.  There seems to be a demand in the country for something which may be of value.  The problem is that, in the case of a good farmer in rural Ireland who has two or three sons, it may be proposed to leave the home farm to the eldest boy, and one or both of the others may wish to be farmers also.  If they have been reared on a farm and have been sent to an agricultural college, they have before them the alternative of looking for a job.  Up to now, there were jobs for pretty nearly every agricultural graduate available.  It is only in the last 18 months that the agricultural graduates have had to emigrate to Rhodesia and Canada to look for work, because the present Government simply will not employ them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather than let them go to Rhodesia and Canada to exercise their talents there, I think we might with advantage consider a scheme whereunder such young men would be offered the opportunity to lease holdings of land from the Land Commission.  It could be made a condition that the operation of the land under the lease would be carried on in consultation with the parish agent or the county instructor. The young man, who presumably would <Col N="1353" /> have from his parents some start in life in the form of stock and machinery, would pay an equitable rent.  Quite apart from the social aspect of making it possible for such young men to stay in the country, there is the great advantage that these parcels of land would involve no charge at all on the Exchequer.  If the young man were paying an economic rent and operating the land prudently and in accordance with a good system of husbandry, at the end of the term of the lease the land would revert to the Land Commission in as good a condition or better than it was in when the lessee took it, and in the meantime the lessee would pay an economic rent.</P>
    <P>At present, if land is allotted by way of purchase annuity to an allottee, the allottee gets the land at one-half its economic value, because, the fair rent having been fixed, it is cut in half by the 1933 Land Act and he gets a present of half the value of the land. That procedure may be practicable with smallholdings for the time being, but I do not think anyone would be so daft as to offer to endow people with a holding of 100 or 200 acres and then give them a present of one-half the value of the estate.  Yet it does seem to be a desirable thing, if the necessity exists and I believe it does, to make it possible for enterprising young men to rent holdings of that kind.  I think that could be undertaken in connection with Macra Na Feirme and with the Department of Agriculture which would be glad to help through the parish agent service and with technical advice which is so abundantly available there.  Extensive educational facilities are also available through the Department and could be used in a scheme of that kind.</P>
    <P>I think that over and above the obvious advantage of doing this for the good of the lessees or the young farmers themselves an additional purpose would be served because these farms would become, if the scheme operated in collaboration with the advisory services provided by the Department of Agriculture, real demonstration farms and, goodness knows, in rural Ireland that is something we badly want.  We do not want farms operated by the Land Commission <Col N="1354" /> or by the Department of Agriculture because the average farmer in rural Ireland says of such farms that they are operated with unlimited capital, with the whole Treasury behind them.  What we want are farms operated by farmers who make a living out of them so that their neighbours can see how land properly used can provide a decent livelihood for the man who lives on it.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Lands, according to his opening statement, is going off the rails and doing so, in my opinion, in an extremely dangerous way, because it appears to me from what he said that he wants to encourage the leasing of land by private owners.  If we are to encourage that, let us get right back to Clanrickarde and Barrymore and the landlords whom we chased out of this country 60 years ago.  It does not matter whether the landlord's name is Murphy or Barrymore, he can be just as oppressive and just as troublesome in 1958 as in 1858.  Let us not forget that Lord Clanrickarde's name was Burke and that one of the worst landlords in Ireland was a parish priest in County Mayo and that it was on his estate we started the Land War in 1879.  The first branch of the Irish National Land League was established on a parish priest's estate in County Mayo at the village of Irishtown.</P>
    <P>It was not the individuals who were landlords that the Land War was fought against; it was fought against the system of landlordism.  I think the Minister would make a very great mistake if he thinks he can foist on our people in 1958 what our fathers put an end to from 1858 down to 1909 and 1923 when the first Land Purchase Act of this Republic was passed and under which every acre of tenanted land passed out of the landlords' hands and into that of the Land Commission for distribution to tenant proprietors.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister most strenuously that he should avoid the mistake of reviving landlordism.  If he does revive it, he is buying the seeds of sorrow, not so much for himself as for those who will come after him.  At the same time, he should not be diverted by our instinctive reluctance <Col N="1355" /> to sanction a reappearance of landlordism from trying to meet legitimate aspirations of young farmers who want a stake in the country, in a farm of land, who are wholly unable to put down the purchase price of that land but who are ready and willing to pay out of profits they can make on that holding a fair and economic rent to the Land Commission if land is made available to them by way of lease.</P>
    <P>I know that such a project contains many difficulties and problems and it was for that reason that the Government of which I was a member asked the most experienced officials of the Land Commission to take this under review and make a report on the matter.</P>

      <P>When the Deputy referred a few moments ago to my initiating landlordism, all I was trying to do was to give some chance to people to acquire some of the 750,000 acres that are now let for a period just long enough to enable them to make enough money to buy a farm. There is nothing sinister in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing sinister, but Hell is paved with good intentions, and I am trying to warn the Minister before he winds up sitting on a hot brick in Hades.  One of the ways of getting to Hades in this country is to revive landlordism.  I see his point, and I am offering him an alternative&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy himself condemned conacre in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not conacre.  I have lived in the country for a long time and I know the difference between conacre and leasehold land.  The evil of conacre is that you take it for 11 months and take out of it all you can get and then drop it like a hot brick. You take the upper part of the field first and when you have got all you can out of that, taken the heart and soul out of it, you then take the lower half <Col N="1356" /> and do likewise.  Then you move on to a neighbour's field and knock hell out of that.  You take another part of that land for 11 months and do the same thing and if you can find another fool to let you do the same, you do it again and you go on doing it until you have half the land of the parish devastated. Then perhaps, you will be able to pick it up cheap if the fellow was vested in the meantime and you manure it and make a good thing out of it.  That is conacre.</P>
      <P>It is a bad thing because it is a standing inducement to anyone who takes it to mine the land, draw all its fertility out of it and then discard it, but if you lease land to a man for a period of 20 years, it is no use his trying to mine it because if he does so for the first three years, he has to sit on it for the other 17.  He must pay rent for it and make the rent out of it for every one of the 20 years for which he signs the lease.  The only way he can make the rent is to farm the land to the limit of its capacity to yield and that can only be done by keeping the land in good heart.</P>
      <P>I should not have to explain these elementary facts to the Minister.  He has plenty of technical advice in the Land Commission to tell him all that. In his zeal to achieve the goal of making land available to promising young farmers, he should avoid the awful pitfall of sponsoring a re-creation of landlordism in Ireland.  That is a weed that can grow rapidly and there are quite a number of boys who would buy 1,000 acres of land, if they thought they could set themselves up as landlords. Irish land is a good investment, if you can lease it to good tenants.  It is the knowledge that you cannot do that without creating a tenant right for your tenants which can be converted into tenant purchase agreements which prevents people from setting themselves up as landlords.  I understand that if you let land for a protracted period, the tenant can set up tenant rights.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question that I would not answer straight off the cuff.  If I were Minister, I would look more carefully into it and see if <Col N="1357" /> you can set land for a protracted period without creating a tenant right for your tenant, of a character calculated to embarrass the owner of the land.  I do not know the exact extent of that right, but I do know that no landowner can set land for a protracted period without taking very careful precautions to avoid creating a tenant right for his tenant.</P>
      <P>I want to raise another matter.  I put down a parliamentary question recently concerning the publication of the names of allottees of land on an estate in County Monaghan.  The Minister expressed himself shocked at the question and hoped that I would not press the inquiry and was dismayed when I did so.  I consider that I did the right thing and I would press the Minister, not only to provide that information in answer to questions, but to make the information available by publishing it in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
      <P>I think it is most undesirable and objectionable to be holding meetings at every crossroads in the constituency for the purpose of dividing up lands. I have been asked, since I first represented County Monaghan, to come down to branch meetings of my organisation to discuss the division of lands.  I am sure I have been asked to do that 100 times and on every occasion I answered that I would do nothing of the kind.  I have said that I have no power to influence the division of lands and, for that reason, that I utterly avoid the discussion of the division of lands.</P>
      <P>I am frequently told that my colleague, Deputy Mooney, is holding meetings at every crossroads and is dividing every acre of land around the countryside. Rumour has spread that, unless you attend these meetings, your prospect of getting land is very remote.  I have been 20 years listening to that from Deputy Mooney and the former Deputy Rice and all the others and I have gone on my weary way, but I am obliged to say that, since the salad days of the Fianna Fáil Party in the early thirties, I think the allocation of land, on the whole, is done substantially on an equitable basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all remember the times when we were first teaching the present incumbents <Col N="1358" /> to be Ministers.  That was not the only thing we had to teach them.  They did not know how to sit on those benches over there and Deputy MacEoin and myself spent a lot of time in teaching them how to do that and many other things.  They thought, when they went into the Land Commission, that they were tigers and that they were distributing land to every street corner lounger in the country.  We weaned them away from that after the first five or six years, but they did do it.</P>
    <P>There were lands parcelled out in County Meath on which a human foot was never put and there were houses built into which a human foot was never put.  These lands were rented on the day they were allocated, the windows were boarded up and a system of intelligence was operated so that if an inspector was in the neighbourhood a charitable woman dashed around from house to house putting a sod of wet turf smoking on every hearth so that it could be said that there was smoke coming from the chimney.  That day, I think, has passed since the early thirties and poor Senator Moylan brought in an Act to throw out from these holdings the early Fianna Fáil allottees.  He was a straightforward kind of man and I remember him saying that we all had our salad days and that we had to put them out in due course.  That he did.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of scandalous conduct carried on in those days, but in recent years the allocation of land is done on the basis of the best judgment of the inspector.  Sometimes that judgment is very bad, but we are all human and I believe they do their best.  I feel that these fraudulent meetings which are being conducted by Deputies are most objectionable and the Minister is perfectly right in saying that he has nothing whatever to do with the division of land, but that any representations made to him will be given due consideration by the Land Commission when the scheme for allottees is being constructed.  I think he is perfectly right and I hope he will keep on doing that.</P>
    <P>It would be silly and childish to forget that there is always the greatest <Col N="1359" /> interest abroad when there is the question of an estate coming up for division. That subject is always the foundation of rumour and it frequently leads to utterly fantastic allegations. The best way to put an end to that is to publish the truth and the best way to make the truth universally available is to publish it in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  Then nobody can ask an inspired parliamentary question and then go back to his constituency waving the parliamentary reply and saying: &ldquo;This is what the Minister has done and this is what I told him to do.&rdquo; If it is published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> everybody will read it. It is a useful record and it will put an end to all anxiety in the rural areas. I believe that if the Minister consults experienced Deputies, they will agree with me that the earlier the names of allottes are published, the better it is for everybody.</P>
    <P>I object to the whole system of asking parliamentary questions regarding the division of land.  I think it is unhealthy and undesirable and is open to the worst kind of blackmail.  There is no greater damage that you could do to a small farmer in County Monaghan than to ask the Minister if he intends to acquire the farm of AB.  It causes him untold anxiety and if the Minister sends an inspector to make a preliminary examination, the whole family life of that man is disrupted for 12 months.  It is true that the whole parish is down on the man and he has this hanging over him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy make a proposal about doing away with this?  His observation is most interesting. I detest the question up to the time of acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the Minister.  I remember somebody trying to establish the rule that he would not accept a question of that kind and, so far as I was concerned, I was 100 per cent behind him.  I entirely deprecate Deputy Tierney's point of view and I think he is talking through his hat when he says the Minister should have the ultimate discretion in relation to the acquisition of land.  It would be a great disaster if that were so.  It would <Col N="1360" /> be a disaster of the worst kind and would completely undermine the whole security of tenure for which the land war was very substantially fought to achieve.</P>
      <P>I have this suggestion to make to the Minister.  The plain fact is that in the West of Ireland there is now beginning to appear a very considerable number of derelict farms, farms which are frequently owned by people who are living in America and England.  These farms are grossly neglected.  Sometimes some of them are let on a very tenuous kind of conacre arrangement but they are sadly neglected.  Is there no machinery by which some of these holdings could be peaceably acquired and vested in suitable families who would work them?  Deputy Blowick, when Minister for Lands, introduced the 1950 Act under which the Minister is free to purchase on the open market.  While there is that provision there, I think that when land is substantially abandoned there ought to be someone who can clear the title so that land can pass into active ownership again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great difficulty of the abandoned farm is that nobody will touch it because almost inevitably you will find the last registered owner died leaving a family of so many boys and girls.  The boys and girls have gradually filtered away, they have got married and the young fellow who was left on the farm turned the key in the door and went off to England leaving the land lying there, land which no one will touch because there is no one from whom it can be bought.  There might be some procedure through the Land Commissioners and land registry office by which one could get a clear title, but, unfortunately, there is nobody resident at home and very frequently the person who is in England, the last owner and ratepayer on the property, will not bother to execute a conveyance of his estate in the property because what he will get for it would be small and he might prefer to continue to let it be rented. In addition, he cannot give a title because there are so many others interested. I believe there should be some machinery by which such a title could be acquired. rather than have the whole holding <Col N="1361" /> remain a blot on the countryside and a source of demoralisation to other smallholders in the area.  If it could be purchased in some peaceful way, and be given to somebody who would work it, it would be a great blessing.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say to the Minister concerns a very important matter, but nobody gives a damn about it.  Through the passage of years the Land Commission has become one of the greatest treasure houses of social history outside the British Registry of Deaths.  We lost our record office in the Four Courts but there is a mountain of material in the Land Commission which is moulding away.  Some day some new, green broom like the Minister will arrive in there and announce that he will have a great clearance, and there will go out in the ash cans muniments which nothing can replace.  Is there no means of collaboration with the National Library to get that treasure house of documents preserved or at least microphotographed?</P>
    <P>It was said, and said with substantial truth, that there were only two or three men left living who knew their way through the library of documents that existed in the Land Commission and the old Congested Districts Board which the Land Commission took over.  I doubt if there is a man living, in the Land Commission now, who would not get lost in that library and the longer those documents lie there the more difficult it will be to examine them.  It will be to the Minister's honour if he sees to it that valuable records of that kind should not perish and be neglected.  Busy men engaged on administrative work, habitually handling documents of this kind, are inclined to overlook their historical significance.</P>
    <P>I have gone into the Land Commission Office to inquire about certain matters and seen men turn up documents from the 15th and 16th centuries, and files away back to early Cromwellian, Stuart and Elizabethan times, and it seems to me it would be a <Col N="1362" /> tragedy if this material were lost, There are certain lunatics in the country who consider that because these documents relate very largely to Elizabethan planters they are of on interest, in the same way as some lunatics would pull down a house just because it was built by a planter. Before such vandals are let loose on such valuable material, the Minister would serve the country well if he could get the National Library to collaborate with him and microphotograph this material for posterity.  I suppose it is only fair I should give the Minister a chance of getting in and moving the Adjournment and, therefore, I accordingly propose to do so unless he be prevented by some other Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the case of Fisheries it would be impossible for me to reply fully before the Adjournment. I should like to commence by referring to some of the statements made by Deputy Blowick, whose criticism was constructive and whose observations were helpful.  Deputy Blowick was worried because it appeared that during the last financial year the number of rearrangements and the number of migrations decreased.  I should like to say that the average over the last eight years has been in the case of rearrangements 436, and that compares fairly well with the achievement of last year.</P>
      <P>It is rather difficult to maintain the number of migrations at the same level every year.  Special problems arise but I am glad to tell the House that we are very likely to do a fairly good job this year with migrations, particularly those out of the West, and that will help to compensate for the reduction that took place last year.  I think the total results for the two years will be up to average.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 8th July, 1958.</P>
