      <P>and <b>Mr. Collins</b> asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (i) the number of trade advisers and assistant trade advisers recruited by Córas Tráchtála Teoranta within the past year and (ii) their respective names, academic qualifications and business experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Collins</b> asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if Coras Tráchtála Teoranta will arrange discussions with the Central Council of Irish County Associations in Great Britain with a view to determining the degree of co-operation it is prepared to give in a concentrated Irish butter and dairy produce sales campaign among Irish emigrants in British cities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the <Col N="273" /> permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to reply to Questions Nos. 2, 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The two questions on the recruitment of staff by Córas Tráchtála relate to matters of day-to-day administration in which I do not intervene.  Córas Tráchtála Teranta have been given general responsibilities with regard to the promotion of the sale of Irish goods in Britain but their detailed arrangements are not subject to my prior approval.  The Deputies are no doubt aware that the marketing of creamery butter exports is one for the Butter Marketing Committee, established by the Minister for Agriculture, and also that the Minister for Agriculture appointed, last December, an Advisory Committee on the Marketing of Agricultural Produce which is at present engaged in a comprehensive study of the markets and marketing arrangements for agricultural produce.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to state the number of stamps sold in respect of male agricultural workers in the year 1956-57. From the 3rd September, 1956, the rate for male agricultural workers was increased from 2/6 to 3/2 and that for female agricultural and domestic <Col N="276" /> workers and certain other classes from 2/- to 2/6.  For a considerable time after the 3rd September, 1956, however, the 2/6 stamp was purchased concurrently for the female and other workers referred to and for late stamping for male agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>As regards the year 1957-58 complete figures of stamp sales are not yet available.</P>
    <P>
      <i>In respect of female workers.</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is not possible to state the number of stamps sold in respect of female agricultural workers as the contribution rate applicable to them applies also to other classes of insured persons such as female workers in private domestic employment.  The latest information available regarding the number of female employees in agriculture is that contained in the 1951 Census which showed that there were 882 such employees aged 14 years and over (excluding relatives assisting).  It is estimated that the number of stamps sold in respect of these employees would not exceed 30,000 per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture is he is aware (a)  that the Agricultural Wages Board have adopted standing orders which have the effect of preventing the four workers' representatives from requisitioning meetings of the board on their own collective motion and (b) that the board have consistently refused to amend their standing orders so as to enable the workers' representatives so to requisition meetings; and if in view of this unsatisfactory state of affairs he will make regulations to enable the workers' representatives to requisition meetings on their own motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the board that one of their standing orders provides, should the necessity arise, for the calling of a special meeting on the written requisition of any five of the 11 ordinary members of the board.  This procedure was invoked on only one occasion in the course of the last 20 years.  Suggestions for its alteration have been considered on two recent occasions but each time a majority of the members favoured the retention of the existing rule.  I am informed that normally no difficulty arises about meetings of the board which are held sufficiently frequently for the proper discharge of its functions under the Act.  I can see no adequate ground for taking action with a view to the alteration of this rule of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether the Agricultural Wages Board have made standing orders under Section 11 of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, prescribing the procedure to be observed prior to the making of an Agricultural Wages Order and providing for (a) the publishing of the board's proposals, and (b) prescribing the manner in which and the time within which objections to the proposals may be lodged.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he will make regulations under Section 11 of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, in relation to the procedure of the Agricultural Wages Board (a) requiring the board to give public notice of proposals to vary rates of wages before making an order, and (b) prescribing the manner in which and the time within which objections to the proposals may be lodged.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to reply to Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The answer in each case is &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The procedure to be observed by the Agricultural Wages Board prior to the making of an order fixing minimum <Col N="283" /> rates of wages is already prescribed in Section 17 of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936.</P>

      <P>The total productive area of the forests in North Tipperary on 31st March, 1958, was 6,343 acres, of which a total of 4,759 acres was planted, leaving a plantable reserve of 1,584 acres.  It is intended to plant a total of 84 acres in North Tipperary in the current year, distributed over the forests as follows: Newport&mdash;369 acres; Roscrea&mdash;92 acres; Silvermines &mdash;314 acres and Templederry&mdash;109 acres. The total area planted in the region last year was 841 acres.</P>
      <P>With regard to Silvermines Forest, the area scheduled for planting this year (314 acres) is substantially greater than the area planted last year (198 acres) and I am satisfied that a more extensive programme would be undesirable having regard to the plantable reserve position at the forest.</P>

      <P>In regard to vocational schools the City of Limerick Vocational Education Committee recently submitted a memorandam containing a tentative proposal for the acquisition and adaptation of the county infirmary which they consider would meet their needs for many years to come.  This proposal if found to be acceptable would supersede previous proposals from the committee and would provide the necessary accommodation proposed for vocational education in their area.</P>
      <P>County Limerick Vocational Education Committee have adopted a programme for the provision of schools at Rathkeale, Caherconlish, Kilmallock, Castleconnell, Glin and Askeaton but definite arrangements have so far been made only in respect of the Rathkeale project for which tenders will shortly be invited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to say that.

      <P>So far as I know, all the manufacturers of commodities containing sugar are quite satisfied with the present price arrangement. No representations have been made to me to the contrary.  It will be appreciated that the capacity of the sugar company to supply sugar on a satisfactory basis to our manufacturers depends upon an accurate estimate of the amount of sugar the manufacturers will require on a programme ahead of production.  Therefore, it is necessary to maintain a situation under which the total sugar requirements of these manufacturers are supplied by the sugar company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get from the Minister an indication as to whether the sugar company will co-operate with the Irish producer of goods containing sugar for the export market in such a way as to enable him to get his sugar requirements as cheaply as he can get sugar on the export market.  The Minister knows that the practice has been to allow producers and manufacturers here to purchase raw material abroad in the cheapest market available where the goods so purchased abroad are used for the manufacture of goods for export.  Is that situation being met by the sugar company in respect of the price they are charging Irish manufacturers of goods containing sugar for export?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the statement the Minister makes in regard to the matter raised by Deputy Norton apply to manufacturers of chocolate crumb?  It is very important that they should be kept in a competitive position as an alternative medium for disposing of surplus milk.  Would the Minister not avail of this occasion to tell us briefly what proportion of the entire domestic consumption of sugar <Col N="301" /> is being produced from beet, what quantity of raw sugar the company is refining and what quantity of sugar the company is selling for manufacturing processes designed for export? Are we self-sufficient in regard to the domestic market for sugar through beet or are we refining from raw sugar still to make up part of our domestic consumption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer the second part of the Deputy's question.  I do not know what proportion of the total production of sugar goes into the manufacture of products for exports.  Roughly, it can be said that the total requirements of sugar for all purposes last year were approximately 145,000 tons.  The quantity of sugar imported last year was 45,000 tons.  However, these two figures, by themselves, might be somewhat misleading.  There is the temptation to take one from the other and to assume that the balance represents the production from Irish beet but that would not be accurate.  The Deputy will appreciate that the production of sugar goes on over the end of the calendar year.  Consequently, it is not possible to relate the output of sugar from beet to the calendar year in a precise way.  The actual quantity of sugar produced in 1957 from the crop that was processed in that year was 108,000 tons.  That is to be related to an import figure of somewhere around 40,000 tons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that if we are to maintain our independence as a nation and maintain the freedom of the country on a sound basis we must of necessity increase our exports and reduce our imports.  We must then ask ourselves the question; is that possible? In looking for an answer, I have no hesitation in saying it is possible if we only make an honest communal effort to achieve that end.</P>
      <P>When we achieved our independence as a nation, the slogan from end to end of this country was &ldquo;Buy Irish Products and Keep the People in the Country.&rdquo;  I was rather disappointed when I read of a resolution which appeared in the newspapers last Thursday. Here is the news extract:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An emergency resolution passed at the National Delegate Conference of the Irish Bakers', Confectioners' and Allied Workers' Union in Dublin yesterday expressed concern at the Government's attempt to save £3,000,000 by the use of all-Irish flour as detrimental to the best interests of the trade and the public.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was not the attitude of the people down the years who secured the freedom which we now enjoy.</P>
      <P>If we are to maintain our balance of payments and if we are to support Irish industry and keep the people in the country, surely that is not the type of resolution which should come from any Irish people?  If we can reduce our imports by £3,000,000 and keep the people in rural Ireland by giving them the market which is their due, I feel there is no justification at all for this resolution. We all have sampled the all-Irish loaf.  We were quite pleased with it, even though it was a pan loaf.  It is all pan loaves that are produced in the area I come from and none of them would come up to the standard of the pan loaf sent to me by the N.F.A.</P>
      <P>The Minister should weigh very carefully the opportunity now at his disposal of giving the Irish wheat growers this opportunity, of giving the Irish people the opportunity of consuming the all-Irish loaf and thus provide employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we have to import this wheat <Col N="303" /> from abroad, we must pay for it dearly in dollars, and we must pay for it also very dearly in human beings because we will send more of them out of rural Ireland.  A further loaf has been forwarded to the Tánaiste&mdash; a batch loaf&mdash;and I am quite sure it is just as good as the previous loaf. It is good enough for the Irish people. It would be a great mistake if we did not avail ourselves of the opportunity of saving that amount of money.</P>
    <P>We could reduce our imports under many other headings also.  I will not dwell on them at great length.  We are importing too much wines and spirits, too much fish, too many of various commodities, too many luxuries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some of them are of an agricultural nature, but I will not elaborate on them.  We have a marketing committee set up for which a sum of £250,000 was allocated.  First, we must ensure we will have sufficient marketable produce to send abroad. Every inducement must be held out to the people in rural Ireland to produce that exportable surplus.  Whether it is in the form of cattle, poultry, pigs or eggs, the chief factors is that we will have a surplus for export to the foreign market.  Our exports of cattle certainly have been excellent over the past 12 months, making a total of £45,000,000, but I have great fear that they will not reach that figure in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the year 1956 was a black year for the Irish farmer as regards cattle prices, and large numbers of cattle were held over in 1956 which should have been marketed.  They were sold in the year 1957 and prices remained so good during 1957 that large numbers of cattle which should have been sold in 1958 were also marketed in 1957.  I know that when people were short of money, they cashed in on the cattle.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that, <Col N="304" /> according to statistics, the number of young cattle in the country was reasonably high, even higher than it was heretofore.  However, I am afraid they will not be of the same market value as they were in 1957.</P>
      <P>If we are to maintain our exports of butter, we must give the necessary encouragement to the Irish farmer to produce that butter.  He will do so for the next few years under a grave strain indeed.  If we are to tackle the problem of bovine tuberculosis seriously, the dairy farmer will be subjected to great strain and expense in the eradication of that disease.  I would like the Minister to make more clear to the farmer down the country what the position will be.  There is grave doubt in the minds of a large number of farmers in regard to what the position will be in the intensive areas.  I was speaking to a farmer last week who disposed of three very good cows, because, he said, they went down in the test.  I feel it was a mistake on his part to sell three of his best cows. If that procedure were carried out by 1,000 farmers all over the country, there would be 3,000 fewer calves for export next year.</P>
      <P>I am all behind the Minister and the Government in the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, but it must be taken in stages.  Very few farmers indeed could afford to dispose of 45 per cent. of their herds in one year.  The best way of tackling the problem would be to spread it over three years.  Where a farmer would have, say, nine reactors in his herd, he would dispose of three each year.  He would dispose of the worst of them in the first year, the next three in the following year and finally get rid of them in the third year.  If it were spread over three years, the impact on the farmer's income would not be so severe and he would be in a better position to stand up to the strain.  The country would benefit generally by our not getting rid of all our reactors in one year.  It will be almost impossible to replace them in a short space of time.  Our numbers of cattle for export will be drastically reduced and the country will suffer as a consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can we reduce our imports?  I will <Col N="305" /> confine myself to agricultural produce. Last year, we imported maize, barley and wheat offals totalling 83,460 tons. Last year also we had a drop in the production of oats of 109,300 tons.  That is a wrong policy.  We could have grown those 109,300 tons of oats, if we had the assurance from the Government that there would be a market for it at a reasonable price.  Year after year for the past dozen years, the farmers' organisation of which I am a member in County Cork have sent resolution after resolution to the Department, requesting them to fix a minimum price for oats.</P>
    <P>There are people who cannot grow wheat and barley very successfully and, if they cannot, surely they are entitled to the same consideration as those who can grow those crops?  Seeing that there is a drop of 109,300 tons, surely the case can be made that there should be some guarantee to the farmers growing oats, that the oats will be bought from them and paid for at a remunerative price?  In fixing that price, if the Minister fixes it, he should take into account the fact that the production from an acre of barley is 50 per cent. higher than from an acre of oats.  It is essential, if there is to be encouragement for the growing of oats, that a price even higher than that for barley should be fixed.</P>
    <P>Oats is a very important crop.  It is a sad reflection on this country&mdash;and I do not say on the farmers but on the Government, as the farmers would grow it if they got the encouragement and the inducement to do so&mdash;that we should be importing oats in the year 1958, while our broad acres through the country are not ploughed up as they should be.  Perhaps they are growing thistles, docks and weeds, when they could be profitably turned into the production of oats, instead of our importing oats.  It needs, then, immediate attention from the Minister to stop the import of wheat, of oats, of maize&mdash;as barley is equally as good as maize&mdash;so as to save the finances of this country and give the farmer an opportunity of producing the crops which are so essential for the feeding of the animals and of the people.</P>
    <P>Now, in regard to bacon and pigs, <Col N="306" /> there is a certain amount of controversy over the breed of pigs we have here now.  I have very little experience of the Landrace pigs: I have plenty of experience of the Large White.  I had no great fault to find with the Large White and I was always thankful for the breed I had.  However, it all depended on the particular type of the breed&mdash;there were good types and bad types&mdash;and it was up to the breeder himself to ensure that the type he had was the right type of Large White.  With regard to the Landrace, I have no doubt whatever that the very same thing applies, that there is the good type and the bad type.</P>
    <P>I am very much afraid that the vast majority of the Landrace pigs which were illegally imported over the past 12 months have been, unfortunately, of the bad type.  For that reason, I do not blame the Minister for allowing them in legally.  We can hope to get the right type of Landrace only when they are imported legally, through the proper channel.  I believe the illegal importation was a bad thing, as we got only the scruff and the dross&mdash;and certain individuals possibly cashed in and made money.</P>
    <P>The conversion of our pigs into bacon has been a burning question for as long as I remember.  There are times when it is very profitable to produce pigs, and perhaps a month afterwards it is very unpopular.  I wonder if the time will ever come when the farmer can say, when he buys a bonham, that he will get a profit out of it, or when he can say of any pig at any place that he will not have a loss.  There were many people who had losses last year in pigs.  Some of them blame the Government; some of them blame the Minister; and even farmers in my own area were inclined to blame myself, as I was not able to do something about it.  More people blame the factories.  In putting our heads together in a sensible fashion we should be able to come at the root cause of all this trouble.</P>
    <P>At one stage, the factories give a certain price for Grade A, a certain price for Grade B, a certain price for <Col N="307" /> Grade C, and so on; while, at another time, it makes no difference what grade you have&mdash;you can sell a pig at a good price.  I think the factories in this country have not fulfilled the requirements of the farmers.  I think the Minister will need to consider seriously, in the not too far distant future, the nationalisation of the bacon factories.  I was never a great advocate of nationalisation; nevertheless, it has done good in some respects and in some industries here which were too great for private enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, of course, cannot advocate legislation on an Estimate.  I think legislation would be required to nationalise the bacon industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I ask the Minister to consider the difficulty there is in the production of pigs and the great difficulty of marketing them to the best advantage, since we rarely know where we are as regards marketing. With regard to the marketing of the bacon abroad&mdash;and of all the other agricultural products as well&mdash; I wish the new committee the best of luck and I have no doubt that, when our Irish produce is marketed, it will be found to be superior to anything else that can be secured abroad.</P>
      <P>I was glad the Minister brought into operation the Fertilisers, Feeding Stuffs and Mineral Mixtures Act during the year.  I referred to this in my speech last year when I spoke of the great difficulties our farmers had in analysing what was in their compounds, whether feeding stuffs or fertilisers.  That difficulty has been overcome now.  However, the fee being charged is rather high.  It would be a great inducement to the majority of the farmers if the Minister reduced the fee to half.  Then the Act would be of greater benefit than it is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Small farmers at the moment are practically denied the right, so to speak, of making a living in their own country.  The lines in which they were engaged, pig production and poultry production, have become very highly <Col N="308" /> commercialised businesses.  It is a bad thing for the economy of the country when those lines become too commercialised, because it has the result of depriving honest, hard-working, small farmers of the way of life which they and their forefathers enjoyed down through the years.  I know it is very hard to prevent people from going into poultry production in a big way, producing chickens by the millions and eggs by the billion.  However, if one looks at the matter in the right way, then one cannot but appreciate that we are taking a way of life away from a very large section and, in doing so, we shall eventually do considerable damage to the economy of the country because we shall lose that population which enjoyed that way of life.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon brings me back to a point that I stressed the last day, namely, the necessity for capital for the small farmer.  A small farmer with a wife and young family has very little capital to invest in anything. If he approaches the banks, the Agricultural Credit Corporation or any moneylender, he had very little hope indeed of getting any capital.  He is compelled to carry on in the old-fashioned way from day to day.  People with plenty of capital behind them do not understand that position.  It is to be regretted that the small farmer cannot go into these lines to which I have referred in a big way and make a living out of them.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will consider what I have said in relation to milk production.  If the number of cows is reduced, the number of store cattle will be reduced and, as a consequence, the country will suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this Estimate, I have been greatly helped by my perusal of the notes issued by the <Col N="309" /> Minister.  I have found them a tremendous guide and I should like as far as possible to follow the sequence of the notes.</P>
      <P>The first paragraph deals with the Advisory Committee on the Marketing of Agricultural Produce.  Certain criticisms have been advanced as to the speed, or lack of speed, with which this committee has acted and the lack of results so far.  I believe that a committee such as this should work slowly, despite the urgency of the situation, so that the full impact of its deliberations may be received at the one time.  I would not recommend for a moment that the marketing of agricultural produce should be dealt with piecemeal.  The problem of putting our produce on the British market, in particular, in such a way that it will command a ready sale is a vast one.  It is essential that goods should be branded. Foodstuffs in particular should be branded.  Those branded goods must be of a known standard and that known standard must be strictly enforced so that purchasers of Irish foodstuffs in British and overseas markets will know precisely what they are getting.</P>
      <P>One of the main troubles of the moment is that purchasers abroad cannot be absolutely and definitely sure of the quality of the goods they are purchasing.  Not only that, but we must produce our goods in a very much more attractive manner.  There are tremendous lessons to be learned in the art of packaging and display.  The whole question of advertising demands treatment on a very ambitious scale. Faced with those problems&mdash;I am sure the committee are fully aware of the magnitude of the problems&mdash;we must allow the committee time to deal with them adequately.  Judging the committee by those of its members of whom I have some personal knowledge, I think the committee is of a very high standard and I have no doubt at all that any initial delay will be more than compensated later on when they get down to the heart of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of wheat.  I should like, first of all, to deal with the production of an all-Irish loaf.  From an <Col N="310" /> economic point of view, there is no answer to the demand for the production of an all-Irish loaf other than the production of an all-Irish loaf.  I was rather disappointed, therefore, to see it stated in these notes that the Government had decided that, pending the outcome of research as to the maximum extent to which native wheat could be used, the aim should be to produce 300,000 tons of wheat annually.</P>
    <P>I am not at all impressed with the view that we should await the outcome of research.  I hold the view very strongly that one should not ask experts whether such and such is possible because that puts the responsibility for the decision on the experts.  The decision in relation to the all-Irish loaf is one that should be taken by the Government.  It is an economic decision; it is a political decision. Having taken the decision, the matter should then be handed over to the experts, with the proviso: &ldquo;There shall be no foreign wheat after such a date and it is up to you to produce a palatable loaf.&rdquo;  I cannot see that there should be any insurmountable difficulty in doing that.</P>
    <P>The recent experiments sponsored by Macra na Feirme and the farmers generally have shown that an extremely palatable loaf can be produced from all-Irish flour.  I was away when the sample loaf was posted to my home address.  It arrived on Friday morning. Presumably it was not baked later than Thursday morning or, possibly, some time during Wednesday night.  I did not reach home until the following Monday.  There were only two slices left and I found those two slices most palatable, even after that very considerable lapse of time.  I base my judgment also on the experiments which were carried out in Sweden and to which reference is made in the current issue of the periodical <i>Development.</i> They refer to the experiment in Sweden where the millers stated that they would find no difficulty in baking an acceptable loaf from flour made from 100 per cent.  Irish type wheat.</P>
    <P>Everything appears to be pointing towards the possibility of producing palatable and most acceptable bread <Col N="311" /> from 100 per cent.  Irish wheat and I cannot see any reason for not taking this decision.  I would urge the Minister to take the law into his own hands, not to await the outcome of research. When one asks an expert if it can be done, he will always produce the difficulties which may or may not arise. That is not intended as criticism of experts.  It is a very natural reaction. It is a decision which the Government and the whole House should take that the import of foreign wheat must cease as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We are still faced with the fact that we have surplus wheat on hands and it is almost certain that there will be a surplus at the end of the coming harvest. If it were decided that that surplus wheat would just have to be disposed of, I would criticise the phraseology used in the White Paper, namely, &ldquo;the surplus to be disposed of for other purposes at the expense of the Exchequer.&rdquo;  That is approaching the whole question in the wrong way. We must try to see that an adequate and proper market is obtained for as much wheat as we can grow.  We should not just try to get rid of surplus wheat. There, I would hope that the advisory committee on marketing would be able to help us.  I would hope that they would find a proper market for the Irish wheat which we do not require, even after producing 100 per cent.  Irish bread.</P>
    <P>There are developments which have been considered or which could be considered, such as the special prices for biscuit-making for export.  Another suggestion made in <i>Development</i> is that we should try to develop more wheat flakes and so on, for export to the Continent, where they would find a ready market.  I would hope that, in future, surplus wheat would be dealt with not as something to be got rid of, but as an additional asset to be sold at the highest price.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also refers to the committee representing growers and other interests which will have responsibility for the sale of surplus wheat to the best advantage.  I am delighted that the Minister has set up this <Col N="312" /> committee and I hope that it will be fully representative.  The policy of co-operation with the producer should receive every possible encouragement.</P>
    <P>The small reference to flax in the White Paper states that the acreage appears to be steadily decreasing, although the flax spinners in Belfast are prepared to buy all scutched flax at world prices.  It is difficult to say what the future of the linen industry in the North may be.  It is experiencing considerable difficulty.  I am not quite sure which body could best look into this matter&mdash;possibly, again, the advisory committee&mdash;but I would hope that someone would try to get into direct contact with the Flax Spinners' Association in Belfast and get some estimate from them over a period of, say, four or five years as to what their requirements might be, with a view to deciding whether an extension of flax-growing in the Republic would be an economic proposition.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of vegetables, particularly potatoes, also referred to in the White Paper.  In my opinion, insufficient attention has been paid to the growing of early vegetables as a source of national income.  The possibilities with regard to the production of early potatoes, early carrots and other early vegetables have never been developed, despite the fact that climatic and soil conditions in many areas are extremely suitable for that development.  Recently, I heard, from one of those involved in it, of quite an ambitious proposal which is already being carried out in the Dingle Peninsula around Brandon, where early vegetables are being raised under extremely good conditions and where they are getting extremely good results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>The Deputy's informant, I take it, was Mrs. Swift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is perfectly right, but I have also heard of it from the Irish Housewives' Association, who have also been informed by Mrs. Swift. It is easy to write off these ideas as the harebrained suggestions of Mrs. So-and-So or Mr. So-and-So, but the <Col N="313" /> fact that it can be done has been proved.  It is dangerous to write it off as deserving of no consideration.  I am rather afraid that that is the attitude which has been adopted to that proposal in the past.  I am delighted that Deputy Dillon shakes his head and thereby proves himself guiltless in that regard, but, certainly, there has been a certain amount of suspicion that perhaps this was not an economic proposition.</P>
      <P>Nearer home, in County Dublin, a very good market has been developed for garden produce, but it is only recently that we have really gone into the export market.  Here, again, the question of standards, quality and packaging is important.  Packaging of vegetables is becoming increasingly popular.  It is a tremendous help to housewives to be able to go into a shop and buy vegetables already cleaned and packaged.  Every minute counts to the housewife.  Cleaning and packaging of vegetables undoubtedly makes them far more attractive.  Some of our producers are considering the matter and are making considerable progress.  I hope the maximum assistance will be given to them.</P>
      <P>There is a reference in the White Paper, under the heading Importation of Tomatoes, which rather mystifies me.  It is stated that the customs duty on raw tomatoes has been increased to operate from 1st June to 31st October each year.  Two paragraphs later, it is stated that the prohibition on the importation of tomatoes from about mid-July to the end of October will continue to operate.  I cannot see the necessity for putting duties on goods the importation of which is largely prohibited but, possibly, there is some explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The customs duty on dried peas appears to be a very reasonable proposition, especially when, as stated in the White Paper, an additional 4,000 acres of peas, approximately, would be sufficient to satisfy the needs of the home market.  Large scale production of peas has not been developed as it should be.  I should imagine that we should be able not only to produce our own requirements but <Col N="314" /> also peas for export.  There is a big demand for peas for canning by British factories.  I would hope that as much as possible would be grown here, canned and then exported.  We might export unprocessed peas for canning but I would rather we kept the entire business to ourselves.</P>
    <P>Figures have been given showing the results on our cattle population of the heavy exports and reference has been made by the Minister to the satisfactory increase in the number of cattle under one year at the last census round about June.  It does appear, however, as if some additional incentive may have to be given for the breeding of cattle.  There is no proposal at the moment, but I hope the Minister will keep in mind that at all costs the numbers of cattle must be kept up.</P>
    <P>In regard to exports of cattle or beef to North America, there does not appear to be any great long-term future in it.  At the same time I would hope that further market research would be carried out in that regard. The possible market, I am sure, is very large, but whether it is wise for us to gamble on the temporary shortages in the United States or not remains to be seen.  In any event, in dealing with such a vast market, accurate market analysis is essential.</P>
    <P>As far as pigs and bacon are concerned, we are dealing principally with the British market.  On my visits to Britain I have often been disappointed at finding that Irish bacon is not being openly sold as such, or if it is I have not noticed it. To export bacon to the British market and sell it just as bacon is utterly disastrous.  We must convince the British consumer that Irish bacon is something to be sought after.  If British consumers do not know that Irish bacon is procurable they will not even ask for it.  I trust the advisory committee will deal with the matter at a very high level and will be prepared for substantial expenditure on publicity.</P>
    <P>I may be foolhardy in crossing swords with Deputy Dillon on the question of the Landrace pig, but perhaps <Col N="315" /> he will bear with me for a moment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the unanimous opinion of the veterinary profession on the Landrace pig, that it was particularly susceptible to atrophic rhinitis.  He said that had always been the advice given to him and that he anticipated that that was always the advice given to the present Minister.  As Deputy Dillon knows, I am not an expert on pigs, still less on atrophic rhinitis, but I have tried to make myself aware of some of the facts through reading.  I do remember, although I have not been able to find the reference, that in the <i>Farmer's Journal</i> approximately a year ago, there was an article based on the findings of the chief veterinary officer of the Isle of Man.  Possibly the reason that struck me was that the veterinary officer was a man I had met many years ago and with whom I had considerable friendship.</P>
      <P>That chief veterinary officer had carried out a survey of Large Irish Whites and Landrace pigs to try to reach some conclusion on the question of their comparative susceptibility to atrophic rhinitis.  His finding were that the Large White was just as liable to contract the disease as the Landrace but that atrophic rhinitis was much more readily discernible in the Landrace due to the different shape of the snout.  His conclusion, therefore, was that the Landrace was as least as good as the Large White so far as resistance to atrophic rhinitis was concerned and that in general he felt there was some advantage in favour of the Landrace by reason of the increased carcase value. I would, therefore, like to have it on record that at least one veterinary officer in a senior position in the Isle of Man, which I suppose is sufficiently neutral between Great Britain and ourselves, had reached the conclusion after considerable research that the Large White was just as susceptible to atrophic rhinitis as the Landrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the grading of pigs, I agree with Deputy Dillon that <Col N="316" /> it is extremely encouraging to see a higher percentage of Grade A pigs each year, 54 per cent., 55 per cent., 62 per cent. and even up to 67 per cent. However, I am conscious of considerable dissatisfaction among some of the pig breeders with whom I am in touch on this whole question of grading.  From information given to me it would appear that if a pig breeder sends two good pigs to a bacon factory, he has a very good chance of getting two Grade A.  If he sends four good pigs he will get perhaps three Grade A and a Grade B.  If he sends six good pigs he may get three Grade A, one Grade B, and two Grade C, even though, so far as he can see, all those pigs are of the same quality.  I know several breeders who send pigs to the factory only in lots of two at a time; they have found that in spite of the extra carriage cost, it pays them better because their pigs are graded higher.</P>
    <P>I know there is a representative of the Department also supervising the grading system, but I also know that the breeders as a whole feel that in many cases they are not getting as good treatment as they should get and some of their pigs are being graded down.  I would hope, therefore, that the Minister would look into this and that possibly some organisation, either the National Farmers' Association or some other association, would be allowed to have representatives at the factories to check on the grading as the pigs are brought in.  There is no appeal after the pig has been accepted.  The breeder is just notified subsequently that one pig is graded A, another B, or whatever it may be.  It is too late then to go back on it and ask for a recheck; it is essential to have somebody else there who is completely unprejudiced. I am afraid the fact that there is a representative of the Department of Agriculture there does not, in some cases, at any rate, carry full conviction so far as the breeder is concerned.</P>
    <P>Everybody will be delighted at the decision of the Government to permit the export of horseflesh for human consumption.  We look forward to the erection, and going into production, <Col N="317" /> of a factory which will deal with the slaughtering of horses and the export of horsemeat.  There is, and always has been, very strong public opinion in favour of banning the export of live horses for slaughter and I think it is a general feeling.  Now that the export of horseflesh has been permitted under licence, I hope that as soon as possible the export of live horses for export will be prohibited.  In this connection, once a factory has been set up, there could be an extension of that trade, and I hope that we will not try to deal with this just as a realisation of otherwise useless assets, but that we will try to build up the export of horsemeat which is greatly favoured in some areas on the Continent.</P>
    <P>On the question of poultry, it would appear from the figures given in the notes that there is substantial room for development.  In 1953, the value of the export of dead poultry was over £3,500,000; in 1957, it was only just over £2,000,000.  Exports of table chickens were less in 1957 than in 1956 and that again is a market which could be developed very considerably. Deputy Wycherley felt that there was considerable need for capital before a trade on that line could be developed, but I do not believe that that is really a fact.  The amount of capital involved in stocking up good fowl as table fowl should not be excessive and there is a ready market available.  There again it is necessary that the product should be well graded, well packaged and sent off in prime condition.</P>
    <P>In regard to the exports of dairy produce, there has been criticism of the way in which Irish creamery butter is put on the British market. I think that criticism is probably justified and that in some cases at least, it is not packed properly and attractively enough.  The Danes, in particular, as well as the New Zealanders, have gone very far in the question of packing, and there is no doubt that the modern housewife, particularly in Britain, is attracted by the good packaging of goods such as butter.</P>
    <P>As far as other dairy products are concerned, such as chocolate crumb, <Col N="318" /> cream in tins and in bulk, surely here again there is an unlimited market, if only we can develop it properly.  We do not appear to be putting our full weight behind it.  In view of the fact that we will have a milk surplus, and in view of the fact that part of our cream could be sold more economically than as butter, I hope the advisory committee can advice the producers on the possibilities of that market.</P>
    <P>On the question of the land rehabilitation project, I should like to draw a comparison between the terms under which this work is carried out and the terms under which grants are made for the reclamation of high bog which is being operated by the sugar company in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture.  The sugar company grants are paid where the Department of Agriculture is satisfied that the reclaimed land is producing satisfactory crops.  That appears to be a very reasonable provision.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether there is any check on the productivity of the land affected by the ordinary habilitation of the land rehabilitation project. It would probably be too much to say that the grant should not be paid until the land is actually under production.  That would be ideal from the Exchequer point of view, but it would be wise to have some check to ensure that, when public money is spent, the land is put into production and kept in production.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wycherley dealt at some length with the scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and gave his view that it should be dealt with in easy stages.  I must disagree absolutely with him on that.  It seems to me that the eradication of tuberculosis is far too urgent to be treated in easy stages and, again as a layman, I must confess I do not agree with the farmer who had nine reactors and disposed of three every year.  That would be quite laughable for, if he disposed of three and kept six, he could hardly isolate the six from spreading the disease throughout the herd during the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>This is certainly something that has got to be treated as a matter of <Col N="319" /> extreme urgency.  Deputy Wycherley said it would be better that we should only gradually eliminate the reactors, so that we would keep up our exports, that if we did it too quickly, we would not have the cattle to export.  The other view is that if we do not do it quickly enough, we will not have a market to export cattle to at all.  It is absolutely essential that, within the next three or four years, the whole T.B. eradication scheme shall be fully completed.</P>
    <P>Part of this scheme involves the pasteurisation of separated milk at creameries and reference is made in the Minister's notes to the scheme under which grants of 50 per cent. are made for pasteurising plants and can-washing equipment.  I have some business interests in that regard and consequently my remarks in this connection may be treated with a certain amount of suspicion.  There are a number of firms engaged in supplying pasteurising plant and can-washing equipment and my information is that the operating of can-washing equipment is entirely inadequate and that in many cases the scheme has got only as far as the installation of pasteurising plants for the skim milk.  If the skim milk is returned to unwashed cans, the whole purpose of the scheme is defeated.</P>
    <P>I think that in certain quarters there is a reluctance to go as far as installing can-washing equipment.  As well as the value of the return of pasteurised skim milk to the farm in sterilised cans, there is also considerable saving.  In all can-washing plants, there is a stage during which the cans are held upside down for a certain period so that they may drain properly. The information I have is that there is anything from one to two pints of milk left in every can after it has been emptied by hand in the creamery, because, human nature being what it is, the people will not hold them long enough for them to drain out properly. In a can-washing plant, cans are held inverted for a period of up to a minute during which a further one pint of milk is drained from them, without any cost to anyone.  I believe that not only does the can-washing plant very <Col N="320" /> rapidly pay for itself by reason of the milk that is recovered and not washed down the drain but that it is essential, when pasteurising plant and can-washing equipment have been installed, to make sure that infected cans are not used for pasteurised skimmed milk.</P>
    <P>I think attention should also be paid to the piping system for delivering skimmed milk into the washed cans. I have had one instance where, to my own knowledge, a new pasteurising plant was in action for a short period and the pasteurised skim was found to be infected.  A complete inquiry was set up and it was discovered that the plant was working all right but the pipes leading from it to the cans were quite incapable of being sterilised or properly washed.  The pipes were old and pitted and consequently were infected all the time.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister will ensure that inspection will not be confined purely to the pasteurising plant itself but will also include the can-washing equipment and the actual piping so as to make sure the pipes can be properly sterilised at all times.</P>
    <P>As regards ground limestone, I think we all regret the increase in cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>The only snag is that we cannot persuade our devoted friends in the United States to continue paying for our ground limestone indefinitely.  We shall not start an argument with Deputy Dillon on that point.  We should all love to have it as cheaply as possible but when we have to pay for it ourselves it obviously costs us more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to see the return of the numbers handled in the artificial insemination stations.  I know of some breeders who are still rather sceptical as to the basis on which bulls are selected for these insemination stations. I hope they are judged not simply on conformation but also on progeny tests of their forebears.  There is a heading dealing with progeny-testing generally which is encouraging and it appears further attention is being given to progeny-testing and the extension of it. While that plan is at present only <Col N="321" /> under consideration I hope it will be brought to fruition at an early date. Some criticism has been made by certain breeders that they are sometimes unable to secure semen from a particular bull.  That complaint, of course, is natural when dealing with selective breeders and for that reason the deep freezing of semen, which is also referred to, appears to be something which should receive special attention.</P>
    <P>Near the end of the notes, reference is made to trade agreements with continental countries.  From the ordinary trade returns it seems that we have chronic balance of payments trouble with those countries on the Continent.  We are importing much more from them than they are taking from us.  I do not know in what way these trade agreements are actually handled, whether it is through negotiation by the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Department of Agriculture or both together, but I feel that some of the imbalance in our trade with continental countries could be corrected or at least greatly improved by better bargaining.  It seems quite hopeless if we must accept imports from France, Germany and the Netherlands without insisting that they should take more of our produce.  It is a matter of tough bargaining and there does not seem to be anybody at the moment who is quite tough enough, or perhaps, who has enough time to do it. Whether it could be done better by Government Departments or by the National Farmers' Association or any of its committees is a matter which is open for discussion but I feel in regard to trade agreements generally with continental countries these agreements seem to favour them very much more than they favour us.</P>
    <P>I should like to make particular reference to the growth and development of the National Farmers' Association. Its growth can be a tremendous step forward in our economic development; the National Farmers' Association can be a tremendous help to any Government.  At the same time there is always a danger that the executives in certain associations may, at some time, have to make unpopular <Col N="322" /> decisions.  That was the case so far as the wheat price was concerned. Apparently the National Farmers' Association did agree with the Minister as to the basis on which the price would be fixed for wheat in the current season and to my mind it was rather disappointing that some members of the National Farmers' Association tended to renege on the decision of their own association.  It is always possible that people will be disappointed with any trade association they join.  That is not confined to agriculture; it may just as easily happen with trade unions or employers' federations, but any member of an employers' federation who resigns because he does not get his own way or any trade union member who leaves his union when he finds that his trade union cannot get a specific increase in pay for him is just as guilty as any member of the National Farmers' Association who withdraws his support from the National Farmers' Association simply because the executive had to make a decision which was slightly unpopular.</P>
    <P>The National Farmers' Association has got together a wonderful band of experts and the organisation merits the support of all those who can actively take part in its work or in that of any other agricultural institution. I do not visualise any situation arising in which the National Farmers' Association will be in direct conflict with the Government.  I believe that negotiations between the Government and the National Farmers' Association so far have been on a pretty friendly basis, but I hope the National Farmers' Association will maintain its progress, grow stronger and take more and more initiative in marketing our products generally.  If they do that it will get us away from the terrible habit of always waiting for the Government to do something.  It is better, I think, that the farmers' organisations should take more responsibility and should make decisions for themselves so that the Government need only come in where State grants or State prohibitions are concerned in the public interest.</P>
    <P>In general, I feel the Minister has <Col N="323" /> produced in this document a record of satisfactory progress during the year. Agriculture is something which, I hope, can be kept strictly above Party politics in every way.  The Minister, I think, is always ready to give credit for any progress which was made under a previous Government.  I hope that tradition will be maintained because as soon as agricultural policy becomes a matter of Party friction, we shall be heading for trouble.  Therefore, I hope the whole of the debate will be kept clear from any sense of tension and that, with the information we have in the Minister's document, which I hope will be passed on to the farming community, the farmers will be able to plan ahead with increasing confidence.</P>
    <P>They have all the incentive that is necessary.  They are getting a much higher standard of technical knowledge and I would hope that very much more technical advice will be made available to them.  With that, I believe the future for Irish agriculture can be extremely rosy, but, at the same time, it is a tough job.  I do not think that those of us who are in the city should ever forget that.  Whereas we may be able to knock off at 6 o'clock in the evening, the farmer has to work very much longer, and under very much more arduous conditions generally.</P>
    <P>Any subsidies or assistance given to farmers will be given ungrudgingly, because I know, from a business point of view, that as long as the agricultural community is prosperous, business is good generally, but once the farmer loses confidence, business generally collapses.  Not only is the farmer the primary producer, but he is the man who seems to control the spread of money throughout the country.  I hope, therefore, we are on the verge of steady progress, if not immediate startling developments, and I feel, under the Minister and with the help of his experts in the Department, that progress is assured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my belief that at the moment there was never more need for a wise policy in relation to agriculture.  While I believe that to be true, I say very emphatically that I believe also that never in the history <Col N="324" /> of the State was there such a lack of agricultural policy on the part of any Government.  I do not know the reasons for that.  I do not know whether it is due to the row in the Fianna Fáil Party as to who should be Minister for Agriculture.  I do not know whether it was that their consciences pricked them because they got into power by so many false promises.  Whatever the reason, there seems to be a shocking lack of policy in that Party.</P>
      <P>I know that Deputy Corry is not here.  I want to assure you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that I have no intention whatever of making a personal attack on him or on anyone else.  This evening, however, I make this appeal to him, in the hope that he will read the Dáil debates.  He has got by for 22 years fooling the people and the farmers of East Cork.  His conduct has now got to the stage that he is only adding insult to injury when he comes into the House and speaks on every Estimate and moans for the farmers.  He does that after he promised them so much before the last election in regard to milk, wheat, barley and oats.  I appeal to him not to add any more insult to injury&mdash;to stop criticising the Government and then voting with them five minutes afterwards.</P>
      <P>There are so many wide aspects covered by the Estimate that it would be very hard for any one speaker to cover them all intelligently.  Therefore, I propose to deal with only one or two aspects.  The first is a pet subject of mine, the improvement of our grasslands. The statements made by the previous Minister for Agriculture exhorting farmers to increase their cow population, were very wise.  The way he put it was: where you had six cows, keep eight; where you had ten cows, keep 12; and where you had 14 cows, keep 20.  Does that not seem to-day to have been the best advice that was offered to the farmers by any Minister for Agriculture since the State was founded?  I believe, and I hope I am not overstating the case, when I say that our cattle population during the last year or year and a half came between us and bankruptcy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, then, we believe that the rearing of cattle and dairying is so important <Col N="325" /> to this country, the best thing to do is, first of all, to tackle the grasslands. There is a phrase that we should try to get two blades of grass to grow where one grew formerly.  It is admitted by the Department of Agriculture that approximately only 12 per cent. of our grassland is giving maximum production.  If that is true, there must be some of the land not growing any blade of grass at all.  I advise the Minister now that that problem should be tackled more energetically.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the efforts made by previous Ministers in charge of the Department of Agriculture to tackle that problem, but it is my personal belief that there is much more room for improvement, and it should be tackled more energetically.  I believe, if that were done, many of our economic problems would be solved.  If our grassland could take double the stock, and I contend it could, we would be in a position in which we would have more cattle for export, as well as other cattle industry by-products.  I suggest that the improvement of our grasslands is one of the problems which the Minister should tackle straight away.</P>
    <P>In the Department of Agriculture, the Minister has available one of the best and foremost scientists in Europe to tackle that problem.  I am referring, of course, to Doctor Tom Walsh.  He is a man with very strong ideas on this subject and the unfortunate thing is that they are only known to very few farmers.  An effort should be made to convey his views and the results of the research he has undertaken, at considerable expense to the State, to the farmers down the country.  I would suggest that the Minister should use the farmers' organisations to help him in that respect.  There is no doubt that much of the land in the country is badly in need of improvement.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that when next he is driving between Cork and Dublin, he ask his driver to slow down at Kilworth Camp.  Just on the left-hand side of the road, the Dublin side of Kilworth Camp, he will see a farm where he would be well advised to have someone put up a poster with large print saying: &ldquo;This farm was well limed and cared for.&rdquo;  If he drives about <Col N="326" /> 500 yards further on towards Mitchelstown, he will see land on the brow of the hill on the left-hand side as he approaches the town.  I suggest that in those fields on the side of the public road, where notices could be read by all passers-by, the Minister should ask his inspectors to carry out an experiment; in the first one, with lime; in the second one, with fertilisers; in the third one, with lime and fertilisers; and in the fourth one, with lime.  I believe that in 12 months' time there would be a lesson there for all to see in regard to the value of proper care and management.</P>
    <P>I believe, too, that much more use should be made of research and of the achievements of the Department.  The agricultural industry is a highly dynamic one.  Scientific discoveries and technical advances involve the necessity for intensive study of crops.  It is only in that way will we have any hope of contending with our neighbours in the export markets.  We are at a point in our history, with the advent of the Free Trade Area, when the markets we have been accustomed to will be invaded by other countries.  It is true, of course, that more markets will be open to us.  I am firmly convinced that, unless we develop our grasslands, we will have no hope of competing at all when the Free Trade Area comes into operation.</P>
    <P>Our Irish farmers and farm workers are as patriotic as any section of the community.  They worked on the land by day and were soldiers by night. Many of these farm workers are still with us to-day.  Their sons and daughters are no less patriotic than they were.  If the Minister makes a proper appeal to them now that the country needs their services, he will be rewarded with their co-operation. Let there be unanimity on this.  Let there be no Party politics.  However we may disagree as to how it should be approached, let us tell the farmers with one voice that the future of the country depends upon their land.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seek the co-operation of all the farmers' organisations. There are many men in those organisations who are devoting much of their time to the national interest <Col N="327" /> and the interests of the farmers.  If he makes the proper appeal to them, he will get their co-operation and I am convinced such co-operation is worth getting.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to make.  I have always been convinced that our educational system at every level should have an agricultural bias.  I feel it was rather a pity that the teaching of rural science in the national schools was discontinued, for the most part.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should, in consultation with the Minister for Education, have this included once again in the curriculum of the national schools.</P>
    <P>I could say a lot with regard to the grading of pigs, the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, the price of wheat and all the rest of it.  I suggest that over the past 12 months there has been a slowness in the attempt made to push forward the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  As a member of a committee of agriculture in County Cork, I think that there has been a lack of co-operation between the committees of agriculture and the Department in this regard.  We, in the committees, feel that it is the fault of the Department of Agriculture.  No matter whose fault it may be, I think it is not a matter about which we should quibble. There should be co-operation and all the financial assistance and all the help necessary should be given.  In spite of what Deputy Wycherley said, I must agree with Deputy Booth in this case. Neither money nor effort should be spared to expedite this work.  Having made the case for the improvement of our grasslands, it would be wrong for me to say otherwise.  I believe that the salvation of our country lies in the improvement of our grasslands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Deputies who have spoken up to now are agreed that our biggest problem in exporting our products is the finding of suitable markets.  We are also agreed that the scarcity of these markets has had a stifling and depressing effect upon the agricultural industry over all the years. It seems to me that too many of the <Col N="328" /> speakers envisage some action by the Government by way of setting up some sort of a marketing organisation to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>It is my opinion that the marketing of dairy produce, like butter, cheese and the various other commodities, would be better handled by the creameries' own organisation&mdash;the I.A.O.S.  It is my opinion that the matter would not be very well handled at all by civil servants.  It would be better if the problem could be attacked by the farmers' own organisations, such as the I.A.O.S.  These are the people who should really tackle this business.  I am sure that if they did they would have the full co-operation of any Government here.</P>
      <P>At present, I think it is correct to say that co-operative creameries are working more or less as individuals and that their central organisation has not been as effective as it might be.  The work they have done in regard to the breeding of cattle, while it has been quite effective in some areas, still leaves a good deal to be desired.  Present indications, contrary to what some Deputies said, are that our cattle population is increasing.  If it continues to increase, that is a very desirable trend.  Farmers in the traditional grazing areas seem to be going in more for the business of calf suckling and the breeding of cattle for beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the country will not be dependent, as it has been up to now, exclusively or almost exclusively on the dairy herds for its store cattle supplies. They will now have at their disposal, more than ever before, cattle that are being bred for beef purposes. This is indeed a very desirable trend.  It should have a good effect on the unbalance that has come about between cereal crops and cattle production. That is one of the effects that has come about in the past few years because of the price of wheat on the one hand and the scarcity and dearness of store cattle on the other.  It has been responsible for putting off a lot of people who normally use their land for cattle production so that, in general, they <Col N="329" /> have been diverted into wheat production. As everybody knows, this will probably have a depressing effect on the prices people will get for wheat in the future.  If the efforts now being made to produce beef cattle on these farms, in order to build up a pool of stores, are successful, there may result a proportionate reduction in wheat-growing.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the big increase in cereal-growing, especially wheat-growing, I would draw the Minister's attention to the bad effect that has been wrought by people who take large tracts of conacre and grow wheat on them year after year.  That has a very bad effect on the land, as well as on the ordinary wheat-producer who grows wheat as a part of his farm programme. I suggest to the Minister that he should see if it is possible to limit the letting of conacre to people who are <i>bona fide</i> farmers, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to ensure that no conacre land will be let except for a three or four-year letting period, which would include a root crop and also ensure that a sufficient amount of fertilisers would be used.  That would help to ensure that there would be no undue emphasis on the production of cereals.</P>
    <P>Another ill-effect which an over-concentration on cereals has had in my constituency is an increase in the incidence of cereal root eel worm.  A great many areas in North Kilkenny have become infested with this pest which is extremely difficult to eradicate.  I believe it is solely the result of over-concentration on the production of cereals.  The difficulty is that those farmers who go in for a grass-cereal rotation are the farmers who run into it most because the ordinary natural grasses and rye grass are favourable to the cereal root eel worm which is thus able to maintain its existence in the soil almost indefinitely in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>When this grass rotation was tried in Sweden, they ran into serious difficulty. It took the most extraordinary and uneconomic rotations, such as repeated root crops or the growing of crops that would have a lethal effect on the cereal eel worm, such as lucerne or all-clover leas.  Furthermore, this very complicated <Col N="330" /> procedure might have to be adopted by us in areas which are severely infected.  As an alternative crop, the Kilkenny County Committee of Agriculture went out of its way this year to advance the growing of peas for the dried pea market.  I realise that encouragement has already been given by the Government to pea-growers in order to extend their activities in this line.  It would be an easy crop for the export market and also it has the advantage that, as a crop, it fits into a rotation very nicely.  It has a very beneficial effect on the quality of the soil and, with reference to cereal root eel worm, it is a crop that helps to reduce the incidence of the infection.</P>
    <P>I would also draw the Minister's attention to the large amount of grass seed imported from almost every country we can think of&mdash;New Zealand, Denmark, Canada, Sweden, France, England and so on&mdash;and the different types of grass and clovers used in the country every year.  I think opportunity is knocking at our doors so far as the production of rye grass and other grasses and clovers is concerned. The more common natural grasses grow in profusion here, even in the wild state and I think we should be able to produce grass and clover seed equally as well as the Danes, the Swedes or the English.  I think one of the difficulties is proper cleaning, but surely that is not a very big difficulty.</P>
    <P>I also feel, without any particular knowledge of the details of the case, that there should be a market for malt and malting barley on the Continent of Europe, and especially in Germany. I should like to hear the Minister's opinion on that suggestion.  I feel there is a market for our malt there and that it should be tried out.</P>
    <P>Another point which I should like to put to the Minister concerns machinery research.  Over the past ten years, millions of pounds have been spent by farmers in purchasing machinery.  While most of it has been of practical use, it does happen that from time to time machinery is imported which is not suitable for use in this country and the country is at a loss through the purchase of large <Col N="331" /> quantities of it.  It would be of great benefit to the country if we had some sort of national institute of engineering, as they have in England, to examine samples of machines, to put them through their paces and report on them to farming organisations and farmers generally.  Such reports on the performance of machines would probably also result in a big saving in expense, particularly as regards money spent on imported machinery.  Well and good if the imported machinery is of a useful nature and if the material is up to standard, but, quite often, machinery and goods of this nature which are imported are inferior and money is wasted on their purchase.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of agricultural education.  From the discussions which take place from time to time in this House and outside on the subject of education, there seems to be a pretty widespread idea that, while farmers may be good enough, they are the type of people who have to be guided and steered in every stage of their work, that if you do not supervise them, they will do the job wrongly.  I know very well that is not very widespread but there is that suggestion in some speeches one hears inside and outside the House.</P>
    <P>If farmers have a market for a crop, know what they will get for it and feel sure of their ground, they always become extremely proficient without any guidance from any body.  I do not advocate the abolition or curtailment of advisory services, but, like Deputy Barry, I advocate the introduction of agricultural classes in school. Kilkenny County Committee of Agriculture tried this on a small scale over the past 12 months in two parish schools, Thomastown and Ballyhale.  We sent an agricultural adviser there once a week to lecture the boys and girls in the senior classes on the elementary subjects of plant and animal nutrition and all the elements of farming.  The results we have had are extremely satisfactory.  In fact, they are amazing. The interest the children take in the classes is also amazing.  The amount they learn and the general interest <Col N="332" /> they have in the subject is very satisfactory indeed.</P>
    <P>It seems to be demonstrated by our experience that it is best to get the line across to the young boys in their early years at school.  Their minds are more receptive than when they leave school and get out of the habit of instruction in general.  Furthermore this develops a love of the land in the children of the country.  I agree with Deputy Barry that it is vital that this love of the land and interest in the things of the countryside should be developed and fostered in our country schools.  It would help to put an end to the flight from the land and eliminate the inferiority country people feel.</P>

      <P>Since the Budget debate took place a short time ago the April trade figures have been published. Anyone who looks at those figures cannot fail to be worried by the trend shown.  Obviously this is not the debate in which to discuss that aspect in any detail but it is the debate which is responsible for any hope of improvement in relation to our external trade.</P>
      <P>The balancing of our external trade in the financial year 1956-57, which was achieved before the present Government took office, and the further improvement in our external trading position which took place in 1957 arose primarily because of the substantial improvement in agricultural production and agricultural exports.  Everybody here knows, understands and appreciates that.  More and more people in the cities are coming, too, to understand that unless we can achieve a substantial increase, a real expansion, in agricultural production, the maintenance of the standard of living of people in the cities and towns will be a matter of considerable difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as agricultural exports are concerned it is, of course, undoubted now&mdash;and, I am glad to say, now accepted on both sides of the House &mdash;that our main export will be the export of cattle and products from cattle.  It is a long cry from the position they used to hold in that regard. I do not want to go back over the wearisome and pitiful story of the <Col N="333" /> manner in which the Fianna Fáil Party, only a matter of a year or two ago, decried the value of our principal market for cattle and decried the possibilities in relation to cattle prospects.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words to-day&mdash; it is the main reason that prompts me to get to my feet&mdash;on the steps we are taking, that we should take and that we must take if we are to maintain and hold that market.  Last night the Minister and I were at a meeting in Naas organised in connection with the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. It was a meeting organised by the county committee of agriculture in conjunction with the National farmers' Association, Macra na Feirme, Muintir na Tíre, the Milk Producers' Association and the Irish Countrywomen's Association.</P>
    <P>That meeting was the culmination of two months of intensive effort by representatives of all those bodies for the purpose of bringing home to the farmers in County Kildare the advantage it would be to themselves and to the nation as a whole to expedite and speed up in every possible way the eradication of bovine tuberculosis in the county.  The enthusiasm shown by the organisers of that campaign throughout County Kildare in the couple of months before last night knew no bounds.  An enormous amount of voluntary work was put into the job of bringing home to every single holder in the county the task that lay ahead and of getting his co-operation towards the solution of the problem. It was a tremendous tribute to the organisers and, I would suggest, to the farmers of County Kildare that they got a 92 per cent. response to the appeals made.  Ninety-two per cent. of the farmers, herd owners, in the county indicated they were prepared to co-operate in every possible way and to do their utmost to ensure that Kildare would be treated as an intensive area and that it would carry through the intensive steps necessary.</P>
    <P>I did not feel it would be proper for me last night to make any observations on that matter.  I felt I was there as a guest and that it was a matter more for the representatives of the farmers' organisations.  But I must confess <Col N="334" /> that I found a sense of bitter and deep disappointment all around me at that meeting.  In his opening remarks the Minister failed completely to respond to the enthusiastic effort that had been made by these voluntary organisations.  He failed completely to give any inspiration to the farmers there, a very large number of the key farmers of every Party in the county. To say that the enthusiasm these people had shown in their work over the last two months was dampened is a big understatement.  Last night they went home from that meeting believing, from the absence of concrete proposals by the Minister on anything, that there was absolutely no policy fixed, settled or determined by the Government in relation to speeding up the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and that the Department and the Minister concerned did not know what road he wanted to travel.</P>
    <P>Let me say at once that I accept completely that the Minister is as anxious as I am that bovine tuberculosis be eradicated as speedily as possible, but the absence of any clear vision and clear determination of policy was brought home by a courteous&mdash;let me pay tribute to the Minister's courtesy last night in answering questions &mdash;yet pathetic failure to appreciate the issues involved and the wonderful opportunity offered to the Minister by the wholehearted response of the farmers of Kildare.</P>
    <P>I am not a bit clear, as a result of last night's meeting, whether there is the urgent appreciation that is necessary if this problem is to be grappled with.  We all know that the British have gone ahead with the eradication of bovine tuberculosis much faster than we all anticipated, say, five years ago. In consequence, within the next three or four years at the outside, there will be a situation when, if our cattle are not graded T.B. free, the export of store cattle to Britain will be at an end.  Many people fail, even in the country, to realise the imminence of the danger which that will mean, not merely to our agriculture but to the nation as a whole.  When, therefore, one gets a substantial body of opinion voluntarily co-operating, in the way in <Col N="335" /> which the bodies to which I refer cooperated in County Kildare, I think they deserve better from the Minister and that he should have done more than merely pay them the courtesy of coming down and meeting them.</P>
    <P>There are two different problems in a county like Kildare in relation to this eradication.  There is the problem for the breeder.  As Deputies know, Kildare is to a very large extent a supplier of liquid milk to Dublin and, therefore, has a very substantial number of cows.  There is one problem in relation to eradication for them and an entirely different problem for the dry cattle farmer in Kildare who is buying his store cattle outside the county, bringing them up and keeping them for a period in Kildare&mdash;and this is typical of the Midlands&mdash;before exporting them as forward stores, or perhaps before selling them for fat purposes.</P>
    <P>If a situation arises in which there is not to be some area in the Midlands completely free from tuberculosis, side by side with the clearance area in the West, it means we cannot keep the forward&mdash;shall I call it, the semi-fat&mdash; store trade for export.  We are all very glad indeed to note that Sligo will be a clearance area in the very near future.  When that happens and when the animals have gone as far as Sligo land can bring them, the traditional pattern must operate&mdash;they must come up to the better lands in the Midlands and be kept there for a period before being exported.  The amount of direct export from Sligo, without coming through the better land, would not be very substantial.  Therefore, if there is not to be a substantial area in the Midlands to which store cattle can be moved out of the clearance areas, a great deal of the satisfactory work done in the clearance areas will be wasted.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us last night in Kildare that we were to get in the county the arrangements which there are in the intensive areas for the purchase of reactors.  I think it was a mistake that there was not a very much greater explanation and a very much clearer idea of the future policy in <Col N="336" /> relation to reactor purchase.  By and large, in the ultimate result, it will be the policy adopted in the valuation of the purchase of reactor animals that will determine whether or not the scheme will be a success in any particular townland.  If word goes round that the inspectors are being niggardly in the compensation paid for reactors, there will be obvious reluctance by others in that townland to come into the scheme and take part in the general measures.  Therefore, it is unfortunate that the Minister did not explain his views on that last night. It is desirable that he should make himself perfectly clear on this question when concluding this debate.</P>
    <P>Even in the West, I have heard comments and grumbles as to the prices paid for animals that had reacted.  I agree that in the case of a young beast&mdash;a young bullock, particularly&mdash;if it is pedigree and if it is a reactor, it has not the same value but where a pedigree cow reacts, the basis of compensation should be that of its being a pedigree animal and not purely an ordinary commercial cow.  If that is not done, people who have pedigree cows will tend to keep them in milk&mdash;particularly if they are supplying milk to creameries or for liquid purposes&mdash;because by passing them in and allowing them to be classed as reactors, they know they will lose a very substantial sum, indeed.  It is vital that there would be a clear understanding on that aspect.  The policy in that regard should be a generous one, a policy erring more on the side of generosity than anything else.</P>
    <P>I want to make a suggestion to the Minister and I think it is worthy of consideration.  I do not claim to be an expert on this or any other agricultural subject.  I am not.  But very often I have the opportunity of discussing agricultural problems with those whom I consider to be experts and it is more as a reflection of their agricultural experience that I speak here now rather than for myself.  If we intend to speed up the eradication of bovine tuberculosis it must be speeded up in such a manner as will enable us to hold the British market <Col N="337" /> and, from that point of view, we shall have to adopt two divergent policies in the Midlands&mdash;one in relation to dry cattle and the other in relation to cattle used for the production of milk and for breeding.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated last night that he was not prepared in those areas to adopt the principle of paying nationally for the tests other than the first test and the test after the &ldquo;All Clear&rdquo; had been given.  If he is not prepared to bear the burden for all cattle&mdash;I think he should&mdash;I make a special appeal to him now to accept financial responsibility in relation to cows.  If that is done, it will have a substantial effect in restoring the enthusiasm damped down last evening. I am appalled at the apparent failure to grasp at the essentials of the scheme at the moment.</P>
    <P>I regard the Minister as a person who is capable of expressing views, if he has them.  He is not one who fails to say what he thinks, if he has given any thought to a problem and if he has arrived at a decision.  I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that on no single question put to the Minister last night was there any specific assurance given that he and the Government of which he is a member had taken a firm decision.  It was a most extraordinary situation.  You had a group of over 100 farmers representative of all political Parties and of every agricultural organisation.  When the meeting was over, moving amongst the people and talking freely to political opponents as well as to friends, I could not find anyone prepared to say that the Minister gave any evidence of a firm policy or firm proposals.</P>
    <P>If that is the position in relation to what is a most vital matter at the moment, I shudder to think of the future that is ahead of us.  Considered from a Party point of view, the situation would be amusing were it not that one must consider it from a national point of view as well.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the speech just made by Deputy Gibbons.  Deputy Gibbons is a progressive farmer and the spokesman of the progressive farmers' views.  I wonder if the speech <Col N="338" /> he made had been made 12 months ago by a Fine Gael Deputy what would have been said by Deputy Moher, for example?  What would have been said by Deputy Moher when Deputy Gibbons said that he hoped the acreage under wheat would be cut down next year to keep the level of production down?  I can imagine the Fianna Fáil Party making the welkin ring had any such speech been made by a member of the Fine Gael Party.  Deputy Moher promised to speak in this debate.  He did not speak on the Budget debate, but he promised he would intervene in this. When he comes to speak here and when his speech is subsequently reported in the <i>Cork Examiner</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Moher has a little influence with the Minister and I am sure the Minister has a little influence with Deputy Moher and Deputy Moher would not have made that kind of speech without having been encouraged by the Minister.  Or are they in the two different wings of Fianna Fáil which are not speaking to each other at the moment?  I would not know whether or not that is so.</P>
      <P>The method by which Fianna Fáil got into office 15 months ago in relation to agricultural prices will prove somewhat difficult to explain on this Estimate.  Right down from the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance the country was deliberately gulled into believing that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power a policy would be initiated and directed by the Government by virtue of which agricultural prices would be higher. I invite any member of this House-Deputy Moher or anyone else-to go down the country and get ten honest Fianna Fáil supporters, if such can be found, and I guarantee that eight out of every ten will tell him that they believed that prices would be higher if Fianna Fáil were elected as the Government of the country.  People now have seen the hollowness of the spate of false innuendoes that were sent out in that period and, having seen it, I am afraid the result will be akin to the feeling present last evening. They will be disillusioned as well as being disappointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather disappointed in relation to the opening speech of the Minister in this debate that we did not hear from him more about some of the other problems that face us.  For example, what real progress is being made in relation to the Glenamoy agricultural project?  I know that in the notes that he has issued the Minister referred to that, but the references <Col N="340" /> are of necessity briefly factual.  I believe that if we could achieve something in that research to ensure that we would get agricultural production from some of that type of bog, we would make one of the most extraordinary advances of the past 30 years. There is a great deal of that bog and it should be capable of being utilised in the way in which we visualised when that experimental station was set up.</P>
    <P>It is far better that it should be utilised in that way than for the production, at a higher cost, of what is a raw material for other agricultural production.  Grassmeal is being produced very satisfactorily in the Midlands and elsewhere, but any form of production that, of necessity, has to be utilised in further agricultural production must be produced not merely at the best quality but at the lowest possible cost.  Otherwise, overhead costs pile up on our main agricultural outlets.  The cheapest place to produce grassmeal must be on some of the better land rather than on bog land. The proper use to which blanket bog of that type should be put is in developing ordinary agricultural production, as was visualised by us when that station was set up in its present form.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say very much to the Minister in relation to the two minutes of 31st January, 1957 and 11th February, 1957.  Everybody had an opportunity of reading the minutes from the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Finance of those dates.  I do not think that anyone can read those two minutes and take out of them the meaning that was attributed to them by the Minister for Agriculture.  I shall be charitable and say that I think he made a genuine mistake in his reading of the minutes on the first occasion.  I think, however, that he would have earned more respect if, having made that genuine mistake and having, under its influence, misled the public as to an action taken by Deputy Dillon and myself, when we were Ministers, he had had the manliness to get up and say that he did misread the minutes and that they did not bear, on his re-reading them, the interpretation which he <Col N="341" /> alleged.  If the Minister does not like to do that, I cannot help it, but it is clear on the face of these minutes, clear in the words of these minutes, that they referred, not to the whole country, but to six counties only&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>And they were to be penalised, although they were the advance counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that, in relation to those six counties, substantially more money was to be spent on eradication and that certain steps were to be taken for the express purpose of speeding up participation in the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Minister, having misread the minutes, in the first instance&mdash;I shall be charitable and say that he misread them genuinely&mdash;and then having seen what the situation was, continues to endeavour to misrepresent that position.</P>
      <P>The two minutes are there.  The Minister said that he would mention this on every possible occasion.  I have done more.  I have had copies made of them when they were put in the Library here and I have sent them to anybody who expressed any interest in the matter.  I have sent them without comment, saying in my covering letter that I was perfectly satisfied for anybody who was interested to read the two minutes and to decide, having read them, whether the Minister was right or whether I was right.  I am still quite happy to leave the matter in that way.  If the Minister likes, I will read the whole of the minutes for the purpose of getting them on the records of the House, but I do not want to weary people by so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in South Galway recently and I was told that, speaking in Clarinbridge last Sunday week, the Minister for Lands announced that it was the policy of the Government&mdash;and, therefore, a policy for which the Minister for Agriculture is responsible&mdash;to inform the farmers that they could look forward to nothing except having to produce more and to get less for what <Col N="342" /> they produced.  I was not there, but I am told that that is what was given as the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>I should be interested to know from the Minister for Agriculture himself, not from the wishful, potential Minister for Agriculture, now the Minister for Lands, whether that represents what this Minister can say in front of the agricultural community. If it is, then it will be a pretty unfortunate day for the agricultural community if they have to face a situation of lower prices, on the one hand, for everything they have to sell and, on the other hand, rising prices for the things they have to buy.  I do not think that is the way in which we will build up a prosperous agricultural economy which, I am glad to say, apparently is now accepted, as it was not accepted some 20 years ago, as being the whole basis of national progress.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is a matter to which I wish to refer and, again, the Minister for Agriculture is the person responsible for it, although I do not believe that he himself could have conceived such an appalling mon-strosity. The Order was made by the Government, but I presume that, as it affects the Agricultural Institute, it is in order for me to discuss it on this Estimate.  I cannot understand what basis of sanity produced the method of election of the five members of the Agricultural Institute.</P>
    <P>All of us, on both sides of the House, agree that it is vital that there should be substantial advances in agricultural research, if we are to keep our place. Realising that it is vital that the Agricultural Institute should be a success&mdash;and so far as we are concerned we wish it every success&mdash;the method by which the five members of that institute are to be elected as set out in the Order tabled on 24th April, simply beggars description.</P>
    <P>If I might take group 2, I cannot conceive the mind that puts on the same level Macra na Feirme, the Federation of Irish Bee Keepers or the Federation of Rural Workers.  We all know that the Federation of Rural Workers is almost overwhelmingly, by its membership, a federation of road workers.  I do not want to decry in any <Col N="343" /> way those who keep bees, even Egyptian bees, but to suggest that bee keepers and the Federation of Road Workers have the same influence in relation to agricultural research as Macra na Feirme is absolutely crazy.</P>
    <P>Wherever one goes down these five panels, one can see something similar. What is being done in relation to this Order and this method of election is to prevent us getting the type of direction in the Agricultural Institute that we want.  I cannot conceive even the Minister for Agriculture being so unrealistic as to hope that that type of election will give the sort of institute we all want.  I suppose that, once the Order has been made, nothing can be done about it, but it is lamentable in the extreme and appears to me to have been framed as a deliberate smack in the face for some of the really important organisations upon which agriculture must rely, if it is ever to succeed.  It is certainly not a method designed to get from these agricultural organisations the voluntary co-operation and assistance that everyone would wish.  I believe the organisations concerned are big enough to ignore the insult.  I hope they are, and I hope against hope, perhaps, that, notwithstanding the mangling the direction of the Agricultural Institute has got under that Order, it will be a success in coping with the problems of agricultural research which must be pushed ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he is not.  At the outset, I want to make reference to the speech made by Deputy Dillon on this Estimate.  One would think by Deputy Dillon's remarks that I was the reincarnation of Guy Fawkes and that my sole purpose was to sabotage Deputy Dillon's Parish Plan.  I think I am entitled to clear myself of any misrepresentation which might have been carried on by Deputy Dillon in <Col N="344" /> that speech.  Deputy Dillon referred to me as the one person who was responsible for the sabotage of the Parish Plan.</P>
      <P>Anybody who wants to make a fair appraisal of what I said in relation to the Parish Plan at that time will see that any references I made were made not to the Parish Plan but to the operating agency.  Deputy Dillon stated categorically in this House that he had accepted Muintir na Tíre as the sole sponsor of the Parish Plan.  I drew a clear distinction between Muintir na Tíre as a rural organisation and the various other organisations which I described as agricultural organisations. Despite the fact that Deputy Dillon had stated that he had selected this organisation as the sole sponsor of the Parish Plan, my speech on that occasion did give him an escape hatch, because, within two weeks of that speech, he went to a meeting of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society and there threw Muintir na Tíre overboard and promised to the co-operative creameries a parish agent.</P>
      <P>I much prefer to think that the suggestions I made on that occasion were readily accepted by the various organisations in my own county of Cork which represents, as far as agricultural land is concerned, one-seventh of the total area of the Republic.  A short time after I had spoken in this House, all the rural and agricultural organisations in that county got together and formed themselves into a county advisory body to act as a sponsor of agricultural instructors in the county.  Every agricultural instructor now operating in that county has a local organisation nominated by the county executive, representative not alone of the rural organisations but of every agricultural organisation in the county, including the National Farmers' Association, Macra na Feirme, the co-operative societies and the Irish Countrywomen's Association.  I think that, as a sponsoring body, that body is much more representative of Irish agricultural interests than Muintir na Tíre could claim to be.  With that, I propose to leave the discussion of my alleged part in the sabotage of the Parish Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> I much prefer, when I come to an Estimate such as this, to talk about our problems and to try to make an appraisal of our position in relation to the people against whom we have to compete.  We have now passed the stage when we produce for a home consuming community and our main concern should be to examine and find out what our position is in relation to those people with whom we shall have to compete for the sale of our excess agricultural produce in any market into which we may go.</P>
    <P>I thought Deputy Dillon rather funny when he was speaking but on examining the position I do not think the position was as funny, from the practical angle, as one would think it was when he was speaking.  If we were to accept Deputy Dillon's word for it, and his theory that Irish farming is a way of life rather than a business, I am afraid we would still be down graded as one of the slum agricultural communities by comparison with those with whom we have to compete. Deputy Dillon was very eloquent when he drew the distinction between a herd owner and being herd-owned. When we come to speak of herds, we have to think not alone of our own herds, what they produce and what their potentialities and capabilities are, but we must also think, when we come to the matter of competition, in terms of the production of our competitors. We know that when we go into the British market for the sale of dairy produce, we shall meet there the Danes, the Dutch and the New Zealanders.</P>
    <P>Over the years these people have developed techniques of production and strains of cattle that leave us with a considerable leeway to make up. Forgetting for the moment the question of competition, and the sale of our surplus produce, there is always the question of our position as farmers and the income that our farmers may hope to obtain from their labours.  Our gross income rate per acre is something between £15 and £16.  Our output per cow on a butter fat basis is 175 lb. Our output per acre, butter fat, is 55 lb. and our output per male worker <Col N="346" /> engaged in dairying is 1,500 lb. of butter fat.  It is only when we come to make a comparison that we realise the disadvantageous position in which we find ourselves as competitors.  If we make a comparison between our position and that of New Zealand, we find that the figures for New Zealand per cow are 250 lb. of butter fat as against 175 lb. here.  Output per acre, butter fat, is 160 lb. against 55 lb. as far as our Irish output is concerned. Output per man engaged in dairying&mdash; and this is the figure which must stagger anybody&mdash;is 12,500 lb., compared with our approximate 1,500 lb. of butter fat per cow.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to get up on the opposite side of this House, talk flavoured nonsense and &ldquo;blah&rdquo; when, at the same time, we have to realise that this kind of thing will be no help to us when we have to go out and sell our surplus produce in competition with those who have such a decided advantage over us.  I myself think that the figures and factors which show a comparison between our position as agriculturists and that of our competitors could not be given too often or could not be repeated often enough in this House and outside it.</P>
    <P>The physical set-up of the New Zealanders is very much like our own. I have always said that, if you make a close study of one country as against the other, we have decided advantages over them.  We have an average of 42 inches of rainfall per year which makes this country probably one of the most fertile grass countries in the world.  New Zealand has considerable spells of drought and it is nothing unusual to have, in those droughts, thousands of acres turned into a brown turf.  Nobody in Ireland in living memory ever saw a drought which turned our grasslands into a brown turf.</P>
    <P>The New Zealanders decided, quite a number of years ago, that they would move in a certain direction.  Many people think that the original cattle population of New Zealand was composed of Jerseys.  That is not the case. New Zealand started, as we started, with Shorthorn cattle and they gradually crossed their whole cow population <Col N="347" /> into Jerseys.  For almost 30 years we could not make up our minds in what direction we would move.  There was a good deal of muddled thinking; there was a time when inside and outside this House there was one slogan: &ldquo;The dual purpose cow is the best in the world&rdquo;.  That was repeated here and paraded outside this House, but now we do not hear it so often as we used to.</P>
    <P>We were, for a long, long time, trying to make up our minds whether we wanted a cattle policy that made cattle breeding a by-product of dairying or whether we wanted dairying a by-product of the cattle industry and so we find ourselves, as far as dairy produce is concerned, completely beaten by our competitors in every market. For a considerable time the trend has been for people to analyse and examine things more objectively, to find out facts for themselves and make up their own minds as to what breed of cattle is most suitable.</P>
    <P>If one travels in the South one finds that the Dairy Shorthorn is the predominant breed still, but one notices that over the past five or ten years, especially since the introduction of artificial insemination, there is a considerable increase in the number of Friesian cattle.  There are some Jerseys but they number only a very small percentage of the total.  The importance of the Shorthorn, the Friesian crosses, in particular of crosses by Aberdeen Angus bulls is paramount in view of the prices which are being maintained for store cattle, but there is one feature of this which has always puzzled me and for which I think I can see a solution on the horizon.  It is what I once described here as the extraordinary odyssey of the Irish calf.</P>
    <P>If anyone were to come to this House, as I do, once a week by car from the South he would find travelling into the South small trucks and vans going to the calf fairs there.  How many people are concerned in the movement of these calves before they finally come to rest at the farms on which they are reared is not clear but <Col N="348" /> there is a great deal of &ldquo;trucking&rdquo; in calves.  I cannot but conclude that the whole system is insane because if anything suffers in the exchange it is the calf.  Nobody can deny that the calf gets an extremely bad start because, between one dealer and another, between one fair and another, the animal alternates between subsistence and starvation.</P>
    <P>The same thing happened in regard to weanlings.  On a number of small dairy farms in the South, it was a common feature to find calves six and nine months old.  These calves were brought from one place to another; they were hawked all over the country and from the time they left the farm on which they were bred no one knew where they ended, how many people were concerned nor how many parasites had a bit of them before they finally came to rest on some beef farm. I think the whole system was insane and it accounted for the peculiar position we had when we found ourselves with great big steers, four years old, with long horns that frightened children. For a considerable time we were exporting these cattle at four, four and a half or sometimes five years old. That was an extremely wasteful policy because those animals could have been exported, if we had anything like a sane beef policy, at an age of from two years to two years, three months.</P>
    <P>On the more general topic of the background from which we, as a nation, gather our wealth, I want to place on the record some figures which will form the basis of what our mean farming potential is.  We have a total of 300,000 holdings of over one acre. I want to make a case to refute at least the conception that the bulk of the land of Ireland is held in large parcels. As a mater of fact our farming economy is, as I shall prove by the figures I shall give, a small-farm economy.  Many people are inclined to think we have a considerable number of farms of upwards of 100 acres or 200 acres.  That is not so.  I want to point out that in the dairying areas, dairying is a small-farm economy and in the South, in particular, we have a considerable number of small farms. Fifty-four per cent. of the farms are <Col N="349" /> 30 acres and under.  They slide down the scale from 30 acres.  Twenty per cent. are between 20 and 50 acres, so that, after extracting the cottiers, the one-acre people, one might say that 74 per cent. of the land of Ireland is divided into holdings of from 50 statute acres downwards.  Seventeen per cent. are over 50 acres but not over 100.  Seven per cent. are between 100 and 200 acres, and 2 per cent. over 200 acres.</P>
    <P>These are the small holdings from which we gather our wealth.  I am sure everybody will now admit that our wealth comes from the land.  On those holdings, 420,000 men are employed of whom only 60,000 are hired labour.  That would indicate that, as far as our farm economy is concerned, it is, in the main, the small-family farm.  We have only 60,000 hired workers.</P>
    <P>I should like to give a short analysis of the recent farm survey.  Some people think that farmers are millionaires and talk of farmers rolling in money because there were no authentic figures until we got the findings of the farm survey.  People liked to believe that the primary producers of wealth were in the millionaire class because it gave them the excuse they needed to look for a larger slice of the cake than they were entitled to.</P>
    <P>I should like to analyse the farm survey.  The first group comprised farms from 15 to 30 acres.  The average farm was 25 acres and the income per family farm with an average of one-and-half people&mdash;I do not know how they managed the half, but that is the statistical figure&mdash;gave a net income of £313.  That would be the equivalent of an outdoor wage of approximately £200 per head, or roughly £4 per week. Nobody can say that the farmer with 15 to 30 acres is a millionaire.</P>
    <P>The second group comprised farms from 30 to 50 acres, the average farm being 38 acres.  The income per family with 1.6 people was £423.  That was £260 per head per annum, or a net wage of £5 a week, the equivalent of an outdoor wage of £5 a week.  The third group comprised farms from 50 to 100 acres, the average farm being 65 acres.  The net income was £589 and <Col N="350" /> family workers, excluding paid labour, were 1.76 persons.  This gave an income per person of £340 or £6 per week.</P>
    <P>That will give some indication of the situation as far as the farm survey is concerned, and I doubt if anyone will refute the investigations of an independent body like that.  It gives an indication of the average income of those groups which comprise the bulk of the people who occupy the land of Ireland. When we think of the farmer, we must think of him as a primary producer. His success is the success of every other section of the community, no matter what their vocations or callings may be. His failure and a recession in his income will find its way into the homes of all other groups.  Despite all that, despite the fact that most intelligent people are prepared to admit that the farmer is the only owner of real wealth, as far as this country is concerned, when it comes to giving him a fair return for his labour and a fair share of the national income, do they treat him as a primary producer?  I am afraid they do not.  They resurrect the old excuse that farmers are millionaires and are rolling in riches.</P>
    <P>All kinds of arguments are being put forward to push the farmer from his rightful place as a sharer in the country's national wealth.  One is that he does not pay any income-tax.  Of course he does because farmers pay more rates than any other section of the community, and who will argue that rates on land are not a form of taxation? Of course, they are, but when the competition starts, it is the law of the jungle.  The agricultural population is distributed over wide areas and is not in a position to organise itself like other sections.  When the competition starts, those other sections in the centres of population have organised groups seeking that little bit more to which they are not entitled, irrespective of the claims of the primary producer. That is the general trend.  It is very much the law of the jungle, the survival of the fittest.</P>
    <P>I am one of the people who have always argued that the agricultural section of the community comprises the producers of the wealth of this nation and that on their production <Col N="351" /> and their efforts every other section of the community depends.  However, there is the continuous tendency by organised sections to deprive the farmers of their rightfull share of the wealth which they produce.  What would the position be if we were to pay farmers' sons and daughters an agricultural indoor wage of £3 5s. to £3 10s. per week from school-leaving age until they reach the age of 24 or 26 years?  The small farmers whose incomes I have quoted could not pay such a wage.  These people, in the main, are the sweated coolies for the other sections of the community and is it any wonder most of them, as is said, desert agriculture and fly from the land?  The reason they fly from the land is that the land will not give them a wage equivalent to what their opposite numbers in other sectors of the economy get.  That is one of the main reasons for this mass movement of people from the land.</P>
    <P>When I was travelling in a London bus about a year ago, I was recognised by the &ldquo;clippie&rdquo; on the bus. She was a girl who came from my own constituency.  She had been two years with the London Transport Board, earning a wage of £10 2s. a week.  What would she have got as a domestic servant on a small farm in Cork?  Why is it if one travels up and down the length and breadth of Great Britain, one will not find Irish boys or girls working on the farms?  They have got such a surfeit of the treatment meted out to them on the farms at home that they much prefer to concentrate in the doss-houses of Brixton, Paddington, Camden Town, Euston and Lewisham.</P>
    <P>I have been on many farms in different parts of England and Scotland. As far as I could see, English farms, in the main, are manned by Scottish emigrants, but there are very few Irish workers on them.  One can hear the word &ldquo;slavery&rdquo; used by sons and daughters of small farmers in the constituency from which I come. They know that, no matter how long they stay, they cannot say they are entitled to the minimum agricultural wage.  I do not want to make the kind of speech made by Deputy Sweetman. <Col N="352" /> I want to say what I know to be true, what I believe to be true.  I want to say what I have observed as a representative of a constituency of small farmers, a constituency which has suffered to a considerable extent from emigration.</P>
    <P>Our exports are the wealth of this nation.  The bulk, 85 per cent, of our exports are of agricultural produce or of agriculturally-based products.  That 85 per cent. provides for all the luxuries which the non-agricultural sections of the community enjoy.  The television masts we see all down the eastern coast and in the suburbs of Dublin are paid for by the sweat of the small farmers, their sons and daughters.  It provides for everything we import, the raw materials for industry, the machines, the replacements and the technical personnel.  At the same time, industry, about which we hear so much, contributes just 10 per cent. of our total exports.  In other words, the wheels of industry are kept going by the work of the farmers and by the farm workman and his family on the small farms scattered throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    <P>I listen to the hysterical screams of Dublin politicians&mdash;I do not care to what Party they belong&mdash;for increased production from the land.  You cannot increase production on the land, any more than you can in industry, without a considerable infusion of capital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>If you want increased production on the land, you will have to put capital into it.  If one were to examine the pattern of Irish agriculture in 1958 and 1948, one would see that the whole pattern of capital investment has changed.  In 1948, the bulk of our work was done by horses and not by machinery.  I believe that we are all mad as far as mechanisation is concerned.  We have gone stone mad.  Many of the small farmers I know have put from £1,400 to £1,500 capital into machinery on farms of 50 and 60 acres.  They have no chance and no hope of recouping the capital invested in that machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The horse is gone and our only <Col N="353" /> interest in horses now is in Punchestown and the Curragh or where we are going to get the dead meat factory for the slaughter of horses.  That is the only interest we have in horses. If you roam around the country, you will see all the iron horses, the expensive machinery and the millions of pounds worth of different types of machinery.  All that machinery is imported.  The wealth of Ireland is being poured out to foreign machinery manufacturers.  The spare parts and the fuel oil which moves the machinery are all imported.  They are a permanent feature in our balance of payments problem.</P>
    <P>Does anybody realise what would happen if we had another Suez crisis? By the grace of God, the skill of our farmers and by reason of the fact that we had a population of farmers who were capable of taking two horses and going out into the fields to produce our food, we escaped starvation in the last war.  That is less than 20 years ago. Suppose we had another Suez crisis; suppose we had another explosion in the Middle East, what would our position be if fuel oil, for instance, were to be cut off?  Would we have to depend upon the British Navy to provide us with fuel?  If we did, God help us.  I am sure they would be as generous to us in relation to fuel oil as they were when they came to give us the grain of tea in the last war.</P>
    <P>What would the position be?  We would starve.  I have no hesitation in saying that we would starve because our whole agricultural economy is geared to foreign machinery, foreign replacements and foreign fuel oil.  In addition, we have lost the technique. We have a new generation who know nothing but how to jump on the seat of a tractor and pull out the choke. If you were to give them two horses and an ordinary chill plough and send them out into the fields, God alone knows where they would end up.  That is the position.  We have not the horses and we have not the personnel to use the horses.  If we had another crisis these are the things which worry me.</P>
    <P>I know people will say I am a crank and that I want to go back.  I do not want to go back, but I want some <Col N="354" /> sanity in the form of mechanisation which we have.  I see people in my own constituency with 50 or 60 acres who put £1,400 and £1,500 into agricultural machinery.  I told them before they did it that they could not recoup the capital.  Now they are in the claws of Bowmaker or some other lending agency.  In order to meet the demands of Bowmaker and other lending authorities, they have to abandon their own farms and go out and work for hire to get the money to pay the instalments demanded for the machinery.</P>
    <P>I often wonder why some sanity did not prevail when we switched to mechanisation.  I think we are to a very great extent the victims of highpowered advertising.  The British had to mechanise during the war.  They had to produce as much as they possibly could to avoid starvation.  We started off and I can say we have the most insane form of mechanisation of any country in the world.</P>
    <P>I made reference a minute ago to the hysterical appeals of Dublin politicians for increased production.  The prerequisite to increased production is some sane organised marketing system. Deputy Dillon may quote figures to say we increased the physical volume of our exports by about 24 per cent.  You can always get the right figure by using the right base year and the right base year in his case was 1947&mdash;the worst weather year in a century, a year in which the soil of Ireland was exhausted through lack of fertilisers.  If you take as a base year the year 1938, which was the year before the war, you will find, on checking the figures, that the physical volume of our exports increased by only 12 per cent.  If you increase production, remember that that increased production must go, in the main, to the British market. Remember also that, in the British market, you will meet the high-geared marketing organisations of competitor countries.  If you have not a comparable marketing organisation then, no matter how good your product may be, it will be down-graded and you will not get its competitive value in that market.</P>
    <P>Personally, I think we are late in <Col N="355" /> the field, as far as marketing is concerned. I was looking at figures which I got from a recent trade report in order to get some indication of how our surplus is being sold in comparison with our main competitors.  The figures will give the House some indication of the position.  I have here quotations from <i>Comtel Reuter</i> of 15th May&mdash;a periodical which reports market prices.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asserts that we have 64 per cent. Grade A bacon.  I should be glad to know if there is a difference between our grading system and that of our competitors.  If we have as rigid a grading system as they have, one would think that, on the competitive market, our product should fetch as good, or almost as good, a price as theirs.  When I read this quotation, the House will have some idea of where we come so far as our 64 per cent. Grade A bacon is concerned.  I quote now from <i>Comtel Reuter</i> of 15th of May:&mdash;</P>

    </table>
    <P>Why are we at the bottom of the list?  Is it because we have a bad marketing organisation?  I know something about a marketing organisation because on a number of occasions I visited the marketing organisations of our competitors.</P>
    <P>Take the Danes, for instance.  Their tonnage is in excess of that of the British home producer.  The average consumption of bacon in England, as far as I remember, is about 10,000 tons a week.  Into that market the Danes send about 3,800 tons.  The British themselves produce about 3,000 and, down the scale, third or fourth last in the list, you will find the Irish Republic.  No matter what grade we may call our produce it is usually down graded in price.</P>
    <P>In travelling through the place, trying to assess our advantages and disadvantages and the kinds of marketing organisations our opponents <Col N="356" /> have, I could see a reason why our surplus produce was not reaching anything near the prices which our competitors were able to command on that market.  Take bacon as an example.  The Danes have, on British soil, something like 42 huge selling centres which are either in or adjacent to the main built-up areas.  Their job is to promote the sale of all-Danish farm produce and to keep their finger on the pulse of the consumer market.  The organisation is controlled by British wholesalers and Danish producers.  You can see the advantage of having the wholesaler and the producer work together.</P>
    <P>As well as the 42 huge selling centres which are located in or adjacent to the main built-up areas, the Danes have at least two, if not more, huge smoking plants where Danish bacon is imported green, smoked and then released for sale in Britain.  One of these smoking plants is at Hull and the other is located at Selby in Yorkshire.  There may be others but these are two which I came across.</P>
    <P>One can see the advantage of exporting green bacon to these plants as smoked bacon deteriorates considerably in cold storage.  If you want to put your product on the market in first class condition, you must export it green, then have it smoked and presented ready for demand.  Those organisations have on aim and that is to keep for 12 months of the year, even in the most remote village, Danish produce in the shops&mdash;to make sure that the British housewife will have a constant supply of Danish produce from New Year's Day to New Year's Day.</P>
    <P>What is our position?  I often look at newspaper articles written by people who do not know what they are talking about.  I have always said that we have one advantage over all the others, if we could only exploit it, that is, that we have our own people over there to eat anything we will send to them.  No other exporting country has that advantage.  Our own Irish people in Britain are a potential consuming population for our produce.</P>
    <P>Bear in mind that you cannot create a taste for a product unless you keep <Col N="357" /> that product continually before the consumer.  If you scurry in and out for a few weeks or a few months at a time, and disappear for periods, how can you hope to establish a market for your product?  Again, you will have to advertise and to put your product in an attractive packet.  If you were to see the rounds these people go to, you would realise our disadvantage. For example, they all hold dairy weeks which are exclusively for the purpose of boosting the farm produce of their country.  You will see their stalls in which the attendants are dressed in native costume.  They spend much more money in publicity than we do. What money do we spend in publicity over there?</P>
    <P>We are much more concerned about sticking up pictures of some Irish seaside place or some other beauty spot than about advertising the flavour of an Irish ham.  We do not advertise.  These are all the factors which we have to face, once we become exporters.  I am aware that at the moment an organisation is studying what we should do.  I sincerely hope that when their findings are referred to the Government the Government will make haste to help us to bring up the leeway in advertising and propaganda for the sale of our surplus produce in that market.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to butter.  I have eaten butter from all the main countries exporting to Great Britain. Without prejudice, I can say that our Irish creamery butter is second to none.  I think any unprejudiced person would say the same.  I know nothing about our bacon and I am not in a position to say we have as good a product as the Danes.  But in regard to butter, we again suffer from the disadvantage that we are not able to induce the customer to try it.</P>
    <P>Pack is a factor in the sale of butter. If a British housewife goes into one of the many chain stores and asks for a pound or half pound of butter the assistant will not root around a 56 lb. lump but will find the pack most convenient to him.  You have Danish butter sold in rolls of half-pound and one pound and the Dutch go one further; for some little extra they have <Col N="358" /> a quarter-pound pack.  That gives the housewife the advantage of being able to use a quarter-pound on the table and put the other three-quarters into the ice box.  These are the small things which count in the sale of farm produce.</P>
    <P>There is one factors which counts above all others.  No matter what the cost is, we should make up our minds that our anticipated export of butter will be so much, and that our anticipated export of bacon will be so much.  Then we should select some centre of population and make sure we keep it supplied with that product for the 12 months of the year just as our competitors do.  You cannot create or hold a market by trotting in and out of it, by appearing and then disappearing for 12 months.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of emigration. I gave, in relation to small farms, one of the reasons why people emigrate.  But there are others.  With an average family of four or five on a small holding, the most that holding can provide for is one boy and one girl.  The other members of the family will try to get an education to suit them for a particular calling.  Having got that, they will go and find employment.</P>
    <P>I am sure every Deputy will agree that there is a limit, a narrow limit, to the increased number of workers you can place on the land.  Any work which might accrue from increased production will be in processing and handling.  With the system of mechanisation, to which I referred earlier, we need not hope for any substantial increase as far as employment on the land is concerned.  One might ask is there any hope for the rising generation on the land.  I can see no hope.</P>
    <P>One of the things that would strike any observant person is the difference between a town with an industry and one without it.  The town with an industry is prosperous; the town without an industry smells of decay.  Its day is past.  If we cannot industrialise our towns they are doomed; nothing can save them.  Most of our towns grew up within the past 120 years. They were mainly depots of supply. They supplied a hinterland of ten or 12 miles at the most when the farmers <Col N="359" /> rolled in on the weekly market day or fair day.  Then the motor car came and there was an absolute revolution in transport.  To-day the farmer can go to the multiple store and the chain store; he can go to the city where, he says, he has a better selection than in the small stores in the town.  There are also the co-operative stores with delivery services out to the farms and again depriving the towns of the opportunity of trade.</P>

      <P>I am finished as far as that is concerned.  I often wonder how true figures can be of the position they are supposed to indicate.  When someone quotes an unemployment figure, to what extent is that figure true of the number of people unemployed?  When a figure is given for the total emigration in one year, I wonder how many of those people left jobs.  The unemployment figure is a bald one which does not define whether the people were unemployed and genuinely seeking work or were unable to find work. I wonder how these figures can be analysed.</P>
      <P>We all have a duty to save the rural population.  Instead of decrying rural Ireland, our teachers and spiritual leaders should be trying to persuade the younger people that Ireland is as good a country as any under the sun. That would be better than putting the skids under them and wailing, telling them there is nothing here for them and that they will have to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Every year, another Department creates about 500 small holdings, but for every one small farm created, about two-and-a-half disappear. When one goes to the offices of the Land Registry, one finds that figure is borne out.  Our agricultural economy is, in the main, extensive. Whether the farm is one of 15 or of 100 acres, the pattern is the same.  A small holding can survive only by doing a specialist job.  One cannot ranch on 15 acres.  That is why dairying&mdash;with its subsidiaries, bacon, pigs and poultry&mdash;is, in the main, centred in the small farm areas.  That is where you have that small farm economy.  In East Cork, the area I represent, the farms are larger than in West Cork and there is a much higher percentage of richer and bigger farmers.  That is <Col N="361" /> why there is in West Cork a concentrated area for pig production, while pig production in East Cork is not such a factor as it is in the poorer areas of West Cork.  We as planners should get our people to think in terms of a special economy, a particular economy suited to the size of each holding, saying: &ldquo;If you attempt to ranch on 15 acres, you will either uproot yourself or starve.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Speaking from the opposite side of the House, I once said the day would come when some Minister for Agriculture would regard any surplus of dairy produce as something radioactive. Everyone will admit that the most depressed product into which one can manufacture milk is butter. Cheddar cheese would probably give a far greater return for milk manufacture than butter.  It would be less of a load on the Exchequer.  I wonder why the possibilities have not been explored of trying to break into that market.  In view of the very serious problem we have in the sale of butter, I would urge that a complete examination be made of the British market for milk products other than butter.</P>
      <P>When dealing with cows and calves, I made a reference to store cattle, but I cannot conclude without referring to beef.  It is peculiar how the agricultural structure of one country can impact itself on another.  As long as any British Government decides to pay a subsidy of something like 42/6 a cwt. for beef, so long can we hope that our store cattle prices will be maintained&mdash;provided, of course, we have the right kind of cattle and make them disease free.  We seem to have done little to cater for that market.  I wonder why we have done so little in the progeny testing of beef bulls.</P>
      <P>When speaking on this Estimate last year, I asked a question as to the result of a certain test which was carried out on Friesian bullocks and Shorthorn bullocks.  When the figures were supplied by the late Senator Moylan&mdash;God be merciful to him&mdash;I noticed I got killing weights for them, but the all-important carcase-grading was missed&mdash;no grading was given for the carcase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the final analysis, what will sell a <Col N="362" /> beef animal, whether pure bred or cross, is the way that animal will grade on the butcher's block.  The consuming housewife will decide.  If we intend to supply a market with beef, or even with stores, we should be up and coming to make sure we shall supply a first-class product.  We must make sure that those who pay us good money will get the best value for it.</P>
    <P>I gave figures here on a former occasion and I referred to them in a broad way again to-day.  If we are to aim at a sane beef economy, we shall have to produce an animal which will have bred into him good growth and efficiency as a food converter.  These are the things which will ensure his early maturity.  We know there have been tests along these lines in Britain and America.  I am particularly interested in one American development, namely, performance testing.  Bull calves at three months are taken into an official centre and there fed on a certain plane of nutrition.  Everything is recorded.  It has been found that the bulls which give the highest weight per food unit consumed are, in the main, the best bulls for transmitting the same good qualities to their progeny through the artificial insemination centres.  That is a form of testing that we ought to have.  Indeed, it is a matter of some urgency that we should know the right type when distributing beef bulls to breeding stations.  Our present method is the old fashioned visual method used by the Royal Dublin Society almost 150 years ago.</P>
    <P>I said a moment ago that the housewife is the official arbiter of quality meat.  I have here an interesting extract from an American journal.  At the last convention of the American Cattlemen's Association, Mr. John A. Logan said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have just completed a survey in which we interviewed meat buyers from 52 countries, operating 8,700 super-markets and stores.  The No. 1 comment was: Ask cattlemen to produce beef that eats well but has less fat.  Restaurant operators serving over 18,000,000 meals per day expressed a similar demand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That will give some indication of the <Col N="363" /> emphasis which other countries place on producing the right store with a view to having the right meat.  Remember, if the store is the wrong type, then the finished animal will not produce the kind of meat the housewife wants. Deputy Sweetman referred to the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. Here, I have considerable sympathy with the Minister.  There will be a great deal of criticism before we succeed in eradicating bovine tuberculosis. There will be a good deal of disappointment. I am not one of those who would strike a pessimistic note.  The position is so urgent that one would hesitate to say anything that might be interpreted as approaching pessimism. The deadline has been set for us.  The position is so urgent that one would hesitate to say anything that might be interpreted as approaching pessimism. The deadline has been set for us.  The British say they have almost 70 per cent. of their cattle attested.  By 1961, they will have drawn a <i>cordon sanitaire</i> around the country and they will exclude all cattle which may be carriers of bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>Our problem is more of a cow problem than a cattle problem.  In some areas, the reactor cow rate is very high; in other areas, it is not so high. As a result of the general test carried out&mdash;it is all we got for the money expended&mdash;we know that, as far as store cattle are concerned, the reactor figure is something around 8 to 10 per cent.  We also know that in some areas in England the breakdown has been as high as 12 per cent.  Nobody wishes to rush into anything.  This will be a slow job.  It will require patience and it will require education. The people will have to be taught the simple things they should do to save their stock from reinfection.  One of the things we must do is to breed tuberculosis free replacements in the dairying areas of the South.  If we do not do that, God only knows when we can hope to achieve complete eradication.</P>
    <P>With regard to veterinary research, practically every discovery made in relation to the curing of human disease has had its impact, so far as the treatment of animals is concerned.  I am often amused at Deputy Dillon when he makes extravagant claims.  I do not know how anyone could claim credit for what the veterinary surgeons <Col N="364" /> have discovered.  If more calves survive to-day, it is because veterinary science has placed at our disposal aurafac and sulphamethazine.  If fewer cattle are dying from pneumonia, it is because we have the sulpha drugs.  If we have lower losses from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister what has been done in relation to the importation of the hornless Hereford.  Reference is made in the White Paper to suggested legislation making it compulsory to dehorn cattle, say, about 1961.  Dehorning of cattle, unless it is done within three or four days of birth, is a pretty brutal thing.  If the hornless heifer has advantages and if it is comparable with horned cattle, I do not see why the whole position should not be re-examined and why we should not import the semen and start a foundation stock of hornless Herefords.</P>

      <P>I am accountable only to the people of East Cork and I am not afraid to return to them.  I wonder what Deputy Sweetman or Deputy Dillon would have done, had they been faced with an enormous surplus of wheat?  What solution would they have found?  We are twitted here that we have taken the floor price from under wheat.  I wonder what solution Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Dillon would have provided.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputies will agree with me or not, but I do know that the numbers of store cattle available are limited.  The former grazier is not able to compete with the exporter. He has fewer cattle to graze lands which are probably producing more grass.  I think the figures, when they are available, will show that there is a considerable switch from beef ranching to wheat ranching in what were the former grazing lands and, if present prices continue, that will be a more or less common pattern.  I should like to know what the solution will be. Is there anyone in his sanity who will say that we should produce and produce and go into the export market when the normal granaries of the world are overflowing?  America paid her farmers 700,000,000 dollars to put 11,000,000 acres out of production.  We know that there is a considerable amount of the former grazing lands let under conacre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Gibbons talking of the presence of eelworm in County Kilkenny as a result of bad rotation.  As <Col N="366" /> farmers, we have rather a bad history. Much of the land now being reclaimed on borrowed money is land that was formerly mined of its fertility by bad husbandry.  If Deputy Dillon's figure is correct, we have spent over £12,000,000 of borrowed money trying to reclaim land.  Is it prudent, is it sane for us to borrow millions of pounds to reclaim portion of the land formerly mined while at the same time, on some of the best land in the country, the same process is taking place?  I know there is evidence of eelworm in the Kilkenny area.  If there are people who will take conacre and grow crop after crop of grain until they establish diseases, they are miners of the fertility of the soil of Ireland.  There should be some letting code to deal with these people.</P>

      <P>With other Deputies, I should like to congratulate the officials of the Department of Agriculture on the White Paper they have produced, which is very comprehensive and covers all features of agricultural activity and production.  I do think that it is a pity that they did not embody in the White Paper a statistical statement, if not a general statement, relating to employment on the land.  We are all very alive to the fact that one of our great difficulties to-day is that we have been unable to retain our people on the land for a variety of reasons.  It would have helped us in this debate and in our discussions generally if we had had some statistics in relation to the flight of labour from agriculture to other spheres of our economic life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in agriculture has been cited by other Deputies.  It is agreed on all sides of the House that we are <Col N="367" /> increasing production.  In fact, we have increased production in practically every sphere of agriculture.  It is an outstanding fact that, at the present moment, the farmer has only one really reliable market, that is, for beef.  He is not certain that in the foreseeable future he will be able to market his other products nor is it certain what he will receive for such products.  That being the case and the county being so dependent on the sale of beef to preserve and maintain our way of life and our national economy, it is imperative that the Minister should pay particular attention to this angle.  At the moment we are almost entirely dependent on our store trade.  It is a known fact that the store beast is a much more saleable article than a fat beast.</P>
    <P>This time last year, when the rise in beef prices came, when farmers were buying at high prices and those who sold had to replace at high prices as well, it was absolutely essential that those prices should be maintained. What in fact took place was that just about this time of the year&mdash;and I am informed that the early signs of that are already appearing&mdash;cattle that had been sold as store beasts and exported out of the country, having got the subsidy which is paid by the British Government to British farmers for such stores, having spent the allotted period of three months in Britain or Northern Ireland, as the case might be, and having had their ears punched as an indication that the subsidy was paid, were brought back to this country in considerable numbers.  That had a very depressing effect on our markets.  The farmer is entirely dependent on this trade.  He may be getting a good price for his cattle, but he is buying at a high price and he wants at least to be assured that that price will be kept absolutely stable. Otherwise, he is running the considerable risk of having his whole economy upset.</P>
    <P>On several occasions last year, I drew attention to these heavy imports of ear-punched cattle from the North, and I was always given the same reply, that the Department were watching <Col N="368" /> the situation carefully and were satisfied that few cattle were coming in.  If they came into my constituency where the closest fair or market town is over 50 miles from Dublin, I am satisfied that they are coming in in much heavier numbers around Dublin.  I am advised that this is likely to happen again in the near future.  It is up to the Minister to protect the farmers in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Irish farmers faces a very difficult situation with reference to sheep. We have more sheep in Ireland to-day probably than we have ever had before in our history.  In any county I have been in&mdash;and I have been in a good few recently&mdash;including South Galway, there is no scarcity of sheep, but the price of wool is considerably depressed. The increase in the sheep population, in my opinion, is due to the fact that the British Government did not live up to their trade agreement with us some period back and imported large quantities of Argentinian beef so that the farmers of Ireland were forced to turn over to other forms of production.  The Minister should not stay idle while we are facing this situation.</P>
    <P>When we were in Government and when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, we exported considerable numbers of sheep to France.  It may be that the position in France at the moment in regard to exchange, finance and general stability is responsible for holding up the export of sheep to that country.  However, France is not the only country where it is possible to get an export market.  The Minister should take the initiative at political level&mdash;I want to stress that clearly, at political level&mdash;because we will never get anywhere in Europe, unless we act at political level.  There is no use in sending civil servants out to negotiate trade agreements.  You may negotiate better trade agreements with Britain and other countries in that way, but if you want to negotiate a trade agreement in Europe, you must do it at political level.  This matter is very urgent and the Minister should move in this case as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why, when we voted £250,000 for marketing close on 14 months ago, there are no results <Col N="369" /> whatsoever to show for it.  I think it was stated here in answer to a parliamentary question or in some debate here, that only £800 has been expended so far.  Every Deputy, whether he lives in Dublin or rural Ireland, realises that our difficulty is to get markets. The farmer has succeeded, and always will succeed in producing the requisite goods, but what he wants is the markets for them.  It is not enough for the Minister to come into the House and say that the bodies concerned are considering the matter.  Again, I suggest that, particularly at the moment when we are approaching the possibility of a Free Trade Area, markets should be sought on the Continent of Europe and may I again say that they should be sought at political level?</P>
    <P>Even if we were able to market all our agricultural produce with case, and even if we were to increase our production in all these different spheres, I do not feel that the present agricultural policy is adequate to maintain in full employment all those who live in rural Ireland and who earn their living from the land.  There are many reasons why the flight from the land has taken place.  As the last Deputy who spoke said, the changeover to machinery and perhaps the capitalisation in respect of machinery on small farms, which is placing a heavy burden on the farmers, may be responsible for their not being able to give as much employment as they want to give.  It is also possible that they are over-mechanised, under-capitalised and cannot produce as much as heretofore. However, even if these matters were rectified, I still feel that, unless we can reorientate our agricultural policy, we will not be able to absorb fully our unemployed.</P>
    <P>I suggest there is considerable scope in the horticultural sphere.  We do not pay a tremendous amount of attention to horticulture in Ireland, although we have on our doorstep the biggest market for horticultural production in the world in Britain.  That market is supplied not by us who have comparatively the most suitable climmate, but by the other countries of Europe whose climate is not as favourable <Col N="370" /> as ours.  Practically every expert who has come to this country, whether from O.E.E.C. or elsewhere, has expressed surprise that we have done nothing about this in spite of the suitability of our climate.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that there is a considerable market for seed potatoes.  There is an instituation called the Potato Marketing Board and their purpose is to secure markets for potatoes for Irish farmers. There could be considerable expansion in relation to both seed and ware potatoes. In my own constituency, there is an area where they grow potatoes almost exclusively.  They could possibly double their production, if they could get the market for it.  Every Deputy who has a knowledge of rural conditions knows that there is considerable employment associated with the production of potatoes.</P>
    <P>I should also like to say that there is, in my opinion, considerable scope in regard to vegetables.  That was also mentioned during this debate.  The difficulty about vegetables is that they are very perishable goods and to be an economic proposition, they have to be produced in very large quantities.  If you have, as they have in other countries, a deep freeze system whereby you can put those vegetables in storage and keep them until such time as the actual market is there for them, it can be made a realisable proposition.</P>
    <P>I do not wish the House to misunderstand me.  I am not suggesting that we should throw away all the benefits that we have got, or all the markets, or get out of such things on which our whole economy depends, but I feel we might step into other lines.  I feel the lines I have mentioned would be more desirable on the smaller holdings in the West where they have a mild climate and also in the southern parts of Leinster.  It certainly would be a considerable adjunct to existing employment and I feel it would do more to retain people on the land than anything else.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the question of wheat. Of course, we are realistic in the Fine Gael Party and we accept facts.  There has been a good deal of political con- <Col N="371" /> troversy over wheat.  The position is simply this: we can for the moment forget the past&mdash;except that I cannot help saying that I believe Fianna Fáil Deputies in rural constituencies gained their votes largely on wheat, and I am sorry for Deputies who were elected on that basis because now they know the truth and they have got to face the music, just as we had.  I said just now that the farmers will produce anything for which they will get a reliable market.  They had a reliable market for wheat and they had a guaranteed price, and that was not entirely due to Fianna Fáil, because we helped in that regard also.  They produced wheat and produced it so well that they produced an excess of it.</P>
    <P>There is an excess of wheat in the country and this year there is likely to be considerably more wheat than there was last year, if the information I have received from those who should be in a position to know is correct. Reading the notes of the Minister, it is quite obvious that there are no real arrangements to deal with the situation. It is now getting on to summer and most of the wheat is sown, and we should be in a position to assess pretty well what the position will be. A vague statement such as paragraph 2, on page 2, in the section of the notes which deals with wheat which says&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The total deficiency, as thus calculated, will be divided by the total estimated intake of millable wheat, and this will determine the deduction per barrel to be made from the basic price.  The amount of this deduction will be announced by the Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;means, in effect, that there is no guaranteed price for wheat.  Can it mean anything else?  It is the most idiotic statement ever produced.  I am not blaming the people who produced the draft.  It is a policy statement and nothing else.</P>
    <P>The Government have a majority and one thing which they could have done, if they had the courage, was to assess the price of wheat.  They could have done that or they could have had <Col N="372" /> the courage to restrict the excessive growth of wheat.  I say that it is not fair to the farmer.  Farmers have to live from day to day and sell their produce and know what they will get for it.  No farmer in Ireland&mdash;not even the Minister for Agriculture himself&mdash; knows what a farmer will get for wheat this year.  There may have been a problem, but if there was a problem at least the price could have been fixed.</P>
    <P>It was quite unnecessary, in my opinion, to lower the price of feeding barley.  In the last year in which the inter-Party Government was in office, they fixed a minimum price of 40/- a barrel.  They may not have liked to do it; they may have found it difficult and there may have been pressure from those interested in tillage; but it proved successful.  The minimum price was 40/- and very few had to take 40/-. I cannot see why the price has been fixed at less this year.  If it had been fixed at 40/-, there would not have been as great a sowing of wheat as there was.  That is why wheat has been sown in every field where it is possible to do so.  That is why we will get a surplus and that is why the Government have created difficulties.  It is better for the country to realise that and I hope that next year they will try to do a better job.</P>
    <P>I have a certain feeling that there is never a very happy understanding between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture.  I feel that a lot of difficulties in marketing could be solved, if there was a closer liaison between those two Departments.  The processing of agricultural goods has been mentioned and it was said that it would be a good thing if we stopped turning all our milk into butter.  I could not agree more with that.  It could be turned into cheddar cheese and exported to other places.  There is an unlimited market for good cheese in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>A lot could be done by co-operation between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Industry and Commerce and their officials and advisers, and also at political level, to encourage firms who are conversant <Col N="373" /> with the manufacturing of cheese to set up in this country.  They have many opportunities, if they do so.  If they come from outside the British Commonwealth, or in fact from anywhere in Europe, they have preference in the British market in the export of that cheese and they are closer to the United States of America if they manufacture here.  It should be possible to provide almost unlimited milk for that purpose.</P>
    <P>We had Deputies mentioning rural science.  I cannot understand why, where a majority of people are going to spend their lives on the land in an agricultural community, rural science is neglected.  The Minister should use all the influence he can command with those who support him in the Government to see that rural science is returned to its rightful place in the educational system.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to mention free trade.  Whether we like it or not some people are, as they say, for it, and some are against it.  Personally, I favour free trade; I think we have everything to gain and nothing to lose and our principal gain would be the export and sale of agricultural produce, be it the raw material of agriculture or the processed material.  I think we have allowed our minds to be overshadowed by the disadvantages that may accompany free trade&mdash;I should not even say disadvantages, but rather the problems, we would have to face. Certainly any gain we shall make in this matter in Europe will be in agriculture. I cannot understand then why we have never sent the Minister for Agriculture to any of these discussions that take place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the present Government&mdash;let that be clear.  The active free trade discussions have started only in the past 12 months or so.  I can understand that one Minister may represent another, but I always felt, and I think our representative who is going there finds that most of the time and most of the discussion that has gone on there, have not been connected with <Col N="374" /> agriculture.  I know for a positive fact that agriculture was never raised at the free trade discussions that took place in the O.E.E.C. Committee until comparatively recently, actually at the beginning of this year, although the talks had been taking place for some time.</P>
      <P>Surely Ireland, a completely agricultural country, should have been represented at that level and should have forcibly made clear that she expected, for her participation in that area, that she would be given consideration for her agricultural markets? It is only natural that we should defend other interests; I do not propose to speak about those matters because we are dealing entirely with the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture, but before I sit down, I wish to say that it is the direct duty and responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture, representing Ireland as such in that all-important Department, to ensure that when the next discussions take place at the meetings of Ministers in Paris or elsewhere he will be present to represent the agricultural interests of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon in moving that this Estimate be referred back gave as his reason that he did not understand the economic policy of the Government which, when the cost of living had gone up, had proceeded equitably and fairly enough, as he said, to hear the case of every section of the community on that increased cost of living, and to make provision for them, with the exception of the farming community.  I hope I am not misquoting or misrepresenting the Deputy, but I think that was the gist and substance of what he said and that was the case he put forward for having this Estimate referred back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I said before, about some case that Deputy Dillon put forward, that what the Deputy seems to forget when he cites the increased cost of butter and bread and flour, is the very obvious fact that the good farmer does not buy any butter at all nor need he buy any appreciable amount of bread or flour if he turns less than half a statute acre of wheat into wheatenmeal. The increased price of butter, <Col N="375" /> bread and flour has not much effect on the good farmer.</P>
    <P>If we look at the agricultural price index we find that in March, 1957, it was 101.1 and in March, 1958, it was 104.2.  The average price at the fairs of store cattle of one to two years old was £34.24 in March, 1957, and in March, 1958, it was £42.13, an increase of practically £8 per head.  Taking fat cattle from two to three years old&mdash; I suppose that would include some good stores also; it should, in any case &mdash;the average price per head in March, 1957, was £58.46 and in March, 1958, it was £64.50, an increase of about £6 per head.  Milch cows tell the same story.  The average price at the fairs in March, 1957, was £41.90, practically £42; in March, 1958, it was £48.06, an increase of £6 per head.</P>

      <P>So far, the farmers' income has not gone down anyway and I think I have demonstrated that the cost of living so far as bread, butter and flour are concerned, did not affect them very much.  I am referring to the good farmers, of course, because the bad farmer might be expected to have less than half an acre of wheat and he might not have sufficient butter but the good farmer would not only have sufficient butter for himself the whole year round, but would have a surplus, perhaps an embarrassing surplus.</P>

      <P>The good will be gone out of it then.  The average price of eggs per 120 was 20/- in March, 1957, and in March, 1958, it was 25.85/- or nearly 26/-.  Those figures are from the economic series published by the Central Statistics Office, dated 5th May, and are the latest figures available.  They prove fairly conclusively that the farmers' income during the last year has gone up considerably, that farm prices have gone up considerably. Deputy Dillon was a long way from proving that the increased prices of butter and the increased prices of flour were a burden on any good farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde spoke about wheat, as did several other Deputies.  I never remember our farm without wheat and it did not take any national emergency to make us grow it.  I know a thing or two about wheat and I never grew bad wheat.  The problem and the position about the price of wheat as I know it is this: we are prepared to give a fair price for wheat to be turned into flour and bread for human consumption.  We are prepared to ask the consumers, poor and rich alike, to pay a pretty high price, as a result, for bread and flour; to co-operate in a big national effort to have our flour and bread requirements supplied as far as possible from 100 per cent.  Irish wheat.  But we are not prepared to ask the consumers to make up by way of taxes the difference between the price that wheat has been sold at to be turned into bread and flour for human consumption, <Col N="377" /> and the price which the remainder of the wheat crop will have to be sold at as animal feeding.  That is the difference.  That is what we are not prepared to do.  I do not think any Government would be prepared to do that.  I do not think any Government would get away with it.  I do not think the consuming public would let any Government get away with it.  It would be most unfair and unjust.</P>
    <P>It was out of that peculiar problem that the married price was born. There are a lot of people very critical about that price now who were very enthusiastic about it before it was adopted by the Government.  It is not an ideal solution.  No farmer Deputy is really in love with it.  Neither is the Minister himself in love with it, nor have the Government any particular grádh for it, but it was the best and fairest method that could be devised in the circumstances.  Perhaps after careful and long examination a better solution will be found and I do hope that a better solution will be found.  I think a better solution must be found.</P>
    <P>Some way must be found of limiting the unreasonably large-scale growing of wheat by people who refused to grow it in a national emergency, people who adopted a very unwilling attitude towards the growing of wheat &mdash;one might say, a treasonable attitude. When we had our backs to the wall, they kept away from wheat. They had to be compelled to take it up by the Government, because it required a bit of work and a bit of energy.  Men had to take off their coats to do the job because, as Deputy Moher said, we had little or no mechanisation then.  At that time, a man had to go out with a pair of horses, and plough an Irish acre a day, as I often did, sow and reap it with horses, and hand stack the crop.  After the emergency had passed, these people came in with their 100 acres of wheat, when combine sowers and combine harvesters made things easy for them and the high price of store cattle had made things risky for them.  That is why they came in.  It had even become fashionable.</P>
    <P>The great majority of them were not <Col N="378" /> our supporters.  They were people who ridiculed the growing of wheat, who would not plough up their 100 years old fattening land.  They had the ignorant and erroneous idea that if they ploughed up their grassland, they would ruin its fertility for the next 100 years.  That idea has now been exploded and nobody nowadays takes any notice of it.  But when these people grow wheat now, they are mining the best land in the country, and something must be done to curb and limit the selfish opportunism of these men who are mining the land of its fertility and postponing the day of an all-Irish loaf which I, as one Deputy, would like to see come as soon as possible. They are postponing the day of an all-Irish loaf by producing a low quality wheat and lowering the general standard of the entire crop.  They are postponing the day when the millers can be coaxed, coerced or cajoled to accept Irish wheat to produce an all-Irish loaf.  At the same time, these people are squeezing the traditional tillage farmer, the traditional wheat grower out of a fair wheat market.</P>
    <P>I know there are snags.  I know that the Deputies who speak for the Opposition on this Estimate will admit there are snags in controlling this unreasonable large scale opportunist type of wheat growing, but I say to the Government, to the Minister for Agriculture, that every effort should be made to find a way of limiting this type of wheat growing.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear&mdash;and this touches upon agricultural credit&mdash; Deputy Dillon urging the Minister for Agriculture to alter the conditions as regards loans to farmers.  The small farmer at any rate could get a loan up to ten times the amount of his valuation. There were two conditions.  The first condition was that he should have a guarantor and the other, that his last two gales had been paid up to date. Deputy Dillon was frank and honest enough to admit that he got this condition inserted.  He admitted it was a mistake.  Of course, it was a big mistake, but it was a simple mistake to make because, as everybody knows, 90 per cent. of the farmers never pay until they get the six days' notice.  That is <Col N="379" /> true.  Eighty-eight per cent. of them would have been well able to pay it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon found that out.  The biggest stumbling block was not in regard to the finding of a guarantor. Eighty per cent. of the cases turned down were turned down because the annuity had not been paid up punctually. Deputy Dillon admitted it was a mistake and he urged the Minister to dispense with it.  I urge the Minister to do likewise, as I think it would be a good thing.  After all, it was not a very serious financial default. He got his six days' notice and the banks usually accepted payment even after the six days' notice.  Deputy Dillon urged the Minister to adjust the matter and leave it out.  I also urge that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon went on to talk further about the question of credit. He said there was a lot of talk in this country&mdash;and there is from time to time&mdash;about farming being undercapitalised; that the farmers cannot get credit.  He holds there are ample credit facilities for those worthy of it. I do not agree with him.  In the case of the fellow who interprets a long-term loan as a loan which has never to be paid back, I agree that that type of man should not be considered, but that type of people are in a small minority. Deputy Dillon maintains that there are ample credit facilities and, perhaps, the Minister for Agriculture has the same mind about the matter.  I do not agree at all.</P>
    <P>I know cases where men wanted a loan to buy cows and they could not get it.  The very same farmers could go into any town in the Midlands that I know of anyway and without delay and without any guarantor drive home a tractor worth £600 or £700 which they had got on the H.P. system.  That is true and every farmer Deputy knows that.  Here are people who were refused a loan by a semi-Government institution to buy cows which would increase their income and their live stock and put them, perhaps, firmly and permanently on their feet.  At the same time, they can get something which they do not want too badly at all-something which they might, <Col N="380" /> perhaps, be better off without&mdash;at a very high rate of interest.  I make that point in order to show that our credit facilities for farmers are not all we think.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister for Agriculture to look into that aspect of credit where a man can get a £600 or £700 tractor without a guarantor and drive it home, whereas he cannot get £600 or £700 to buy cows which would be better for him and the country.  One wonders whether a guarantor is necessary at all.  Sometimes a very credit-worthy farmer cannot get a guarantor.  It sometimes happens that a good neighbour may be a bad pay. The result is that a farmer who is asked to go guarantor is put into a very embarrassing position.  He turns his face against going guarantor for anybody.  That is a well-known fact. There are many men who will go guarantor for no one, no matter how credit-worthy he may be.</P>

      <P>I want to make another point in regard to agricultural credit.  It is a point upon which I think I would get great support from all sides of the House.  I would urge upon the Minister to make purchase loans freely and easily available on the easiest possible terms to the tenants of labourers' cottages to purchase cows.  If that were done, I am sure that 90 per cent. of the tenants in rural Ireland would avail of the loans.  They could purchase a cow and have milk and butter for themselves for the greater part of the year.</P>
      <P>I should like to see every cottager with a good cow&mdash;one which would produce a good calf every year.  If the Minister considered that proposition, I should like him to insert a condition asking them to buy selected or approved cows, so that they would not be fooled into buying a bad beast, but would buy cows approved by the Department's inspectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, exactly.  I should like to see every cottager in the country with a good cow which would <Col N="381" /> produce a good calf.  It would increase the numbers of live stock in the country.  It would also have a great psychological effect on those people to have the ownership of a cow and a calf and all it means.  I hope the Minister will consider that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon referred to Denmark and the way of life of the Danish farmer.  I refer to this not so much by way of criticism of what Deputy Dillon said as that it touches upon agricultural credit also.  Deputy Dillon said that a friend of his was in Denmark and went to one of those folk schools and there met a married woman who could speak perfect English.  There was some kind of course on for married women for a fortnight.  She seemed to be delighted to be there.  She said she was married 11 years and that was the first time she put her nose outside the door since she was married.  Her husband was out only twice.  Deputy Dillon suggested that was no life for an Irish farmer to imitate.  What puzzled me was where and when that woman learned perfect English when she did not put her nose outside her door for 11 years.  It is all rather extraordinary.</P>
      <P>He went further and said that the Danish farmer boasted about being a hard worker.  He spoke about his production and of the number of hours each day which he works.  Deputy Dillon pointed out that when this farmer got married and started to set up house, to purchase land, machinery, stock, and so on, he got a loan and that he consecrated the remainder of his life to the task of raising a family and repaying that loan. This is not a bad consecration.  Deputy Dillon further told us that there was a man standing on the doorstep of that Danish farmer, if he defaulted or showed that he was not making good, to point out to him that the road was wide and hard and that it was there for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it hard to believe that the picture painted by Deputy Dillon of the life of a Danish farmer is true in all its aspects.  I should like Deputy Dillon to give the House figures or statistics in regard to evictions or seizures in Denmark.  If he studies the <Col N="382" /> matter further, I think he will find that the percentage of bad debts amongst Danish farmers or farmers who do not meet their commitments is extraordinarily low and that, therefore, life there is not as severe as Deputy Dillon thinks.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. Lynch spoke in somewhat the same strain as Deputy Dillon.  He referred to some man of his acquaintance who could afford to send a young fellow to Holland to study Dutch farming and to spend five or six weeks there.  He came back bubbling over with enthusiasm about their methods of farming in Holland, about how they got up at 5.30 a.m., about the number of cows they milk and the work they do.  His father asked him if he had been to any race meeting or football match and he replied that he had not. Deputy T. Lynch seemed to be disgusted and seemed to hold up Dutch farmers as people not to be imitated. In my view, that is entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>Why was the young fellow enthusiastic?  What inspired him? What was the source of his enthusiasm if life there was so much blood, sweat, tears and toil?  Apparently he had a good time on his own farm.  He could go to races, football matches, and so on.  His father could afford to send him for six weeks to a country where the people worked hard and he came back quite enthusiastic about it all. It is wrong to discourage our farmers from imitating the virtues and good qualities of farmers in Denmark, Holland, New Zealand or elsewhere. We can learn a lot from them, just as the farmers of Denmark, Holland, New Zealand or anywhere else may be able to learn a lot from us.</P>
    <P>I am still wondering how it is that the woman Deputy Dillon mentioned was able to learn perfect English and to speak it fluently if she had not put her nose outside the door for 11 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="NicholasEgan" hpid="Mr. N. Egan Mr. N. Egan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, she had an easy life.  She had not her nose to the grindstone all the time in that event.  However, she might have learned enough English at home to enable her to pass the equivalent of <Col N="383" /> our matriculation or leaving certificate examination but I suggest she would not be able to speak the language fluently, as she did with Deputy Dillon's friend.</P>
      <P>By far the biggest task before the Minister for Agriculture and his Department is the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  The last stage of clearance in Great Britain will be reached by march, 1960 and it will be cleared altogether by 1961.  After 1960, two years hence, no untested cattle from this country will be allowed into Britain.  The position is almost alarming. We are very close to the deadline. Our scheme for eradication started less than four years ago.  While the British scheme started 25 years ago, they are only now reaching the clearance stage.  We started less than four years ago and we have only two further years in which to clear up the matter or else send no cattle to Britain. While many Deputies from both sides of the House spoke about the matter, I think it was not sufficiently emphasised and I fear that the people of the country as a whole do not realise its significance.</P>
      <P>It is the biggest task before the Minister and his Department.  It is their most urgent task.  It is a task fraught with the greatest potentialities either for good or for bad, financially, economically and in every other way. We are very close to the deadline.  I urge the Minister to concentrate his great ability and energy, and I hope the officials of his Department will concentrate their great ability and energy on this important matter.  We need all the enthusiasm and drive they can put into the matter to eradicate bovine tuberculosis in the shortest possible time.  Everything possible should be done to rally the country and to make the farmers realise the importance and urgency of this task, through county committees of agriculture and through whatever other channels the point may successfully be driven home to our farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputy paid a tribute to the reasonable way in which this debate has so far been conducted.  I re-echo <Col N="384" /> those sentiments.  I was present for most of the debate.  I am very pleased with the way it has proceeded and with the reasoned way in which Deputies from all sides of the House have spoken.  I could never appreciate or enjoy an unkind cut or a poisoned dart. I can understand a clash of mind&mdash; benefits may result from such a discussion&mdash;or a violent clash of opinions. However, I never liked the unkind cut or the poisoned dart in this House or anywhere else.  Therefore, I am glad that so far this debate has been conducted on very fair lines and in a manner which is creditable to all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Finally, I congratulate the Minister on his very clear and factual statement, on the way he presented facts concerning developments in agriculture during the past year and the difficulties and problems which face us in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate which takes place each year when the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture is under review in this House is probably noted for its length and also because of the number of Deputies who take part.  Naturally enough, the debate in regard to agriculture should be given the utmost attention.  Deputies are given an opportunity by way of parliamentary question to elicit information concerning each Department, but only once a year are they given an opportunity of reviewing the entire agricultural policy in open debate and of making constructive criticisms and suggestions.  While Ministers may change from time to time, the Department of Agriculture remains an institution set up for the benefit of the farmers.  Although there may be a good deal of criticism about the methods used to administer the various schemes under the Department, we should bear in mind that we have in the Department of Agriculture perhaps the most efficient, highly skilled and best trained officers of any Department of Agriculture in any part of the world to-day.  In so far as it is their duty to carry out loyally and honourably the policy of the Minister in charge of the Department, they do so; but it is part <Col N="385" /> of our obligation in opposition to endeavour to steer the Minister on to what we feel is the proper line of policy to be administered by this highly efficient Department.</P>
      <P>That is where I cannot join in the congratulations to the Minister which have been extended by the previous speaker and others.  If we speak freely and frankly, we must admit that the Minister is in charge of one of the most important Departments of State. We must admit, too, that for the 15 months he has been in charge of this Department, there has been no agricultural policy whatever.  It has been stated, particularly during the past hour, that so far as the agricultural community are concerned, and particularly the farmers themselves, they are not so severely affected by the rise in the cost of living.  That statement was made by a colleague representing the same constituency as I represent. I do not subscribe to that, nor do I subscribe to the Deputy's sincere belief that the farmers to-day are not feeling additional living costs at a time when their incomes are drastically reduced.</P>
      <P>It should be the aim of the Minister to be in a position to stand up with pride and delight and say that, as Minister for Agriculture, he feels sure he is the leader of the best off and most progressive section of the community. That is what the farmers should be. Consider for a moment that the price of flour has been increased by 3/6 per stone.  I should like Deputy Egan to tell the House where is the farmer's house that can do without flour. Where is the farmer's wife who does not purchase flour?  Where is the farming family that does not usually or frequently purchase a sack of flour?  To say that the increase in the price of flour does not very seriously affect the livelihood of the farming community is a statement not in accordance with the facts and one that certainly cannot carry much weight.  A few minutes ago, Deputy Moher said the majority of our farmers were small farmers.  He gave the percentage and also gave the approximate acreage.  Without doubt, the increases in the price of flour and bread have made things more difficult for them and added to their costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> Deputy Egan said that the position has not in any way worsened and that the farmer's income has not in any way lessened.  Whatever may be said about wheat&mdash;and I shall have a word or two to say about it&mdash;we must admit that no one in the country to-day knows what the price of this year's crop will be.  It is all very fine for the Minister for Agriculture to say it will be so much.  No farmer with wheat on his land to-day knows what he will get for it.  The price of wheat is reduced and there is a further reduction now because of the fact that he must provide himself with his own sacks. That will represent a further reduction of about 6d. per barrel.  While this year's wheat price has been reduced as compared with last year's, next harvest the farmer may find himself faced with a reduction of 12/6 or 15/- per barrel.  The farmer's rates have increased.  If he has a motor car, there is the additional cost of petrol.  If he has machinery, there is the additional cost of oil.  If we consider that state of affairs together with the other increases he is obliged to meet, it certainly makes him worse off.</P>
    <P>At the same time, trade unionists, industrial workers and others are given the benefit of wage increases to the extent of 10/- per week.  It will not be too long until further demands are made on farmers for increased wages for their agricultural workers.  No one can deny that the agricultural worker is playing as important a part for the country as the farmer himself.  He stands side by side with the farmer in the fields, at the sowing, at the reaping, at the fairs.  He is at his beck and call in the event of beasts being ill. He is there for his Sunday milking. He is always available.  Those of us who feel that the agricultural worker is not as important a citizen as the farmer himself are not expressing an honest opinion about the people who are the assistants to the main producers.  While our farmers should be the best-off section of our community, beside them in that category should be the agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>Let us ask ourselves what has taken place since the Government took office <Col N="387" /> to make the farmer better off, make him more content and give encouragement to the younger people to remain on the land.  We hear speeches, well-founded or otherwise.  I suppose it would be impossible for a speech to be delivered here which would meet with the entire approval of every member of the House.  The farmers have been criticised for having machinery and tractors.  Who is better entitled to have his way of working brought up to the best and most modern ideas than the farmer himself, so that he may have greater efficiency and more speed?</P>
    <P>We hear criticism of the farmer for indulging in the purchase of large-scale machinery, such as tractors, reapers and binders, and combines or whatever he desires to purchase to modernise his holding.  Let us take that position side by side with that of the industrial worker.  Some want to take away the tractors and put the farmer back to slavery with the horse. Assume that the sewing machine were taken away from the dressmaker and she were told to go back to the thimble and needle.  Assume that the big machinery were taken out of the worsted mills and cloth mills and it was said that no more spinning was to be done by up-to-date modern machinery, that they were to go back to the old spinning-wheel.  Is that not exactly the same as asking the farmer to surrender his up-to-date machinery and go back to hard work with horses?  That day has gone and gone forever, and I am glad it is gone forever.</P>
    <P>We are living in an age of speed and modern ideas, when people like to get all the work they can done in the shortest space of time, with the greatest speed and efficiency.  How can people feel they would add to greater production by criticising our farmers for mechanising themselves?  Recently it was said that at every church gate on a Sunday, the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland or whatever it may be, the entrances are completely blocked by the farmers' motor cars. There were expressions of jealousy and criticism because the farmers have reached the stage of taking their own <Col N="388" /> motor cars to the church gates.  I asked here, as far back as 14 or 15 years ago, and I ask it again now: &ldquo;Who is better entitled to drive to town on his business when he likes or drive to church on Sunday, than the farmer?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There seems to be an extraordinary idea in the minds of certain people that everyone should get everything&mdash; except the farmer who is footing the bill and paying for everything.  It is a grand thing, and it should be the proud boast of every Deputy, that we have lived to see the day in which the ass and cart or the pony and trap, such a familiar sight outside every town and at every church gate 25 years ago, has gone.  The whole world is moving fast and there have been extraordinary changes all over the world.  It is only right and proper that the farmer should take his motor car and drive his family to church or anywhere else.  Who is better entitled to it?  I repeat that here now, for the records of the House.  The Deputy who criticises the farmer for having a motor car is delivering unfair and unjust criticism.  Who is better entitled to a motor car?</P>
    <P>It may be said that the farmers are entering into strong financial commitments in the purchase of machinery. If they have not got tractors and other essential machinery, how are they to get the work done?  Horse work is a thing of the past&mdash;gone and gone for ever.  The tractor means more speed; it can be brought out into the field to tear the ground up, doing as much work in one day as a pair of horses would do in five days.  Owing to emigration, and for other reasons, there is a serious shortage of workers on the land.  We know there are numbers of unemployed, but there are many unemployed people that a farmer could not or would not have around his place.  Agricultural labour calls for a certain amount of skill in working on the land.  It is not every type of man who is suitable to perform such duties as are required by an up-to-date or efficient farmer.</P>
    <P>That is why I say it is of the greatest importance that, instead of farmers being criticised for having <Col N="389" /> machinery, we should say: &ldquo;More power to them for having machinery.&rdquo; More power to them for endeavouring to get as much work done as they possibly can, as easily as they can and in the shortest possible space of time. When I hear a Deputy saying that every second farmer in the country is sinking his money in agricultural machinery and saying he felt it was money not being well spent or wisely spent, I certainly cannot subscribe to that idea.</P>
    <P>We heard it said here to-day that the farmer is no worse off now than he was two years ago.  A statement of that kind, from people who should know, is a statement on the borderline of insanity.  The price of wheat and the price of barley have gone down. Grade A pigs have been reduced by 5/- a cwt.; Grade B pigs have been reduced by the factories to the extent of 50/- a cwt.  That means that those actively engaged in the production of wheat, barley or pigs must be worse off this year.  They have the prospect of being worse off financially at the next harvest.  I fail to understand&mdash; and so do the farmers&mdash;the activities of the Minister, more particularly when compared with the performance of the past 15 months.</P>
    <P>The farmers consult amongst themselves, as they often do and should do, and they ponder over the promises made by the Government prior to and during the general election.  We were told that the farmers were on the verge of bankruptcy.  We were told that the farmers were creating disaster by keeping the inter-Party Government in office.  We were told that the farmer who would not vote for Fianna Fáil was cutting a stick with which to beat himself.  The strange thing about the Fianna Fáil Party is that&mdash;and this is particularly true with reference to their so-called agricultural policy, a policy which they have not now and which they never had&mdash;they had a tune to suit every kind of jig in rural Ireland. They made the most extraordinary and fantastic promises, promises they now deny and say they did not make.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is a state of mind into which the Fianna Fáil Party have got themselves, and I do <Col N="390" /> not know whether it is due to the manner in which they fought and won the election through bluff, through false promises and through deceit, but they appear now to have worked themselves into a position in which they think they are sincere, in which they think they did not make any promises.</P>
    <P>They concentrated entirely on the milk producing districts and in those districts they devoted all their energies to criticising the then Government, asking for the removal of the Government from office and an expression of &ldquo;No confidence&rdquo; in its administration by the people voting against the Government. They gave solemn undertakings from every single platform that there would be a substantial increase in the price of milk.  In those areas, the milk producers banded themselves together and tore up the paving stones on the way to vote, voting in the belief and hope that they would get a substantial increase in the price of milk.</P>
    <P>The farmers of North Kerry, of Tipperary, of Limerick, East and West, and of every milk producing district were given to believe that the moment there would be a change of Government steps would be taken to ensure that the price of milk would be substantially increased.  It was not a question of asking for their votes on an undertaking that the best possible would be done for them; they were told that the moment there was a change of Government the price of milk would be substantially increased.  It was pointed out to them that an increase in the price of milk was long overdue and that it should have been given by the then Government.  They were told that the cost of living had gone up and had seriously affected their livelihood. But it had not gone up then to the same extent that it is gone up now.</P>
    <P>While those promises were made to the milk producing farmers, the only interest that the present Government had in them was to capture their votes for the purpose of getting into office. They had no intention of giving them one penny-piece of an increase.  I have here the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 12th March, 1958.  There was a very important meeting held of the Limerick County Executive of the National <Col N="391" /> Farmers' Association.  The banner line that appeared was: &ldquo;Cut in Milk Price Deplored.&rdquo; The report stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government's decision to reduce the price of milk was described as irresponsible by the President of Limerick County Executive of the N.F.A. when he addressed a county executive meeting in Ballingarry, Rathkeale.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Every member of the N.F.A. in County Limerick can vouch for the fact that a solemn undertaking was given before the election that the price of milk would be substantially increased.  They were never told that the price of milk would be reduced.</P>
    <P>Farmers engaged in producing milk must purchase flour and the sack of flour to-day costs those farmers 3/6 per stone more than it did when the inter-Party Government was in office. Despite the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party severely criticised the price of milk prior to the general election the fact remains that, as a result of their getting into office, they have reduced the price of milk.  How then can the farmer be better off to-day?  We are told that he is not suffering any loss. Irrespective of whether he suffers loss or gain, he suffers from the fact that he has been deliberately deceived.  No blame for that can attach to the officers of the Department of Agriculture. The blame must be placed on the responsible political head, the Minister for Agriculture, who dictates and decides the policy to be administered by his Department.</P>
    <P>The President of the Limerick Executive of the National Farmers' Association went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;By reducing the price of milk the Government had neither the foresight not the initiative to market milk products in a proper manner and they have struck a severe and major blow to the agricultural industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Thinking over the manner in which the milk producers have been deceived, I suppose that to-day quite a number of them are repenting, but they can at least see now where honesty lies.  They know they have been deceived. They <Col N="392" /> know they have been fooled.  They know that the Government that pledged themselves to give an increase in the price of milk have failed to do so.  In addition to failing in that respect, they have made the cost of living of the farmers more difficult while, at the same time, reducing his standard of living.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether what I shall describe as the &ldquo;Humbug Milk Costings Commission&rdquo; is still costing the Department anything.  I do not know if it has been would up.  I do not know if any salaries or expenses have been paid to anyone in relation to it.  It is high time that an end was put to this fraud and codology.  It is high time that expenditure on this piece of deceit came to an end.</P>
    <P>When we hear speeches to the effect that the farmer's income is not reduced and that he is not worse off than he was, we must reflect for a moment on the manner in which the Government, having successfully fooled the milk producers in other areas, concentrated on barley growers.  In the barley-growing districts, where large acreages of barley were grown by contract, they devoted all their energies to telling the barley growers that all that was required was a change of Government and that, immediately, instead of 40/- a barrel, they would get 45/- a barrel for barley.  It cannot be that any Minister or any member of the Government Party can deny that because I distinctly heard that being said from every Fianna Fáil platform in my constituency, which is an outstanding constituency for barley growing.</P>
    <P>That type of speech had such a disturbing effect on hard-working decent farmers, whose land was suitable only for barley, that they decided that they had better carefully consider the matter and that it was up to them to vote for whatever Party would give them the most.  They said: &ldquo;we have been told that, if a change of Government takes place, we will get 45/- a barrel for barley.&rdquo;  They believed sincerely that they would get 45/- a barrel.</P>
    <P>What is the result?  Instead of <Col N="393" /> leaving the price at 40/- a barrel, Fianna Fáil reduced it to 37/- a barrel. One can sympathise with milk producers, but one must also express sympathy with the barley growers who believed that they would get a substantial increase in the price of barley and in addition, were given to understand by the same speakers that there would be a greater allocation of barley contracts, that barley contracts would be more freely given and that arrangements would be made towards that end.  Strong emphasis was placed on the fact that 40/- a barrel was not a fair price for barley.  The pious hope was expressed that a change of Government would put 5/- a barrel into the farmer's pocket and a solemn undertaking was given in that regard.  The eyes of the dairy farmer were wiped and the farmer engaged in barley production suffered from the same deceit.</P>
    <P>Having successfully pulled the wool over the eyes of the dairy farmer and the barley producer, they then concentrated on the wheat-growing areas. What they did not say or promise in those areas could not be described in any debate in this House.  Although the Minister may say that he promised nothing and the Taoiseach may say that his Government promised nothing in the way of an increase in the price of wheat or the restoration of the 12/6 per barrel by which wheat was reduced during the term of office of the inter-Party Government, the promises made to the dairy farmer and to the barley producer fade into pale insignificance when compared with the picture that was painted for the wheat producer.</P>
    <P>We were told that anyone who did not grow wheat was not a good Irishman or a good farmer.  We were told that no one could take credit for wheat growing but Fianna Fáil, that they alone were responsible for the birth of the idea of wheat growing and for the development of that idea down through the years.  The farmers were told that it was the intention of the inter-Party Government to kill wheat growing, to deprive those who had made any profit out of wheat growing of that profit, to deny the farming community the benefits <Col N="394" /> to be derived from wheat growing. They were told that the inter-Party Government had devoted all their energies to attacking wheat producers. Fianna Fáil pointed out that, after a bad year, the most savage and the most bitter attack and the greatest possible raid that could be made on the pockets of wheat growers was the reduction of 12/6 per barrel.</P>
    <P>Speeches were made throughout the length and breadth of the country in the saddest possible tone.  Those speeches re-echoed in the hills.  It was even whispered in the silent homesteads at night-time that farmers should be on their guard, that wheat had been reduced already by 12/6 a barrel; that, if there was a change of Government, that 12/6 would be restored and that there would also be a guarantee that there would be no reduction in the price of wheat, that Fianna Fáil would assure the farmers that there would be no question of a reduction, that they could always look forward to the sky being the limit in the matter of wheat production.</P>
    <P>The most simple-minded Fianna Fáil supporter was let loose throughout the country and instructed as to how to speak on wheat, where to speak on wheat, what to say on wheat and what to promise on wheat.  Peaceful country homesteads were invaded after midnight by canvassers.  The people were told that, by returning Fianna Fáil, not only would the wheat cut be restored, but that there would be a great future for wheat growing, that there would be no such thing as restriction of acreage, that the more they grew the more they would be paid, that it was the only possible profitable crop. Some of their canvassers went even further and said that the greater the acreage under wheat, the better, because then there would be sufficient for home requirements and a surplus for export and that, therefore, the harder the wheat producer worked, the better he would be paid and the quicker they put the existing Government out of office, the better.</P>
    <P>What was the result?  The result was the very opposite.  Wheat producers followed the dairy farmers and the barley producers.  The wheat producer <Col N="395" /> was likewise deceived.  The higher they put him, the greater was the fall.  The wheat producer got the greatest fall of all.  He did not get his 12/6 restored.  Instead, he suffered a substantial cut per barrel.  He is in the position to-day that he is like Mohammed's coffin, neither up nor down, but in the air, because nobody knows what the price of wheat will be next harvest.  They may say that it will be reduced by 5/- or 6/- a barrel from the acreage that I see.</P>
    <P>I feel that there is as much land under wheat this year as there has been in the past.  I do not know what the latest statistics are as to the amount of wheat sown, but I feel that the reduction in the price of wheat will be from 12/- to 15/- a barrel.  On top of that, for the first time, they will have to provide their own sacks, which means they will have to pay, approximately, 6d. a barrel extra.  Then we are told the farmer is better off, that he is a more prosperous man and that he does not suffer any loss.  Who believes that kind of codology?</P>
    <P>I am only sorry that for the speeches made here on this Estimate by the Fianna Fáil Party we had not a large audience of milk producers, a large audience of barley producers and wheat producers, because the speeches from Fianna Fáil on this Estimate to-day were the very opposite to the speeches made prior to the last general election.  When I heard Deputy Gibbons speak this evening my mind went back to the Kilkenny by-election when he was concentrating on milk and wheat.  The sting had gone from his remarks to-day; it was a different kind of speech altogether.</P>
    <P>Having successfully fooled those engaged in barley production, Fianna Fáil then said: &ldquo;Is there any other source of income we can attack in order to make a proper raid on the pockets of the farmers?&rdquo;  Having successfully reduced the price of milk, wheat and barley, they proceeded to reduce the price of Grade A pigs by 5/- a cwt., which means that the farmer engaged in pig production is getting less for his pigs.  Many farmers have gone out of pig production.  It <Col N="396" /> is a strange fact, however, that although the farmer gets 5/- a cwt. less for his Grade A pigs, there does not seem to be any such thing in the shops as Grade A, Grade B or Grade C bacon or any other grade of bacon. The price of pigs seemed to drop but the price of bacon sold over the counter seemed to increase.  However, I suppose that is something about which the Minister for Industry and Commerce might like to hear something when his Estimate comes before us for review.</P>
    <P>If I were asked by any member of the Fianna Fáil Party what good the present Government did for farmers since they assumed office, I would be extremely sorry to say I could not point out any one item.  I cannot point to anything they did that increased the farmer's income or profits.  It is true to say that they did agree to export horse flesh under licence.  I think that was announced in the Dáil last October.  I do not know whether or not that was a wise decision but, wise or unwise, it is the decision that was taken.  Personally I would not like to have subscribed to that idea because certain dangers were there and are there.  Even though the announcement was made last October that horse flesh was to be exported I doubt if a single horse was slaughtered; in fact I doubt if any licence was issued.  However, now that the Government has decided to export horse flesh, I trust every precaution will be taken to see that it will be clearly indicated that it is going from this country as horse flesh and that it cannot be taken by any means in the country to which it will be exported as meat for human consumption, because a great deal of harm could be done to our good name on the Continent in that respect.  If, in the event of horse flesh being exported, there are any such instances to which the attention of the Minister is directed, I hope the position will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The only other decision I have known to be taken was in connection with the Landrace pig.  Whether that was a wise decision or not also remains to be seen.  I wonder whether the Minister for Agriculture has taken <Col N="397" /> every care to be guided by the veterinary section of his Department; only time can tell. Whilst the Minister has the right to dictate policy and to make decisions, I trust that in the two instances to which I referred, that of the export of horse flesh and the Landrace pig, a careful examination was made.</P>
    <P>When the inter-Party Government were in office there did not seem to be a single word spoken from the Fianna Fáil Party in praise of any act performed by that Government in relation to agriculture.  Have there been any achievements since?  I am afraid that by 1961 or 1962, as a result of the present Government's agricultural policy, if any, this country will find itself where it was in 1948 and our farmers will find themselves in the position they were in prior to 1948.  If cattle were taken away from this country and if the present favourable prices for cattle did not prevail, I ask this House what would be the circumstances of the Irish farmer to-day?  Is it not the price of cattle that is keeping this country going as it is?</P>
    <P>You have Fianna Fáil speakers who will be bold and brave enough to stand up on a platform, even at this late stage, and say: &ldquo;While the price of wheat, barley and pigs is down, look at the price of cattle.&rdquo;  They had as much to do with the price of cattle which prevails to-day as Brian Boru had.  I feel that if there is any thanks to be given to the cattle industry, it must be given to the terms of the 1948 Trade Agreement.  Since we obtained native government, there is no agreement which brought greater benefits to the country, or bestowed such financial benefits on the farmers, than that agreement.  It linked up the price the Irish farmer gets for his live stock with the price the British farmer gets on the British market.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have shown themselves extraordinary converts to the British market when speaking of present-day cattle prices.  It is not a year ago that many members of the Fianna Fáil Party were again anxious to look with suspicion on the British market and every member of the Party knows that <Col N="398" /> their nightly and morning prayer was that &ldquo;The British market is gone and gone for ever, thanks be to God.&rdquo;  That prayer was echoed day and night by Fianna Fáil speakers.</P>
    <P>A statement was made in the House of Commons to-day dealing with supplies of butter from this country, and it was stated that Ireland, like other countries, would have to curtail the amount of butter to be exported to Great Britain.  So, perhaps, in the long run, their prayer may be granted.</P>
    <P>Remember that all the energies of the Fianna Fáil Party were concentrated on undermining and damaging the British market, and whilst you may seek markets all over the whole world, everyone, with any common sense or intelligence, knows that the British market is at our doorstep. It is the best market and it is the nearest market and it is up to our Ministers to make it the most profitable market. It is the market we should concentrate on.</P>
    <P>When we have any surplus agricultural produce for export, where could we get a better customer than our next-door neighbour?  Apart from that, there is nobody in the country, and particularly nobody on this side of the House, anxious to see that our farmers supply Great Britain with food at a cheap rate.  On the contrary, it is our ambition to get the best possible price for anything we send to England.  That is where the Minister for Agriculture and the Government have the responsibility for negotiating and I hope that if there are any negotiations in the future, in connection with markets with Great Britain, they will come out as successful as the inter-Party Government did from their negotiations in that line, and that the financial benefits for the Irish farmers will be as great.</P>
    <P>The 1948 Trade Agreement brought millions and millions of pounds into the pockets of the Irish farmers, and, but for it, there would be numerous farmers not on the verge of bankruptcy but bankrupt and in the county homes. One seldom hears a single word of praise for the benefits of the 1948 Trade Agreement which I feel was the <Col N="399" /> greatest financial achievement of any Government since this State was founded.  Nobody knows that better than the staunchest Fianna Fáil supporter who sits in this House, but who, through political spite, will not admit it because he is afraid his friends might laugh at him or he might be the recipient of a rebuke from his Party leaders.  In their hearts, however, they know that the greatest achievement was that 1948 Trade Agreement.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the fact that we now have 1,000,000 more acres of arable land than we had.  How did that come about?  It did not happen overnight; it happened through hard work, through planning, and because the Government were prepared to spend money on reclaiming waste land and bogland.  Whilst the Government enjoy the task of hurling criticism, they give no credit at all and take no pride in the fact, as Irishmen should, that, through their own Department of Agriculture, through their own engineers and through their own workers and farmers, we were responsible for converting 1,000,000 acres of useless land into good productive land.</P>
    <P>I said here last year that if we were to take up a newspaper and read in it that any Government on the Continent, or in the world, had introduced a scheme, the net result of which was that that country's wealth had been improved to the extent of adding to it 1,000,000 acres of arable land, we would sit back and say that that must be a wonderful country, that they must have a wonderful Government, that they must be wonderful people to have created 1,000,000 acres of arable land.</P>
    <P>That is really the position so far as we are concerned.  We have that to our credit.  No matter what Minister is in charge, it is an advantage that is there; it is additional wealth; and it is a benefit to the farming community who own it and a national asset of which we can all be proud.  It is an outstanding achievement.  When we consider that we have only 12,000,000 acres of arable land, do we not consider the addition of 1,000,000 acres an outstanding achievement?</P>
    <P>I wonder what is the attitude of the <Col N="400" /> Minister to the future of that scheme, because there seems to be as great a demand for the advantages of the land rehabilitation scheme as there ever was.  Every Deputy knows that every morning when his post arrives it contains a request from some farmer for the advantages of the land rehabilitation scheme.  Could we not have a clear statement on the future of the scheme, so that those who have put their money into the purchase of machinery, bulldozers and so on, for land reclamation will know there is a future for it, because the inter-Party Government gave an undertaking that the scheme would not end while there was a single acre of land to be reclaimed?</P>
    <P>No such undertaking has been given by the Minister.  Every Deputy in rural Ireland knows that the land reclamation scheme is not going ahead with the same speed as in the past. There appear to be deliberate departmental delays&mdash;I do not say on the part of individual officers but on ministerial instructions.  There is a general slowing down of the scheme.  What greater scheme or greater method exists for sinking money in land than reclamation of the land?  The work being done falls far short of the desires of many farmers who still have large tracts of land to be reclaimed.  In the Midlands, where there are a number of joint applications by groups of farmers for grants for drainage of tillage fields or grasslands, there seems to be an extraordinary slowing up of the work and, as may be seen in the Book of Estimates, no substantially increased amount is being provided for it.</P>
    <P>Land reclamation not only provides work but gives the farmer security as he is reclaiming his own land and he can see waste land turned into productive soil.  When he has to pay rates for it, he knows he will be paying for something that will be of use to him and which will give him some financial return.  All farmers to-day regard the land reclamation scheme as of outstanding importance and of great financial benefit, and for the Government even to think of slowing down that scheme is nothing short of national sabotage.  While we have 1,000,000 <Col N="401" /> acres already reclaimed, it is possible to add substantially to that figure and it should be the aim of the Government to provide money for that purpose. It would be money spent more beneficially than that which is allocated even for relief schemes or other employment schemes: it would be money spent wisely and well, if it were spent in making the land fit for increased production.</P>
    <P>The Minister should express an opinion, not his own opinion but the policy of the Government, in relation to land reclamation.  After making a survey in each county as to the number of applications awaiting attention, he should aim at having, in the next four years, substantially larger sums of money set aside for this work.</P>
    <P>Dealing with one other project which the inter-Party Government put into operation with financial advantage to our people, we find that under the limestone scheme over 1,000,000 tons of lime per year were provided for the land at the lowest price in the world.  There is no doubt that scheme was absolutely essential.  It was an outstanding aid to increasing production; it has helped to nourish the land and put into a state of health land which was starved and impoverished.  The inter-Party Government removed a Fianna Fáil tax on superphosphate so that phosphates were available at world prices.  That also added to the nourishment of the land and to the financial return of the farmers.  It helped to provide good feeding for the live stock now being exported and for which Fianna Fáil are inclined to take credit.</P>
    <P>The farm building scheme helped farmers to provide suitable housing for their cattle and substantial grants were made available for haysheds but the Government could do more in that direction.  When one travels through the country, one sees a vast number of small farmers' residences with either a few cocks or a rick of hay at the end of each house, and one wonders why more advantage has not been taken of grants that are available for the erection of haybarns.</P>
    <P>The Department, I feel, should survey the farms requiring haybarns in various areas and, where the circumstances <Col N="402" /> of the small farmers are such that they could not contribute a reasonable share towards the work or where the title deeds are not in order, debarring them from an agricultural credit loan for that purpose, some steps should be taken to make finances available for the erection of haybarns. I am sure there are records in the offices of the Agricultural Credit Corporation of numerous applications for loans for haybarns which were rejected because the titles were not in order. In many cases, farmers dislike consulting solicitors on questions of title because they fear being involved in legal costs and prefer to leave their lands in the names of their grandfathers or great-grandfathers rather than have the titles brought up to date.  In some cases, it costs a certain amount of money, but I think the Minister should consult with his colleagues in the Government and see what could be done to have farmers' titles put in order, so that, particularly in the case of the poorer farmers, they may be able to avail of credit facilities that exist, particularly in connection with the erection of haybarns.</P>
    <P>I know at least two dozen farmers in my constituency who could not get haybarn loans because of defective titles.  If they were to put their titles in order, it would involve them in legal expenses which they were not prepared to meet.  Some steps should be taken to have these titles put in order for small farmers who find it impossible to meet the legal costs of having it done themselves.</P>
    <P>Another solemn guarantee given by the inter-Party Government was that providing the farmer with minimum prices for feeding barley for pigs.  Soil testing facilities were made available and 100,000 samples were tested per year.  Last, but not least, they put into operation the parish plan to provide advisory services for farmers on their own farms.</P>
    <P>I believe it was Deputy Dillon who made reference to the extraordinary number of highly qualified professional people, particularly in agriculture, who were obliged to leave this country because they could not get suitable positions here.  They went to Canada, <Col N="403" /> Rhodesia, America and Great Britain. Is it not possible to utilise the services of such highly qualified people here in their own country?  Is it not common knowledge to the Minister for Agriculture that every time a vacancy occurs for an agricultural instructor under any committee of agriculture there are at least from six to ten applicants for it?  Again, we must bear in mind the expense to which the parents of such qualified people have gone to provide their sons with a high standard of education, sufficient to obtain their degrees in agriculture.</P>
    <P>I, and I am sure every Deputy in the House, would like to hear from the Minister what are his plans for the advancement of the parish plan.  Is it not a fact that there are groups of parishes calling out for parish agents? Is it not a fact that these appeals not alone receive the blind eye but also the deaf ear of the Department?  Is it not a fact, which can be established from the records, that a very big number of people qualified in agriculture have emigrated during the past year and a half, and particularly during the past six months?  Is it not also a fact that a number of veterinary officers and surgeons have left the service of the Department of Agriculture?</P>
    <P>Is it not further a fact that the question of all-round general improvement in both pay and conditions for veterinary surgeons has not been given the active attention that it should have received from the Minister, with the result that since last January a number of veterinary surgeons employed by the Department of Agriculture have emigrated?  They are a loss to the community, to the profession and to the farmers who are anxious to avail of the services of such professional people.  I do not say that they should not be allowed to go if they want, but I do say there is work for them here. Their terms of employment should be sufficiently attractive to keep them here.</P>
    <P>I am sure most Deputies have a knowledge of the working of the parish plan and of the great benefits it has brought.  The areas where parish agents are available cannot be compared <Col N="404" /> with areas in which no parish agent is available.  I know that from my own experience in my constituency where the parish plan has been in operation in the districts of Arras, Greycullen and Killasher.  A parish agent is there at the beck and call of every farmer, big and small.  His advice is free and he is anxious to help and advise farmers on soil testing and crop rotation.  A parish agent is of tremendous benefit to any rural district.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why steps have not been taken during the past 12 months to make a greater drive for the establishment of parish agents in areas which have not got them.  The agents are available and the farming community are crying out for them. Through lack of foresight, through lack of policy, through lack of sincerity and through lack of progressive thought the Government have failed to realise the importance of the parish plan, and of the manner in which the farming community, rich and poor alike, are crying out for the services of parish agents.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this matter seriously.  He should give a statement of policy on it, not for the House alone, but for the country.  The farming community cannot understand why some areas enjoy those services and others do not.  I trust that some steps will be taken to see that more serious thought is given to the parish plan.  I hope that more serious thought will be given to the parents who have spent large sums of money on the education of their children in order that they might secure degrees in agriculture.</P>
    <P>I remember that in 1948 or 1949 Deputy Dillon, when Minister for Agriculture, advised parents to concentrate on agricultural education for their children.  They were told of the future that lay in agriculture for them. Now we see that most of those qualified in agriculture have only the emigrant ship to take them to the greater Ireland beyond the Atlantic, and across the Irish Sea to seek a livelihood outside their own country. I hope that state of affairs will be rectified and that some effort will be made to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> Reference has been made to the question of the all-Irish wheat loaf.  I have a feeling that the 100 per cent.  Irish loaf is coming and I agree with it.  I think that the Minister for Agriculture should consult with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to see that the millers or whoever is responsible, will adjust their machinery so that it will be suitable for the production of the all Irish loaf.  It is all very fine for the millers to say that they cannot do this, they cannot do that and they cannot do the other.  I feel that sooner or later the Irish loaf is coming.  If we are to benefit by the coming of the 100 per cent. Irish loaf, a group of citizens like the millers should not be allowed to hinder it.  If there are to be adjustments made in machinery to meet their requirements, the Minister for Industry and Commerce should take steps to convey that to the millers.</P>
    <P>The importance of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme could not possibly be over-emphasised.  That scheme has been in existence in Great Britain for about 25 years.  I have a feeling that were it not for the inter-Party Government commencing it, it would not be started in this country yet.  The co-operation of the farmers was asked in respect of that scheme. During the past few months statements were made by certain farmers' organisations in an effort to make known their grievances with regard to milk prices.  Appeals were made to farmers not to co-operate with the scheme.</P>
    <P>I think that was bad advice, wrong advice and unreasonable advice.  I think that the associations anxious to ventilate their grievance by such tactics were not performing a national duty.  I hope that the farming community who may have a grievance will ventilate their grievance other than by refusing to co-operate in that very important scheme because at the moment there can be no scheme of greater or more vital importance.  We are told that by 1961 only T.B. free cattle are to be admitted into Great Britain. We must now realise that we are on the doorstep, so to speak, of 1961 and whilst it has taken almost 25 years to have complete free herds in Great <Col N="406" /> Britain our scheme is only in operation for the past four or four-and-a-half years.</P>
    <P>I think wonderful headway has been made in that respect.  I feel that was due to the drive, foresight and initiative of Deputy Dillon, who as Minister for Agriculture, stressed the importance of co-operation by the farmers in the scheme.  I feel that the Minister for Agriculture, in view of the importance of the scheme, should be clear with the people on policy in that regard.  I have a feeling that the farming community at large do not realise the seriousness of the position. The seriousness of the position would be seen at once if their live stock were not allowed into Great Britain.  They would then realise the serious financial loss not only to the country but to themselves.  It is in their own interests to take full advantage of the scheme.  It is in the interests of the community in general that the Minister for Agriculture should be more generous with regard to the administration of that scheme.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that where compensation has been paid, valuations are being sent into the Department with which the farmer may not fully agree.  I think it is the policy of the Department to try to keep the demands on State funds as low as possible under that scheme.  Full compensation is not being paid in all cases and I would ask the Minister to take steps to see that the officers of the Department will not be niggardly in administering the scheme.  If there is any question of doubt as to the value of the reactors, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the farmers because if we want the farmers to co-operate, it should be made known to them that they will not be at any financial loss by co-operating.  Let them know that the hand of friendship will be stretched forth from the Department of Agriculture and that they will not be at any financial loss.</P>
    <P>My opinion as to why a number of farmers are not fully availing of the scheme is that the farmers feel that full compensation is not being paid or will not be paid.  I would ask the Department and the Minister to issue <Col N="407" /> an instruction to the officers of the Department dealing with that problem to be generous with the farmers.  If they are generous, I feel that the farmers will throw their weight behind the scheme and co-operate in every possible way with the Government.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Department deals with grants for cow-houses under that scheme is wrong.  I would now make an appeal&mdash;a very strong appeal&mdash;that that grant should be increased as an encouragement to farmers to come forward and to avail of the scheme.  I think that every possible encouragement that can be given to our farmers to co-operate should be given&mdash;even to the extent of formulating a new scheme of grants to assist them in every way, provided they comply with the full terms of the scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the water supply scheme, that has been in operation for a number of years past.  Again, like the land rehabilitation scheme, it is generally felt throughout the country that the Government are deliberately slowing down the water supply scheme.  Everybody knows quite well that there is nothing more important or more necessary to the farming community than to have water, if possible, in the house.  Rural electrification is nearing completion in most counties, and where we have that state of affairs it is quite simple and easy for farmers to be provided with electric pumps.</P>
    <P>I have known of a number of farmers who made applications to the Department for grants and long periods have elapsed during the consideration of such applications.  I have a feeling that steps are being taken by the Department to prolong such applications so as to discourage farmers from availing of the scheme.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk, particularly by Deputy N. Egan, in regard to credit facilities.  Deputy N. Egan referred to the fact that farmers, small farmers particularly, ought to be given credit facilities in order to increase production.  Last week, Deputy Dillon pointed out that there were funds available for farmers who <Col N="408" /> required loans and that money would be available for any credit-worthy farmer.  Money is available for the credit-worthy farmer but it is the non-credit-worthy farmer we are worrying about.  That is why I cannot subscribe to the idea that ample money is available for the farming community in order to increase production.  I have a feeling that the people who really deserve it do not get it.  Any bank or any financial institution will advance money to an extensive farmer who has full title deeds and good and ample security, but the small farmer&mdash;the 20 to 30 acre farmer, or less&mdash;who requires money to purchase live stock, to carry out farm improvements or for the many other calls on his purse such as the breaking-up of additional land, payment for seeds or the other little incidentals that crop up from time to time during the year on a small farm is very seriously handicapped through lack of credit.</P>
    <P>In the past, the Agricultural Credit Corporation served a fairly good purpose. In 30 years, the Agricultural Credit Corporation issued a total of 47,000 loans of which less than 45,000 were for loans of £500 or under.  The number of loans issued for sums between £500 and £1,000 was 1,756, while bigger loans, over £1,000, totalled 555.  The small farmer is handicapped for lack of capital.  The question arises because it is mainly the small, poor farmer who has not proper title or who has not taken out proper administration in respect of his father's or his grandfather's estate, who is involved; there is some legal hitch that cannot easily be got over. The Agricultural Credit Corporation will not waste much time with a person who has a defective title.</P>
    <P>Some steps ought to be taken to provide capital for small farmers because, in the long run, it is the small farmer who does the work and who produces anything.  I know quite well that merchants find farmers to be honest to a high degree and that merchants with bad debts are few and far between.  On the whole, the banks do not seem to be as liberal in giving out money to a small farmer as to a <Col N="409" /> farmer with very good security.  As Deputy Egan rightly pointed out, no farmer likes to sign for his neighbour because, as surely as he signs for two or three good neighbours, he will sign for the fellow who is a bad debt and that will sour him against signing for anybody else.  I am not saying that any farmer would ask a person to sign as guarantor with the full intention of deliberately letting him down, but it often arises that a farmer is never in circumstances to repay and therefore the person who signs must pay.</P>
    <P>In recent years, people have got very careful not to put their names either on bank bills or on guarantee notes for the repayment of loans for their neighbours. I suppose they cannot be blamed for that attitude, but at the same time we cannot say there is a high degree of dishonesty.  No farmer likes to be put to the humiliation of having to ask his neighbour to put his name to a bank bill for £100, £150 or £200. First and foremost, they may not all refuse, but it is not a nice thing to do. A man's holding or property ought to be sufficient guarantee, without having to knot up his neighbour in his personal and financial affairs.</P>
    <P>Another thing that is disliked about the Agricultural Credit Corporation is the fact that civic guards are notified to check up on the ability of an applicant to pay.  That is a wrong practice and it ought to be stopped.  I am not saying that the guards do not treat the matter as confidential.  Nevertheless, many people would like to see their affairs treated in strict confidence and do not like even the members of the Garda Síochána to know they are making applications for loans or have them inquiring about them from their neighbours.  Generally speaking, I think it is wrong and some steps should be taken to simplify the method of providing loans for small farmers.</P>
    <P>The Government have made a bad job of agriculture.  The farming community are the poorer for the past 15 months.  They have the prospects of a poor harvest and poor prices.  If cattle prices were not as they are at present, I venture to say that the farming community would be in a very serious plight.  The Government hold <Col N="410" /> out no future for the farmer.  No definite, long-term line of policy is laid out before them.  A member of the Government said last week-end that farmers are expected to produce more, to work harder&mdash;and they must be patriotic and be prepared to take less for it.  If that is evidence of a sound agricultural policy, I am sorry for the country.  I feel it is the type of policy one would expect to see coming from Grangegorman, or some place like that, but not from a sane, sound Government who are supposed to have the interests of the community at heart.</P>
    <P>The farmers were always and are still prepared to work but they are given no lead.  They cannot plan from year to year because they do not know what lies ahead.  There is a wave of uncertainty which has always surrounded the Fianna Fáil Governments. There is a lack of guarantees, a lack of policy and a lack of drive.  There is the ever-present uncertainty and fear of severe drops in prices and of a general all-round reduction in the amount to be expended for the benefit of the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>The farmers are disappointed with the activities of the past 15 months and are, in fact, completely disillusioned. The Minister for Agriculture must face the problem more courageously and get a long-term policy, which he does not seem to have or to be thinking about.  He must extend a greater hand of friendship and co-operation to the National Farmers' Association and be prepared to take advice when it is tendered by such people.  Unless he is prepared to act on that advice and assist in finding profitable markets for our agricultural exports&mdash;unless some firm, broad agricultural policy is formulated&mdash;I have a feeling that our farmers will again fall into despair and that, by the time 1960 comes, the farmers will find themselves in the condition in which they were in 1946 and 1947.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that, after listening to the speech of the last speaker, it is rather difficult to approach this debate in anything like an objective manner.  The reason for that is that one would think, listening to Deputy O.J. Flanagan, that no <Col N="411" /> difficulty ever existed for the farmers &mdash;I am speaking now as a representative of the dairy farmers&mdash;during the reign of the inter-Party Government. We do not require very long memories to remember what happened in the last five or six months of their term of office.</P>
      <P>In regard to the land reclamation project, we found they were not honest enough to say they had no more money to give the people but they quietly issued instructions to the inspectors not to pass any more schemes for the moment.  That was one instance of the manner in which they generally sought to divert blame from the proper place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a word of truth in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand Deputy Flanagan's flight of imagination in regard to wheat and barley. Certainly it is a flight of imagination when he says that the Fianna Fáil Party made promises during the last election that they would increase the price of milk.  They certainly did not. I have no hesitation in standing over that statement.  If we look at the record of the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to milk prices over the years, we shall realise that it can stand comparison with anything Fine Gael ever did for the dairy farmers in that respect.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to discuss this Estimate from a political point of view, as Deputy Flanagan did.  I believe that every Minister for Agriculture, by reason of the magnitude of his job and the diversity of the industry, was faced with very difficult problems, internally and externally.  I am quite well aware that during Deputy Dillon's tenure of office he had his own headaches and that the farmers were pretty dissatisfied with some of the things he had to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was the instance when Deputy Dillon, as Minister, went down to a meeting of the County Committee of Agriculture in Limerick of the gallery having to be cleared by Gardaí. When he was coming to Cork we had to take steps to see that he, as Minister, would not be interfered with by the irate farmers of Cork.  If the <Col N="412" /> present Minister for Agriculture comes under fire, so did his predecessor. Perhaps it is that we farmers are hard to please.  In any case, there is no use in the Opposition trying to give the impression that while they were in office every farmer was happy.  He certainly was not.  This play acting in which the Opposition are indulging, as far as the present difficult position facing the Minister is concerned, is getting them nowhere.  The farmers are intelligent enough to realise that the difficulties confronting the Minister were not of his making.</P>
    <P>In passing, may I say, since Deputy Flanagan mentioned the much-vaunted 1948 Agreement, that he should have said that the difficulties facing the Minister now in regard to the surplus of butter and eggs should have been considered at the time of that unfortunate agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="BattDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Dairy farmers find themselves under a certain disability in regard to certain aspects of our present difficulties.  I am referring now particularly to the position in <Col N="413" /> regard to the implementation of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme, behind which we must all stand.  The dairy farmer finds himself in the position that as milk and butter must be subsidised a reduction has to take place in the price of milk.  I shall not say that that will put the farmers in any better position.  I shall be quite honest and say they do not like it. I do not like it, but nobody has suggested how it can be avoided.  We have not heard it suggested that to provide all this money to do all the things suggested, we should impose extra taxation.  That would be unpopular. That will not be suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us in all honesty approach the thing objectively and say we think the Minister is doing his best in the circumstances and that we wish him well.</P>
      <P>Mention has also been made of the wheat position.  It has been said that over-production in wheat has taken place owing to two or three factors which could not be foreseen two or three years ago.  In my opinion, the principal one is that, owing to the scarcity of cattle people are finding it difficult to put in grazing cattle and are turning more land to tillage.  There is also the fact that the turning of that land to tillage and the growing of a successful wheat crop is made possible by combine drilling and more up-to-date sowing methods.  You can now get a wheat crop grown where it would not have been possible some years ago.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about what should be done with our wheat surplus. It has been suggested that it should be used as feeding.  The use of whole wheat as feed in my experience is not as simple as it sounds.  It can be pretty dangerous.  I think it is improbable that we shall ever arrive at the position where we can export wheat.  Some system of control must be exercised in the growing of wheat by people growing it outside the normal form of rotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very interested in this committee for the marketing of our produce. <Col N="414" /> I feel very disappointed that, after so many years of native government, no real effort was made until now to do something along those lines. We should have taken such steps many years ago.  We are now coming rather late in the field.  However, better late than never.</P>
    <P>I have heard a number of people who do not engage in farming contribute to the debate.  Perhaps they see more and know more about it than those who are engaged in farming and have not time to look around.  But I heard some very wise suggestions made, particularly by Deputy Booth, in regard to the marketing and packaging of our products in England. There can be no doubt that effective wrapping and packaging now play a very important part in the sale of any commodity, and particularly so in the case of foodstuffs.  I should like the Minister to see that every effort is made to have our produce presented in an acceptable manner, so that it will look its best and be easily handled.</P>
    <P>The problem of credit for farming has been very difficult and unsatisfactory, from the point of view of the farmer who needs credit.  It was very rightly said this evening by Deputy Egan that it is strange that anyone can go into a garage, sign a couple of forms and come home with £500 or £600 worth of implements; and yet, without a lot of trouble and guarantors, he cannot get money to purchase cattle.  That position should not exist.  I realise it is not easy to get around all the difficulties which the lending of money presents. I fear that there is a feeling of hesitancy in banking circles to advance money to farmers.  It is hard to understand why that should be so, having regard to the importance of the industry to the country.  Our experience generally is that farmers find it difficult to get money.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the difficulty should exist in banking circles.  I suppose they have an answer to it, but surely the land cannot run away and that should be sufficient security on which to give credit.  It is a very serious matter for many farmers, especially small farmers who require money for the purchase of stock of one <Col N="415" /> kind or another.  Deputy Moher mentioned those problems and with what he said I entirely agree.  The income of the small farmer, as proved by the farm survey, is very little as compared with the incomes in industry and elsewhere, and the result is an inducement to youngsters to leave the land and go into the towns and cities.  That is an unfortunate state of affairs, undoubtedly.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of talk about the bacon industry and pigs and about the reduction of 5/- which the Minister finds he is forced to apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What forced him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The real problem that faces the pig producer, as I see it, is not so much the amount of the grade A reduction, but the difference between grade A and grade B.  That is the real sting.  I suggest to the Minister that some method should be found whereby that gap could be closed to something like 10/- or 15/-, rather than 50/- or £3.  There is no reason why the bacon industry should get away with purchasing a pig for practically half the price of one that is almost just as good.  There appears to be no difference between them.  I have seen them and it is my experience that the difference in the gauges appears to be so small that it is hardly visible to the naked eye.  At the same time, it means a loss of perhaps £3 or £4 per animal to the unfortunate producer.  If the Minister could do something there, it would more than offset the reduction of 5/- in grade A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real problem in making any profit in the production of bacon pigs is the cost of what is fed to them.  My experience has been that some close check should be kept on what is put on the market as pig ration.  No real check is kept on what goes into it.  A considerable tightening up of the regulations in regard to the making up of those rations generally is needed. Under the regulations, there is provision for the admixture of a certain amount of lime and grass meal.  My fear is that, once the door is opened at all, you do not know what you will <Col N="416" /> get.  I have a feeling that some of these admixtures put in for the health of the pig are rather overdone and probably do not help, in the ultimate result, in the fattening of the pig.</P>
    <P>The poultry industry also seems to have come under fire.  That industry seems to have gone the way of the White Turkey.  Even the introduction of the &ldquo;broilers&rdquo; and the <i>poulets poussins</i> they use on the Continent, is like a flash in the pan also.  At least, the feeling in the industry is that all there is in it is a year or two and that is preventing people from going into poultry production in a very big way. I suggest that the Minister and the Department should make inquiries along those lines, as I am aware of many people anxious to get into this aspect of the industry, but they are afraid, from what they have heard, that the trade&mdash;to Italy or France&mdash; might close down in a year or two. The Department might make inquiries along those lines and enable people to know where they stand if they get seriously into this industry.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of talk to-day about farmers having motor cars.  I never heard anyone, from this side of the House, seriously finding fault with the fact that farmers have motor cars.</P>

      <P>I am rather worried about this undue mechanisation of agriculture.  I am worried about it, as I fear that a lot of it is on the &ldquo;never, never.&rdquo;  If a day of reckoning comes, it will be just too bad for the unfortunate people who have been encouraged by high-pressure salesmanship to invest a lot of money which they had not got.  It meant they had to borrow under those terms so as to get themselves mechanised.  As Deputy Moher very rightly said, they find now <Col N="417" /> that they have to go on hire to the neighbours, to try to pay the instalments. I am aware, of course, that a certain amount of mechanisation is a great help to any farmer, but anything can be overdone and I am greatly afraid that encouragement has <Col N="418" /> been given in that respect to overdo it.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 21st May, 1958.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of the food items comprising the consumer price index (a) the Dublin average price per <Col N="286" /> unit at mid-February, 1957 and mid-February, 1958, (b) the average change per unit in terms of money and (c) the corresponding figures in respect of national average prices.</P>

      <P>The following table shows (i) the average retail prices in the Dublin-Dún Laoghaire conurbation and (ii) the national average retail prices of the main items of food in mid-February, 1957 and mid-February, 1958, and the changes between these two dates.  Differences in quality between Dublin and Dún Laoghaire and the State as a whole may exist in respect of a number of the articles specified in the table and this should be borne in mind in making comparisons between prices for different areas.</P>
      <P Just="Center">(i)  Average retail prices of food in Dublin and Dún Laogharie and (ii) National average retail prices at mid-February, 1957 and mid-February, 1958 and the changes between these two dates.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state separately in respect of each agricultural wages area (a)  the present adult minimum rate and the date from which it operated, and (b) the estimated rate of wages required, at each subsequent quarter-year publication of the consumer price index, to restore the minimum agricultural wages in each case to the value obtaining at the end of May, 1956.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The present minimum wage rates for agricultural workers are prescribed under the Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) Order, 1956, which came into operation on the 28th May, 1956.  The minimum weekly wage rates for males aged 19 years or over for a &ldquo;week in which 50 hours' work is done (exclusive of work on Sunday or weekly half-holiday)&rdquo; prescribed in this Order are £5 6s. 0d. in Group A areas; £5 0s. 0d. in Group B areas; and £4 15s. 0d. in Group C areas.  Minimum rates of wages have not been prescribed for female agricultural workers employed outside of Counties Dublin and Kildare; the minimum weekly wage rates for females aged 19 years or over for a &ldquo;week in which 48 hours' work is done (exclusive of work on Sunday or weekly half-holiday)&rdquo;are £3 8s. 0d. in Dublin County Borough and County and £3 0s. 0d. in County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  The following table shows the consumer price index from mid-May, <Col N="289" /> 1956, to mid-February, 1958, and the five rates specified at (a)  above adjusted (to the nearest penny) in proportion to the changes in the consumer <Col N="290" /> price index since mid-May, 1956 (the nearest date to 28th May, 1956, for which the index was computed).</P>

      <P>I find that regulations were made from time to time by the former Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction under the Corn Production Act, 1917, regarding the constitution and proceedings of the Agricultural Wages Board which was set up under that Act but which ceased to function in 1921.  These are somewhat lengthy but the latest version of the general regulations made by the Department is contained in Order No. 121 dated the 23rd January, 1920, of the Statutory Rules and Orders, 1920, which the Deputy will find in the Library.</P>
