      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that knitting factories in Skibbereen and Kanturk have closed; <Col N="1438" /> whether he has any proposals for the establishment of another industry to provide employment for the displaced workers; whether proposals for any industry in West Cork were rejected on the grounds that no local capital was available; and whether he has any proposals for the establishment of new industries in West Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen Press reports about the intended transfer of operations from knitting factories in Skibbereen and Kanturk to Mullingar.</P>
      <P>No proposals for an industry in West Cork would be rejected solely on the grounds that local capital was not available.  I understood that, in a couple of instances, proposals for new industries in West Cork, for which Foras Tionscal had approved grants under the Undeveloped Areas Act, have not as yet proceeded because of difficulties experienced by the promoters in completing their own arrangements.</P>
      <P>With regard to the establishment of new industries in West Cork, the promoters of any sound proposal can count on receiving substantial assistance. I am aware of certain cases in which private interests are examining the possibility of establishing industries in the areas and their detailed proposals are awaited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the main headings which have caused expenditure for (a) Central Fund and (b) Supply Services to be £5.8 million less than last year for the months of April and May.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is presumably referring to the Exchequer statement publishing in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on 3rd June, 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction is due in the main to revised arrangements made in January of this year for the financing of the Paymaster-General's supply account. Prior to January last, there was a monthly settlement between the Exchequer and this accounts, i.e., in addition to making Exchequer issues day by day to cover the payable orders presented for encashment a balancing issue was made on the last day of each <Col N="1441" /> month to cover orders issued but not yet presented for payment.  These balancing issues are now made on a quarterly instead of a monthly basis. The change was made to minimise in the need for temporary borrowing in the course of a quarter and accounts for £4.3 million of the £5.8 million referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Of the balance of £1.5 million various supply services accounts for £0.2 million while Central Fund Services account for £1.3 million as follows:</P>

So far as the position can be foreseen at the moment, that business will include the completion of the Estimates and all stages of the following Bills which are at present before the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Transport Bill, 1958.</P>
      <P>Administration of Estates Bill, 1957.</P>
      <P>Savings Banks Bill, 1958.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The Appropriation Bill.</P>
      <P>Then there are all stages of others Bills which have yet to be circulated and which include:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Great Northern Railway Bill.</P>
      <P>Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Bill.</P>
      <P>Housing (Amendment) Bill.</P>

      <P>An International Finance Corporation Bill and the</P>
      <P>Turf Developement Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will, perhaps, be, in addition, one or two motions.  However, so far <Col N="1444" /> as the position can now be stated, that will represent the business for the remainder of the session.</P>

      <P>The pleasing feature of this debate is the number of Deputies who have taken part in it.  They seemed to express their opinions as individuals and as representing the views of various communities.  They have, perhaps, given some very useful information in connection with primary, secondary, vocational and university <Col N="1445" /> education.  It is only right that a deep interest should be taken in this Vote because education is the foundation of all progress in the State.  It is necessary for the benefit of our agriculturists, industrialists, workers of all kinds, and those who enter the professions. While the views expressed may not receive any due consideration from the Minister or the high officials of his Department, nevertheless it is well to have them on record and, as I have said, it is gratifying to note that Deputies on all sides of the House are interested in education.</P>
      <P>I always notice at election times that the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; is never mentioned&mdash;evidently because it must not be a very popular subject with the community at large.  That may have been so in the past, but I think that at present all sections of our people are deeply interested in educational advancement, because they realise the necessity for it.</P>
      <P>In his opening statement, the Minister expressed his views very clearly and fully.  One of the most pleasing changes in educational policy which he announced was that in relation to the removal of the marriage ban.  Agitation for the removal of that ban has been going on for the past 24 years, since it was first imposed, I think, in the year 1934.</P>
      <P>When we consider this Estimate, we must think of the child, the home of the child, the teacher, the school programme, the school building, its environment and also, perhaps, our managerial system.  When a child enters school at four, five or six years of age, he or she enters, as it were, a new world and I am sure the child is full of hope and wonder.  A great deal will depend on its home environment up to that stage and afterwards during the whole course of its childhood.  A good teacher will always deal with a child from the knowledge he or she has of the home life of the child.  In order to deal with that aspect of education, a teacher must surely have the necessary training qualifications.  It is well, therefore, that at least one step is being taken to ensure that, within a certain period, we shall, I hope, have qualified teachers in all our schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1446" /> We have numerous unqualified teachers&mdash;teachers who never entered a training college&mdash;who are doing very well in educating children.  Qualified teachers are very slow to accept positions in remote country schools and, in that case, the Department must sanction the appointment of unqualified teachers.  In these remote districts, the only education children can get is that which is available to them in the primary school.  They are far away from secondary schools and very vocational schools.  It is, perhaps, very seldom that the parents can afford to send them to a boarding school, a vocational school or a university.</P>
    <P>With further reference to the training of teachers, I think that, along with the percentage who enter the training college from preparatory schools, it would be well if the Minister would consider allowing university graduates to enter the training college for at least a course of one years, so that such students could learn all about the practice of teaching, psychology and teaching methods.  In that way in addition to those teachers who are trained from the leaving certificate and from the preparatory colleges&mdash;and now, with the return of married women teachers &mdash;we would eventually have a sufficient number of qualified teachers for all our schools.  That would also help to ensure that there would be no further understaffing of schools.</P>
    <P>People should realise and understand clearly that where a teacher has to deal with 50, 60 or 70 children in one class the teacher cannot impart the individual education that is required and necessary.  In schools, both two-teacher and three-teacher schools, there is a teacher in charge of a number of groups of classes.  One teacher may be in charge of infants, first, second, third and fourth classes and another teacher in charge of fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth classes.  In cases such as that it is impossible to deal with the children in the manner necessary for their educational advancement.  The Minister, therefore, should consider the lowering of the average required for the appointment of a first assistant, a second assistant and so on in proportion <Col N="1447" /> to the number of children in a school.  In that way there would be sufficient staffing of schools and it would lead to an advancement in general education standards.  It would also assist the revival of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>It is well that the Minister has introduced the scheme by which candidates for the teaching profession, enterants to the training colleges, are to be interviewed before they are called to training.  He who aspires to be a teacher should really have a vocation for it.  A vocation for teaching is just as necessary as a vocation in a candidate for the priesthood, for nursing, and in fact for any occupation at all. An individual must have a certain desire to undertake the work; it can happen that even a genius may be a very bad teacher.  There are certain tests which indicate whether a person is capable of dealing with children; a great part depends on the character and personality of the teachers.  I am sure that all the officials of the Department, inspectors and others, know that some very highly qualified men and women have proven to be hopeless as teachers.</P>
    <P>There is a certain method by which a person can deal with children and control them without being harsh. There is a certain way in which knowledge can best the imparted.  To achieve that in the proper way is one of the most difficult tasks of all.  One must impart knowledge in a way that a child will be able to follow what is taught.  One must be able to deal with children in such a way that they will be anxious to learn because of the love and respect which they have for their teacher.  Therefore, it is most necessary to have the right type of teacher.  No boy or girl should enter the teaching profession unless he or she a vocation for the work. Having entered the profession with that vocation, and having gained the necessary experience, a teacher can lead children to study the required subjects without having recourse to any harsh method of punishment.</P>
    <P>Though I admit that Deputy Dr. <Col N="1448" /> Browne's contribution to this debate was interesting, I should not like to have him as Minister for Education because he has certain views with which experienced teachers would not agree. We all know that in the olden days teachers were supposed to be very harsh on children.  I do not know how true that is but my own experience, during my period in school, was that I cried when two of my teachers passed away in middle age.  I am sure if teachers could inculate real love and respect in the minds of children they would have no difficulty in controlling them at school.  Of course, the conduct of the child at school depends a great deal on his conduct at home.</P>
    <P>If parents control their children properly at home, if they see to it that they do their homework&mdash;not difficult homework&mdash;if they see to it that the children attend to their duties and are respectful and obedient to them, then I am sure the children will prove good pupils in the schools and will give no trouble.  That has been the experience of many teachers.  Some children are difficult to manage but teachers may be aware of the home lives of those children and will understand their weakness and make provision for them.</P>
    <P>The present school programme was established as the result of a programme conference in 1923 or 1924. There have since been some revisions and I think the time has come to carry out a further revision.  However, in that regard it might be better to wait until we see the results of the inquiry into the teaching of Irish in the schools and how best it may be promoted after leaving school.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies and other people have the idea that instruction in agriculture should be part of the primary school programme.  There is no time for it nor is there any opportunity of carrying it out in a particular way.  In the early days of this century there was a certain amount of theoretical agriculture taught.  There was a book by Professor Baldwin and it was certainly a most useful instrument for imparting agricultural knowledge in the schools.  In schools where the teachers <Col N="1449" /> had land of their own, or had access to the lands of other people, some practical work was done in agriculture which was very useful.  However, nowadays my belief is that agricultural education should form part of vocational education, but if there could be an agricultural bias given in the primary schools by the issue of suitable school books it would be all to the good.</P>
    <P>The whole question of school books is a rather troublesome one.  They have been changed from year to year though I believe there has been some alteration in that respect recently.  School books are so dear that it is very difficult for parents in poor areas to purchase them for their children year after year.  In fact there are many of these books dealing not only with Irish and English but also with history and geography which are not in any way suitable for their purposes. The teacher's organisation down through the years has asked that good types of school books should be issued.</P>
    <P>In fact, much of the trouble about reviving Irish is caused by the lack of suitable books.  Translations published by <i>An Gúm</i> were destroyed recently.  I do not know why.  There are periodicals published in Irish, some of which are not of much use.  There is one periodical called <i>Amárach</i> which is about the best Irish periodical that we have seen for some time.  It might be no harm if the Minister would consider helping it in some way by a grant as, otherwise, there is a danger that it may have to cease production.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with the school programme, I may as well refer to the burning question of the revival of Irish. I do not think that expression should be used because the Irish language has never died in this country, even after its suppression for over 700 years.  Some fanatics think that Irish should be revived within a few years.  If the effort to destroy the language took 700 years, very good work will be done if in 100 years the language will be revived and spoken by the majority of the people.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that Irish as a compulsory school subject has retarded <Col N="1450" /> the educational advancement of pupils.  In the real sense, it is not a compulsory subject any more than English, arithmetic or other subjects in the school curriculum.  It is understood by those who know that where a teacher is not competent to teach subjects through the medium of Irish, he is not compelled to do so.  Subjects are not taught through the medium of Irish unless the teacher is qualified to do it and the children are capable of assimilating the knowledge so imparted. There is a difference of opinion about teaching infants through the medium of Irish only.  That is one of the matters that should be, and will be considered, of course, by the commission of inquiry that the Minister is about to set up.</P>
    <P>So far as my knowledge goes, and I had 43 years' experience as a teacher, I do not think that the teaching of Irish in the schools in any way hindered the educational advancement of the children.  On the contrary, it was a means by which their mental development was promoted.  Even though a second language is not taught in the primary schools of other countries, with the possible exception of Wales, it would be very foolish, very unwise, to change the policy adopted here.  It is only in the schools that any attempt is being made to revive the language.  Until the language is spoken at home by parents and members of families, to whatever extent they know the language, the revival will be slow and perhaps will never be achieved.</P>
    <P>People ask why should we teach Irish to children when they have to emigrate.  We do not educate our children for emigration.  Certainly we should keep in mind that, whether our people stay at home or emigrate, they should receive the best education possible so that they will be good citizens of this State or good citizens of the country of their adoption.  In England, and perhaps also in the United States of America, wherever the Irish congregate, Irish classes are promoted. When I was in London many years ago Irish classes were carried on there. Were the Government to prohibit the teaching of Irish, it might be one way <Col N="1451" /> of hastening the revival of Irish.  It was during the English réigime, when the British had control of education in this country, that the people were enthusiastic about the study of Irish. Years before this State was set up, teachers voluntarily attended Irish colleges and did everything in their power to acquire a knowledge of the language so that they could teach it in their schools.</P>
    <P>At one period in our history, at the foundation of the State, some of the schools were in a shocking condition but it must be admitted that we have now some of the finest schools in the world.  Their construction has been expensive, perhaps a little too expensive, because the lifetime of a school is only about 50 years and, perhaps, if less expensive schools were built, there could be more new and reconstructed schools.  Deputy Jones recommended the adoption of a standard plan for the various types of schools, single-teacher, two-teacher, three-teacher schools, and so on.  That would save a great deal of expense, such as the cost of employing an architect, and so on.  I suppose the idea behind the present system is that a school building should be in conformity with its surroundings.</P>
    <P>There are still schools which are not fit for children or for teachers but it will be admitted that, to the extent permitted by our financial resources, vast improvements have been made. There are often difficulties about sites and there is still the old trouble&mdash; shortage of money.  It is well to know that after the lapse of nine or ten years nearly all our schools will be in a pretty good condition.  In this matter consideration should not be confined to cities and towns.  It is important that the school in the remotest area should be as well constructed and as neatly kept as schools in cities or towns.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that, owing to the decline in the population and the consequent decline in the average number of pupils, a number of rural schools have been closed down.  In certain areas, the school was always the cultural <Col N="1452" /> centre.  Even where there are only seven or eight pupils, the teacher should be maintained.  The trouble, of course, is to get teachers to stay in such schools.  Perhaps an enticement would be to give teachers in such schools the same basic salary and the same maximum salary payable to a teacher in a two-teacher or three-teacher school.  The capitation grant, or the principal's allowance as it is called, could also be increased.  There is a great difference between the principal's allowance in a small school and in a large school.  After all, the teacher in a small school must teach all subjects and, in fact, must teach them under greater difficulties than if he or she were in a large school.  I think if teachers were treated in a more generous way in regard to salaries and principals' allowances it would be an enticement to qualified teachers to accept appointments in those schools.</P>
    <P>In years gone by a teacher always lived near his or her school, lived among the people and was associated with them in many ways. The teachers knew the conditions of the various families and in that way were in a better position to deal with their pupils and also to be more helpful to the parents.  Now, owing to the development of transport and other amenities, teachers live in the towns and villages.  You can do nothing about that because this is a free country and they must be allowed to live wherever they like.</P>
    <P>There is also the difficulty about sanitation and the heating and cleaning of schools.  The grant for heating and cleaning is entirely too small.  It will take just as much to heat a room in a small school as a room in a large school. Where you have, say, a two-teacher school you must have two fires to heat that school.  A conference took place some time ago between the managers and representatives of the I.N.T.O. and the Department, in connection with this matter.  I do not know if anything has come of it but I should like the Minister to look into it if a report has been received from that conference.  He should try to increase the grants if at all possible, to ensure the better heating <Col N="1453" /> and cleaning of schools.  It is not right that teachers and pupils should have to sweep the schools and wash the floors.  We did it and it was done well but in this modern age I do not think the parents like their children to do it, although personally I do not think it would do them much harm.</P>
    <P>The managerial system has been in operation in this country down the years and I am sure that neither the teachers nor the Department wish to have any alteration in it.  It is working perfectly.  It is only right that the clergy of the various denominations should have control of the schools to a certain extent and be in a position to help the teachers in imparting religious instruction.  There have been grievances in regard to the inspector system.  There have been improvements but one peculiar matter was introduced after the foundation of the State.  Merit marks for each subject were then introduced, whereas before that there was just one general report given by the inspector on the general working of a school.</P>
    <P>Anybody conversant with education who enters a schoolroom knows at once whether that school is run efficiently or otherwise.  There is always something about the appearance of the school, its tidiness and so on, which creates a certain impression.  There is something about the children, their courtesy, manners and general appearance and the bearing of the teacher himself which influences that impression. Even without examining the children at all, I am sure the inspector, or whoever enters the school, will get a certain impression, good or otherwise, so that there should be no necessity for these merit marks on different subjects.  The I.N.T.O. down the years has demanded the abolition of these merit marks and it would be well if the Minister reviewed the matter now with a view to altering it.</P>
    <P>There is the other question of the primary certificate examination which is compulsory.  I think I cannot do better than to quote what the Taoiseach said on one occasion.  For a short period, I think in 1944 and 1945, he himself acted temporarily as Minister for Education, and he was not a bad <Col N="1454" /> Minister either.  He spoke at the I.N.T.O. Congress in Kilkee at Easter in 1955, and was reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The matter of the primary leaving certificate examination had been mentioned often and to-day again the matter had been stressed in the address of the President of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;I must confess,&rsquo; said Mr. de Valera, &lsquo;that I did not know this examination was compulsory.</P>
    <P>(&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; from audience).</P>
    <P>&lsquo;I did not know that it was compulsory in the sense that every child must go for it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not think that can be defended. It was a shock to me to find I was not aware of that.  As your president said, every pupil in a secondary school is not required to sit for the secondary leaving certificate. I think there should be inducement rather than compulsion. The method of examination is another matter.  When a standard has been reached it is right that some certificate be given at the end of the course to indicate that a certain standard has been reached.  I think that can be achieved.  I do, however, feel that the compulsion to sit for the examination is indefensible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider that from his chief and that some alteration will be made in connection with the compulsory primary certificate examination.  Perhaps the teacher should be in a position to give a certificate of merit to each deserving child when he or she has completed, say, the sixth standard, or whenever the pupil is about to leave the school.</P>
    <P>However, that is a matter for consideration but it is ridiculous for pupils who are mentally deficient in some way to be put forward for a primary certificate examination.  The teacher is obliged to put forward every child who has spent one year in the sixth standard. I have referred to mentally deficient children and it is a pity that something could not be done for those <Col N="1455" /> retarded children in the schools.  Because of our system of inspection and because of the primary certificate examination and the understanding of schools, teachers cannot give to mentally deficient children, the attention that such children deserve if they are to be helped.  They are kept back in classes because of their deficiency and I am sure that they feel that; it gives them a certain inferiority complex. They cannot follow the course in the same way as children of the same age who came to school with them when they entered.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible to put these children into a separate class because they would feel that also.  Perhaps we could have one teacher for that type of children, but I am afraid that would not work out.  It is a pity nothing can be done for them.  There is only one hope for them.  You often find that these retarded children, who are very slow to learn in the primary school, in many cases are wonderful at manual work if they have an opportunity of attending a vocational school.  I have known several examples of that.  The pity is, of course, that there are so few vocational schools in the country at present, and consequently those living in remote areas cannot get that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I had better not say too much about vocational education because I have spoken for too long already, but I think it is true that no grants are given by the State for the erection of secondary schools.  If a teacher qualifies as a secondary teacher and wants to set up a school, he must provide premises himself.  The numbers attending secondary schools prove that our people are anxious to have secondary education.  The Minister should seriously consider allowing grants to help teachers build secondary schools.  We know that the religious bodies have such schools, but that is a different matter altogether.  They are doing wonderful work.</P>
    <P>As regards vocational education, I think that the proper age for a child to enter a vocational school is about 16 years.  A child, having finished <Col N="1456" /> its primary education, would attend a secondary school for two years.  If such a secondary school is not available there should be attached to every national school a higher primary school in which extra subjects would be taught, perhaps by a special teacher.  It would be recognised more or less as a type of secondary education. After two years there, the child would be well equipped to enter a vocational school.  Consequently, it would not be necessary, as it is at present, to teach such subjects as arithmetic and English in the vocational schools.</P>
    <P>The proper subjects for vocational schools would be rural science, domestic economy&mdash;cookery, laundry, housework of different kinds&mdash;woodwork, metal work, religious instruction and a continuation of the teaching of Irish.  In that way we would be helping the revival of the language, first in the primary school, then in the high primary, then in the secondary school and vocational school up to the age of 18.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that people who must leave the country have to be regarded as unskilled workers.  Provision should be made, as I hope it will be, to ensure that all our children will have primary education, a certain amount of secondary education and certainly a thorough vocational education to equip them for life in a difficult world.  Certain critics have said that the children leaving our schools now are illiterate or semi-illiterate.  Nowadays, our children gain various kinds of knowledge in a broad way.  In the early days of the national schools, and up to about 30 or 40 years ago, we just had what we called &ldquo;the three R's&rdquo; and a certain amount of geography and history.  Of course, it was not correct history.  By the way, that is one subject that should be well taught in every school, primary and secondary.  If we are to maintain a love of country we should have a thorough knowledge of its past history and of the men who helped to make it great.</P>
    <P>If, after leaving school, our children continue studying on their own, I think we could hold that, with such general knowledge, they could compete with <Col N="1457" /> the children of the schools of any other country.  If the children attending school regularly are helped with their lessons at home and if, after school, they read good books, newspapers and periodicals and gain a thorough knowledge, not only of the affairs of their own country but of international affairs as well, I think that, with their native wit and humour, our children could compare favourably with the children of any other country.</P>
    <P>There is no use in people being so pessimistic about our educational system.  It is as perfect as it can be within the limits of the financial resources available.  I am sure that if teachers and pupils do their work, all will be well with Irish education.  I should like to pay a tribute to the officials of the Department who have always been very helpful to managers and teachers and, I suppose, Deputies and Senators.</P>
    <P>Before I finish I wish to refer to one aspect of education concerning former teachers.  I am referring now to what are called the pre-1950 pensioned teachers.</P>

      <P>I need not dwell too long on this matter.  The Minister is well aware of the position.  It was regrettable that the Education (Amendment) Act passed in the summer of 1950 excluded teachers who retired before the 1st January, 1950.  I shall give an example to show how this worked out and how unfair it is.  Say that a teacher in Kerry was born on 4-1-85, was trained in the period 1904-1906 and retired on 31-3-50 with 43 years' service.  That teacher got nearly £1,000 of a gratuity on retirement. Another teacher born on 21st November, 1884, much the same time, trained 1904-1906 in the same college as the first teacher, retired on 31st December, 1949, and got no gratuity.  It is most unfair that that should happen.  It is rather strange that in the neighbourhood of my own town of Kenmare, there are two teachers, one of whom retired on 31st December, 1949, because he was 65 years of age in <Col N="1458" /> November of that year, while a neighbouring teacher, and a great friend of his, reached the age of 65 on 4th January, 1950, and on 31st March received a gratuity of £835.  The Minister knows how the first teacher must feel.</P>
      <P>I know that Ministers for Education in the past have seen the injustice of this and have claimed it is impossible to remedy the situation because of shortage of money.  May I point out that only one payment will be involved? There will be no recurring payments.  These teachers are gradually passing away.  The amount required to cover the gratuities to which we feel they are justly entitled is something in the neighbourhood of £650,000.  Those affected would be quite satisfied if the payments were spread over a year or two.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Mulcahy was Minister for Education from 1948 to 1951, he increased the pensions for pensioned teachers.  He also introduced these gratuities.  The measure was a good one, but unfortunately it did not go far enough.  It has that one fault. When the late Deputy Moylan became Minister for Education, he also tried to do something to rectify the injustice by paying about one-third of the gratuity to the teachers affected, but, in order not to commit himself, he called the payment an <i>ex gratia</i> grant. The conditions of the payment were similar to the conditions underlying the payment of the gratuities.</P>
      <P>Each of those Ministers did something to help pensioned teachers. Would the present Minister now seriously consider completing the good work and paying the dwindling number of teachers affected the remainder of the gratuity?  If he does that, he will not only have the gratitude of the teachers concerned but the gratitude of all the members of the I.N.T.O.  In fact, members of public bodies see the injustice of the present position and have recommended that the money should be paid.</P>

      <P>Is maith an rud é, im' thuairimse, go mbíonn ócáid mar seo againne gach blian i <Col N="1459" /> ndiaidh a chéile chun tuairimí na dTeachtaí a chloisint le linn Meastacháin na Roinne Oideachais a bheith á bplé ar conus is féidir feabhas a chur ar scéimeanna oideachais a bhíonn ar siúl.  Go deimhin, tá na scéimeanna go h-anamhaith ar fad ach is ceart dúinn féachaint isteach iontú go minic chun a fheiscint an bhfuil aon rud tairbheach gur féidir linn a dhéanamh chun a feabhas éigin a chur ortha.</P>
      <P>Deirtear nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag dul chun cinn sa tír seo.  Ní aontaím leis sin.  Chífeadh aon duine a bheadh i láthair, cuir i gcás, nuair a bhíonn Feis na Scol ar siúl i gCorcaigh ar feadh seachtaine gach bliain agus na daltai scoile ina mílte bailithe ann agus teanga na tíre á labhairt acu, go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag dul chun cinn. Agus lá feise nó ócáid mar sin nuair a chloisfidís na daoine a bhíonn bailithe i bparóiste éigin sa tír ag labhairt Gaeilge, bheadh fhios acu go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag dul ar aghaidh agus go bhfuil sí cuíosach maith ag na daoine óga nuair a fhágann siad na scoileanna.</P>
      <P>Do bhí duine uasal i gCorcaigh le déanaí le linn an Tóstail, duine ó Choimisiún Idirnáisiúnta Cultúrtha na hEorpa a tháinig ó Mheiriceá i dtosach, is dóigh liom.  Dúirt sé gur chuala sé na páistí ag teacht amach as an scoil náisiúnta le hais halla na cathrach agus go raibh an teanga á labhairt acu go flúirseach agus go raibh áthas air agus ar na daoine a bhí ina theannta dá bhrí sin.  Chonaic sé comórtais rinnce ar thaobh na sráideanna i measc na bpáistí sa chathair agus chuir sé sin ionadh agus aoibhneas orthu go léir.</P>

    <P>Sílim go bhfuil an clár atá againn ins na scoileanna fé láthair oiriúnach don tír seo ach is dócha gur ceart féachaint isteach ann do réir mar atá an tAire a dhéanamh fé láthair.  Tá sé chun Coimisiún a bhunú chun féachaint isteach i múineadh na Gaeilge agus cé nach maith liom Coimisiúin ná Coimisinéirí de ghnáth, is dóigh liom gur céim ar aghaidh é sin a dhéanamh sa chás seo.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon ní bun ós cionn le múineadh na teangan ins na scoileanna ach tá an méid sin cainte ar fud na tíre ina thaobh gur ceart rud éigin mar seo a dhéanamh chun a thaispeáint dos na daoine go <Col N="1460" /> bhfuil gach rud scrúduithe go maith. Tá súil agam go gcuirfear gach feabhas is féidir i bhfeidhm ón scrúdú san do leas na teangan agus do leas an oideachais ins na scoileanna.</P>
    <P>It is a great thing that we have an opportunity during the debate on this Estimate every year of hearing the views of Deputies on all sides of the House on the various aspects of education. The system that has been in operation here has worked well.  It has stressed the religious and moral upbringing of the rising generation and tried at the same time to develop their intellects in such a way as to give them confidence to face the struggle in life that is before them in a competitive world.</P>
    <P>One of the principal objects of the educational system in any country is, I would say, to preserve the national characteristics of the race and to bring up the rising generation in an environment which will preserve their traditions and characteristics, and at the same time instil in them a willingness to improve as the years go by not only their own circumstances in life, but also the standards of their walk of life and consequently of the country generally. That, to my mind, is the primary aspect here and it has been well attended to by teachers, by managers and by the Department, and has produced good results.  That is not to say that we ought to sit down and say that everything is perfect, that things which were suitable ten or 20 years ago are just as suitable to-day in a changing world.  We must examine from time to time the matters connected with education which will keep the rising generation abreast of the times and give them the opportunities in life befitting their station.</P>
    <P>It has been said that too much time has been devoted to the teaching of our native language and that there is too much compulsion.  Those who talk in that way have not examined the matter at all.  I do not think there is any country in the world where they have a language of their own and where that language is not taught and encouraged in the schools.  It is our primary duty to encourage our native <Col N="1461" /> language.  Those in past generations who looked to the days of freedom had that in their minds.  The men of 1916 also had it in their minds before they made the supreme sacrifice, like Pádraig Pearse, who went to Rosmuc, mixed with the people of the Gaeltacht, and transmitted that Gaelic atmosphere in his writings as an encouragement to students, to the rising generation and all his colleagues.  Every Government which has been in office since has adopted that policy of the preservation of our national language.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we are not making much progress in this respect. I cannot agree with that viewpoint.  If people were to attend the school festival in Cork where they have drama, music plays and so on, and hear night after night the thousands of school children there conversing with their teachers and amongst themselves in their own language they would realise the progress that has been made.  They would also realise that 15 or 20 years ago such a state of affairs was quite impossible.  If a talk in Irish is being given, the children of to-day understand it.  Perhaps they do not speak the language fluently, but they understand what is going on.  If these lectures were given 20 or 25 years ago, very few of the audience would be able to understand them.</P>
    <P>There was in Cork during the recent Tóstal festival a representative from Europe of the International Cultural Relations Committee and he said that he and those with him heard children who were coming out of a school near the City Hall speaking quite fluently in the Irish language, and that they saw them on the streets having their own little competitions in Irish dancing. They said that when the natives of Germany, Belgium, Holland, Italy, and so on, come to a city, speaking their own language, showing their own folk dances, it arouses in the local population a spirit of emulation and some pride in the national characteristics which are theirs and which they have inherited through years of struggle.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister in setting up the commission to appoint those who have knowledge in that <Col N="1462" /> sphere.  I have experience myself in my own days of secondary teachers teaching honours students all their lives setting out programmes for national schools that were quite unsuitable in every way and setting them out in kind of watertight departments of grammar, (a), (b) and (c), and all the rest, setting them out more to confuse than to enlighten.</P>
    <P>I hope the people the Minister will appoint to grapple with this problem will be the ordinary people of the country and those connected with that sphere of education all their lives. Anybody who stood out against that scheme of things was the worst in the world.  If he found he was not getting results and had the courage to say so, he was at once condemned.  That was not Pádraig Pearse's idea of a teacher or of his functions, or of the status he should have.  I was glad to hear various Deputies say that the relations between inspectors and teachers in recent years had very much improved, that there was a more helpful and cooperative attitude.  That is all to the good.</P>
    <P>In most cases, the text-books are quite unsuitable.  In former times, we had &ldquo;Ceachta Beaga Gaeilge&rdquo; by Norma Borthwick, illustrated by Yeats &mdash;short, concise lessons dealing with a theme, where you had a little done well.  At the present time, there are long rigmaroles of lessons in books that children can never finish within the year.  That is not a helpful thing.  One of the worst ideas that can ever be put into a child's mind is to leave something unfinished.  Let them have something they can do thoroughly and can finish.  &ldquo;Fill orm,&rdquo; ars an droch-obair, &ldquo;agus dein arís mé.&rdquo;&ldquo;Return to me,&rdquo; says the badly-done work, &ldquo;and do me again.&rdquo;  They should be able to do something precisely and accurately, so that they may be trained properly.  To do that, they should have proper text-books.</P>
    <P>When the British wanted to make our children &ldquo;happy English children&rdquo;, their scheme of books was well designed for that purpose.  It is not the amount that we cover that matters, but the method of our doing it.  The <Col N="1463" /> measure of our success lies in doing it well.  In that way, we build up the character of the Irish child in the Irish schools to the advantage of this country.</P>
    <P>We have not properly graded text-books in Irish; we have too much in the English books; and we have arithmetics which are no great credit to us.  After all these years, we should have something more suitable, particularly from the fourth standard upwards.  Up to that, they are fair enough.  We ought to make some effort to improve the text-books and make them more suitable and fit them in so that they can be completed within the year.  Some of the text-books, whether in Irish or in English, in arithmetic or history or geography, must be left there because there is not sufficient time to deal with them.  It is bad practice that the child in third, fourth, fifth or any other standard should not be able to complete the book within the year but must leave six or seven lessons undone.  That was not formerly the situation&mdash;you just completed the book in the particular year and it was so designed that it could be done and done efficiently.</P>
    <P>Then we have people saying that written Irish should be ignored until the child reaches the third or fourth standard.  To my mind, that would be bad educational policy.  Furthermore, it is impracticable.  It is all right where you have one teacher for each class; he can set out his programme and do what he wishes in accordance with the general syllabus.  Take the school where you have two teachers in charge of seven or possibly eight standards.  There is a junior teacher teaching infants, first and second; the senior teacher teaches third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and sometimes eighth.  While the junior is teaching the infants, what are the first and second to do, if not writing?  While you are teaching Irish to one class, does anyone think it would be good for the atmosphere of the school to have English or something else going on in the other standard?  Is it not the proper practice to have oral Irish going on with the class on the floor <Col N="1464" /> and to have those in the desks writing Irish, familiarising themselves with the lessons they were taught previously, with the words, and so on?</P>
    <P>I would say that the writing of compositions and aistí should certainly be deferred, but the ordinary writing and familiarising with the simple words in the junior classes, and the progressive words in the senior classes, should go on regularly.  When Irish is being taught in a classroom everything there at that time should be Irish, if a proper atmosphere is to be preserved and if proper progress is to be made. These are some of the things in the primary schools which need attention. Unless some cognisance is taken of what Deputies say here, all the talk will be in vain.  Let us hope that some good will come of it.</P>
    <P>It is said also that our children are not up to the standard of the children of other countries.  That is quite false. Every check has been made on it.  The Christian Brothers, the Presentation Brothers and teachers of various kinds teaching here have also for a time been teaching in England or in America.  If you ask them, as I have done, about the standards there, they will tell you that our standard of education in the various classes is as good, if not better, and that it is more solid.  Perhaps those other children may be more glib to answer and perhaps a bit smarter generally, but our children are just as sound and fundamentally they are as well taught as those in any other land.</P>
    <P>We have had experience of that here. As members know, an oil refinery is being established in the South of Ireland.  It is in course of erection and the head men have come from Holland, Belgium, America and so on. They have interviewed Irish students for appointments, from the vocational and technical schools and have been quite amazed at their standards. Therefore, let us not think we are down in the world in that regard at all.</P>
    <P>I have seen cases where students had to emigrate, where they had learned chemistry and things like that; and within a week or a fortnight, they had three or four more drawn away to <Col N="1465" /> the same firms as they were found so good and so satisfactory that they were being sought after by firms and agencies abroad.  Our schools are good &mdash;there is no doubt about that&mdash;and they are doing good work.  Our only idea is to improve them as far as we can and keep up with modern trends.</P>
    <P>Sixty-one per cent. of the population finish their formal education in the national schools, and only 39 per cent. go further.  What do these do to improve themselves?  We have heard long speeches about what should be done, all the scholarships that should be given, as if everybody could possibly get a secondary or a university education, as if their parents could afford to let them go on to 20 or 21 years of age without earning anything to support the family, even without considering whether it would fit them for the sphere of life into which they were going ultimately.</P>
    <P>I believe that in national schools in the rural parts the 60 per cent. or so of our population who go no further, go out into the hedge schools of the headlands of the farms of our country. They learn about the rotation of crops, about fertilisers, about the type of drill they should make for potatoes and the type of drill for beet, about the care of animals and all the rest of it. They go into Macra na Feirme or other clubs of that kind and they learn more, if they are wise.  Their education does not finish with school.  They learn how to care animals and market them. Surely that is enlightenment of mind for our population in their sphere of life in agriculture.</P>
    <P>We should try to help them.  I think we should keep them at school until the age of 15 and that during the last year in school, as some members, including Deputy Manley, said, we should have an extra room provided for them. Instead of the big, pretentious vocational schools which we cannot have in every parish, we could provide an extra room in each national school and an agricultural instructor should attend for the benefit of those boys who have reached 14 or 15 years of age and give them certain instruction and prepare them for their way of life.</P>
    <P>When I was at school&mdash;a good many <Col N="1466" /> years ago&mdash;we had an agricultural manual and later we had school gardening. All these things&mdash;for which there were special fees&mdash;have gone.  Our rural schemes are the important things because when the pupils come to 14 or 15 they must face the world with national school education.  It is good, sound education up to that point, but we should try to help the children at that stage to work themselves into the atmosphere in which they are to live and give them a little extra instruction to prepare them for life.</P>
    <P>The secondary schools carry on higher education.  Travel in the world is now very easy, leading to greater international intercourse, and consequently a knowledge of perhaps one or two continental languages is more advantageous than when these languages were taught purely as academic training in the past.  The secondary schools teach these subjects and we have a certain proportion of our population able to enter into business and commerce with the world outside or able to assist the country's international trade.  When letters come here from abroad, they can be properly answered.</P>
    <P>At the present time, it is difficult to keep vocational teachers, especially those dealing with technology of various kinds, because they are being absorbed in industry and getting far higher pay in industry than as teachers. That problem becomes more difficult daily and a better scheme of education must be developed, if we are to keep in line with modern progress.  We must consider these things and, having considered them, we must do something effective about them, if not this year, then next year, but it must not be left on the long finger as something to be talked about and hoped for, but not achieved.</P>
    <P>The number who can get secondary or university education is limited.  We have three universities, or four, if we take in the whole nation, and I presume they will be able to train 6,000 or 7,000 of the 500,000 who are in the schools each year.  We must look to the big bulk of our people and try to improve their standards and give them opportunities for intellectual and <Col N="1467" /> physical development and moral training which will make them good citizens. If they must go abroad, at least they will be able to hold their place with others.  These should be our aims in education and it is about time we had another look at our policy to see what improvements we can make.  We must give the young people the idea that their interests are being considered and scope given for the exercise of their energies.  If we do that, we will be training a generation which will appreciate its purpose in life and the needs of the nation and the necessity to build up our productivity.</P>
    <P>In going further, I would only reiterate what has been said already in the House, but I should like to add to what Deputy Palmer and some others said about the teachers who retired before 1950.  The youngest of them is now 73 and they are passing away as the days go by.  If we do nothing this year or next year, the problem will be solved by their deaths.  They will be all gone.  Meanwhile the few are left who, in my early years and in the early years of the older members of the House, taught the Irish language late and early and went back into the schools to do it; revived the Irish spirit and taught with colleagues who because of a day or a month got retiring gratuities which these others did not get, although they taught over the same days and years.  Just because of an accident of birth, if you like, they retired in 1949 rather than in 1950.</P>
    <P>The late Seán Moylan remedied to one-third that deficiency.  These teachers paid pension premiums for years and these premiums were taken over by the Government when they had reached a very considerable sum. When it came to a certain time, the line was drawn.  A similar situation has been remedied in other places&mdash; why can we not remedy it here?  Why should this be the one part of the country that has not done so?  Surely something is due to these teachers who have given years of service to help this nation spiritually and culturally to reach the present-day standard of which we can be proud.  We should not forget them now in their declining <Col N="1468" /> years for the sake of the small sum that would right the wrong done to them.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the matter and to supplement what the late Seán Moylan did&mdash;and what his successor did, I think, in a different way&mdash;by giving some monthly allowance or something of that kind to close up the gap that is still there.</P>
    <P>There has been discussion about discipline in the school.  One of the things for which the teacher must have responsibility is discipline.  He has several classes to control and in order to get the work done he must maintain discipline.  Some people say that bad answering and so on should not be punished.  Perhaps not&mdash;but laziness should be punished.  It is like the Irish proverb which I mentioned a while ago&mdash;Fil orm ars' an droch-obair agus déan arís mé.  We do not want to bring up a race of molly-coddles who will be the masters before they reach the age of maturity instead of the people who should be.  Discipline is necessary in a nation.  The fact that the rising generation must be disciplined is good for them in after life. They see the difference and, when the time comes, they appreciate it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to open what remarks I have to make on this Estimate by joining the two previous speakers in a plea on behalf of teachers who retired pre-1950.  No later than to-day, I received a letter from one of them, a former principal of a girls' school, who retired in 1944 at the age of 60.  Although she had a first-class record as a teacher, she found herself done out of five years' teaching money, added to which she has got in the pre-1950 group.  I have met them on several occasions when they came to this House.  I was always deeply impressed by the dignity with which they presented their case.  It is obviously a case of injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am probably pushing an open door as far as this Minister for Education or any previous Minister for Education is concerned in regard to this matter. It is largely a governmental matter to provide the money.  Before I leave the subject, I cannot help pointing out that this House at the moment is in the <Col N="1469" /> throes of voting many millions to pay the debts of C.I.E. and surely it would be only justice to give these other people what is due.  It is a gross injustice against them.  Although it would have no political value or worth to give it to them, we would be redressing a wrong.  I believe it would bring the country luck to do so.  I think all of us who are putting this case to the Minister are strengthening his own case to the Government to see that the small sum is paid over and that this injustice is rectified.</P>
    <P>It has been put to me that when secondary schools are employing a science teacher, the Department of Education insist that it is necessary for such teacher to have the Higher Diploma in Education as well.  I am merely passing on that information as it was given to me.  It is very difficult for secondary schools to get science teachers.  I suppose it is very necessary that those who are to teach science should have a degree in that subject. There is such a demand nowadays in other spheres of life for people with a science degree that it is up to the Department of Education&mdash;if what I say is correct&mdash;to alter the present state of affairs so that science teachers without the Higher Diploma in Education may be employed in secondary schools.</P>
    <P>I have no particular knowledge of education.  I cannot speak as a specialist, like the last two speakers who are teachers.  Nevertheless, many points have been given to me by teachers to raise on the Estimate as well as by parents, and then I also have my own observations to make.  On this Estimate, we are mainly concerned with primary teachers.  I suppose every person in this House at some time or another started his or her education in a primary school.  The bulk of our people go through primary school and gain their impressions therefrom.</P>
    <P>I approve of the decision taken by the Minister in restoring the status of married women teachers.  In my constituency several schools have been entirely dependent on married women teachers and other teachers have been dependent on these married women teachers to give them a lift to their several schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1470" /> It has been obvious for a long time that the shortage of teachers is having a very serious effect on the educational system as a whole.  We must always remember that children in their formative years are very apt to gather impressions that will last throughout the remainder of their lives.  The system in many parts of rural Ireland is that you have teachers who are visitors, who are really birds of passage.  Literally, what is happening in my constituency is that when the qualified teachers come out of the training colleges they are appointed to a school maybe in May or June and stay there and in many cases a married teacher who has been doing temporary work there is relieved of her duties and the qualified teacher is appointed in her place.  Then, as soon as the summer is over, it is found that the newly-appointed teacher has secured another job somewhere else; always, the tendency is to move towards Dublin.  The married teacher who was there before, anchored to the district and who would have stayed, has been taken off and then has to be restored again.  I am citing that instance to show the very forceful argument there is for the action the Minister has taken in lifting the ban on married women teachers.</P>
    <P>I have already said that children gain their impressions in their formative years.  Every Deputy must feel it is very bad for children to be brought up in an atmosphere of a continual changing of teachers, a lack of continuity.  For that reason, the restoration of married women teachers is good inasmuch as it is likely to anchor them to a district.  It is likely that a husband and wife will teach in a district and stay there and that we shall have that continuity which existed in the past.</P>
    <P>Everyone will accept that the teacher&mdash;or &ldquo;master&rdquo;, as he is known in rural Ireland&mdash;plays a very important part in the life of the country in forming the ideas of people.  When pupils leave school they very often have recourse to him again for advice. Our aim and object, as far as we can, should be to provide that continuity which is so essential.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" /> Special facilities should be made available for the purpose of building houses for teachers.  Loans should be available in some shape or form, or there should be easy terms to encourage teachers to build houses and stay in their districts.  By doing that, we shall be doing a service for the country as a whole.  I also think it would do a lot to dispel the idea, which seems to be growing in the minds of the youth to-day, that there is nothing for them but to emigrate.  A restless outlook is created by continual changing of teachers and it must impinge itself on the youth of to-day to a large extent. I think it is largely responsible for the desire of the people to get out of the country or, at least, to get out of rural Ireland into Dublin, and that is a stepping stone to emigration.</P>
    <P>I have always felt, and this has been conveyed to me by a lot of teachers as well, that there is too much central control over our primary schools.  I am informed that the syllabus is fixed in Dublin in the Department of Education, whereby teachers are supposed to teach certain subjects at certain times. If an inspector walks into a school without notice, as he does, and finds the teacher teaching some particular subject for a short period over the time allotted to it, he gives the teacher a bad mark.  Does not that to a large extent turn teachers into robots?  The teacher is not allowed to think for himself. He is not allowed to develop the individuality of his pupils or to use his own individuality for the good of those whom he is educating.  I do not mean to say that there should not be some sort of fixed routine in schools&mdash;it is understandable that there should be&mdash; but if the principal of a school himself were freer to decide on the best way to lay out a general curriculum for those whom he is teaching, it would be all to the good.</P>
    <P>If what I am told is correct, when inspectors come to inspect schools, they do so without any prior notice whatsoever.  If that is so, I do not see that there is really any sense in it. The idea may be that if an inspector comes suddenly into a school, he will catch out a teacher, if he is not carrying out the curriculum in the correct <Col N="1472" /> way, and is not running the school as is thought fit.  Against that, this surely lowers the teacher in the eyes of the pupils if he is in the position that he is to be pounced on at any moment by an inspector.  Surely it is possible for an inspector to give due notice?  Perhaps things would be brushed up in a school, if such notice were given, but I think it would give the teacher a better standing amongst his pupils.  I think it was Deputy Palmer who said that an inspector from his own observation, experience, and examination of the pupils will know if all is well, if it is a well-run school or not.</P>
    <P>Teachers should be allowed greater latitude to run their own affairs and we ought to develop as much individuality as possible.  If people who are responsible for developing the minds of pupils are restrained to a certain extent, that must inhibit them in the attitude they adopt to their pupils, and it must lead to a lack of individuality, and individuality is perhaps the best thing that we can bring out in human beings.</P>
    <P>I have never been able to understand why there are no teachers as officials in the Department of Education.  In the Custom House we have doctors, engineers and architects who are rated as civil servants and who are special advisers to the Department.  The same situation exists in other Departments and surely a teacher, or several grades of teachers from primary and secondary schools, acting as officials in the Department of Education, would be of tremendous advantage to the Department. They could give the inside facts relating to the profession with which the Department is dealing all the time.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything against the Department, but I have found them at times just a little unrealistic.  I could cite several instances, but where you have people working in the Department, living in Dublin, absorbing the Dublin way of life, and this allied with the ordinary caution of civil servants who do not really like to do anything lest they might be doing something wrong, it would be a great advantage if, within their own ranks, there was somebody who had actually taught and had experience of school work.  The experience <Col N="1473" /> of such a person would be of great benefit.  There are professional advisers in other Departments and I do not see why such advisers should not be made available as an experiment in the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made here about the ability of the children in Ireland, both at school and in their subsequent careers, as compared with the ability of children in other countries.  I have had the opportunity of practising as a doctor in both England and Ireland, and, let me say categorically, straight away, that, in my opinion, the standard of intelligence in Ireland amongst the ordinary children&mdash;and may I say amongst the ordinary people?&mdash;is very much higher than in England.  Some Deputies have argued here that our system of education is better than elsewhere. I am not really qualified to speak on that subject because I am not a qualified educationist myself, but certainly so far as the power to absorb, to understand things, goes, I think the Irish people stand head and shoulders above their counterparts in England, and I might say above their counterparts in a great many parts of the world.  I do not think we should have any inferiority complex about that.  We can stand our own with anybody.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of corporal punishment, principally by Deputy Dr. Browne.  Apparently there are certain people who seem to think that boys can be handled by sweet reasonableness and nothing else.  I should hate to see us becoming a nation of neurotics and mollycoddles, as a Deputy on the opposite side suggested.  When we were small, we had to undergo corporal punishment.  Everybody has to undergo correction and I believe that a relaxation of correction has been to a large extent responsible for the growth of &ldquo;Teddy boys&rdquo; who are anti-everything and who have no respect for law and order.  Surely a lot of that is the effect of this crazy Socialist attitude that the cane should not be taken to children?</P>
    <P>All of us in this House, I am sure, had the advantage of being corrected in our youth, and I do not see why we should adopt the attitude that corporal <Col N="1474" /> punishment is wrong.  One would imagine from hearing some people speaking here that the teachers of Ireland are a group of sadists.  I never heard such nonsense and I might add <i>en passant</i> that, if children were corrected more in their homes, it would not be necessary for teachers to correct them in the schools.</P>
    <P>I would not be one to encourage excessive punishment, but, if a teacher is to have his hands and feet tied in administering reprimands to children under his care, how can he keep law and order in his school?  Anybody who speaks like that is only talking nonsense and the ultimate end of it would be no discipline whatsoever.  To my mind, it is a negation of democracy and nothing else.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words on the subject of the Irish language.  Of course, a great deal of this debate has revolved around that subject, and I must freely confess to the House, before I speak on it, that I do not speak Irish myself, but I cannot help imbibing the views of a great many people and cannot help learning a good deal about it from what I hear.  When our own Government was established here, it was decided, on account of the neglect of the language when we were under alien Government, to try to reestablish Irish.  Whether that has been successful or not is another matter.  It seems to me that the main idea was to bring teachers from the Gaeltacht, the only place where Irish was a living language or spoken to any great extent. into Leinster and other parts of Ireland to teach there through the medium of Irish.  That happened a great many years ago.  We have to evaluate the situation to-day to see whether that has been a success or not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said something which struck me as being fundamentally very sound.  He said that in some cases small children were being taken out of English-speaking homes and put into the arena of Irish where they are taught Irish and are taught other subjects through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>Probably one of the reasons for bringing teachers from the Gaeltacht <Col N="1475" /> was to establish the Irish language in the rest of the country and to create an urge in the people generally to speak Irish and to think in Irish.  Is it not possible that we are dealing with a parents' resistance in this matter more than anything else?  It is 25 or 30 years since the system was established. Many of the present day parents were children then and were taught through the medium of Irish.  Had the parents accepted that as something they desired, they would have continued to speak Irish and would have encouraged their children to do so.  That does not appear to be the case.  One does not hear much Irish spoken.  Occasionally I hear national teachers or such people speaking it.</P>
    <P>Any Deputy who says that the present scheme to revive Irish is not a success runs the risk of being accused of being a shoneen or West Briton.  Nobody wants to see the Irish language fade out.  In my youth, there was great enthusiasm for the Gaelic language.  I learned the language for a bit, but have forgotten it now.  It seems to me that the present system has the stigma of compulsion about it and, as long as that continues, there will always be serious resistance to it. If compulsion were removed&mdash;and perhaps that is what the advisory committee will recommend&mdash;and if certain benefits were given again I find myself in accord with Deputy Dillon&mdash;such as scholarships to universities, possibilities of wider education, and so forth, in conjunction with encouragement of Irish customs, Irish dances and other traditional customs, there might be a Gaelic revival.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any Deputy can honestly suggest that at the present moment there is any real enthusiasm for the Irish language.  I do not mean for the Irish language itself&mdash;let me not be misunderstood&mdash;I refer to the way in which it is being taught or the way in which it is endeavoured to put it across.  I know it is a difficult subject and a subject on which one's remarks can be grossly misconstrued, but there is a commission to be set up and there may be some changes brought about as a result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise the importance of this Estimate because on our system of education depends what the future generation will be and we will be judged to a great extent by our standard of education.  Education begins in the home when the child is an infant on his mother's knee.  A great deal depends on whether the mother speaks the Irish language or the English language.  Unfortunately for the child, the vast majority of mothers speak the English language. When the child goes to school at the age of five or six years and is put into a class and hears a language he has never heard before, the impact on his mind is so great that his first years at school are largely wasted trying to grapple with the language.  It is a mistake to force the Irish language on a child of such tender years.</P>
      <P>I am all in favour of developing the language, but the question is how best it should be done.  For whatever few words of Irish I have, I can thank the Gaelic League.  I attended their night classes because of my anxiety to learn the language.  That applied to many men in my time.  With the ambition that existed at that time to learn the language, there was even more Irish spoken amongst the people then than there is to-day, notwithstanding the great amount of money which has been spent on the language and the great amount of education in other subjects which students are denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of 5,000 national schools, a mere 3 per cent. teach agricultural science and that in an agricultural country where the big majority of boys and girls will get only primary education. Deputy MacCarthy stated that 61 per cent. of the people get primary education. I have no hesitation in saying that a boy or girl of 14 years of age, having gone through the very grand programme of education in a national school, having endeavoured to learn the Irish language, the English language, history, geography, geometry, algebra, mathematics generally, has far less education than his father had in the past.  I know it as a parent.  I know, because of my experience of children in rural Ireland, that they are greatly hampered in the schools to-day because of the grand programme <Col N="1477" /> and the learning of the language. Some sacrifice must be made to revive the language but how that is to come about without hindering education is a matter that should be very seriously considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for continuation education on completion of the primary school course.  The father who rears a family looks forward to the day when his eldest son or daughter can give him a little help in his home.  He looks forward to the day when the boy will reach the age of 14 so that he can help him in the running of his farm or his business. He may be anxious to give him a secondary education, or vocational education but, because of circumstances outside his control, he is not able to do so and the boy, through force of circumstances, is compelled to do with the limited amount of primary education which he gets up to the age of 14 years in the national school.</P>
    <P>It is recommended that a boy attending the vocational schools should be 16 years of age.  There is, then, that period from 14 to 16 and they are the vital years in the development of a young boy.  If a young boy or girl is allowed to lapse between the ages of 14 and 16 without any continuation in his or her education, it is very difficult to bring them back to education again because they will have forgotten all they learned in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>In the old days, those who left the primary schools had the opportunity of attending night classes in the national schools.  Those classes do not exist at all to-day and, indeed, it was a very useful form of education. Our emigrants who went to America were fairly well educated in the primary schools; they continued their education in the night classes; and when they went to America they continued their education there. That made them well educated Irish emigrants.  They are not so well prepared to-day, unless they get the opportunity of secondary education, or a good grinding in vocational education, but they are lacking that knowledge in English, arithmetic and Irish which they should get in their own country, if our educational <Col N="1478" /> system was a proper one for imparting that knowledge to our boys and girls.</P>
    <P>In the old days, too, agriculture was taught in the schools and my own parents learned agriculture in the national school.  I do not know why agriculture is not taught.  I presume it gave way to other subjects such as Irish, but agriculture being the main industry, I think that in rural Ireland, at least, the bias in education should be all in favour of a little agricultural teaching, if we are to encourage our people to stay in rural Ireland.  Unfortunately, the trend is away from the land and to a great extent I blame the educational programme which has been in existence over the past 30 years, because that education was altogether for education, for training the children for the professions and for the Civil Service, all of which are now overcrowded, while rural Ireland is becoming depopulated.</P>
    <P>The system of education in the rural areas should be based on the way of living of the people of rural Ireland, that is, on the hard way of life which they have to live.  I know that good work is being done in the vocational schools, and we appreciate all that has been done, but there is just that lack between the age of 14 and the age of 16 years.  The boys and girls cannot continue the education they get in the primary schools, in the all important subjects of Irish, English and arithmetic.</P>

      <P>Not for night classes, and that is the weakness in the whole system, because, as I pointed out before, the father and mother are looking forward to the day when the eldest boy or girl can stay at home from the age of 14 and help in the running of the business.  An opportunity should be afforded them to attend night classes the moment they leave the national school.  That opportunity should be given to the boys either in the national schools&mdash;as was the case 40 years ago &mdash;or else in the vocational schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1479" /> I believe that the system of teaching Irish at present is not the best, as it is so confusing to the children.  I know some children who are reared in Irish-speaking homes and they are able to cope with the language all rights, but where children are not reared in Irish-speaking homes, the system is most confusing when they are asked to do sums or history or geography, and all the other subjects, through the medium of Irish.  Even in the national schools, it would be far better for the development of the language, if it were taught as a subject.  When people go abroad, they learn a language, such as French, in a very short time by listening to other people speaking it and by learning a few words now and again.  They develop their knowledge gradually, and if we could only develop the learning of the Irish language gradually, instead of compelling children of tender years to learn it, whether they like it or not, there would be more love for it.</P>
    <P>I believe every Irish boy and girl would like the Irish language, but the idea of compelling them, and hammering it into them, is rather repulgive and it is not a great inducement to them to learn it.  As Deputy MacCarthy said a few moments ago, the chief thing for our educational system is to limit the subject on the programme so that what the children are taught will be taught well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to the voices of those who spoke on behalf of the pre-1950 national teachers.  They are now a dwindling band and, as other Deputies said, they served the country very well.  They did excellent work and I would ask the Minister to do his best for them. Their claims have been advocated by organisations all over the country, by county councils, by committees, and most Deputies have advocated their claims, too.  If their claims were not just, I do not think they would get so much support.  I feel sure if the Minister for Industry and Commerce wanted the money for some purpose, he would get it.  I hope that the Minister for Education will prove just as good a bargainer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> In relation to education, we are very fortunate in this country in one respect, that is, in the control and management of the various branches of education.  We have three different branches of education&mdash;I am not speaking about university education&mdash; primary, vocational and secondary.  In the primary branch, we have clerical managers.  They manage the schools and do the job very well.  Vocational education is taken care of by vocational committees almost outside the control of the State and secondary education is under the control of the laity and the religious bodies who run educational institutions.  If a system of education is State controlled, that situation is fraught with grave danger.  If education is used as an instrument of the State to mould political opinion, it can lead to very disastrous results, as it has done in other countries.  Therefore, our system of control of the schools in the various branches of education should be preserved and guarded.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest flaws in our present system of primary education is the school leaving age.  The school leaving age is 14.  That was determined by an inter-departmental committee. It is departmental policy but that policy is not now in conformity with current educational opinion.  We have the most eminent educational authorities stating that at 16 years a child has reached its highest intelligence.  I would suggest that the school leaving age should be raised at least to 15. That would be only following the lead of other countries which have, I suggest, a better educational system than ourselves.</P>
    <P>Teachers all over the country will tell you that a great defect in our system is the large classes in most of our schools.  Forty pupils in a class is a very common thing and the number ranges from 40 to 50, or even 100.  I know one case in my own town of Castlebar in which there are 100 pupils under the one teacher.  In that class it is absolutely impossible ever to keep order.  How can one teacher be expected to manage pupils of tender years&mdash;100 of them at the one time&mdash; and at the same time, teach a particular subject?  It is an absolute necessity <Col N="1481" /> to have something done about the large classes which are common in most of our schools.  It is not so bad in rural areas because the population there is dwindling due to emigration.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the problem of the retarded child.  By that, I mean a dull child.  That problem is made more difficult by the existence of those large classes.  We have completely and callously disregarded the situation of the dull child.  I do not think anything at all has been done to help such children and, naturally, help the parents, because no parent is content if his child is not as good as the others. Any child, even a dull child, has the right to be treated in the same way as any other pupil.</P>
    <P>Lately, the Council of Education recommended that the programme in the schools should be extended.  There are already seven subjects on the primary schools programme: Christian Doctrine, Irish, English, Arithmetic, History, Geography and Singing.  In some schools, in addition, we have Algebra and Geometry.  The Council of Education have recommended that three more subjects should be added. Their purpose in doing that is to relieve dulness and give variety to the programme.  I think that is impossible. The programme is already overloaded, and God knows any teacher has enough variety and he certainly has no dullness where he must manage 40 or 50 pupils, divided into three groups, and teach them two different subjects at the same time.  I can assure the House and the Council of Education that there is no lack of variety in any school, rural or urban. Time is not an elastic bag.  You cannot pack in 12 subjects into the time allotted in any primary school.</P>
    <P>It is very deplorable that our children must sit all day in dilapidated buildings.  Sometimes, those buildings are a menace to their very health. They are insanitary and totally inadequate. Deputy Dr. Browne stated here that there is an accumulation of arrears of £4,000,000 granted by the Department of Education to the Board of Words for school buildings.  I cannot understand that at all.  If it is true, <Col N="1482" /> it shows a terrific lack of capacity for work in the Board of Works.  This is a time when we have a building depression and 20,000 building workers are out of work.  If that money is available, and if arrears are accumulating, why not start a building campaign and in a few years' time most of those inadequate buildings will be demolished and replaced by new schools?  We all welcome the fact that this year £1.4 millions have been granted for the building of new schools.  We may ask questions during the year to see will this £1.4 millions be spent.  I do not see the use of granting money when that money will accumulate in arrears and will not be spent.</P>
    <P>Much comment has been made here during the last few days about the revival of the Irish language.  There are a few factors which militate against it.  The people to-day are so engrossed in earning their living and making ends meet that they have neither time for nor interest in something which will not return some material benefit to them.  They have lost interest in the language.</P>
    <P>Secondly, those people who know the language are so apathetic about speaking it that it has fallen into disuse. I know there is a mental effort involved in the speaking of Irish, but there are many people all over the country to-day who know more Irish than did people 100 years ago.  Yet they will not speak it.</P>
    <P>Parents have what might be described as a negative opposition to their children learning, or being forced to learn, Irish in the infant grades in the primary schools.  Deputy Dillon has commented on that already.  School-going children are bewildered enough in their first years at school, deprived of the company of their parents and taken out of the environment of their homes, without their being asked to communicate with one another in a language that is absolutely foreign to them.  To them, Irish is not their native tongue.  The Department should take steps to abolish compulsory Irish in the infant grades in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>In a foreign country a person can <Col N="1483" /> make himself intelligible if he has about 200 sentences to get along with. I suggest that a booklet should be issued to the schools here giving about 200 sentences and phrases in Irish and, at the end, there could be a glossary of words which could be put into their proper context when required.  In that way, children learning Irish would be able to make themselves intelligible. After all, we only want to revive Irish as a spoken language, not as the language.  I suggest that this booklet should be in use as high as the fifth class.  On reaching that class, children would have 200 or 300 sentences in which to make themselves intelligible to one another in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify one point.  This week about 22,000 candidates are sitting for the Intermediate Certificate and the Leaving Certificate throughout the country.  I have been approached on a few occasion about the system of marking.  I want the Minister to tell me, when he comes to reply, if the standard of marking is changed during the period in which the papers are corrected?  I have been informed that, if a paper proves too difficult and if too many candidates are failing in that particular paper, directions are issued by the Department to the examiners to go easy on that particular paper.  If that is true, then it is grossly unfair to those whose papers have already been corrected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>I do not propose to keep the Minister very long.  I am sure he is anxious to wind up this debate. I had not the privilege of being present to hear most of the speakers, but I have read what was said.  I was amazed to discover that the majority of the speakers here so far are satisfied with <Col N="1484" /> the progress made in the revival of Irish.  I was amazed to-day to hear Deputy MacCarthy, for whom I have nothing but the greatest respect, say that he was satisfied with the progress made.</P>
      <P>Make no mistake about it, the Irish language as a spoken language is dying, and dying fast.  It is not the Department of Education which will revive it. There is only one cradle of the Irish language, and that is the Gaeltacht. Unless we continue to rock the cradle, and if necessary spoonfeed the child, we shall succeed only in killing the child.  Deputy MacCarthy told the House that he is satisfied that the country is becoming Irish-speaking and will be an Irish-speaking country in a short time.  He quoted in support of his contention the work done in Ring and in some other colleges in West Cork. He said we could go down there and hear the pupils converse in Irish and see plays produced in Irish, all resulting in the production of Irish speakers. If the Deputy goes down to Maynooth he will hear the students there converse in Latin.  He will hear lectures delivered in Latin.  He will see plays produced in Latin.  But Latin is a dead language and will never become the spoken language of these students when they eventually graduate and leave Maynooth.  That is what will happen in the case of Irish.</P>
      <P>We shall, as a result of the present policy of the Department, turn Irish into a dead language.  We shall have a reading and a writing knowledge of it. We shall be able to speak it on occasions, but it will no longer be the spoken language of the people.  That unfortunately is the truth.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I represent what is probably the largest Gaeltacht area in the country.  We see the boundaries of that Gaeltacht shrinking every day.  We see the Irish speakers in that Gaeltacht emigrating.  What is even worse, we see those who remain turning to the English language and speaking English.  That is one of the tragedies of the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in full agreement with Deputy Kenny.  We should abolish compulsory Irish forthwith and, in lieu thereof, we should establish compulsory oral Irish <Col N="1485" /> classes where Irish would be taught through the Módh Díreach and through the phrase method.  We should revert to the type of elementary classes of the late Father Total and the late James Craig.  Let us forget about spelling. Let us go back to phonetics and hold oral Irish classes in which the language could be taught as it is spoken.</P>
    <P>It would pay us, I think, if, instead of voting moneys for the Department of Education for the revival of Irish, we handed that money over to Gael Linn or Comhaltas Uladh.  In that way we would do much more to revive Irish than we are doing by the present method.  I have the greatest respect for the present Minister.  I have not the same degree of respect for the Department and its policy.  Gael Linn are doing a wonderful job of work in reviving Irish.  Comhaltas Uladh&mdash;we have at least one executive member of that body in this House&mdash;are doing a wonderful job, too.</P>
    <P>Where is the use in people being able to speak the language if they will not speak it?  The Irish patriots to whom Deputy MacCarthy referred were just as anxious for the revival of Irish as the spoken language of the country as to see the country gain its freedom; they were thinking in terms of the spoken language and not the language taught in our schools to-day.  Now, Gael Linn and Comhaltas Uladh send a number of students each year to the Gaeltacht where they mingle with Irish speakers and speak nothing but Irish. It would be a step forward if the Department sponsored some such scheme and sent a certain percentage of elementary schoolchildren into the Gaeltacht for two or three months every year and then returned them to continuation oral Irish classes in the schools.  In that way we would have the householders of the Gaeltacht occupied continuously teaching these children and providing homes for them and the wherewithal to feed them.  That is one of the solutions for our problem.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is proposing to set up a commission to inquire into the best method of reviving the Irish language.  As sure as he does that, the language is finished.  We are sick, sore and tired of commissions, of reading <Col N="1486" /> the reports of commissions which are never implemented.  The old Cumann na nGaedheal Government did a very good thing when they set up the Gaeltacht Commission which put in a very good report.  Unfortunately that report was never implemented.  We know of several commissions which were set up and brought in excellent reports.  Members of these commissions devoted a considerable amount of time gratuitously to the study of the problem referred to them but we never got any further.  If we are going to set up a commission now to inquire into the language, in ten years we may get a report and in 25 years we may endeavour to implement it when the language has gone.</P>
    <P>Instead of setting up a commission the Minister should consult with Gael Linn, Comhaltas Uladh and other bodies in the South of which I am not aware, but which I am certain are also doing good work.  If the Minister consulted with them they might advise him as to the best method of reviving the spoken language, that is, provided we are satisfied it is the spoken language we want.  I hope something will be done and done very quickly. Otherwise the people who are left in the Gaeltacht will lose faith.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny referred to school buildings.  I think it was in or about 1919 that a principal teacher in the Gaeltacht was asked for a report on the sanitary accommodation in his schoolhouse and his reply was: &ldquo;Ten acres of mountain at the back of the school.&rdquo;  Unfortunately that is still true.  There are certain schools in this country without sanitary accommodation. Something should be done and done forthwith to remedy that serious lack of amenity which every schoolhouse should have.</P>
    <P>It reminds me of a case of which I have personal experience.  It was the case of Belcruit, a school in the Rosses of County Donegal in the Breac-Ghaeltacht. As a result of the efforts of the local authority the locality got a water supply, and within 21 feet of the school, piped water passed along the public road.  I asked the then Minister for Education if he would ensure <Col N="1487" /> that piped water would be laid on to the school.  I am not exaggerating when I say five different inspectors called at the schoolhouse for the purpose of investigating the necessity for laying on this water.  The matter was under consideration for 18 months.  I do not know what the cost of the travelling expenses of these inspectors was but at the end of 18 months I was informed by the Minister that it was not water that was necessary but a new school.</P>
    <P>I agreed with him that a new school was necessary.  I then asked him where did that school stand on the priority list and I was told that in about eight to ten years' time a new school would be erected in that locality and it would then be considered essential that water should be laid on.  I got a local plumber to give me an estimate of what it would cost to lay water on to the school and I received an estimate for £47 10s.  I am certain that the travelling expenses of the various inspectors who visited that school were much in excess of £47 10s.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to the ruling of the Chair but the position is that, as a result of the Minister's Estimate, we vote certain moneys for the erection and repair of schools.  I am referring to a method by which we could spend that money more beneficially than it is being spent.  If that £47 10s. had been expended on the laying on of water and the improvement of the amenities of that school there might be no necessity for a new school, because I can assure the Minister that if the Gaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht continue to dwindle, as they are dwindling, there will be no necessity to build schools in the locality at all. This was once a five-teacher school; it is now a two-teacher school.  It would be a waste of money to build a new school but it would not be a waste of money to lay on piped water to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputy referred to the teaching of history in our schools.  Some of our history books are far too biassed.  They <Col N="1488" /> are too recent and are inclined to give us a particular slant to recent events in Ireland.  I do not wish to go into the matter in detail but I suggest we should leave those events to future historians and should be very careful now what we inject into the minds of children.  I am not too satisfied that it may not be the history books now being used in the schools which have caused this unrest in the present generation and which have injected into the minds of the younger generation an admiration, which is possibly misplaced, of the heroes of which they read in their school books.  I do not wish to say any more than that about it in case I would be misconstrued.</P>
    <P>It would be a very good thing if outside every schoolhouse we had a flagstaff with the national emblem displayed there on festive occasions. There is nothing more galling than to see at Gaelic football, soccer matches and on other occasions the national flag displayed on carts, wheelbarrows and other such vehicles, not even horizontally. There should be a flagstaff outside each schoolhouse and the pupils should be taught the proper manner in which to fly the flag, when it should be flown and the material of which it should be composed.  That would do some good and the flag would be respected. I have seen the national flag with the component parts thereof not horizontal but parallel; I have seen the orange nearest the flagstaff, and so on.  That is all through lack of education and the Minister could do a considerable amount to remedy that.  It would not cost more than 30/- to erect a flagstaff outside the schoolhouse and to have a flag displayed there.  It should be possible also to have short instructive lectures given on it.</P>
    <P>We should also pay more attention to physical culture in our national schools.  In the old days, 20 or 30 years ago, if you motored or travelled on a side-car through the countryside you would see the children doing physical exercises.  It is very seldom you see it to-day.  You see it in the cities but very seldom in rural Ireland which is a mistake.  We want to build up the bodies as well as the minds of those children and it would be a good <Col N="1489" /> thing if we had an even balance between physical culture and mental training.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to discuss many of the other matters raised, but these things struck me, as a layman. If we do not keep the cradle of the Gaeltacht rocking&mdash;and the child, if necessary, spoon-fed&mdash;we shall soon kill the child in it and when he is gone, we shall find ourselves&mdash;just as the clerics do with Latin&mdash;with a knowledge of a dead language.</P>

      <P>This has been one of the most protracted debates on the Department of Education that we have had in this House, certainly in my period of ten years' membership.  It ranged over a varied field and many separate topics were introduced.  It was my intention, had the debate ended sooner, to take up as many points as I possibly could, but the variety to which I have referred makes it impossible for me to do so in any reasonable length of time. However, I can safely say there were three or four main topics which were common to most of the speeches.  If I refer to those in more detail and ignore others, perhaps I shall be doing sufficient in reply to this debate.</P>
      <P>A year ago, I listened to the debate on this Estimate, but I was not then in the same position as I am now to appreciate the points made and comment on them.  I am a little better equipped now; nevertheless, that is not to say that I consider myself at this stage an expert or anything like an expert on education.  I have, of course, the assistance of experts.  At this stage I might take up a point made by Deputy Esmonde, who said he found it peculiar that in a Department such as the Department of Education there were not teachers actually employed as officers of the Department.  The fact is, of course, that the technical staff, the inspectorial staff, is comprised exclusively of teachers.  These are the experts on whom I normally rely and on whom the Department normally relies, for guidance in matters affecting the mechanics of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The language&mdash;its restoration, the <Col N="1490" /> teaching of it and teaching through it &mdash;was possibly the principal topic.  I donot think I need make my position clear.  In common with every one of the Deputies who spoke it is my desire to see the language revived.  I do not expect that this will be done to the exclusion of English.  Some Deputies mentioned that English is a valuable possession and that it would be a pity to lose it.  I agree entirely.  Our Constitution recognises English as an official language, as it does Irish.  I believe that we could attain, and should aspire to attain, the stage when the people can speak Irish as fluently as they speak English.  That is my hope and I believe I express the wishes of the vast majority of Deputies and, in so far as they represent the electorate, it may be safely presumed that that is the desire of the majority of the people as well.</P>
    <P>Were it not for the imminent setting up of the commission to examine, not only the teaching of Irish and through Irish in the schools but other ways in which it is hoped to pursue the language in the after-school period, I might be expected to say more on this subject at this juncture.  As there is a commission about to act, I shall restrict what I might otherwise be tempted to say.  Nevertheless, I might point out that there is a variety of views, even amongst Deputies here, as to the methods which should be adopted.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have suggested that the Irish language should not be taught or even mentioned at all to infants coming into the schools.  Others suggested that it should be treated only as a single subject right through the school curriculum.  Others have suggested that it should be completely absent from the school curriculum up to the age of eight, nine or ten.  Many have failed to understand what the true position is.  I know that many of the teacher Deputies have tried, during the course of the debate, to correct the wrong impression amongst other Deputies and amongst the general public.</P>
    <P>For that reason it might be as well for me to comment briefly on the instructions given to teachers, as laid down in the 1926 National Programme <Col N="1491" /> Conference.  Some Deputies said that they assumed that this would be trotted out.  If that is the term, I am trotting it out, for the benefit of the House:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a teacher is competent to teach through Irish, and where the children can assimilate the instruction so given, the teacher should endeavour to extend the use of Irish as a medium of instruction as far as possible.  When these conditions do not exist, such teaching through Irish is not obligatory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the simple doctrine.  In the infant classes, where it is sought to teach Irish, I think Deputy Jones pointed out how that method is applied. He suggested, quite rightly, that there is no attempt to speak only Irish to the infant children coming in.  As he put it, the attempt is to go from the known to the unknown.  Most Deputies would agree that there is, in fact, no attempt to teach at all at that stage, rather than to instil impressions and instil some fundamental knowledge of arithmetic and of language.  The teaching of arithmetic if it can be called teaching of the subject, is limited to: &ldquo;a dó is a dó, sin a ceathair; a trí is a dó, sin a cúig.&rdquo;  I do not think that could be interpreted as a burden on the child. As Deputy Jones said, there is no attempt to confuse the child in trying to teach him these elementary things.</P>
    <P>With regard to the different views held as to the age at which the language should be introduced, the Council of Education examined that problem in some detail and came to certain conclusions.  At paragraph 210 of the Council of Education report, on page 142, they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To introduce Irish at the age of nine years or later would in the first place allow but little time for its teaching, even were the school leaving age to be raised, and would result in scarcely any oral command over the language being acquired by the average child in his school career.  The force of this contention will be realised when consideration is given to the extent of our curriculum, our difficulties of organisation, <Col N="1492" /> no matter what improvements may be made, our experience in the teaching of continental languages in secondary schools, and the force of extra school influences.  Secondly, common experience proves that at the age of ten years or so the child's imitative habits and ability to adapt his speech to new sounds become more limited and that his speech organs become less flexible and plastic.  Thirdly, the second language is more easily acquired in infancy by the same methods through which the child acquires his first language&mdash; imitation, play and activity.  The experience of parents whose children play with child-speakers of another language substantiates this, although much admittedly here depends on environment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on at paragraph 211 the Council of Education reports:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With few exceptions, the statements received by the council, where these contained a specific recommendation as to the age at which Irish should be introduced, suggested that its teaching should begin in the infant standards.  A large majority of our members accept this standpoint and they recommend accordingly that the teaching of Irish be introduced at the beginning of the primary school.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Still further on, at paragraph 235, having reviewed generally the submissions that were made to them, they say, at the end of that paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They do not, accordingly, suggest that any change be made in the present regulations regarding teaching through Irish.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Education set up that council and the personnel is widely known in the educational field and outside it.  The recommendations and submissions the council received came from groups, organisations and individuals well qualified to make these recommendations and submissions and the council was equally well qualified to sift them.  This is the majority recommendation and, in the light of it, it is difficult to understand why people attempt to lay down categorically alternative methods. <Col N="1493" /> Nevertheless, the council's task was not directed only to the teaching of Irish and the methods by which it might possibly be revived.  A new commission is about to be set up for that and for that reason I do not propose to comment further on the recommendations of the councils.</P>
    <P>I might say that in common with many other Deputies I am not satisfied with the progress that has been made. Much progress has been made; many more people know and understand Irish now than 20 years ago but I share the view very strongly that there is some reticence among those of us who know the language to speak it among ourselves.  Whether that is due to lack of some from of moral courage or not I do not know, but I believe the work done in the schools in teaching Irish is quite good.  If there was an adequate follow-up, the work done would fructify and we would be in a position to say and establish that the work of the teacher, particularly in the national school, is soundly based.</P>
    <P>In regard to the commission I should like to explain how it came about.  Some Deputies on the opposite side have spoken disparagingly of the intention to set it up.  I should like to remind them that it was as the result of a motion put down by some of their own colleagues in the Seanad that it was decided to set up this commission. I should say it was largely as a result of that motion because everybody must have realised that some further examination of the situation was necessary at this stage. Originally, the intention was to limit the terms of reference, to narrow these terms as suggested by the movers of the motion in the Seanad in order to concentrate on the schools, concentrate on how better to teach the Irish language in the schools and how better to relate it to the teaching of other subjects and how better to integrate it into the system of education.  That was the original intention because it was felt that the terms of the motion wandered over such a wide field that it would probably be difficult to get a positive recommendation from any council or commission.</P>
    <P>I should say at this stage that if <Col N="1494" /> these were to be the terms of reference, limiting the inquiry to what was being done in the schools, it would have been a matter for me to set up that commission and nominate the members of it but as a result of representations made to the Taoiseach, to me, and to other members of the Government by the movers of the motion in the Seanad and by other groups and organisations, the Government decided to have another look at the terms of reference.  As a result, these were extended so that not only would the teaching of the language in the schools come under review but also what other things can be done outside the schools in voluntary organisations, in business spheres and in other walks of life which can assist in the restoration of the language.</P>
    <P>For that reason the setting up of the commission has passed from me; it is now a matter for the Government. I believe the personnel is practically settled and the names will soon be announced, and no doubt at a very early stage the work of the commission will commence.  I think that fact alone should indicate that the Government is not satisfied with the progress that has been made in the restoration of the language.  I stated during the course of the Seanad debate that I was not personally satisfied either but I should like to support those Deputies who have stated that we have come a long way.  I can supplement what Deputy MacCarthy has said in regard to school festivals where we see young people in concert halls and other places throughout the country able to converse in the native language and able to put on plays, musical and straight, and other forms of entertainment on their own language.  I believe that is being done to a much greater extent at present than in the earlier years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred to the teaching of Irish as the teaching of a dead language.  I agree that to a large extent, and for many years, we have been, in my opinion, possibly paying too much attention to the written language and to grammar and it was for that reason I decided, shortly after assuming office, that examination should be made of how we might pay more attention to the oral aspect of <Col N="1495" /> learning the language and of teaching it.</P>
    <P>The decision to introduce the oral examination at the Leaving Certificate stage, I am glad to say, has been very well received by the House and the country.  There has been some question as to why it should not be introduced at an earlier stage.  Deputies will appreciate the practical difficulties involved in examining, say, 14,000 students rather than examining, say, 7,000 students, having regard to the availability of qualified personnel.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy, in particular, asked me if I would elaborate on the methods which were to be adopted in carrying out the test.  As he knows, and as I have already announced, it will be first carried out in conjunction with the Leaving Certificate Examination of 1960.  The marks obtainable by the candidate in the oral test and in the written paper, combined, will be the same maximum of 600, as applies at the present time.  In the early years, it is proposed to allow 500 of the marks to the written examination and 100 to the oral part of the examination. Later on, it is proposed to alter that ratio as to 200 for the oral test and 400 for the written paper.</P>
    <P>As I indicated when introducing the Estimate, the test will be carried out by secondary and national school inspectors.  There were not sufficient secondary school inspectors even to contemplate attempting the task.  The intention is that the candidates will sit for the test, in so far as is possible at all, in their own schools.</P>
    <P>An inspector will visit each of the schools some time during the final term before the Leaving Certificate Examination as a whole is taken.  A teacher from the school staff, nominated by the manager, will be permitted to sit in with the inspector during the period of the oral examination. It is intended that that will have the effect of putting the candidate at ease and of giving the teacher an opportunity of assessing the standard of the questions.  The teacher himself may put question but the alloting of marks will be a matter entirely for the inspector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> The Deputy also raised a question with regard to the time factor.  Assuming there are about 7,000 candidates&mdash; in fact, in 1957, there were 7,227 candidates&mdash;if we allot an average of 15 minutes per pupil that would give a total of 1,087 examining hours.  Assuming there was one examiner, and taking five hours a day, he would complete that work in 342 days.  We hope to have at least 40 examiners with the result that the number of examining days will be reduced to about eight or nine.  There will, however, be no intention of rushing the examination in order to conclude it within that period of eight or nine days.  If, as I believe we can do, the examinations will be completed within three weeks, I suggest that that, from the time point of view alone, would ensure a reasonably even standard of marking and also no one school could complain that another school got much more time to prepare for the examination.</P>
    <P>I mentioned a time of 15 minutes. That will not rigidly be adhered to. Some candidates will be able to satisfy the inspector, possibly, in seven or eight minutes, and some&mdash;perhaps due to reticence or lack of experience of this type of examination&mdash;might require a little further time.  The inspector might decide, in order, to give such a candidate a proper chance, to keep him, say, 18, 20 or even more minutes.  However, that would be a matter for discretion.</P>
    <P>There will be no question of trying to catch out my candidate.  The test will be one of conversational ability. There will be no question of seeking knowledge in the test.  It will not be a test of literature or folklore.  It will be a test to examine the ability of the candidate to express himself in Irish about day-to-day matters with which he himself is conversant.  The candidate's fluency, accuracy of speech and pronunciation will be the aim of the test.  It is intended at the start to include a short reading test by way of introduction and to help to put the candidate at his ease and at the same time to test his pronunciation and interpretation and to give material for conversation which could lead on to more general questions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> I have already got a draft scheme which details the basis on which the examiners will award marks&mdash;how these marks are to be allocated, and so on. Apart from the question of the propriety of issuing instructions to examiners beforehand, it may be that the scheme will be modified in some detail later, on further consideration.  Specific and full instructions will be given to all the examiners.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the introduction of an oral test may not be quite right in a competitive examination such as the Leaving Certificate now is in relation to many posts and many entrance scholarships to universities. However, when one thinks of Civil Service examinations of different kinds, one will realise that the Civil Service Commissioners can work those oral Irish tests very well from the competitive point of view and there is no reason why it should not be done also in the Leaving Certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  The inspectors who will be conducting these examinations have experience of oral tests for other purposes as well.  Deputy Mulcahy knows that they are experienced in the Easter orals in which they have to examine a large number of pupils.  A fairly large team of inspectors have to undertake those tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, in relation to the written examination papers, a big number of examiners have to be recruited and, by the methods the <Col N="1498" /> Department has of co-ordinating the standard, it can generally be assumed that a fair and even standard is adhered to in written tests.  I believe the same can be done in the oral tests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that it is a very different atmosphere and I would ask him to consider the very small number of marks which divide people on the scholarship side.  Two hundred marks for an oral test provide a very great margin for error.  The Minister, I am sure, is aware of the kind of supervision and watchfulness that has to take place even in regard to written examinations.  Does he anticipate there will be any kind of scheme that can reasonably be worked with regard to the oral examination, or does he consider there will be any kind of an appeal board for doubtful cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could promise an appeal board.  In the first place the oral Irish part of the test will not be a failing part of this examination.  If a candidate fails to get any marks in the oral test he does not fail the examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking of it at scholarship level, at competitive level rather than at qualifying level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no question of an appeal board.  The presence of the teacher himself will ensure that a good candidate, a good pupil, will not be &ldquo;knocked&rdquo; unfairly.  That will be one of the purposes of it.  In any case we can only do our best to ensure an even standard of marking and I do not believe it will be impossible of achievement.  I do not think I would feel justified in refusing to introduce this test only on the grounds that we feared an equitable standard would not be maintained.  I should say, too, that there will be a corresponding reduction in the amount of prescribed texts on the written side in order to enable the necessary concentration to be given to the oral test, and to the preparing of students for the oral test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also asked me for some further information about the marriage ban, but, before I come to that, Deputy Dr. Browne described this as <Col N="1499" />&ldquo;a miserly contribution&rdquo; towards the solution of our problem.  I remember last year, about this stage in the course of the Estimate debate, Deputy Dr. Browne put me the question as to what my views were on the compulsory retirement of married women teachers and I answered him, without examining the question very carefully &mdash;in fact I had not given it any real thought at the time&mdash;by saying that I thought it was a great waste of teaching power.  I am very glad I gave that answer because, having examined the situation, I was more convinced of the truth of what I said on that occasion.</P>
    <P>During the course of the year Deputy Dr. Browne pressed me on a number of occasions&mdash;at least twice&mdash;as to what I was going to do about it.  He obviously made a fairly big issue of it then.  He attached some importance to it and now he describes it as &ldquo;a miserly contribution&rdquo; to our problem of pupil-teacher ratio.  The &ldquo;miserly contribution&rdquo; has been made and I should like to clarify the situation in regard to some aspects of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy requested information as to how the revocation of the marriage rule would operate and what the significance of the 1st July is.  It is the intention that, subject to the rules and regulations for national schools, the revocation of the rule should apply in the case of all teachers who were, as a result of it, required to retire on marriage.  The 1st July is the beginning of the school year and, consequently, is an appropriate date for the re-entry of such teachers into recognised teaching service.  These teachers on re-entry will be placed on the salary point corresponding to the point they had reached before retirement on marriage, and will be allowed to proceed therefrom by normal increments to the maximum of the scale. In order that those of them to whom a marriage gratuity was paid may have their service previous to marriage reckoned for pension purposes they will within such period as may be decided on by the Department be required to refund the gratuity.</P>
    <P>Teachers serving in a recognised capacity before the 1st July to whom the marriage rule applied, who marry <Col N="1500" /> on or after that date and retire from teaching, would not under the terms of the existing superannuation schemes be eligible for a marriage gratuity.  I feel, however, that such teachers should, taking everything into account, be given a marriage gratuity subject to the normal conditions and I intend to have the superannuation schemes amended so as to enable a marriage gratuity to be paid in these cases.  A teacher in this latter category who re-enters the teaching service subsequently will be required, in order that her service prior to marriage may be reckoned for pension purposes, to refund the marriage gratuity over such period and with the addition of compound interest at such rate as may be determined.  Women teachers entering recognised national teaching service for the first time on or after the 1st July next will not be eligible for a marriage gratuity.</P>
    <P>Since the decision was announced there has been much newspaper comment on it.  Rather, I should say there has been much correspondence published in newspapers about the effect it will have on teachers who will come into service for the first time after the examinations held in the training colleges this year&mdash;in other words the final year students.  It has been suggested that many of them will have to emigrate, that there will be no jobs for them.  I want to say here and now that not one of these teachers will be denied a job.  In fact, they will have the choice of two or three jobs at the beginning of the school year.  It may be that some of the jobs they would like to get in Dublin, Cork and Limerick may not be available to them but, in the parts of the country where it is most necessary to have trained teachers, in parts of the country where there is no further education beyond the primary school level, there will be plenty of jobs available for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked me on what grounds from a social point of view the decision was made.  In the first place I consider it my duty to provide the highest possible form of education for all our children and, in order to do that, I think it is my duty also to ensure that, wherever possible, trained <Col N="1501" /> teachers will be available.  The system that was growing up of unqualified teachers being appointed to schools, particularly in remote parts, was in my opinion unjustified and intolerable. The fact was that in many cases school managers were finding it increasingly difficult to recruit teachers to remote schools and, even if they did recruit trained teachers, they found it impossible to retain them there.  The employment of so many untrained teachers is educationally indefensible. Even the provision of more training facilities would not of itself overcome the problem for a considerable time ahead.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the fact that it was largely to the remote parts of the country trained teachers were most reluctant to go, and that having taken up positions in them, they were most reluctant to stay there.  A young woman trained teacher was very unlikely, facing the prospect of compulsory retirement on marriage, to remain in a remote area.  The natural tendency was to gravitate towards the bigger centres of population, particularly Dublin.  Managers of schools were complaining that there were frequent changes of personnel, that a trained teacher would come to a school and, getting an offer of a job in a more populous area, would leave after a very short period, and this was having a detrimental effect on the education of the children.</P>
    <P>Approximately 105 trained teachers retire each year.  These teachers, on their retirement, have an average of 11 years' service.  I gave it as my opinion before that many of them retired when they were coming to the peak of their teaching capacity.  I thought, and still think, that it represented a serious loss to the State of so much teaching capacity at an age when women are best able to teach.</P>
    <P>With regard to the objection to mothers teaching in school, on the contrary, I think that a mother has poise and maturity that give her a special advantage in teaching; that give her a special advantage in relation to the children she controls and, in particular, in dealing with parents and helping and advising them as to <Col N="1502" /> the progress of their children and as to the careers their children might well follow.  In the past, as we all know, many rural communities revolved around the married teachers, the husband and wife, teaching in the same schools.  It was a wonderful advantage to a locality.  Many Deputies have made the point that, as a result of not having adequate teaching facilities and trained teachers, many young people leave a particular area. Therefore, the removal of the ban, I believe, will lead to greater stability and less frequent changes.</P>
    <P>In addition, a woman who could look forward to teaching, if she so wished, after her marriage would in the early years apply herself much more effectively to her profession and even in the early years would become a more efficient teacher.  The fact remains, also, that some 235 married women teachers are already accepted into the service in different parts of the country in a temporary capacity.</P>
    <P>Therefore, having regard to the advantages that I have outlined, having regard to the fundamental fact that our first duty is to provide the best possible system of education and, <i>a fortiori</i>, the best standard of teachers&mdash;that means trained teachers &mdash;I think the decision is unassailable. I want to repeat, and I hope it will get all the publicity it possibly can, that no teacher leaving the training college this summer need be without a job in Ireland in the autumn and that will apply in the foreseeable future and, as I said already, they will have the choice of perhaps two or three jobs, but not necessarily in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne early in his remarks referred to our system of education in rather disparaging terms. He described it as unjust, ramshackle and in a few other extravagant terms. He compared it with other systems in Europe and in the world.  I do not know what special qualifications Deputy Dr. Browne has to come to the conclusion that our system is ramshackle, antediluvian, unjust, in comparison with other systems.  I have said, and will repeat, that I believe our system is fundamentally sound, that perhaps within the structure there <Col N="1503" /> may be defects but, within the structure, we still can cure many of these defects.</P>
    <P>I was criticised in some newspaper editorials, following the introduction of the Estimate, for being naïve, for having some illusions and for being unable to take criticism.  There was editorial comment in the <i>Irish Times</i> and in the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  The <i>Irish Times</i> started by saying how rapidly young Ministers slide into a departmental groove.  I suppose they could have added how slowly they slide into the <i>Irish Times</i> groove.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 27th May, in criticising me, entitled its leader &ldquo;Freedom of Opinion&rdquo; and seemed to imply something sinister by drawing in the Hitler régime in Germany and referring to the freedom of opinion and freedom of speech that were permitted there during that period.</P>
    <P>I do not condemn newspaper criticism and I hope that we shall never see the day in this country that in ordinary circumstances the freedom of the Press will be in any way restricted. Freedom of the Press, I suppose, is synonymous with power of the Press to a certain extent but freedom, like power, can be abused.  Every newspaper has the right to criticise our Government, to criticise the method of election of the Government and to criticise its administration and various aspects of its administration. Editorials, so far as they express a view of a section or cross-section of the people, have their value and I think I could say the same about letters written to the newspapers and published in them.  People who feel so strongly about any particular subject that they are impelled to write to the newspapers are entitled to do so but, in doing so, they ought to identify themselves.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, often it is not prudent or even practicable for Press correspondents to do so but letters appearing in the Press over <i>noms-de-plume</i> lose much of their potency.  However, if newspaper editorials and letters to the papers make criticism and comment to <Col N="1504" /> the point of being unfair, whether it is unfair in respect of the administration of a Department of State or even of an individual, I am sure those who can speak on behalf of the Department and the individual concerned are not expected to hang their heads in shame and to say, &ldquo;<i>mea oulpa</i>&rdquo;.  I believe they are entitled to meet unfair criticism if they think it is unfair.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Times</i> editorial complained that I had not mentioned whether the newspaper campaign to which I referred was contained in one or more newspapers.  I would like in passing to refer to some of the articles which I had in mind when I spoke in the manner in which I did.  The <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 29th December, in an editorial entitled &ldquo;Your Children Have To Suffer&rdquo; said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The facts are beyond controversy. These children face the world as semi-illiterates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is referring to children leaving the national schools and continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They can scarcely write or read. Arithmetic, geography, history and other elementary subjects are little more than names to them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Lower down, it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;50,000 Irish boys and girls who finish their education&mdash;save the mark &mdash;at the age of 14 are destined for the emigrant ship.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that is fair criticism.  I do not think such remarks are temperate and for that reason I saw fit to criticise what the <i>Sunday Independent</i> said, but I am not the only one who thought that what was contained in these editorials&mdash;they were a sequence in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>&mdash;was not in accordance with the facts.  In this respect, I should like to tie in the I.N.T.O. statement in reference to these editorials, and in reference to Deputy Dr. Browne's opinion of our system of education, in relation to that which they have in other countries and in relation to the products of the systems of education.</P>
    <P>The secretary of the I.N.T.O. wrote to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and his letter was published on 12th January, 1958.  It read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" />&ldquo;The C.E.C. of the I.N.T.O. desire to challenge the misleading statements made in the special article and editorial in recent issues of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> regarding the standard of education reached in Irish primary schools.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From the ample opportunities available to their members to make a comparative assessment of the educational standards reached in other countries, and from the opinions expressed by visiting educationists, they have no hesitation in saying that the attainments of children, age for age, in our primary schools, in subjects other that Irish, are at least as high as, if not higher than, those which obtain in any other English speaking country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that Deputy Dr. Browne, like myself, will take that organisation as being a body with the necessary knowledge and authority to speak on educational subjects, and also as a body which has made a study of the educational systems in other countries. However, as I said in my opening statement, I am not suggesting that all is right with our system.  I say that it is sound and that we can seek solutions of our problems on the basis on which it is standing at the present time.</P>
    <P>Corporal punishment was among the matters alluded to during the course of the debate.  I am glad to note that not one Deputy agreed with the views expressed by Deputy Dr. Browne.  I know he is convinced of the justice of the point of view which he holds, but I think that some corporal punishment is necessary.  I can never understand why this expression &ldquo;corporal punishment&rdquo; is used so often to-day.  In less extravagant days, people called it slapping or &ldquo;biffing&rdquo;.  The rule, as Deputies know, is that children may be slapped on the open hand. When some questions were put down on this subject during the course of the last year, I looked up what material there was in the Department.</P>
    <P>I was amused to come across a reference to the subject in the <i>Irish School Monthly</i> for March, 1955, entitled <Col N="1506" />&ldquo;Punishment in the Schools&rdquo;. It referred to a country which, beyond saying any more about it, is a friendly democracy, and where, it says, physical punishment in the schools is forbidden and as a result juvenile delinquency has practically disappeared, only to be replaced by adult delinquency by juveniles.  It goes on to give some general examples of that adult delinquency, which I need not go into, and refers to it as having reached terrifying proportions.</P>
    <P>I might say, too, that in his Encyclical Letter&mdash;Divini Illius Magistri&mdash;on the Christian Education of Youth, Pope Pius XII said that disorderly inclinations amongst children must be corrected. That was a direct reference to methods of correction.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister realise that there are thousands of schools in which corporal punishment is not used in other countries and in which they get good results?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>I will not deny it.  In many other countries, the teacher may not administer corporal punishment, but he refers the pupils to the headmaster of the school.  Generally, I should like to say that I do not think Deputy Dr. Browne will deny the parents' right to correct their children in a fair manner.  The child, as we seek to establish in this country, is given into the custody of the school manager, and while the child is there, the manager is <i>in loco parentis</i> and, to a large extent, he carries all the powers and rights of the parent.  Certainly, by implication, he carries the power of correction, whether or not it is delegated to the teacher.  Irish teachers are not sadists and only in very rare instances do we get a case where a teacher might have gone beyond the limits, but, as Deputy Russell pointed out, there are remedies for that and they are readily availed of.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies referred to the numbers in preparatory colleges and the favour given to candidates from Gaeltacht areas in the preparatory colleges entrance examination compared with those from other areas.  In preparatory colleges, 25 per cent. of the places are reserved for students from the Gaeltacht areas and in entering the training colleges 25 per cent. of the places are reserved for those coming from preparatory colleges which, I said, includes 75 per cent. from the rest of the country and 25 per cent. students from the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies referred to the necessity for integration of our system. I think it was Deputy Dooley, in particular, who made a special point of it. I should like to ask him what does he mean by integration.  I believe there is a reasonable degree of integration. Does he suggest that we should have a system such as they have in England, the 11-plus&mdash;or as it might be applied here, 12-plus or 13-plus&mdash;where a child at a certain age is asked to undergo an examination and on the results of that is directed into one school or another&mdash;to the secondary school, as we know it, or the vocational school? In the first place, such a system would not work in this country, and I might say that the parents here would not tolerate a situation where the State could decide and require that a child, at 11, 12 or 13, shall enter a particular type of school and may not enter another type of school, that he shall become a student of, say, a vocational school and not of a secondary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies&mdash;Deputy Corish, in particular&mdash;referred to the necessity <Col N="1508" /> for vocational guidance.  That is a very big problem.  It has been well tackled in many other countries, but, by and large, I believe our children are getting a reasonable degree of vocational guidance by reason of the cooperation between parents and teachers.  Parents are possibly in a better position than teachers to decide what vocation their child should follow.  The combination of parent and teacher would be sufficient to ensure that the child is pursuing the avocation to which he is best suited. To have an established system of vocational guidance would require specialists, psychiatrists and others, who would require special training in the universities.  At the moment, we have not such; and I do not think there is any point in suggesting that we should, at this stage at any rate, establish a vocational guidance scheme without the necessary personnel to undertake it.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, they probably had some such scheme in Napoleon's time.  I have read Holland Rose's <i>Life of Napoleon</i> in which he refers to the school report when Napoleon left the junior military school at Brienne at the age of 15.  The following were the comments in the report: &ldquo;Constitution: healthy, excellent; character: submissive, sweet, honest, grateful; conduct: very regular.  Has always distinguished himself by his application to mathematics.  Knows history and geography passably.  Very weak in accomplishments.  He will be an excellent seaman.&rdquo;  Perhaps if he had been a seaman, the world might be a better place; but that is beside the point.</P>

      <P>The next major point made was in regard to school buildings and the slowness in providing replacements for schools which are now described as unsuitable.  As Deputy Dr. Browne has said, unfortunately the number has been increasing.  It is not so much that the rate of progress has been decreasing, but that the standard has been increasing and the system of inspection is bringing to <Col N="1509" /> light schools that, in varying degrees, are in need of repair or reconstruction. I should like to say, as has been said during a number of debates in the present session, that it is not the intention to cut down on school buildings during the present year.  The money provided last year was something in the region of £1,500,000, but it was unexpended to the extent of £300,000.  In fact, I think it is more. The figure in the Estimate this year is £1,400,000.  I hope it will be a more realistic figure and that we will be able to absorb the money provided.</P>
      <P>It has been admitted that there is a back-log in the money sanctioned by the Department compared with the actual amount spent by the Board of Works&mdash;something short of £4,000,000. Unfortunately, that does not necessarily mean that the money is there waiting to be spent.  It was provided according as the schools were provided. I should like to say generally in respect of the problem that the number of schools provided in a particular year does not necessarily represent the volume of school buildings or the number of children being catered for in these schools.  The fact that 45 schools were erected in one year and 50 in the next does not necessarily mean that, in the year 45 were built, fewer children were catered for.</P>
      <P>For some years past, a large part of the school building programme has been taken up with the provision of schools in slum clearance areas&mdash;new housing areas in the larger centres such as Dublin, Cork and, to some extent, Limerick.  These were very big schools, some of them costing up to £300,000.  The result was that it took a very large slice out of the money available.  That programme of building new schools in new housing areas is very near completion and it will release more money and effort to provide the smaller schools required in different parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies expressed themselves dissatisfied with the rate of the building programme.  I want to say that I am dissatisfied, too.  I do not know where all the blame lies.  I do not know that the blame must necessarily lie at the door of the Office of Public <Col N="1510" /> Works.  I am not sure whether or not the system under which they work restricts their capacity to provide the need, but I intend to find out, and I hope that the tempo will increase in the coming years.</P>
    <P>I do not think there were very many other important matters raised during the course of the debate.  The last speaker was Deputy O'Donnell.  I do not know whether I should describe him as a defeatist or a realist in regard to the Irish language, but I do hope that the outlook he has is not general among the people who live in the Gaeltacht.  As far as I can see, he ignores the effort being made in the schools for the revival of the language and says that, unless we pump all our available money into the Gaeltacht, even to the extent of suckling it like a baby in a cradle, no matter what we do, the revival will fail.  I believe that is a defeatist view and I hope it is not the general view.</P>
    <P>There are so many other matters to which I could refer, I would be only delaying the House by following them up.  Some of the points made by Deputies were common, one with the other.  Some of the criticisms were made on false premises.  I do not want to chase each one.</P>

      <P>I think it is of vital importance, from the point of view of what one might call the main road along which the educational scheme is running, that the Minister should address himself to, and try to give some information on, the points I raised in respect of the recommendations of the Council of Education which indicated that a certain changed curriculum ought to be introduced up to 12 years of age.  I am sure the Minister appreciates that until that is settled, the additional examinations required to be made in the primary schools cannot be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First and foremost, there is the further examination of the general position in regard to education in the <Col N="1511" /> national schools, the easing of the size of classes and the provision of additional teachers.  That is a matter upon which we want to have some information from the Minister.  We should like to know what progress he is making in coming to a decision along the lines of the changed curriculum, on the one hand, and the easing of the staffing situation in relation to particular schools, on the other.  To what extent has he reached a point at which he can come to some conclusion enabling him to discuss the problems involved with both the teachers and the managers?</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that there is in that arena a matter of vital importance if the very necessary examination of the post-12 in the national schools, the position in the continuation and vocational schools is to be pursued.  He will shortly have in his hands the report of the Council of Education on that curriculum in the secondary schools.  Apart altogether from that, the whole position with regard to the teaching and the curriculum in the primary schools is a matter about which some decision should be taken forthwith.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;speak about the number of subjects they are required to teach and referring, in particular, to the three extra subjects&mdash;drawing, rural science and physical training&mdash; which the Council of Education suggested should be introduced as well. The first step towards achieving the ability to implement that recommendation is the provision of trained teachers.  The revocation of the marriage ban will assist to some extent and when we achieve the stage of having only trained teachers in all the schools, we will then be in a position, by reason of the number of teachers available, to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.  It is only then&mdash;I think the <Col N="1512" /> Deputy will agree with me&mdash;that we can contemplate teaching these extra subjects.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them are being taught at the moment.  In any case, their introduction would be gradual.  Could the Minister go so far as to come to a conclusion on the desirability of having these subjects introduced and then put himself into a position, in relation to the teachers, in which policy was flowing in that direction so that those who are interested in the policy and content of education in the national schools would know what the ideal was and what the day-to-day or year-to-year movement was?

      <P>The council did recommend an advisory research group within the Department.  I propose to implement that.  Whether that group will take over some of the recommendations and examine them in relation to their implementation is a matter upon which I cannot give a definite decision at the moment.  With regard to the future of the council itself, I prefer to wait.  I must admit I have not contemplated what other tasks it might be asked to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> As the House has given me another chance, I want to refer to the figures quoted by Deputy Dr. Browne.  He stated unequivocally that the majority of our children finished their education at 14 and 15 years of age at the latest. By mishandling figures, he proceeded then to prove to himself that two-thirds of our children receive no formal education after 14 years of age. In the process, he obviously related the total number of pupils in secondary and vocational schools to the number in national schools and, in doing so, he ignored age groups and did not take into account secondary tops in national schools.</P>
    <P>The factual position is that, roughly, two-thirds of our children between 14 and 15 receive whole-time education. Many of the balance receive part-time education.  In the 14 to 16 age group, there are approximately 125,000 children. Of these, 18,000 still attend the national schools; 40,000 attend secondary schools; 20,000 full-time vocational courses, making in all a vocational courses, making in all a total of 86,000.  On a percentage basis, 86,000 out of 125,000 is, roughly, 70 per cent.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,055,280 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1959, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office and for payment of certain Subsidies and Sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total Estimate of £1,583,280 for Industry and Commerce for the year 1958-59 compares with a total of £3,287,370 granted for the year 1957-58. The provision for this year therefore <Col N="1517" /> shows a net reduction of £1,704,090 as compared with the provision for last year.  In this comparison the amount provided in 1957-58 for losses on the disposal of surplus native wheat is not included in the 1957-58 figure of £3,287,370 as this service has been transferred to the Department of Agriculture and is provided for in 1958-59 in Vote 26&mdash;Agriculture, and has been dealt with on the Estimate for that Vote.</P>
    <P>The principal increases are in the grant for the provision of additional laboratories for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards (sub-head N (4)) £46,000; Grants-in-Aid to the Industrial Development Authority (sub-heads O (1) and C (4)) £20,000 and £50,000; Grant-in-Aid to An Foras Tionscal (sub-head Q (1)) £50,000; grants for Technical Assistance (sub-head T) £67,000; and Fuel Subsidy £85,000.</P>
    <P>The principal decreases are in the provision for salaries, wages and allowances of the headquarters staff (sub-head A) £21,000 and in the amount provided for food subsidies (sub-head J (1)) £1,930,000.  The decrease of £20,940 under sub-head A is mainly due to a reduction in the headquarters staff from 602 in 1957-58 to 567 in 1958-59.</P>
    <P>A token sum has been provided under sub-head J (1) for flour subsidy to meet any expenditure that may arise during the year arising out of the final examination of the accounts and claims in respect of previous years.  This is purely a precautionary provision.</P>
    <P>Industrial production and industrial employment which had suffered a severe set-back in 1956 showed signs of recovery during 1957.  In the December quarter of 1957 a slight increase over the corresponding period in 1956 was disclosed and this was the first occasion since March, 1956 on which the quarterly figures were at a higher level than in the corresponding period of the previous year.  For the December quarter of 1957 the volume of production index (to base 1953=100) of transportable goods industries was 108.8 as compared with 100.1 in the December quarter of 1956; and the number of persons engaged in these <Col N="1518" /> industries in December, 1957 was 151,200 as compared with 150,600 in December, 1956.  The outcome of 1957, therefore, so far as industry is concerned, was that, as a result of special measures taken to stimulate expansion, the decline in activity was arrested and the process of recovery begun.</P>
    <P>The special measures taken in 1957 included the removal of special import levies on a number of commodities, and the granting of licences for the importation, free of special import levy, of materials intended for a process of manufacture or for the equipment of an industrial undertaking; the removal of restrictions on hire-purchase transactions; and the provision of tax reliefs for industry, including an extension of the tax concessions in respect of profits derived from industrial exports.</P>
    <P>There are grounds for confidence that the recovery in industrial production will continue.  The increase in the first quarter of 1958 was 7 per cent. over the same period of 1957, notwithstanding the fairly considerable upsets caused by the shipping dispute during that period.  Employment in industry was 1½ per cent. higher than in the same period of last year and earnings per worker were 7½ per cent. higher.  I am far from suggesting that there is any justification for complacancy regarding any aspect of our industrial, financial or economic position.  To recover lost ground is not enough; our policy and objective is to expand and develop industrial activity beyond the point of meeting the normal needs of the home market, so that Irish products may find in increasing degree an economic outlet in the markets of the world.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with specific matters, I should make a brief statement upon the basic policy of the Government in the industrial field.  We believe that, if economic progress is to be maintained and the problems of excessive unemployment and emigration ended, public and private investment in developments of a productive character must be stimulated and organised.</P>
    <P>Increased investment in productive development cannot alone guarantee permanent progress.  The adoption of <Col N="1519" /> the most modern methods and techniques in production, efficient management, and the will to work harder at all levels of activity, in the manager's office no less than on the factory floor, are also essential.</P>
    <P>Financial policy must be in harmony with the objective of stimulating a higher level of investment, that is to say, it must encourage savings and help their canalisation into productive enterprise.  Wage policy, of employers and workers, must be directed towards maintaining competitive costs by facilitating the rise of productivity. Banks and insurance companies must join with the Government in providing long-term capital for industry, through the Industrial Credit Company or otherwise, and provide the shorter-term credits required by progressive firms, if their trade expansion is to be made possible.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to welcome the announcement made last week by the chairman of one important Irish assurance company, the New Ireland Assurance Company, of that concern's willingness to provide capital for industry.  I should also mention with approval the movement which is gaining momentum and which began, I believe, amongst the workers employed by the firm of Messrs. Arthur Guinness and Co., to save in an organised way for the purpose of creating new capital, to establish new employment-giving industries.  That development is a most encouraging sign, both of the growing understanding of the character of the national problem and of the desire to do something practical about it.</P>
    <P>While it is in agriculture that the immediate potentialities of increased production are greatest, the expansion of industrial activity is necessary to achieve a better balance in the economy, and is beyond argument, the most speedy means of improving employment prospects.</P>
    <P>We can no longer rely for industrial development, to the extent we require it, on the policy of protection.  Export trade is most essential to our industrial growth and in its development <Col N="1520" /> we can apply the policy of attracting external investment into Irish industry and encourage the advent of foreign industrialists bringing with them new skills and techniques, and established market contacts.</P>
    <P>Restrictive practices of a character which operate to the detriment of industrial progress must be eliminated by a more enlightened approach by employers and by workers to the requirements of a developing economy. Joint consultation leading to common policy in these matters must be encouraged.  Following on a statement which I made during the course of the Budget debate, I had a discussion last week with the representatives of the United Trade Union Organisation on the practicability of examining, on an industry basis, the possibilities and problems of achieving expanded production and employment.  It is too soon to say what may prove to be possible in that regard, but I consider that the definition in general discussion of reliable targets for expansion of industrial activities would be both a help and a stimulus.</P>
    <P>The measures taken, and being taken, to encourage and induce greater industrial development are already well known to the House.  An intensified drive is now being made to attract external industrial participation, in new forms of industrial activity particularly those with export possibilities. That drive is being organised by the Industrial Development Authority who have informed me that their experience so far entitles them to be optimistic as to the eventual outcome.  I have no doubt that the announcement of the Government's intention to extend the period of the tax relief for exports profits to ten years will give increased impetus to that campaign.  The Industrial Development Authority are actively pursuing their efforts to attract industrialists from U.S.A., Britain and Europe, and already a number of firms have started or have decided to start here.  As the House is aware, the object of the Industrial Development (Encouragement of External Investment) Bill is to encourage and facilitate external capital investment in the establishment <Col N="1521" /> of industrial projects aimed at the development of exports.</P>
    <P>Government policy and Government action can achieve a certain amount, but unless supported by the whole-hearted co-operation of all the interests concerned, satisfactory progress will not be realised.  There are very encouraging signs that industrial managements and industrial trade unions alike are becoming increasingly aware of the necessity for reaching and maintaining the highest standards of efficiency and productivity if we are to expand our economy and provide full employment at home for our people.</P>
    <P>In that connection I think I should refer to the technical assistance scheme for industry.  Under an agreement entered into with the U.S. Government, a sum of money was provided out of the Grant Counterpart Fund for the purpose of making available to industrial firms grants towards the cost of engaging industrial consultants and technical experts, with a view to improving efficiency and productivity. The amount set aside from the Counterpart Fund proved to be insufficient to meet the demand which was in itself satisfactory and the Government, in consideration of the importance of measures designed to achieve higher standards of production, decided to provide an additional sum out of which technical assistance grants may be made in the current financial year.  These grants will, in general, be made on the basis of one-third of the total cost of each technical assistance project.</P>
    <P>During the past year the Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Act, 1957, became law, and under that legislation the maximum aggregate of grants which can be made by An Foras Tionscal for the establishment of factories in the undeveloped areas was increased from £2,000,000 to £4,000,000. During the year the volume of grants approved by An Foras Tionscal for industrial development in these western areas continued to increase and amounted to £876,960 compared with £497,900 in the previous financial year. On 31st March last, the total commitments of An Foras Tionscal in respect <Col N="1522" /> of grants under that Act amounted to £2,078,588, of which £710,348 had been paid, leaving outstanding commitments of £1,368,210.</P>
    <P>Up to now 32 projects which have reached the production stage were assisted by An Foras Tionscal and employ at present about 1,500 persons.  It is expected that in the course of their normal development the employment given by them will rise to 3,000 persons. There are 21 further projects in respect of which assistance has been promised but which have not yet reached the production stage.  Certain of the industries assisted by An Foras Tionscal have already entered the export field.</P>
    <P>A number of projects which have not yet reached the production stage have been planned primarily on an export basis and if the promoters' plans come to fruition these projects should make a significant contribution to our export potential.</P>
    <P>Under the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, the Industrial Development Authority approved of grants totalling £193,850 of which £9,000 was actually paid leaving outstanding commitments of £184,850 at the end of the previous financial year.  It is, perhaps, worthy of note and may be of interest to the Dáil, that a substantial number of the applications received by the authority for grants under that Acts so far did not come within the ambit of the Act.</P>
    <P>There exists, perhaps, a position which we can, and must at some future time, examine.  There has been some recent comment to the effect that we have too many authorities concerned with industrial development.  Because I have examined the position, I think I can say that nothing has been lost or unduly delayed for that reason.  I think there is a situation existing which needs looking into and I intend to do that.</P>
    <P>The general fall in the world price of metals has caused some setback in mineral exploration and developments in this country.  Some of the exploratory work which has been proceeding has now ceased and a couple of producing mines have ceased production.  I think that it is reasonably certain that <Col N="1523" /> metal prices must recover at some time, and we can hope that it will be fairly soon so that exploration and production will be resumed in the areas which have been affected by the fall in world prices.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, a loan of over £1,300,000 has been guaranteed in favour of St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd. in connection with the development of the copper deposits at Avoca. The company is proceeding with its plans for the development of the deposits and it is expected that the mines will be ready to go into production about August or September next.  It is to be presumed that the policy of the company to which the mine has been leased, in regard to the commencement of production, will be decided in the light of the world market price trend for copper which then prevails.  It is to be hoped that there will be before then a substantial rise in the world price for copper which, as we know, fell to very low levels of late.  There have been some signs of recovery in recent weeks, but the price has not yet risen to the point which the management of the mines regard as their &ldquo;break-even&rdquo; level.</P>
    <P>A technical assistance scheme of coal exploration in the Leinster and Connaught coalfields will shortly be launched.  The scheme will be financed by an E.C.A. grant of £80,000 from the Counterpart Fund.  It is hoped that this scheme will reveal valuable new deposits of coal both in the vicinity of existing coal mines and in virgin ground.  The main emphasis will be in the Leinster coalfields area.  The scheme which will take about three years to complete will also include experiments in coal cleaning techniques. It is hoped that, as a result of this scheme, we shall be able eventually to procure from home sources our total requirements of anthracite coal and perhaps have an exportable surplus. Other proposals for the fuller investigation of the country's natural resources are also under consideration.</P>
    <P>In regard to the oil refinery project, construction work has since commenced, the first two stages being the erection of tankage and the construction <Col N="1524" /> of the marine terminal.  It is expected that the refinery will come &ldquo;on stream&rdquo; about the middle of next year.</P>
    <P>The output of Bord na Móna for the year ended 31st March, 1958, was 820,000 tons of sod peat of which 450,000 tons were for production of electricity, 530,000 tons of milled peat for power stations, 32,000 tons of briquettes and 200,000 bales of peat moss.  The present programme is directed towards achieving by 1960 an annual production of 960,000 tons of sod peat, of which 500,000 tons will be for production of electricity and an annual production of 250,000 tons of briquettes.  By 1962, it is expected that there will be an annual production of 1,200,000 tons of milled peat for power stations and 350,000 bales of peat moss.</P>
    <P>These targets allow for the peat required for the new power station at Bellacorick, County Mayo, which the E.S.B. expect will be in operation early in 1963.  It will be noted that about 50 per cent. of the sod peat production is required for electricity generation.  Since mid-1957 the board has been conducting a very vigorous sales drive in order to increase its sales to industrial and commercial consumers.</P>
    <P>The first of the new briquetting factories at Boora, County Offaly, is expected to be in production in July, 1959, and the second factory at Derrygreenagh, will be in operation by January, 1960.  Each of these factories will produce 100,000 tons of briquettes a year.</P>
    <P>New markets continue to be found for peat moss and production has been expanding accordingly.  New production units are being added at the factory in Kilberry and it is hoped to achieve an output of 300,000 bales per annum in a few years' time.  In addition, a new peat-moss bog has been acquired at Coolnamona, County Leix, where it is hoped to attain an annual output of 150,000 bales.  About 80 per cent. to 85 per cent. of all peat moss produced by the board is intended for export markets.  Approximately 150,000 bales of peat moss, value £114,000, were exported in 1957 as compared with 105,000 bales in 1956.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> I stated last year that it was my intention to have the E.S.B. programme, which had been revised in 1956, reconsidered.  I referred particularly to the possibility of taking stations using imported fuel out of commission for a time in order to permit of the construction of further milled peat stations.  The matter was subsequently investigated.  The Government decided that the erection of the peat-burning station at Bangor-Erris should be proceeded with in the knowledge that, if the rate of growth in demand for electricity should remain below 7 per cent. per annum for the next few years, the commissioning of the station in 1963 might require that existing imported fuel stations might have to be taken temporarily out of use.</P>
    <P>In recent months, however, there has been a most encouraging improvement in the rate of growth of demand for electricity and I am informed that this is now proceeding at a rate of 7 per cent. per annum.  A recent O.E.E.C. report indicates that in West Europe generally consumption of electricity is expected to expand at 7 per cent. per annum so that we are back again to the European average.  We need to do much better of course, because the same report shows our <i>per capita</i> consumption of electricity is the fourth lowest in Western Europe.  At the present rate of growth in demand, the Bellacorick station will be fully required on the date of its completion in 1963.  In addition, further generating capacity will be required by 1964.</P>
    <P>Apart from Bellacorick, work is at present proceeding on the following generating stations: Ferbane milled peat station&mdash;the last of the three 20-megawatt generating sets is nearing completion.  Rhode milled peat station&mdash;two sets of 20-megawatt are under construction and the station is due for commissioning in 1960-61. Arigna, which is to burn Irish coal and where the 15-megawatt station will be commissioned in the next few weeks. It will provide a ready market for about 40,000 tons of Arigna coal per annum.  Lanesboro' sod peat station of 20-megawatts, will be commissioned also in the next few weeks, and the <Col N="1526" /> Clady hydro-electric scheme, is due for commissioning in October-November next.</P>
    <P>By March, 1958, the last of the four small generating stations to burn hand-won turf was commissioned at Gweedore, County Donegal.  These stations will provide a market for surplus hand-won turf available in the main turf-producing areas of Counties Donegal, Galway, Clare and Kerry.  Each station is designed to consume a maximum of 30,000 tons of turf per annum, for which the E.S.B. will pay approximately £70,000.  Firm prices are offered by the board and, in addition, an attractive prepayment scheme has been announced in each area under which producers receive a portion of the purchase price at various stages of production.  Bord na Móna recently reported to me that the purchasing operations of the E.S.B. in these areas should introduce a worthwhile element of stability into the hand-won turf market.</P>
    <P>With the completion of the North Mayo station in 1963 the latest E.S.B. generating capacity will be 768.5 megawatts of which 479 megawatts or 62 per cent. will consist of plant based upon native resources.  Last year, 80 areas were completed under the rural electrification scheme.  On 1st April, this year, 184 areas remained for development.  All the more populous areas have now been developed and the areas remaining are those which, for one reason or another, were considered to be the least economic.  The Government have accordingly decided that the 50 per cent. capital subsidy should be restored with effect as from 1st April this year for the development of these remaining areas.  The necessary legislation will be enacted as soon as possible.  The extension of supply to all areas will be completed within the next four years.</P>
    <P>Our total exports in 1957 were valued at £131,000,000, the highest ever recorded.  In volume our exports were greater in 1957 than in any year since 1930.  Comparing 1957 with 1956 the value of our exports increased by £23,000,000, while the value of our imports rose only slightly, from <Col N="1527" /> £182.8 million to £184.8 million.  The increase in the value of our exports was accordingly the main factor which accounted for the reduction in our import excess.  It will be recalled that the import excess, which had reached the dangerously high figure of £96.8 million in 1955 had been somewhat reduced to £75,000,000 in 1956.  In 1957, it was further reduced to £53.6 million.</P>
    <P>The largest element contributing to the increase in the export figure was the great increase in exports of store cattle.  There were also substantial increases in exports of fresh, chilled and frozen beef and veal, mutton and lamb, bacon and hams.  These agricultural items are, of course, traditional exports and, perhaps, a more heartening sign is the fact that several industrial exports reached sizable increases. Among these industrial exports which increased in 1957 might be mentioned yarns, apparel, glass and motor vehicles.</P>
    <P>The overall figures for 1957 and the comparison with former years, undoubtedly reduce anxieties about the immediate future.  Nevertheless it is recognised that the large increase in exports in 1957 was due partly to a number of non-recurring factors.  The balance of payments position still needs careful watching and we must make certain that the gains recorded will be maintained.  A study of the monthly trade figures for 1957 and the first four months of 1958 shows that we are not yet out of the wood.  While exports in all but one months of the first three-quarters of 1957 were higher than in the corresponding months of 1956 the improvement slowed down in the last quarter of 1957.</P>
    <P>Coincident with that slowing down in exports, our imports in the months of the last quarter of 1957 were greater than in the months of the last quarter of 1956.  The result was that in the last quarter of 1957, our import excess was greater than in the last quarter of 1956.  Similarly our import excess in the first four months of this year was greater than in the corresponding period of 1957.  That reflects a drop in our cattle exports, but is no doubt also <Col N="1528" /> attributable to the higher level of industrial activity and the effect of wage increases on consumption expenditure.</P>

      <P>No.  There is nothing exceptional to report regarding trade agreements except the difficulties experienced in reaching agreement for the re-entry of Irish cattle and meat into Germany.  For that reason, the exchange of notes relating to quotas for non-liberalised goods under the Trade Agreement with Germany was delayed and has only recently been effected.  Trade Agreements with other countries are of a general and continuing nature, and yearly renegotiation is not necessary.</P>
      <P>During the year, Córas Tráchtála Teoranta has extended its activities. Córas Tráchtála Teoranta was incorporated as a limited liability company in 1951.  They have reached a stage where their future status and functions must be reviewed. I consider it to be desirable to endow Córas Tráchtála Teoranta with statutory permanence and with a continuing responsibility in all matters relating to export activity.  I hope during the present year to promote legislation to that effect.  There is difficulty in long-term planning for an organisation which is dependent upon an annual Dáil Vote.  Staff problems arise also where no security exists.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Finance indicated in his Budget speech, it is intended to increase by £25,000 the Grants-in-Aid provided for Córas Tráchtála Teoranta in these Estimates.  The extra £25,000 will, in due course, be the subject of a Supplementary Estimate and it will be used by Córas Tráchtála Teoranta to expand its activities and in particular to promote the sales of Irish whiskey abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, the Committee on Company Law Reform has made its report and has recommended the making of numerous changes in the present state of that very important branch of the law. Examination of all the committee's proposals in detail with a view to the <Col N="1529" /> introduction of legislation where desirable will take some considerable time. In order, therefore, to avoid delay I propose to introduce, at an early date, a short Bill implementing some of the more urgent of the committee's proposals. A second Bill, dealing with such other recommendations as it may be decided to adopt, will be introduced later and I propose, finally, to introduce a Consolidation Bill which will gather all the law on the subject into one measure.</P>
    <P>A need exists to review the law relating to the establishment and management of co-operative organisations. I am anxious that the opportunities for economic advancement which co-operation offers should be fully availed of and that there should be no impediment in the way of the development of the co-operative movement. I have, therefore, appointed a committee to examine the position and to indicate any alterations which they feel should be made in the existing law in order to promote co-operative effort in the non-agricultural sphere. That committee has commenced its deliberations.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, has now been in operation for almost five years.  During that period the Fair Trade Commission have held five public inquiries and have made nineteen sets of Fair Trading Rules.  Following public inquiries three Orders have been made and have been confirmed by Acts of the Oireachtas, the effect of which is to regulate in the public interest, conditions concerning the supply and distribution of radio sets, building material and motor cars. An Order has also been made in relation to the supply and distribution of grocery goods but that Order has not been confirmed by the Oireachtas.  I am of the opinion that some of the provisions of the Order need to be altered and I propose to make an amending Order in the near future.  Then the Oireachtas will be asked to pass confirming legislation in due course.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, as I said, has now been in operation long enough to enable some opinion to be formed concerning its scope and its <Col N="1530" /> suitability.  In general, I think it is fair to say that the machinery of the Act has proved to be satisfactory. Substantial progress has been made in eliminating some of the more objectionable kinds of restrictive trade practices.  The time has come, however, in my view, to review its provisions, in the light of the dual requirements of policy: on the one hand to eliminate all unfair restrictions and restraints which are harmful to the public interests, and, on the other hand, to promote a healthy competition with a minimum of official regulation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it may be appropriate to recall here that the members of the Fair Trade Commission constitute the Tribunal of Inquiry into cross-Channel freight rates which was established by resolution of both Houses last November.  That inquiry has just been completed.</P>
    <P>It became clear during the first half of last year that workers would press for a further round of wage increases. In view of the overwhelming importance, in the national interest, of securing an orderly settlement of wage claims, and to ensure that due regard should be had to the national economic situation, and to the need to safeguard employment and production and to avoid rises in prices, I had discussions on the subject with the United Trade Union Organisation and with the Federated Union of Employers. Consequent on these discussions the two organisations undertook direct negotiations which ultimately resulted in the conclusion of a national wages agreement.  It would not be correct to say that the implementation of the agreement proceeded without some problems arising but, on the whole, I think we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that a difficult period of adjustment was completed without any serious trade disputes arising from that cause.</P>
    <P>I think also that insufficient attention has been directed as yet to the fact that, as our statistics show, increased earnings under that national wage agreement have been almost exactly compensated by the rise in productivity with the result that, so far as industry as a whole is concerned, <Col N="1531" /> labour costs per unit of output have remained stable and its competitive position has not been seriously impaired.</P>
    <P>Economists tell us that in a healthy progressive country increases in productivity should run ahead of rises in wages but, having regard to the contrary consequences which followed upon the 1955 round of wage increases, our present experience is a matter for very widespread satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court has continued its work of promoting industrial peace. During last year, the court considered 196 trade disputes.  A substantial number of these disputes were settled at conciliation conferences but the court made recommendations in 110 cases and it is pleasant to be able to report that the majority of these recommendations were accepted by both the employers and workers concerned.</P>
    <P>One of the most important disputes dealt with by the court in recent years was the recent one in the shipping industry. The court's recommendations in that dispute were accepted by all the parties concerned, and I am sure that Deputies will join with me in expressing the hope that it will help to the establishment of an era of stable and peaceful relations in that most important industry.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that, at the request of the trade union interests, I have referred to the court for investigation the dispute between dockers and shipping interests in connection with container traffic at the Dublin port.  That dispute has dragged on for a long time now, and I sincerely trust that the parties to it will co-operate fully with the court's efforts to work out a reasonable and equitable settlement, which will be effective in increasing trade through the Port of Dublin.</P>
    <P>As in previous years I have made provision in the Estimates for the attendance of an Irish delegation at the International Labour Conference at Geneva which is now proceeding. The Government has decided to ratify the convention dealing with the abolition of forced labour.  That will bring <Col N="1532" /> the total number of I.L.O. Conventions ratified by Ireland to 39, which is quite a commendable record.</P>
    <P>For some years now Stagiaire Agreements have been in operation between Ireland, France and Switzerland.  Towards the end of 1957 a similar agreement was concluded with Sweden and I hope that, in the near future, further agreements will be concluded with the Netherlands and Germany.</P>
    <P>These agreements facilitate young persons, who wish to spend a period of training abroad, to secure employment in the countries with which we have these agreements.  During last year, 31 Irish trainees went to France and Switzerland, while 25 foreign trainees came here.  It is regrettable that so few Irish hotel proprietors and people concerned in other businesses have so far availed of the opportunities presented by these agreements for the training of their employees on the Continent.  The arrangements should be particularly helpful to the Irish hotel industry in improving the standards of efficiency in catering and service.</P>
    <P>The agreements should also be of interest to Irish industry in general. The probable emergence of a European Free Trade Area underlines the need for the greatest possible degree of efficiency for there can be no doubt that trading conditions in such an area will be highly competitive, and will present a very strong challenge to Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I hope that in future years a greater use will be made of the facilities to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>A very useful development of the work of such bodies as the European Productivity Agency is the holding of Seminars both in Europe and the United States at which trade union officials discuss and study various aspects of labour-management relations. The Irish trade union movement has sent representatives to attend these Seminars, and I understand that the Seminars are regarded by the trade unions as a most valuable method of keeping in touch with current international thinking and practice for the development of harmonious relations in industry.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I might mention <Col N="1533" /> that, during the year, I received a request from the European Productivity Agency to co-operate with them in a project for research work in connection with human problems in industry arising out of technological advances.  I have requested the Irish Management Institute to explore the possibility of co-operating with the European Productivity Agency in the matter, and I understand that the institute has had preliminary discussions with the various interests concerned with a view to setting up a national committee to look into the subject.</P>
    <P>The new Factories Act, which came into operation in October, 1956, is working satisfactorily and, on the whole, factory occupiers have made reasonable efforts to bring their plant and premises into conformity with the revised safety, health and welfare requirements.</P>
    <P>I must confess, however, that I am rather disappointed with the progress in regard to the establishment of safety committees under the Act.  These committees are of a voluntary kind, set up by the workers themselves to promote safety in factories, and the idea is that they should work in close liaison with both the occupier and the factory inspectors.  Last year, there were over 1,800 accidents in industry, although fortunately only a small number proved fatal.  Many of these accidents might have been avoided if workers in general had been more &ldquo;safety conscious&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The establishment of safety committees deserves to be encouraged by all concerned and there is no doubt that these committees have a very important rôle to play in reducing the incidence of accidents, which apart from having tragic consequences for the worker and his family, can represent a serious economic loss to employers and the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>As the House only recently debated the provisions of the Office Premises Act, I do not think I need go over the ground again.  The purpose of the Act is to provide for the safety, health and welfare of office workers.  A number of representative public-minded persons have agreed to act on the advisory council provided for by the <Col N="1534" /> Act.  The council has already held two meetings and is now settling down to the important task of determining the nature and scope of the regulations necessary for the smooth and effective working of the Act, which I hope to bring into force early next year.</P>
    <P>I have long urged the need for fairly extensive revision of our legislation dealing with apprenticeship.  The Apprenticeship Act of 1931 did not achieve the measure of success which was hoped for it&mdash;and indeed hardly any measure of success at all&mdash;and only four trades are at present designated under the Act.  It is, of course, of the utmost importance that our potential craftsmen should have the opportunity of being trained to the highest standards; indeed, our success in a free trade area would in no small degree depend upon the skill of our workers.  The proposals for new legislation which I foreshadowed last year are being developed and I should greatly welcome the views of employers, workers and of educational interests on that very important subject.</P>
    <P>I had contemplated reporting very fully with regard to the proposed Free Trade Area negotiations.  The House is aware, however, that the recent parliamentary crisis in France brought these negotiations to a stop.  It is not known when they may be resumed nor, indeed, have we yet any knowledge as to the attitude of the new French Government to the whole conception of a European Free Trade Area.</P>
    <P>In memoranda released to the public, in replies to Parliamentary Questions, and in a statement I made during a debate in the House, I have endeavoured to keep the Dáil and the public generally informed of the progress of events.  It is scarcely necessary for me, therefore, on this Estimate to go into the history of the negotiations or to enumerate the various differences of approach to problems which have tended to slow down discussions.</P>
    <P>I shall, therefore, confine myself to some comments on what appear to me to be the most important aspects of the project from the point of view of this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1535" /> At this stage, I should perhaps again make it clear that, while as members of the O.E.E.C. the Government are participating in the negotiations, a decision on the question of joining a Free Trade Area has not been taken by the Government.  Such decision will be taken only when the conditions attaching to membership for Ireland are known and when the Government and the country can weigh fully both the advantages and disadvantages.  The Government's decision must, of course, be submitted to the Dáil for ratification. The Government's principal aim in taking part in the discussions is to secure that the terms of whatever convention may be drawn up will have regard to the special conditions which exist in this country.</P>
    <P>In the simplest form, an agreement to join a Free Trade Area means an undertaking progressively to reduce and ultimately to abolish all tariffs, import quotas and all other restrictions on trade from the other member countries of the area.  At the same time, of course, the other member countries would be progressively reducing and eventually removing their tariffs, quotas and trade restrictions on goods exported from this country.</P>
    <P>The proposals for a European Free Trade Area were first put forward during the period of office of the last Government and, on their decision, the Council of the O.E.E.C. were advised that Ireland could consider membership of a Free Trade Area only on the basis of getting special treatment as a country in process of economic development.  There is not much room for disagreement as to the likely effect on Irish industry of a dismantling of our tariffs over the next 12 to 15 years in accordance with the timetable which is visualised for members generally and we, therefore, submitted to the O.E.E.C. working party, which was set up to consider the position of the less developed countries, a formal case for a postponement of the obligations to scale down protective measures until such time as increased industrialisation had brought the economy of the country to a state of balance comparable <Col N="1536" /> with that of the more advanced countries of Europe.</P>
    <P>That working party have since been considering our case.  Similar requests for special treatment were made to the working party by Greece, Turkey and Iceland.  Until the working party have reported and until their report is considered by the inter-governmental committee, it is not possible for me to give an indication of the possible outcome of our submission.</P>
    <P>I may say, however, that I personally have found among the delegates of the other countries in Paris an appreciation of our efforts to secure a balanced development of our economy through the creation of more industries and the expansion of existing units; I have found also some evidence of a genuine desire to help us by giving us special concessions.  I am hopeful, therefore, that the present deliberations, if they are resumed, and when they are concluded, will result in our being given facilities to enable the economy to be further strengthened before being called on to bear the full obligations of a Free Trade Area, should we join it.</P>
    <P>We have, also, a very keen interest in benefiting from any financial arrangements which may be made for assisting industrial expansion in countries still in the process of development. A team of financial experts who are examining this aspect in detail has recently visited this country.  The experts will report to the working party who in turn will make recommendations to the inter-governmental committee on any special financial provisions which should be made for Ireland as well as for the other countries involved.  It is too soon yet even to forecast what the nature of any such recommendations may be.</P>
    <P>The position of agriculture and agricultural products in a Free Trade Area continues to be uncertain.  Deputies will remember that the proposals for a Free Trade Area as originally put forward by the British Government applied to industrial products only. Deputies will be aware also of the debates which took place on that aspect of the proposals last year culminating <Col N="1537" /> in a full discussion by the Council of the O.E.E.C. in October, 1957, and the adoption by the council of a resolution declaring, among other things, the determination of member countries to reach agreement on methods of further co-operation between all member countries in agricultural matters with a view to ensuring the expansion of trade in agricultural products.</P>
    <P>Although there are varying views among O.E.E.C. member countries regarding the treatment of agricultural products in a Free Trade Area it is evident that whatever régime is drawn up for such products it will not be &ldquo;free trade&rdquo; as the term is understood in industry.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the resolution just mentioned, the British Government formulated proposals for liberalising European trade in agricultural products.  These proposals were designed to reduce agricultural trade barriers gradually and in a manner which would take into account such factors as the important part which agriculture plays socially, politically and economically in all European countries, the need for market stability, and the desirability of preserving and strengthening existing trade links.</P>
    <P>Although the removal of tariffs as well as other barriers to trade was visualised, the British Government made it clear that they themselves could not abandon tariff protection for agricultural products.  They visualised that they would be given a waiver from any obligations that might be laid down for the removal of agricultural tariffs.  The British proposals were put before the Inter-Governmental Committee in January, 1958, and must be presumed to be still under consideration.</P>
    <P>One other aspect of the Free Trade Area proposals to which I should refer is their possible impact on Anglo-Irish trade relations and on the trade agreement with Britain.  Deputies are familiar with the main provisions of this agreement.  One of its main benefits is that it formally guarantees entry into Britain free of duty of a variety of Irish goods, agricultural and industrial, which are subject to customs duties or other restrictions when <Col N="1538" /> imported from countries on the Continent.</P>
    <P>So far as our industrial exports are concerned one of the inevitable consequences&mdash;an unfortunate one from our point of view&mdash;of a Free Trade Area Agreement as hitherto visualised would be that the duties applied by Britain to continental goods would be progressively reduced and ultimately eliminated, thereby depriving a substantial proportion of our exports of the preferential treatment which they are at present entitled to receive under the Anglo-Irish trade agreement.  It should be noted that this result would be consequential on adherence by Britain to a European Free Trade Area, and would follow no matter whether we joined or not.</P>
    <P>On agriculture, Deputies are aware that under the trade agreement, our products on entry to Britain are given certain treatment which is more favourable than that given to continental products.  Any liberalising of British arrangements affecting the importation of agricultural products from the Continent might affect the value of the agricultural provisions of the trade agreement.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully alive to the possible consequences on our trading relations with Britain of the conclusion of a Free Trade Area Agreement which did not take fully into account the very special nature of those relations.  Discussions on this subject have taken place with British Ministers.  Deputies will appreciate that it is not possible at this stage to give any detailed account of those discussions.</P>
    <P>If I have dwelt somewhat on the anxieties associated with the Free Trade Area proposals, that does not mean that I am unaware of the opportunities which the removal of barriers to trade in Europe could present to producers of goods capable of standing up to competition abroad. Already a number of Irish industries are exporting to European countries, even if only to a limited extent, despite the operation of tariffs in those countries.  Such firms might look forward with confidence to a Free Trade Area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> Other Irish industries already capable of meeting full home needs are taking heart from the experiences of those who have pioneered external markets and are addressing themselves to the task of expanding sales by developing foreign business.  Some who have successfully embarked on export in recent years have told me that the only reason why they were not in export business earlier was because they had never tried.</P>
    <P>Whether the present negotiations result in the setting up of a Free Trade Area in Europe or not, it is, I think, evident that conditions favourable to the freer movement of goods will emerge in the years to come.  Our manufacturers will have the chance of exploiting those conditions.  The Government have made valuable facilities available to manufacturers exporting and to those planning export business.  It is to be hoped that full advantage will be taken of those facilities.</P>
    <P>The Estimate of £3,788,410 for Transport and Marine services for the year 1958-59 compares with a total&mdash; including a substantial Supplementary Estimate&mdash;of £5,619,390 granted in 1957-58.  The provision for this year, therefore, shows a decrease of £1,830,980 as compared with the provision for last year.</P>
    <P>The principal decreases are in the provisions for C.I.E. (sub-head A (1)) £1,642,000 and the G.N.R. Board (sub-head A (2)) £160,000.  There is no provision in the Estimate for the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway which ceased operations in 1957-58.</P>
    <P>The Minister of Commerce, Belfast, has indicated his intention of terminating as from 1st October, 1958, the Agreement for the joint operation of the G.N.R. undertaking.  It is proposed that the operation of the undertaking here, apart from the Dundalk Works, will be transferred to C.I.E.  Simultaneous and parallel legislation here and in the Six Counties will be necessary to deal with the dissolution of the undertaking and the amalgamation of our portion with C.I.E.  This will be <Col N="1540" /> a separate Bill from that dealing with C.I.E. and general transport matters. The Bill has been introduced and will shortly be discussed here.  Deputies will have an opportunity of discussing the affairs of the G.N.R. when the Bill is before the House.</P>
    <P>The Dundalk Works have been taken over by a new company&mdash;the Dundalk Engineering Works, Ltd.&mdash;who have been charged with the duty of securing new industrial activity for the works with a view to maintaining the level of employment there.  The company will continue to carry out work for the G.N.R. Board up to the end of September, 1958, after which they will carry out, to the greatest extent possible, the repair and maintenance of G.N.R. rail and rolling stock for C.I.E.  The company have tendered for railway contracts abroad and have been successful in arranging for the transfer to the Dundalk Works of the manufacture of Heinkel cars.  I hope that some further developments of a similar character can be announced later.</P>
    <P>The provision of £419,000 for the G.N.R. appearing in this year's Estimate has been framed in the light of these circumstances.  It includes £239,000 for our share of the operating losses, and capital expenditure from 1st April to 30th September, 1958.  The balance of £180,000 is in respect of estimated losses on our portion of the undertaking from 1st October, 1958, to the end of the financial year.  The necessary steps will have to be taken to transfer this sum to C.I.E. after they have taken over the G.N.R. service here.</P>
    <P>The provisions made for C.I.E. in this year's Estimates are of a transitional nature and take into account as far as is possible the provisions of the new legislation which is now passing through this House.</P>
    <P>The sum of £3,204,300 for C.I.E. is made up of £793,300 in respect of repayment to the Central Fund of advances to meet interest payments on transport stock in last year; £1,191,000 for expenditure chargeable to revenue and £1,220,000 for capital expenditure. The provision for expenditure chargeable <Col N="1541" /> to revenue includes a further sum of £793,300 to enable C.I.E. to meet interest payments on transport stock in this year.  Under the existing legislation, this sum would be advanced to C.I.E. from the Central Fund in this year and if not repaid by C.I.E. would be recouped to the Central Fund out of the Vote for 1959-60.  In view of the changes proposed in the new legislation, this liability will be met from the Vote this year.</P>
    <P>Interest charges due by C.I.E. to the Exchequer amounting to £354,000 will not be collected this year and it is intended that C.I.E. should be permanently relieved of these charges under the new legislation.  There has also been a reduction in estimated capital expenditure in the coming year due to the reduction in the dieselisation programme, which is nearly completed.</P>
    <P>For these reasons and because last year's Estimates contained a non-recurring provision for the repayment of £803,000 to the Central Fund in respect of an advance made to discharge guaranteed borrowing by the board there is a total reduction of £1.6 million on the provision for C.I.E. in 1957-58.  I should make it clear that this reduction does not reflect any expected improvement in the board's operating position during the course of the year.</P>
    <P>A provision of £249,335 is made for grants for harbour improvement works. The amount voted last year was £236,410, but owing to some unexpected difficulties in the placing of certain contracts, the amount expended was only £93,053.  The big back-log of work left over from the war years has very largely been overtaken, but work will still be proceeding at about 12 harbours.</P>
    <P>The provision for this year includes about £30,000 for dredging and it also includes a sum of more than £100,000 for the dredger which is being built at the Liffey Dockyard for the Limerick Harbour Commissioners but which will be available for work at other west coast harbours as well as at Limerick. Considerable work will also be in progress at Waterford, Wicklow and several other harbours and I hope that <Col N="1542" /> a contract will have been placed for works at Galway.  Proposals for development at Drogheda Harbour, where there has been continuous commercial development in recent years, are at present under examination. The works at Arklow are virtually complete.</P>
    <P>In addition to the grants for harbour improvement works which are made from the Vote for Transport and Marine Services, provision is also made from the National Development Fund for non-voted capital services for some £197,800 for works at Dublin, Cork and Limerick Harbours.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the very severe slump in freight rates which has been a feature of the world shipping industry over the past few months and which as yet shows no sign of reversal.  As a result of this slump, some millions of tons of shipping are being laid up all over the world or are being operated at altogether uneconomic rates.  Irish shipowners generally cannot remain immune from the effects of the world-wide slump.  Irish Shipping Limited, who are engaged in tramp shipping which is the most highly competitive of all trades are, perhaps, more fortunate than some of their competitors in that most of the ships in their fleet are modern and a number of vessels were chartered upon satisfactory terms before the recession in freights set in.  The company hope that these fortunate circumstances will materially help them in weathering the present storm, though unfortunately it has been necessary to lay up two of their ships temporarily.</P>
    <P>Normally a shipping company would hope to have reserves accumulated from the years of profitable operation which would enable them to meet these periodical reverses.  Unfortunately, Irish Shipping Limited are not in this position.  The company was set up in 1941 with a capital of £200,000.  From then until 1955, no further capital was subscribed by the Minister for Finance, but the company financed the acquisition of new tonnage to the value of £3.4 million solely from profits.  Since 1955, the Minister for Finance has subscribed £4.8 million and Irish <Col N="1543" /> Shipping Limited have provided another £2.2 million towards the cost of new ships.  The present position is, therefore, that the company possesses a fleet which cost £11.4 million of which only £5,000,000 has been subscribed in capital by the State.  That result, while very satisfactory from one point of view, prevented the accumulation by the company of reserve funds with which to meet the onslaught of this recession.</P>
    <P>The company is acquiring two 18,000 ton tankers.  One of these tankers has been delivered at a cost of £1.6 million and is now operating on a satisfactory charter arranged some time ago. Delivery of the second tanker is expected in the middle of next year, at a cost of £1.7 million.</P>
    <P>The company arranged to finance the purchase of these tankers by means of guaranteed borrowing and to meet repayments from operating profits. Owing to the slump in freights, it may not be possible, however, for the company to adhere fully to that arrangement. The maximum authorised capital of the company under the Act passed in 1947 is £5,000,000, which is now fully subscribed.  It is anticipated, therefore, that it will be necessary to provide by new legislation for an increase in the authorised capital to a figure which will enable the company to meet their capital commitments and which would be more in keeping with the value of their assets, amounting to over £13,000,000.</P>
    <P>To encourage and facilitate the expansion of the shipping industry generally, provision was made in the Finance Act, last year, for a special investment allowance against taxation of 40 per cent. of capital expenditure on new ships in place of the previous initial allowance of 20 per cent.  Since the introduction of these concessions five new ships, ranging from 600 tons d.w. to 1,800 tons d.w. have been ordered by private Irish owners.  I understand that the decision to place these orders was largely influenced by these taxation concessions.</P>
    <P>The Estimate of £528,750 for Aviation and Meteorological Services for the year 1958-59 compares with a total <Col N="1544" /> of £316,360 granted in 1957-58.  The provision for this year, therefore, shows an increase of £212,390 as compared with the sum granted last year.</P>
    <P>The principal increases are in the provisions for constructional work at Shannon Airport, £132,000; Dublin Airport, £108,000; and Cork Airport, £24,000.  Other increases amount to £36,000.  The total increase is, however, offset by an increase of £86,160 in Appropriations-in-Aid, together with miscellaneous decreases amounting to £1,400.</P>
    <P>During the past year, the north apron at Dublin Airport was extended to provide increased accommodation for aircraft; an extension to the south apron is now in the course of construction. This year provision is made for additional building accommodation to cater for the growth of passenger and cargo traffic.  During 1957, over 10,800 aircraft used the airport.  These aircraft carried almost 500,000 passengers and over 8,300 tons of freight and mail.  The total number of passengers who passed through the airport last year was a record for the airport. British European Airways commenced scheduled services from London, Manchester and Birmingham to Dublin in April of last year.  In addition, Sabena, the Belgian Airlines, commenced a service from Brussels to Dublin and B.K.S. Air Transport Ltd., a British independent company, commenced a service on the Newcastle-Dublin route.</P>
    <P>With a view to reducing the operating deficit at this airport, the landing fees were increased in October of last year.  This increase in fees, together with the growth of traffic, is expected to bring in an additional £20,000 approximately in a full year.</P>
    <P>The Government decided in April last year to provide a new runway at Shannon to accommodate the long-range jet aircraft which are to be brought into use on the North Atlantic route over the next few years.  The total cost of the runway and related works is estimated at £1,000,000.  I hope work on the project will commence in July and that the new runway will be ready for use in 1960.  It is expected <Col N="1545" /> that an intermediate type of jet aircraft will be introduced on the North Atlantic before the end of this year, but that type of jet aircraft is not as heavy as the long-range type which will come into general use on the route in about two years' time. Subject to certain limitations as to the all-up weight of the aircraft, the intermediate type jets will use the existing runway at Shannon.</P>
    <P>An extension to the transit lounge at Shannon is being effected to meet immediate passenger accommodation requirements, and a new building, which will be used for freight and other purposes, is also being put up.</P>
    <P>Over 10,600 aircraft landed at Shannon Airport last year and they carried about 450,000 passengers and over 15,000 tons of freight and mail. Ten foreign airlines operate scheduled services through the airport and a number of other airlines also use the airport regularly.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the introduction of the new economy class fares, which came into operation on the transatlantic route at the beginning of April last, will result in an increase in traffic through Shannon Airport this year.</P>
    <P>For the financial year ended 31st March, 1957, total revenue at the airport was £585,000 and expenditure amounted to £473,700.  The operation of the airport last year therefore showed an operating surplus of £111,300.</P>
    <P>In view of the plans of the airlines to introduce long-range jet aircraft on the North Atlantic, the Government have felt it prudent to take steps to counter any possible diminution of activity and employment at the airport. Accordingly, we decided in October last that the Shannon Free Airport Development Authority should be established and be charged with responsibility for special measures to promote the development of transit traffic through the airport, the development of tourist facilities at and near the airport in order to promote terminal traffic, and the development of freight traffic at the airport.  The comptroller of sales and catering is the chief executive of the authority.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the <Col N="1546" /> development authority there has undertaken a Press and publicity campaign in this country and abroad, with a view to attracting industry to the airport area.  Already they have received a number of positive inquiries about the possibilities of establishing industries at the airport.  About 250 acres of land are available for development as industrial sites.</P>
    <P>As indicated by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech, legislation is being prepared to provide for the complete exemption from taxation for a 25 year period of profits derived from new <i>bóna fide</i> export businesses using air freight and established within the confines of the free airport.  It has been announced that, although Shannon Airport is not at present scheduled as an undeveloped area under the Undeveloped Areas Acts, favourable consideration would be given to the bringing of the airport area within the scope of the Acts so as to enable grants to be given towards the establishment of industries, provided definite proposals for the establishment of such industries emerge. Expenditure on the activities of the authority will be met from the surplus on the sales and catering service.</P>
    <P>In June last the Government authorised the acquisition of the necessary land for the construction of an airport at Cork and the preparation of detailed plans for the airport.  The acquisition of the land is proceeding. It is proposed to construct two runways with suitable lighting, navigation and landing aids and an appropriate terminal building.  I hope that construction on the site will commence next year and that the airport will be ready for use by 1961.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has continued to expand its activities.  It has extended its services to Switzerland and Italy and to Belgium and Germany and it has also opened a new route to Rome via Lourdes this year.</P>
    <P>During the past year, the company has encountered the diversionary effect on its traffic of the services introduced last year by British European Airways on certain routes to Britain and by the Belgian Airline on the route Brussels to Dublin.  In the circumstances, the <Col N="1547" /> company anticipate temporary financial repercussions.  The financial results for 1957 are not yet available but the loss, if any, will not, I hope, be serious.</P>
    <P>Apart from the decision to equip Shannon Airport to enable it to cater for jet aircraft, the most important decision taken in the sphere of civil aviation during the past year was the decision to initiate a transatlantic service.  The aircraft used by Aerlinte are leased from the American Company, Seaboard &amp; Western Airlines, at a fixed charge per mile flown, Seaboard &amp; Western being responsible for all direct operating costs such as maintenance of the aircraft, fuel and oil, landing charges, insurance and crew costs. Seaboard &amp; Western will provide the operating crews, but arrangements are being made to have Aer Lingus pilots fly as supernumeraries to obtain route experience, according as their duties allow.  Aerlinte will be responsible for cabin personnel and service, for ticketing and passenger handling.  The flights are, of course, under the licence and in the control of Aerlinte, and carry that company's insignia and markings.</P>
    <P>It is difficult at this stage to make any close estimate of the operating revenue and expenditure until the new service has been in operation for a reasonable time.  Operating experience in this year will enable estimates of future results to be made.  However, the aircraft hire charge is such as will enable the Aerlinte service to operate profitably, if it can achieve the same average year-round utilisation of seats as has been experienced by all companies operating on transatlantic routes.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Tourism shows an increase of £40,000 on the sum granted for last year.  When the Tourist Traffic Bill, 1957, was being discussed here, I reviewed the position of the tourist industry in considerable detail and I do not think it necessary, therefore, to go into that detail again now. Tourism continues to be one of the main supports of the national economy and it would be difficult to find anywhere in the Estimates for the Public <Col N="1548" /> Services an investment of the order of £500,000 which has potentialities capable of comparison with the benefits which can accrue to the national economy from the development of the tourist traffic industry.</P>
    <P>I mentioned, however, during the debates on that Bill that I had under consideration certain aspects of the tourist industry, other than those which were dealt with then.  These matters are ones of some complexity, and their examination has not yet been completed.  It is possible that further legislative proposals affecting the tourist industry will have to be brought to the House in due course.</P>
    <P>I mentioned, however, in the course of the Budget debate that the Government has decided to provide further financial facilities to encourage the expansion of hotel facilities in tourist areas.  The scheme will be in addition to the system of guaranteeing loans for hotels and will be administered by Bord Fáilte.  The broad outlines of the scheme have recently been announced in the Press.</P>
    <P>With a view to tapping sources of tourist business not available to C.I.E. and thus to bring additional tourists into the country, it has been arranged that certain external motor coach tours will be permitted to operate in Ireland in this and future tourist seasons. These tours have been admitted on the conditions that they will be of a duration of not less than four nights' stay within the country, that they will be confined to persons normally resident abroad who have made advance reservations, and that the inclusive charge for transport, accommodation and other services in Ireland will not exceed £3 5s. per day in the period 1st May to 30th September, or £3 per day outside that period.</P>
    <P>Nine applications for licences to operate these tours have been approved to date.  These applications were examined in consultation with Bord Fáilte and C.I.E., and were found to comply in all respects with the conditions laid down.  The admission of these tours will bring business to 22 additional hotels not previously utilised by C.I.E. tours for overnight <Col N="1549" /> stops.  However, finally to remove any apprehensions about the possible effect of the admission of these tours on C.I.E. operations, I am glad to be able to say that C.I.E. recently announced that they expect a 50 per cent. increase in this year as compared with last year in bookings for their own tours.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Department of Industry and Commerce, as Deputies know, cover a very wide field and, indeed, include activities which I have not mentioned at all and which I could not mention without making this statement even more protracted than it is. I will, of course, try to give Deputies any information about these other activities of the Department which they may desire to have if they indicate that desire during the course of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>In considering this Estimate, it is probably well to dwell shortly on the areas in which there is agreement on the matters which fall for discussion. For that reason, I listened with some interest to the Minister outlining the Government's policy on industrial development and on the prerequisites which he considered essential for progress and development.</P>
      <P>When we are reviewing the results of the Department's work for the past year and considering industrial development and policy generally, the time is opportune to consider what has been accomplished and to decide, where possible, what further steps are necessary for expansion of industrial development and consequent employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent months, during the discussion on the amendment of the Control of Manufactures Acts, we dwelt on a number of aspects of industrial policy. While it is generally agreed that it is necessary, either through legislative provisions or through national financial policy, to provide facilities for development, it is not sufficiently realised that the State can go only a certain way in dealing with this problem.  It is necessary <Col N="1550" /> to have a positive policy for industrial development and expansion. The taxation code should encourage investment.  Financial policy should instil confidence amongst those affected by it who are interested in expanding existing industries or establishing new ones.</P>
    <P>It has been repeatedly stated, by Ministers of various Governments, by writers and economists, that we have in this country a great number of advantages which should enable us to secure greater external investment in industrial development.  We have the large pool of people readily capable of being trained and equipped for work in almost all industrial undertakings. We have good relations between employers and workers.  We have a stable political system and, compared with other countries, no language difficulties. At the same time we are, if not on the European Continent, near enough to it to make transport reasonable easy&mdash;although that is probably one of the slight drawbacks.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, we consider the advantages that this country possesses and compare them with the advantages enjoyed by a number of other countries in Europe also seeking foreign investment, it will be seen that we have many advantages that they do not possess. It is not, however, sufficient to have these advantages because quite a number of other countries have them also, if not to the same degree, to an extent sufficient to make people who are interested in the problem consider them as bases for development.  So far, I think, that with few exceptions&mdash; some of them were referred to to-night, such as the oil refinery, St. Patrick's Copper Mines and one or two others where outside firms have either taken over or joined in the management, both financial and technical&mdash;despite the efforts of Governments over a number of years, the drive to secure external participation in industrial development and in the establishment of new industries has not been anything like as successful as is needed, or indeed as successful as a number of people expected when such strenuous efforts were made by Ministers, Government Departments <Col N="1551" /> and by the I.D.A., as well as by individual businessmen, to secure from abroad external participation, both financial and technical.</P>
    <P>I think it well, therefore, to consider whether we have gone far enough to attract outside industrialists to establish industries here or to participate in those already established. Foreign industrialists, people anxious to invest money, will not invest here simply because we enumerate the advantages to which I have referred or because they prefer coming here to going somewhere else.  The principal incentive which any industrialist will wish to have is the profit incentive, the incentive that it will be possible to make more here than elsewhere and the guarantee that, having made what they consider a reasonable profit, they will be allowed either to build up reserves with which further to develop their industry or to meet commitments which might arise in times of difficulty or, alternatively, that they will be allowed to take a fair share for themselves.</P>
    <P>I think there is general agreement among Deputies on all sides of the House that any industrialist is entitled to a fair profit and to a reasonable return on his investment, and that if there are any cases of abuse they can be readily dealt with, but the country to which we look in particular for industrial investment here is the United States.  That is pre-eminently a private enterprise economy, a country in which industrialists are prepared to develop industry only if they can see opportunities for a satisfactory return.  It is idle to imagine, after the efforts that have been made here over the years by individual Ministers, by delegations from Departments, by C.T.T. or the I.D.A. as well as by individual industrialists who have themselves endeavoured to secure investment by American industrialists in this country that they will not seek something more than we have offered them up to the present.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, therefore, that the amendment of the Control of Manufactures Act enacted here recently will have to be clearly and fully known to <Col N="1552" /> provide the benefits we believe it may possess&mdash;because I think even the most optimistic person to support the enactment of that measure would agree that it was done in a tortuous manner, liable to cause confusion as to the actual position, that it is complicated and difficult to understand and that even with the change of title it is by no means clear to external businessmen or prospective investors.  The facilities which are supposed to be available and which are provided here by the Department or through the I.D.A. do not readily appear from a reading of the terms of that Act.  It is, therefore, necessary to make it obvious through publicity by the I.D.A., by the Department of Industry and Commerce and through our representatives in the United States that there are few legislative provisions against external investment here.</P>
    <P>Having allowed for whatever encouragement is provided in that way, I believe we should seriously consider granting further facilities.  We might perhaps consider that the whole taxaation rate here is too high to attract external investment.  While we have given individual facilities, exemptions of some sort or another&mdash;in the case of exports, 25 years' exemption&mdash;whatever fears the Revenue Commissioners have should be overcome.  A fear which always impresses the Department of Finance and the Revenue authorities is that if you give absolute relief, of the nature that might be likely to attract external investment, there is some prospect of the Revenue losing by it. What we never had we cannot lose. There is a great case for freeing-up, if necessary by further relaxation, the allowances which external investors are anxious to get if they are to invest here and if they are to have the prospect of getting something here that they have not been able to get elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, the other disadvantages that exist&mdash;the fact that we have a small home market, the fact that they have to provide transport from here to Europe or from here to any other country&mdash;mean that they will be less likely to invest here than if we make such investment as attractive as it is <Col N="1553" /> humanly possible on the understanding that whatever advantage will accrue to them will also accrue to us through the establishment of new industries and increased employment.</P>
    <P>When I listened to the Minister's speech referring to the improvement which had occurred in the employment position and the fact that employment in industry had increased slightly in 1957 over 1956, I could not help recalling the propaganda used by the Government prior to, and during, the last election.  I believe it is quite illusory to imagine that the Government, alone, can provide a remedy for the unemployment problem, or that it can provide industries.  A Government may set the sights; a Government may direct general economic policy.  There is no more dangerous illusion than the illusion that the Government, of itself, can provide a remedy for unemployment or can establish industries wherever they are required.</P>
    <P>The two great examples of the results of individual initiative and enterprise are the United States and Germany.  While no valid comparison can be made between conditions in a small country such as ours and conditions in these countries, nevertheless, they have lessons for us.  During and before the last election, the present Government, when in opposition, created the impression that if a change of Government took place, all would be well.  They created the impression that it would be possible to provide employment.  They referred to different schemes such as the scheme announced by the Minister himself of an expenditure over a number of years of £100,000,000 which would create 100,000 jobs.  All that did considerable damage because it created the illusion that the Government itself had a remedy to solve the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Since the change of Government, people have become disillusioned with Fianna Fáil in particular, and probably with politicians in general.  The example of the two countries I have mentioned and the example of every country in the world, with the possible exception of Russia&mdash;we have not sufficient data in relation to Russia <Col N="1554" /> but certainly conditions there and the type of life and economy they operate would be anathema to our people&mdash; indicates that there is no country in the world in which Governments, themselves, have solved unemployment or have provided a solution or remedy for this problem.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that State-directed schemes are essential and in many cases desirable.  Some work must be undertaken by the State or it will not be undertaken at all.  In countries with great industrial enterprise, countries with large-scale industrial employment, it is provided in the main by private enterprise on the basis of private initiative and endeavour.</P>
    <P>The slight improvement in the unemployment position that occurred in 1957 over 1956 would have occurred, no matter what Government was in office. It was inevitable.  Some particular industries benefited by removing the levies.  When the levies were imposed, it was expressly stated that they were to be of temporary duration and that their purpose was to correct the adverse trade balance which existed. We see from the trade returns for the first few months of this year that the terms are again running against us. We see that a variety of factors&mdash;a number of them probably due to the dropping of these levies&mdash;has, on the one hand, stimulated development in the industries affected and, on the other hand, resulted in increased imports, thereby aggravating the problem which it was set out to solve.</P>
    <P>As I said, the present Government, when in opposition, created the impression that if they were elected to office, they could provide a solution to these problems.  I do not believe that&mdash;with the possible exception of a few legislative amendments such as the amendment of the Control of Manufactures Acts&mdash;a single important remedial measure has been put into operation to provide employment.  I do not wish to dwell on that at length now because there are other matters to be considered but I submit that such electioneering tactics create an absolute lack of confidence.</P>
    <P>There is prevailing throughout the <Col N="1555" /> country a lack of confidence in the Government and, to some extent, because of the propaganda indulged in, a lack of confidence in politicians and in the ability of politicians to solve the problems which confront us.  The Government give the impression that they are waiting for something to turn up and hoping that nothing will happen to make the position worse.</P>
    <P>Like a number of other Deputies, I was interested in perusing the trade figures for last year.  The Minister referred to them in the course of his address.  The significant fact emerges from these figures that the very remarkable expansion which occurred in our exports was due, to a very considerable extent, to the policy which was operated by the previous Government. We recognised that we should expand our agricultural production. We recognised that the introduction of a variety of measures, such as the land rehabilitation and drainage schemes, the eradication of bovine tuberculosis scheme, and so on, would increase the supply of cattle and that that, in turn, would provide greater numbers for export and for processing into chilled or frozen beef and veal. The results were shown in last year's trade figures.  Equally obvious is the fact that, unless that policy is continued&mdash;unless every incentive which can be provided is continued at the maximum rate possible&mdash;the numbers will not automatically remain high.</P>
    <P>The fact that last year's prices were so substantially higher than those of the previous year enabled the present Government to reap the benefits of the policy we initiated over the previous period, reflected in the very substantial and gratifying expansion in exports last year.  While that is the satisfactory and agreeable side of the picture, I want for a moment to turn to the trade returns and to examine the figures which are contained in the returns on Table 5 of the Trade Statistics of Ireland for the year 1957, published by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside for a moment our trade with Britain, if we examine our trade with other countries we find that our imports from them amount to a <Col N="1556" /> total of £73,000,000 in round figures, and that our exports to them total £20,000,000.  If we examine a few individual countries we find that our adverse trade balance with them is quite remarkable.  I am not suggesting this development occurred just last year.  It is a phenomena of the trade returns over a number of years. In view of the fact that in most cases the trade agreements have to be renewed on an annual basis, and in some cases re-negotiated, I believe it is time we carefully examined these returns.  The various Departments should scrutinise closely the terms of trade with each individual country to see not merely that our own exporters are taking full advantage of the trade agreements but that the other countries are giving full advantage of the terms of these agreements.</P>
    <P>In some cases by administrative action, and by delays of one sort or another, this country has been prevented from availing to the full its rights under these agreements.  It is only right, however, to say in other cases very often when it was drawn to the notice of the authorities concerned they took action to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>Last year we imported £3,600,000 worth of goods from Belgium and we exported £1,500,000 worth to it.  Our position was better with France.  We imported £3,100,000 worth and exported £1,800,000 worth to France. From the Federal Republic of Germany we imported £6.9 million worth and exported £3.2 million worth to it. From British West Africa we imported £1.3 million worth and exported only £45,000 worth to it.  Our trading figures with New Zealand are certainly interesting in view of the audacious claim which New Zealand made about this country dumping butter on the British market, more especially as we are traditional suppliers to that market, and the New Zealanders themselves were responsible for extensive dumping last year.  We imported from New Zealand £841,000 worth and they took only £49,000 from us.  In the case of the Netherlands we imported £4.5 million worth and they took £.9 million, or just short of £1,000,000 worth from us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" /> I mention these figures because, with the strong possibility of the trade balance getting out of line again, it is vital that we should examine these figures closely.  Leaving aside whatever administrative or other measures are necessary to facilitate exports to these countries, it is obvious from a national point of view that the expansion and development of exports is essential.  If the pattern of trade were scrutinised with care it might be possible in some cases to improve the adverse trade balances.  A continuous review of trade with each country should be carried out so that all figures might be readily available, and any evidence such as I have mentioned, such as administrative devices which would nullify the trade agreements, should be countered by immediate rejoinders.  The returns of trade available for the first few months of this year make it obvious that the most strenuous efforts will be required to prevent any deterioration in the balance of payments position.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the Minister's speech he referred to tourism and its effect on national economy.  I want to welcome the announcement that it is proposed to make further facilities available for the expansion and equipping of hotels.  There again I believe our approach in the past has been too cautious and we should give some relief whether by remission of taxation or greater grants for extension and development. We want to adopt a bolder and more imaginative policy.  We should allow a remission of rates for a fixed number of years to those who extend or develop their accommodation. Where additional facilities are provided, exemption from taxation on profits should be allowed.</P>
    <P>The accommodation available in this country is not anything like what it should be in order to attract the number of tourists who would come here if further accommodation were available. In that regard I want to raise the question of the Tóstal, as I believe the time has arrived when it should be reviewed.  We have now had enough experience of how the Tóstal has worked to decide whether on its present basis of operation it is a success or not.  Leaving aside entirely <Col N="1558" /> the idea of the festival being suitable for exploitation on a nation-wide scale, which I think experience has shown it is not, good individual festivals in different parts of the country have demonstrated what local effort is capable of doing.  There are numerous examples in many parts of the country, in country towns and in cities like Cork and Wexford.  Certain aspects of it here in Dublin and in other parts of the country have all been successful but, as far as I am aware, no estimate has ever been made by Board Fáilte, by the Central Statistics Office, or by any authority responsible for tourism either directly or indirectly as to what benefits have accrued from it.  It is certainly obvious that the Tóstal, on a country-wide scale&mdash;holding all the events at the same time&mdash;is not a success.</P>
    <P>The opening performances of Tóstal functions in different parts of the country should be reviewed, leaving aside entirely the episode which occurred at the opening this year which I believe reflected no credit on any of those responsible.  The idea of a Minister or a prominent public official opening these functions in the manner in which they have does not appear to be appropriate.  The hoisting of a flag on a flag-pole, in a city or country town, may be an occasion for making a speech, or for starting the ball rolling, but it is hardly the way to start a festival of this sort.  I think Board Fáilte, in collaboration with the Hotels Federation and other groups interested, should review the whole question.</P>
    <P>The idea of individual festivals is excellent and it has been shown to work in different parts of the country, in cities or towns, and has resulted in a substantial increase in the number of visitors to them.  Whether most of those visitors are Irish or foreign does not matter a great deal to the place concerned.  The overall objective, of course, is to increase the number of foreign tourists; but if, at the off season of the year, it is possible to initiate a festival or a particular type of undertaking which will attract visitors or outsiders to the town or city, it is bound to be reflected in improved <Col N="1559" /> business.  It is time that this matter was reviewed impartially and carefully, to see what steps could be taken to put it on a more reasonable basis and at the same time to preserve whatever advantages have been gained from the working of it up to the present.</P>
    <P>In the course of our anxiety to develop and expand industry here, I often feel that we dwell too much on establishing new industries and give insufficient attention to the existing ones.  It is for that reason that I welcome the decision to provide more money for C.T.T. this year, to assist in the sale of Irish whiskey abroad.  I only hope that, to whatever purposes the money is devoted, it will be done in the closest collaboration with the distillers.  One of the oldest established industries, one which uses native raw materials and provides male employment, is the distilling industry.  With a few notable exceptions, it is an industry which over the years has declined to the extent that we now have very few distilleries.  The fact that different Governments have always taxed it almost to the limit is no reason why we should not review the situation now and decide that, because other countries have found it possible to expand whiskey exports, the same should be possible here.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the expansion of the sales of Scotch whiskey was that it was possible for them to employ large sums of money for publicity and for the exploitation of foreign markets, particularly in the United States.  Our distillers had not anything like the same funds available to them and, because of the heavy rate of taxation and because it is a long term job, they were not able to build up anything like the same stocks.  Whatever was available was always pretty well assured of sale on the home market.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I believe we should not merely provide the money which is included in this year's Estimate by way of additional grant to C.T.T., but whatever other steps the industry considers advisable, in consultation with the Department and the Department of <Col N="1560" /> Finance, should be taken, so as to give relief to this old-established industry. It has provided in the past, and still provides, good employment and that industry should be enabled to maintain its position and expand its sales.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a specific case of an old industry which has been affected by events and which is located in my constituency&mdash;the stonecutting trade in the Barnaculla and Glencullen district, which has declined substantially during the past year.  I understand that about a year ago there were approximately 80 stonecutters in the area, which is a comparatively small one, and that now the number is down to 25 or 30.  At the same time, the number of labourers has declined correspondingly. The ordinary stonecutting trade has declined steadily over this period.  I understand it would scarcely be surviving at all if the granite quarries were not doing some work which is strictly not proper to them, that is, cutting imported Portland stone and cutting and polishing limestone brought in in bulk from other areas.  To give one particular example of a quarry there, a year ago it had 30 stonecutters and eight labourers; now it has only eight stonecutters and three labourers.</P>
    <P>The monumental sculpture business which up to a short time ago could not keep abreast of orders, is now almost defunct.  In the area, I believe there are five small quarry workshops and at present they only engage part-time attention.  I mention this because I understand that one of the new regulations in one cemetery in this country has contributed to this position.  In Clonmacnoise, there are regulations posted up in the new cemetery which state that only monuments of approved design may be erected there.  I understand that in fact many of the monuments which have been erected are uniformly small, plain limestone crosses, and that these are produced almost entirely by machinery.  I do not know whether it is possible, by initiating joint discussions between the Minister's Department and either the Department of Local Government or the parties concerned, to prevent this position deteriorating further; but <Col N="1561" /> certainly if one Department is endeavouring to develop and expand industry and the result of regulations from a subsidiary body of another Department results in the situation I have described, it ought not to be tolerated.</P>
    <P>The other matter which I wanted to raise on the Estimate is the recent alteration in bus fares.  One thing which is resented greatly by the people is not only the increase but the alteration in the stages.  In many cases, the stages have been so altered.</P>

      <P>Not for a long time has the introductory statement to this Vote been so encouraging as it has been to-day.  That encouraging statement is welcomed by every side of the House irrespective of how Opposition Deputies may seek to disregard the important factors which over the past year have tended towards the resuscitation in the industrial drive in this country.  We may well regard the present situation&mdash;if all the indications continue in the direction in which they are pointing&mdash;as a repetition of the industrial drive which commenced in 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has always been an effort made by Deputies on the other side of the House to imply that Fianna Fáil, in their over-anxiety to develop industries, have allowed that effort to stem progess and development in agriculture <Col N="1562" /> which, it is always rightly pointed out, is our main industry.  While we are talking in general terms like this, it cannot be too often repeated that everybody should realise that our one main and staple industry can succeed only when the industrial arm of our economy is developed to the fullest. The success of one is, to a great extent, contingent on the success of the other. What we are all striving towards, I hope, is that the maximum number of people will be employed and enjoy a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>That situation can never be brought about by the development of our agricultural industry alone.  We can never solve the vexed question of unemployment and emigration by concentrating on agriculture, no matter how much we may do that.  At the moment, the emphasis is on the development of agriculture, and rightly so, and how this surplus labour on the land is to be absorbed is a question we have got to answer.  In the different industries generally, in our manufacturing industries and in our other industries, mainly lies the answer to the problem of absorbing, to some extent, anyhow, the surplus unemployed from the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement to-day is most encouraging in so far as the position is a reversal of the situation which existed last year.  Deputy Cosgrave sought to minimise the importance of that advance and tried to point out not merely that Fianna Fáil had nothing to do with that happy situation, but that, in fact, it was due to some action taken by the previous Government.  Usually, he is not very critical in his speeches; his speeches are normally tempered with a good deal of reason.</P>
    <P>He himself, in pointing out some of the prerequisites for industrial progress, admitted that political stability was one of the most important factors. In the very first instance, we must all agree that the restoration of political stability was brought about since the last election.  It was, indeed, one of the steadying factors which permitted a further advance in our industrial development.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the efforts being made to decentralise industry, and, <Col N="1563" /> while it may be argued that the expansion of employment anywhere in the country is to be commended, those of us from the western seaboard must advocate, on every possible occasion, the need to bring industries to those areas where the population is declining. In that respect, the doubling of the funds at the disposal of An Foras Tionscal is a very welcome addition to the already very good inducements held out to those who are prepared to bring industries to the western seaboard. Apart from the fact that we have a flight from the western seaboard, the reason we are anxious to see industries decentralised is, as I pointed out at the outset, the importance of industry in relation to agriculture.</P>
    <P>If our population continues to decline, the home market, so far as agricultural produce is concerned, becomes of less value day by day.  With the success of our industrial development, the creation of more employment and the stimulation of the purchasing power, the home market becomes more valuable to agriculture. Since one is complementary to the other, in that respect, we believe that the economy of the small holding on the western seaboard can be considerably improved and extra employment created within the area.  Nobody can doubt the benefits which are very definitely set out in the Undeveloped Areas Act.  Some people may&mdash;and some undoubtedly do&mdash;show pessimism with regard to the rate of advancement under the inducements of that Act, but, when one considers all the factors, I think the figures given by the Minister for the amount of money already paid out in grants under that Act are sufficient to encourage further effort and to create reasonable inducement for the possible development of further worthwhile industries in years to come.</P>
    <P>Speaking on this Vote last year, I had reason to refer to what possibly might seem discrimination within the areas described as undeveloped.  It is not a descrimination which can be placed at the door of any Department or organisation dealing with industries. It is due to the fact that, naturally, <Col N="1564" /> new industries will select what is the best of the undeveloped areas and those areas furthest away from the hub of activity, the most northerly points, will naturally be the last to be selected, unless they have some raw material&mdash;such as we have in the fishing industry&mdash;in addition to the inducements of the Undeveloped Areas Act to attract investment from centralised concerns in Dublin, or from abroad.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I advocate that there should be some discrimination within the area itself as to the amount of grants made available to those people who go further west.  I still feel, while no definite provision is made in the Act for that sort of thing, that those responsible for the administration of the Act, An Foras Tionscal, should always take more cognisance of the readiness of any concern to go further away from the centre than of those who merely go across the line of demarcation and thereby qualify in full measure for the inducements given.</P>
    <P>The magazine issued by Irish industry deplores the fact that greater inducements are being offered to foreign investors than are being offered to existing industries here.  The magazine goes on to imply that if the same concessions had been given here as we offer to foreign investors, our home industries would be willing to do the job.  I am afraid that is not wholly true.  While we have every possible sympathy with the established concerns and would like to see our own industries expand, wherever possible, I do not think they have shown any great initiative, particularly in the matter of decentralisation of industry. Recently, they have been given good inducements for export in the shape of income-tax relief. Perhaps I would agree they have not got sufficient inducements in the form of better allowances for depreciation of plant, but those grievances aside, if they are prepared to enter the export market, they are entitled to certain tax-relief inducements which are as good as those held out to any foreign investors coming here.</P>
    <P>Most of those industries were protected by very strong tariff walls for a period.  They were the subject of <Col N="1565" /> much criticism by people whose underlying motive was, perhaps, an antipathy towards Irish industry in any form.  In fact, we still have people who have not been broken down in their old prejudice against Irish manufacture.  But, in the main, Irish products have come to be accepted by all and we do not now hear so much about industries sheltering behind tariff walls and producing inferior goods.  Perhaps the proposed establishment of the European Free Trade Area has done more than anything else to compel people to improve their methods and to go into more competitive lines of production in order to make provision for the day when they may have either to compete or fold up.</P>
    <P>By and large, those industries which require the protection of tariffs when first set up have done a good job and have reached the stage where they are capable of competing with any outside product and, as the Minister pointed out in his opening statement, many of them have successfully broken into foreign markets.  Their example could easily be followed by other home industries.</P>
    <P>But I am not satisfied that native enterprise has made an all-out effort to expand and develop industry to the extent it could.  There may have been certain insurmountable obstacles in regard to many industries.  The technical &ldquo;know how&rdquo; may not have been there and the raw materials may not have been at their disposal; but they certainly have had an opportunity over a number of years, and I feel they have missed that opportunity.  They are now complaining they have not got sufficient inducement to enable them to do the job which, to an extent, foreign investors are being called upon to do.</P>
    <P>One of the most encouraging things the Minister referred to&mdash;the most important statement we have heard for a long time&mdash;was his announcement that the 50 per cent. subsidy for rural electrification will be reintroduced.  I do not think Deputies from rural areas fully realise what a boon the amenity of rural electrification is to the rural areas, particularly the more backward areas.  There definitely has been a <Col N="1566" /> slowing down of development over the past two years.  We were told here at one time that the demand had slowed up to such an extent that it became necessary to have the remaining development distributed over a number of years, so that there would be no sudden falling off in employment under that head.  It has now been established that, not merely is there no falling off in demand, but that there is an increase.  There is a greater demand than ever for current throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Coming from a county where great tracts of rural areas remain to be developed, I most sincerely welcome the reintroduction of the subsidy, but I have a few things to say in regard to future development.  We have frequently had complaints here from all sides in regard to the method by which the E.S.B. develop rural areas.  I refer particularly to the imposition of the special charge system.  It is most unfair that one, two or three houses in every little pocket developed should be singled out for a special charge, sometimes double that of their neighbours, if they are to enjoy the great amenity of rural electrification.  I believe it would be a much better system if there was a levelling of the overall charges, a flat rate, whereby, if a particular spur-line proved uneconomic, the little extra required would be infinitely smaller when spread over 100,000 consumers.</P>
    <P>Other Department assess their costings on a similar flat rate.  It has been frequently pointed out here that if the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were to charge in accordance with the economics of a particular area, it would be a rather costly item to send a parcel, say, from Donegal to Cork and it would hardly pay to deliver a letter from Dublin, carrying a 3d. stamp, in Mayo.  That is exactly what the E.S.B. is doing in rural electrification development.  They are singling out certain houses which they were unable to bring in, in the first instance, and they are putting on the unfortunate householders a special charge twice or three times as much as the charge to be met by neighbours who were connected. <Col N="1567" /> Since the Minister is giving this new impetus to rural electrification by the reintroduction of the 50 per cent. subsidy, I would appeal to him to stipulate that this system of special charging should be dispensed with and an overall general level charge introduced in every area.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement was the most comprehensive one I have listened to since I became a Deputy.  It was a frank and honest account, and it was certainly most encouraging.  The Minister did not go out of his way to create unnecessary optimism.  He made a factual statement setting out the position as he found it and pointing out the indications for the future.</P>
    <P>We are all proud of the success of our Irish airways.  Our airports are to some extent the shop windows of the country.  Unfortunately, Aer Lingus, like many other State corporations, has become almost too independent.  It does not like dictation in the matter of economies.  It can be quite nice when it comes to the Exchequer for a subvention to cover working losses, but let a Deputy or a Senator put his name to an application for a job and the candidate is immediately disqualified.  I do not object to a rule which forbids canvassing or the use of undue influence, but if a Deputy recommends a boy or girl for a post in Aer Lingus, his recommendation should carry as much weight as that of any other citizen.  The position is that if one wants to ensure the failure of a candidate, one has only to put one's name to a letter and the candidate is immediately disqualified.  That is tantamount to Aer Lingus saying it will take a recommendation from anybody, but it will not take one from those who set up the concern and gave the necessary finances for its operations.  That is going too far and no State-sponsored corporation should be allowed to get away with it.  The members of this House are upright citizens and people of integrity and they should have the right to recommend in the same way as any other citizen.</P>
    <P>We are all proud of our airways and proud of the returns showing an upward trend, particularly in the <Col N="1568" /> terminal traffic which is more valuable than transit traffic.  An upward trend in any traffic is to be welcomed.  I do not know if it is wise to allow other airways to use Dublin Airport.  The Minister has pointed out that while the number of scheduled flights by outside airways will to some extent affect the revenue of the home company, the repercussions will not be serious.  The benefits to be derived as a result of allowing outside airways to use Dublin Airport will, I am sure, outweigh any losses Aer Lingus may suffer as a result of this competition.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would refer to tourism. The recent concession announced in relation to additional hotel bedrooms is very welcome indeed.  I would, however, urge the Minister to make the concession retrospective to cover reconstruction work undertaken since the beginning of the year.  It is unfair that a hotel which started reconstruction for the purpose of providing additional bedrooms early in the year should now be left in the position in which it cannot participate in this concession whereby a generous free grant per bedroom is made.  There would not be many hotels involved and I think they should be brought within the scope of this concession.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave appealed for greater concessions.  I do not agree. I would be prepared to go as far as anybody because Donegal is a tourist county, but I would not approve of any relief of rates such as that suggested by Deputy Cosgrave.  These people reconstruct and extend because they hope that ultimately such reconstruction and extension will show a profit. The present concessions are generous and I do not believe the hotel proprietors would look for any relief of rates, provided they get the wherewithal to build additional bedrooms. No good businessman would undertake such an expansion unless he was pretty certain that ultimately it would give him a good return for the outlay of capital.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which one feels obliged to refer is the progress of Bord na Móna.  We have been talking about the importance of industries in the undeveloped areas.  The ultimate <Col N="1569" /> fate of those areas depends on whatever industries we can bring there in order to expand employment and retain people in the holdings.  While we shall always strive to divert to those areas whatever industries we can, our greatest hope should be centred on industries where the raw material is already available.  The raw material is most readily available on the western seaboard from Donegal to Kerry, apart from the fishing industry to which I have already referred, is peat.</P>
    <P>The Minister was able to give some very encouraging figures in that respect, and while the cost of machine-won turf produced by Bord na Móna is in the main too high, as is proven by the price quoted by private concerns which are in production for a number of years, Bord na Móna have done for this country the greatest service that any State-sponsored corporation has ever done.  They have proved to the people that we have as good a fuel as any we could import.  They have succeeded in breaking down the prejudice against turf as a fuel in the greater part of the country.  They have carried out experiments which have succeeded in putting our native fuel into some of the biggest institutions in the country for central heating and other heating purposes, and they have proved that turf-fired electical stations are more economical than those fired by imported fuel.  In addition to that, they have carried out reseach in many other directions and have given great hope to bog owners and people who live in the poorer areas, where bog is always to be found, as to the further development of peat. The export of peat moss alone, as the figures given by the Minister indicate, is sufficient encouragement to justify the activities of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Private enterprise is now moving, in many instances, to continue and take over the work which Bord na Móna has been doing.  It is a welcome change if such people are able to do the job better and to produce at a more competitive price the fuel which Bord na Móna has been turning out. However, we shall always be grateful to Bord na Móna for the work they have done to develop and put on the <Col N="1570" /> map our fuel in the manner in which they have done it, and for the effort they have put into research to bring our native fuel to the position which it now enjoys.</P>
    <P>The Minister was able to show in his statement a complete reversal of the picture presented to us over the past year or two.  It was not an effort at misrepresentation but a purely factual statement of the position as it exists.  As he pointed out, there is no room for complacency or cause for undue optimism.  No matter what we may say about emigration and unemployment, there is only one way to cure them and that is to provide permanent employment.  The type of work we are sometimes prone to provide by making, say, £1,000,000 available for putting men to work at making a drain along the road or making a road into a bog, is not work of a permanent character, nor does it hold out any hope of security for the people who take part in it.  At best, it is only a temporary measure.  When we speak of establishing industries, expanding exports and of our industries breaking into new markets and becoming more competitive, we are talking in real terms of providing employment and expanding our economy and really setting about solving the problem of unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>When I refer to the expansion of industry I do not leave out tourism or such industries as are allied to agriculture or the various other branches of development which we are undertaking. If we continue on the lines along which we are going and if the progress over the past year can be maintained, we shall, in the next few years, have reached the happy stage where we shall have succeeded in getting that extra employment in industry which is bound to have an effect on our agricultural industry. Just as nothing succeeds like success, once we get moving more rapidly in the right direction, as we are at the moment, our problems of unemployment and emigration should be brought near to successful solution.  I welcome the Minister's statement.  I compliment him and I believe that our important Department of Industry and Commerce, <Col N="1571" /> which covers so many fields&mdash; and I do not wish to say this for the purpose of throwing bouquets at anybody&mdash;could not be in better hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be congratulated to-night on the way he dressed the shop window and on the number of dummies he put into it.  He made a long speech, but was there any hope held out to the unemployed man, to the small businessman in the cities and in the country towns?  He dealt with the Free Trade Area and tried to take the people's minds off the problems facing everybody at the present time&mdash;the problems of unemployment, emigration and what follows in their wake, the problem of slack trade in business.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that in my own town there is in every main street a shop offered for sale which cannot be sold?  It has never happened before since the State was founded.  If the Minister realised that, I wonder would he say there is ground for confidence? Imagine a Minister for Industry and Commerce coming in and saying there is ground for confidence.  The present Minister, taking his speech this evening, is the greatest bluffer we have in Irish politics to-day, because while he talks about &ldquo;great confidence&rdquo; at present, we know that unemployment was never as rampant and that the only alleviation provided for it during the past 18 months has been emigration. It is no longer the emigration of the bread-winner alone.  Apparently now, as there is no hope that there will be any great change in conditions here for the ordinary people, it is the emigration of families as well.  I think of the by-election in Carlow-Kilkenny and the general election which followed; I think of some of the cartoons they put out saying they would &ldquo;rescue industry from the wreck it is in and put new life in it&rdquo;, that it was only a matter of change, of turning the key in the lock, of putting Fianna Fáil in charge and there would be new life in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister came in to-night and mentioned &ldquo;more confidence&rdquo;, I recalled that within the past few months we had the Bishop of Galway, <Col N="1572" /> the Mayor of Galway and a very representative deputation from that city coming here to draw the Taoiseach's attention to the position in regard to unemployment and emigration.  That deputation could be repeated from every town and city in the country at present.  Why should people come on deputations such as that?  If they thought the present Government were doing something, why should they bother to come the whole way from Galway?  If the present Government had the &ldquo;confidence&rdquo; which the Minister states is there, why should they come?  That just shows what the people down the country feel about the present Government.</P>
    <P>I am sure they have no more animosity to Fianna Fáil, than they had to the previous Government.  I am sure it was not politics that brought them up.  I feel that these men would be very favourable to any Government which would provide employment. When these people thought it necessary to come to Dublin to bring before the Government the serious position of trade, of employment and of emigration, things must be very bad.</P>
    <P>The Minister said to-night that the policy of the Government is to work harder and to increase savings.  All these things are very good in their own way, but the Government should give a lead in these matters; the Government should work harder themselves and should encourage savings.  After all, there is the old saying that &ldquo;example is better than precept&rdquo;. Had that example been given, it would have been much better than the precept.  The Minister says he is very pleased that the banks have given long-term credit to industry in some cases and short-term credit in others, and that they have increased this long term credit.  The Minister did not mention that during the past six months the Bank of England rate was reduced by 1 per cent., while the banks here reduced the rate only by 1/2 per cent.  It that any encouragement to industry here?</P>
    <P>The Government now are placing all their faith on foreign capital and saying we have not enough capital here.  I believe we have enough, if <Col N="1573" /> people had confidence in industry.  We have not that confidence.  What we lack&mdash;and there is no use saying or thinking anything else&mdash;are the skills and techniques.  I do not think it is any blame to industry that we lack them.  After all, we have been free for only 30 years.  There are other countries which have been developing these techniques for hundreds of years.  It is not slur on our people that they lack them.  As well as that, this is a small country.  If the Minister can induce any firms of international standing to come in, they will need to bring very little capital.  I would say that we badly need new skills and techniques. We have some flourishing industries, some of the old ones, and we have some industries started in recent times which are doing very well.  At the same time, these are few and far between and one could almost count them on one's fingers.</P>
    <P>It was also mentioned here that the Minister and the Department were watching prices.  I wonder if they are &mdash;I doubt it.  I do not think that since this Government came into office any attempt has been made to halt increases in prices of any kind.  The Taoiseach made the statement that there was not enough profit ploughed back into industry.  That may be right. I do not think the Department can claim that they have made any attempt whatever to control the prices of any commodities.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister's statement, 186 trade disputes went before the Labour Court and he claimed it worked in settling them.  I have no doubt it did, but what was the cause of all those trade disputes coming before the Labour Court?  What was the reason that 186 trade disputes came before the Labour Court?  Do we not know what it was&mdash;that it arose <Col N="1574" /> out of the Budget which increased the cost of living, the price of bread, the price of butter, the price of sugar and flour?  The people had to look for something to compensate for those increases. When the Minister for Finance was bringing in those increases, he called on workers and others not to look for any compensatory benefits. Did he not know that the people would have to get some extra money to meet the increased cost of living?</P>
    <P>Now that the Government have seen the result of that increase in the cost of living by their own deliberate action, I wonder if they can see the effects it has brought about in the country.  There were 186 trade disputes due simply and solely to that.  What amount of money is coming out of Irish industry now, to meet all the advances which were given, including the £1,250,000 to the civil servants, or caused by the increases in the cost of living brought about by the Budget, and the increases in the price of foodstuffs?</P>
    <P>I expected that the Minister&mdash;being Minister for Industry and Commerce in a very strong Government&mdash;would have given us his views to-night on the question of container traffic.  However, he did not speak about it; he just brushed it to one side like many other things.  He placed it on the shelf again; he had referred it to the Labour Court and he was placing his trust in God that everything would be all right. In the recent shipping freights inquiry, several remarks were made about that container traffic.  There are one or two on which I wish to comment.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12th June, 1958.</P>
