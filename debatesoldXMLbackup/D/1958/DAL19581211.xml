      <P>The available statistical information in relation to tourism in this country in 1956 and 1957 was given in the articles entitled Statistics of Numbers and Expenditure of Visitors to Ireland and Irish Visitors Abroad&rdquo;, which appeared in the June, 1957, and June, 1958, issues of the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin</i> and in the articles entitled &ldquo;Hotels and Guest Houses: Receipts, Guest Registrations and Bed-nights&rdquo; in the March, 1957, and March, 1958, issues of the same journal to which I would refer the Deputy.  It is not possible to give the country of normal residence of tourists as distinct from other visitors but I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement which includes the available data.</P>
      <P>This information is compiled only on an annual basis and the corresponding figures for 1958 will not be available for some time.</P>

    <P>&dagger;The sharp decline shown between 1956 and 1957 was due entirely to a fall in the estimate of the number of visits of persons from Britain who crossed the Border by private motor vehicles.  A new method of estimation was adopted in 1957 so that the estimate for 1957 is not comparable with those for earlier years.  It is believed that the estimates for years prior to 1957 are somewhat too high and that the number of visits by private motor vehicles of Six County residents are correspondingly too low.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if having regard to the large number of mentally defective children awaiting admission to St. Vincent's Home, Annacotty, Limerick, he will sanction the proposals made to him to <Col N="1919" /> provide increased accommodation in this institution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals have been made to me to provide increased accommodation at St. Vincent's Home, Annacotty, County Limerick, by means of a scheme of major extensions which would involve heavy expenditure.  I have explained to the authorities of the Institution that the resources of the Hospitals Trust Fund for some years to come will be strained to meet existing commitments under the hospital building programme and that in the circumstances a grant to enable a major scheme of extensions to be carried out at this institution could not be considered at this stage.</P>
      <P>The provision of accommodation for mentally defective children received special consideration under the post-war hospital building programme and the accommodation previously available has already been more than doubled.  As I informed the Deputy last week, in reply to a question on the subject, the total accommodation available at present in mental defective institutions is approximately 2,380 beds.  Of these 1,300 (approximately) have been provided since 1948.  More over, it is expected that 210 additional beds will become available early next year.  Planning for the provision of a further 175 beds is in progress.  The Deputy may be assured, therefore, that the problem of providing further accommodation for mentally defective children is not being overlooked.  It has, however, to be considered in conjunction with other aspects of the hospital building programme and in the light of the limited funds available.</P>

Would the Minister give his favourable consideration to a more modest scheme of accommodation than that originally put forward for this home?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that insured workers, their wives and dependents are being charged fees in certain cases by private doctors attending them in private or semi-private hospital wards; if he will make a statement in order to clarify the position; and if he will state the procedure necessary to ensure that an insured worker will not leave himself open to such charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a patient (including) an insured person or his dependent) eligible to receive institutional services under the Health Acts, 1953 to 1957, elects to enter private or semi-private accommodation in an approved voluntary hospital the liability of the health authority concerned is limited to a subvention towards the cost of his maintenance in the hospital. The subvention does not include any payment in respect of the services of the visiting medical staff of the hospital, and the patient is liable for the payment of fees to the medical staff for their services.  In addition the hospital authorities may recover from the patient the difference between the amount of the subvention and the amount of what would normally be the hospital bill excluding any fees chargeable by the visiting medical staff.</P>
      <P>If a patient receiving services under the Acts elects to enter private or semi-private accommodation, where available, in a hospital conducted by a health authority he would be liable to the health authority for certain charges, namely, the charge he would have to bear if he were in a public ward plus an addition because he was in private or semi-private accommodation. In addition he would be liable for fees to a member of the medical staff if that member had the right to private beds in the hospital and he entered the hospital as the private patient of that member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that an eligible person has to <Col N="1921" /> do to ensure that he will not leave himself open to charges by the medical staff is to make it clear to the hospital authority when entering the hospital that the accommodation he wants is public ward accommodation or that he is not entering the hospital as the private patient of any member of the medical staff.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>An insured worker, his wife and any other dependent in Limerick City who is eligible for services under Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953 (broadly, any person, who is covered by a medical card), is entitled as an in-patient to free hospital services in a public ward of any hospital in Limerick City or in the Limerick Regional Hospital, and as an out-patient to free X-ray services or other specialist services, as defined, at any of the clinics approved by the Limerick Corporation for such purposes. He must be referred for such services by a doctor, and, if that doctor in the local district medical officer, no fee is chargeable by the doctor, but if the doctor is not the local district medical officer, he may charge a fee. Otherwise no fee is payable by the insured person to any doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any other insured worker, his wife and any other dependent in Limerick City is entitled as an in-patient to hospital services in a public ward in any hospital to which he is sent by the health authority at a charge not exceeding 10/- a day or in a public ward of any other hospital of his choice at a charge of 10/- a day.  As an out-patient, he is entitled to X-ray service at a charge of 7/6 and to other specialist services as defined at <Col N="1922" /> a charge of 2/6 at any of the clinics approved by Limerick Corporation for such purposes.  As in the case of the insured worker who is covered by a medical card, he must be referred for any such services by a doctor who in this case may charge a fee.  Again, as in the case of the insured worker covered by a medical card, he is not liable for payment of any fee to any other doctor.</P>
    <P>The first step to be taken by a patient wishing to avail himself of these services is, therefore, to consult his family doctor and if institutional or specialist services are necessary he should obtain a reference to the appropriate hospital or clinic, where coincident with the commencement of investigation or treatment as appropriate, the necessary form of application for services under the Health Acts can be completed for submission by the institution concerned to the health authority.  Any question of doubt or difficulty should be taken up with the Limerick Corporation.</P>

Planting programmes totalling 1,549 acres are scheduled at the six centres this season, compared with a total of 1,113 acres in 1957-58.

      <P>There was a decrease of £1,659,235 in 1957 compared with 1956.  The primary cause of the decrease appears to have been the scheme of petrol rationing which came into operation on the 1st January, 1957.  In order to ensure that they would get petrol coupons a very considerable number of vehicle owners taxed their vehicles in December, 1956, for the succeeding calendar year. Receipts for 1956 were accordingly inflated and those for the calendar year 1957 correspondingly reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying when the House adjourned last night, no Deputy has so far in this debate made any serious effort to refute the well-established fact that stable government is essential to progress in any country and no Deputy has attempted to refute the fact that stable government is invariably the outcome of an election under the straight vote system. It is in an attempt to obscure these facts that the Opposition have dragged all sorts of red herrings into the debate.  A case had to be made by the Opposition that Fianna Fáil were proposing this change for a mere Party manoeuvre.  That could not be properly contested unless they could malign the commission which will be responsible for the setting up of the constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to do that, it meant that they even had to impeach the members of the bench also, in an attempt to prove in the most abstract manner that Fianna Fáil were activated merely by Party motives in bringing in this measure.  None of them believed that. Each Deputy is looking at it from his personal point of view or the view of his Party.  It is a well-known fact on the other side of the House that the vast majority of the people want stable government and if the people in the last election voted for one thing more than another, it was for stable government after their experience of the previous few years.  The Opposition <Col N="1945" /> know that the people are already well aware that by voting in favour of the referendum, they are voting for the elimination of frequently recurring elections.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick referred to the cost of the referendum but he did not mention the number of elections that were necessarily held in the past 30 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>He refused to refer to the number of times the people have had to bear a cost of £80,000 in their quest for stability.  Deputy Norton tried to prove that we had stability under P.R. and he referred to the few changes we had in government, but he was careful not to mention the number of elections we had to secure that stability.  If we had few changes, it was because of special circumstances, in the absence of which the position could have been very different.  The special circumstances were that we had the Fianna Fáil Party with a strong programme, determined not to &ldquo;truck&rdquo; with any other Party but determined to secure stability, even though it meant referring to the country fairly frequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people do not want frequent elections and no doubt they will seize this opportunity to ensure, as they can do now, that elections will not take place except when normally due. Nobody, even among those who have tried to make the case, believes that anybody will be disfranchised.  The people will decide what Government they want.  They will exercise their vote to the best of their ability and to say that various minorities will be deprived of representation is absolute nonsense.  As is well known, the P.R. system creates minorities unnecessarily and it is not a question of minorities seeking representation.  I come from a constituency where the Protestant minority cannot secure representation directly here as such. It is a three-seat constituency and under P.R. about 3,000 people who come out and vote for whatever member on the panel they think suitable are not directly represented; but they <Col N="1946" /> do not abstain and I have great pleasure in saying that I have the confidence of the greater part of the majority.  I am not ashamed to say I have always been prepared to do what I could for them in the little matters that affect their everyday lives. They are good citizens and make a full contribution to the economy of the State.  They will not be affected by the single-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>The people do not expect every little pocket representing every &ldquo;sorehead&rdquo; section of the community to send somebody here and the people who would suggest that this House should be representative of every little section or pressure group would turn this House into a mere talking shop, with no possibility of making any progress, no possibility of enacting any defined programme put before the electorate at election time.  That is what the Deputies opposite advocate.</P>
    <P>If there is one thing more than another that the straight voting system provides, it is that any Party coming before the people at election time must have a programme and a policy in which the people will have confidence. If a Party fulfils that requirement it is very likely to obtain the necessary support, but if it does not live up to its promises and to the programme offered to the people before getting their support, it will not be returned on the next occasion.  That is amply demonstrated in any country where direct voting operates.  Therefore, people who say that by this enactment Fianna Fáil will continue the life of the Party as a Government Party in perpetuity are paying Fianna Fáil a definite tribute in that they assert that Fianna Fáil is the only Party likely to retain the confidence of the electorate.</P>
    <P>One cannot continue discussing points that have been made repeatedly in the past few weeks.  Everything that could possibly be said by the Opposition, using the Dáil as a platform from which to try to drag the minds of the people away from the actual purpose of the referendum, has been said.  No Opposition can convince the people that you will not have stability under the direct system, and unless they can convince the people that stability is <Col N="1947" /> unnecessary for progress, their entire case falls to the ground.</P>
    <P>They fall back on the old argument that Fianna Fáil are trying to gerrymander the constituencies.  That is impossible.  Take any constituency, in the Twenty-Six Counties and consider how many times it has changed.  I know constituencies which at one time sent three or four Fine Gael or Cumann na nGaedheal representatives to this House, but that position is reversed to-day.  They may have changed several times in the past few years.  How can anybody select a pocket or area and say: &ldquo;I know the people in that area will remain loyal to such-and-such a Party for all time&rdquo;? I do not think anybody or any commission, even if they wished to do it, would be capable of doing it.  I am prepared to let a commission appointed entirely by the Opposition go into West Donegal to-morrow and carve it up to suit any particular Party.  The position can change in 12 months' time.</P>
    <P>I believe there is more rightcousness on the side of the Government in respect of this measure than any other measure that has come before the House.  It is a simple matter for the Opposition members to get up and make threats about people being deprived of representation, but they are losing sight of the fact that it is the people who will decide, as decide they will.  When they go before the people and tell them this is tantamount to setting up a dictatorship simply because a Government will be sufficiently strong to remain in office for five years it will be a very poor argument to the people as a whole who are disgusted with elections taking place before the lapse of the normal period.</P>
    <P>I do not see what case can be made by those people who make taunts about the loyalty of Fianna Fáil to the leadership of the Party.  I do not think the members of a Party in this House have any other ambition than to see that their Party is well disciplined, well organised and can act as a body.  They have their Party meetings and discuss their proposed legislation. They can discuss their future <Col N="1948" /> plans and come to the Dáil with one voice.  It is certainly new tactics on the part of the Opposition when that is held up as an example of dictatorship.</P>
    <P>At one time, it was the practice to sneer at this side of the House and say there was a split in the Party.  Now the great crime is that there is too much loyalty.  Members are all voting the same way.  We are not the only members showing loyalty.  I remember on one occasion when we were discussing, I think, the City and County Management (Amendment) Bill the Labour Party put down an amendment which Fianna Fáil saw fit to support, and they withdrew the amendment rather than support Fianna Fáil and defeat the Coalition Government at the time.  These things are not unusual in the House.  A Party is not worth its salt if it cannot have loyalty and discipline.  It will never be successful as a Party, unless it can act in accordance with proper leadership. If you think you can get the country to believe that is dictatorship, you are reckoning on very low intelligence on the part of the electorate.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to hold the House repeating things that have been said so often in the past few weeks.  However, I want to say something I will not be ashamed to read if I live for generations to come.  I believe we are doing right by posterity.  I never supported anything in this House in which I believed more sincerely.  I do not think the Deputies who have opposed it, just as they have opposed the various reforms which Fianna Fáil have brought about in their time, will be prepared in years to come to have their names associated with the opposition they are now putting up to this measure which will do something which I believe is necessary, that is, ensure stability of government in the generations to come.</P>
    <P>We talk about bringing in the unfree portion of the country.  The unfree portion of the country does not want to come into a Parliament where elections and instability are the order of the day, where economic progress is inhibited by the fact that a strong <Col N="1949" /> stable Government is seldom elected under the system the Opposition are upholding.  For that reason, I merely intervene in the debate to say what I think is honest and sincere, that generations to come will vindicate the action we have taken in giving the people the opportunity to vote in this referendum to give to themselves a system that will stand the test of time and ensure a Government by majority, not by pressure groups or minorities.</P>

      <P>We may accept that the views Deputy Brennan has expressed are sincerely held, and that prompts one to consider what has been happening to people like Deputy Brennan who now in the month of December, 1958, find themselves making a speech in this House which this night 12 months ago they never thought they would be making.  Is it not extraordinary that a decent man like Deputy Brennan can express here with obvious feeling opposition to a system which sent him into Dáil Eireann?</P>

      <P>Is it not extraordinary that this is the first time Deputy Brennan ever criticised P.R.? In the last election I have no doubt Deputy Brennan when seeking his seat in Dáil Éireann had due regard to the fact that there were 3,000 Protestants in his constituency and he did not say to them, nor did any other Deputy in that Party over there say: &ldquo;Vote for us; elect us as a Government and we will introduce a Bill designed to end P.R.&rdquo;  I am prepared to accept that Deputy Brennan holds sincerely the views he has expressed here.  I am impressed by the iron discipline that kept him quiet until now and prevented his speaking in the last election campaign for fear the cat might get out of the bag and there would be no support from religious and other minorities for the Fianna Fáil Party who were seeking their votes just 18 months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan has now the opportunity to speak, secure in his position in this House, with full knowledge of <Col N="1950" /> the fact that if this &ldquo;gimmick&rdquo; succeeds, he can click his fingers at the 3,000 Protestants in West Donegal because no matter when an election is held back into Dáil Éireann will come the bold Deputy Brennan.</P>

What does Deputy Brennan think we should do&mdash; sit silent and mute while the Government proceeds to tear down the Constitution as we know it?</P>

      <P>Does he think, and if he does whence does he get his view, that we on this side of the House do not conceive it our duty to do now what we did at much cost 36 years ago&mdash;preserve the rights of the people against assaults?  If we are having a full discussion on the merits or demerits of P.R. in this autumn session of the Dáil, let the people outside realise who has initiated this discussion. There are burning problems facing our people, unemployment and other economic problems of various kinds, and we would be serving the people better by discussing those problems, but we are not allowed to do it because the Government, bereft of ideas, have no legislative proposals to put down for the autumn session of this Dáil.  Accordingly, instead of discussing the economic situation and its implications, matters of burning concern to the people, here we are discussing the merits and demerits of P.R.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan blames us, but if ever a Government have proceeded in the teeth of public opinion this Government have done so.  They have <Col N="1951" /> ensured that this entire session of Dáil Éireann will be consumed in dealing with this matter, which, no matter how long it is discussed here, will not put a single man who is out of work back into work.  It will not cause the draining of a single acre of land and it will not put a house or a roof over those without a home.  It is being discussed at a time when people are streaming from our shores daily, when the queues of the unemployed are becoming longer and longer.  We are here, in the second year of this Government, which got into office to get cracking, doing nothing but talking about the merits and the demerits of P.R.</P>
    <P>It is a shame on the Taoiseach, on every member of his Government and on the Deputies sitting behind him that this situation should be permitted to develop.  This Government got into office to get cracking.  It appealed to the women of this city to &ldquo;Vote Fianna Fáil and get your men back to work&rdquo;.  It used such slogans as &ldquo;Vote Fianna Fáil and we will beat the crisis&rdquo;.  Now, 18 months later, that Government spend the entire autumn session of Dáil Éireann in an academic discussion of the best method of ensuring its continuance in office.  We cannot help that.  As a vigilant and determined Opposition, it is our duty to resist this effort by the Government, to ensure that, here in the only place where we can do it, it will be fully discussed, that every angle of it will be explored, and even though Deputy Brennan and his colleagues do not like it, we intend to continue to do it.</P>
    <P>Let us throw our minds back and see how this extraordinary proposal saw the light of day.  I am willing to wager that if Deputy Brennan, Deputy Booth and the other Fianna Fáil Deputies were put into a room at the end of last August and asked to define the 12 or 24 most urgent and most important political problems, and if they were left there for three days, they would emerge without a single one of them having mentioned the abolition of P.R.  It was never present in the minds of the people.  It was never mentioned <Col N="1952" /> except by the Taoiseach occasionally when Fianna Fáil was beaten and then, every time he was challenged about it, the Taoiseach was careful to say: &ldquo;I did not quite mean that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Towards the end of August, an inspired report crept into the newspapers that the Government were considering proposals to end the system of P.R. Shortly afterwards, one of the most extraordinary developments took place. The Taoiseach, or Prime Minister, held a Press interview.  He called the reporters in and disclosed to them his own personal views with regard to P.R., but he was careful to say that he had not yet put it to the Government. Was there ever such a bit of balloon-flying and play-acting as that &mdash;a Press interview by the Taoiseach giving his own views on P.R. and saying that he did not know whether the Government would agree with him or not?  He need not have had any doubt because, a few days later in the Council Chamber in Merrion Street, the Government met and entirely agreed with the Taoiseach.  I am sure that any doubts he had about his proposals were quickly put at rest.  The Government endorsed the Taoiseach's proposals and so this Bill saw the light of day.</P>
    <P>I believe there is not a member of the Government who examined for himself what is involved in the Taoiseach's proposals.  There was no critical examination.  Apparently, once the Taoiseach said that this was his view, the boys said: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  As long as the Taoiseach said that it was a good thing, it was accepted.  I wonder are they now beginning to realise that Homer nodded, that there was a mistake and that they have started something they cannot control?  Are they beginning to realise that in a matter of this kind they are playing with fire and that not only will other people be burned but that their own hands may be singed also?</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that, even if the members of the Government and their colleagues in this House have convinced themselves that everything is all right, their own supporters throughout the country by no means agree with <Col N="1953" /> them.  The more this matter is discussed and examined, the more the people are worried as to what the outcome may be.  I believe that fair-minded Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party realise that this proposal just goes too far.  It may be all very well to delete from the Constitution the reference to P.R. and to allow this House to endeavour to devise the best method of election, whether or not it be the single member, non-transferable vote, but it is quite another thing to remove P.R. from the Constitution and to put in its place a system which is completely untried, so far as this House is aware.  Is that not going too far?</P>

      <P>As I say, the proposals have not been examined in a critical manner by the Government. Certain arguments have been used here in its favour and other arguments have been used against the system we all know.  One argument has been that it was imposed by the British.  I would have thought that, by 1958, Deputies in Fianna Fáil would have grown up&mdash; but no.  The same sort of silly cant we used to bear in this country, 20 or 30 years ago, is solemnly trotted out again. &ldquo;P.R. was imposed by the British&rdquo;&mdash; that kind of argument is used by Deputies who are expected to be reasonably intelligent people.  For what purpose do they use that argument? They use it to try to work up outside an unthinking antipathy to P.R.  It is the same sort of slogan as: &ldquo;Burn everything British except their coal&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;oppose P.R. because it was imposed by the British.&rdquo;  Imposed how are you!</P>
      <P>Was P.R. imposed when this House sat as a constituent assembly in 1922 and freely resolved, in the first Constitution, to elect its members by P.R.? Is it suggested that the British were trying to impose their will upon us at that time?</P>

Article 26 of that Constitution provided that &ldquo;Dáil Éireann shall be composed of members elected to represent constituencies determined by law,&rdquo; and the Article went on to provide that the system of election would be in accordance with the principles of P.R.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 26 of the 1922 Constitution.  I want to know, when this argument is used that this system was imposed by the British, if it is being suggested that our leaders at that time, who had succeeded in seeing the last British Tommy march down to Dún Laoghaire and sail away, our leaders, like the great Michael Collins and the rest of them in this House, accepted dictation from the British as to the manner in which this House would elect itself?  Every Deputy who uses that kind of argument shames himself, if not this House, and certainly shames those who gave much to establish this State 36 years ago.  When the Constitution Deputy N. Lemass is looking at was enacted by the people in 1937, when in that Constitution Article 16, sub-Article 5, provided that the system of election to the Dáil should be in accordance with the declared <Col N="1956" /> system of P.R., is it suggested that the British were imposing that upon us?</P>
      <P>The argument is absurd and whoever uses it, and it is being used by members of Fianna Fáil, is puring scorn on his own leader in 1937. They are pouring scorn on the man who now leads their Government because it was the present Taoiseach who, in this House, in 1936, declared his belief in P.R., declared that it had worked well in the country, declared that it had given stability to the country, stability which had been denied to other countries that did not use it.  It was their own leader who, in 1936, asked the Irish people in a referendum to support the system of P.R. Nevertheless, here we are told in this debate, by Fianna Fáil Deputies, that this system was imposed on us by the British.  If it was, if that is so, then, in 1936, the present Taoiseach was doing what the British told him to do, and I do not believe that.</P>
      <P>What are the facts?  They have been stated here already by the leader of the Opposition in the magnificent speech which he made.  He has reminded Deputies that anyone who says the system of P.R. was imposed by the British, in effect, is insulting the memory of the founder of Sinn Féin and the first President of the State, the late Arthur Griffith.  It was Arthur Griffith who campaigned tirelessly through the years for the adoption in this country of the system of P.R. Right from the early years of this century, the achievement of P.R. was one of Griffith's aims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a measure of Home Rule or independence became possible in the early teens of this century and when the British used the argument that Home Rule would mean Rome rule, Griffith was more insistent than ever that that argument must be resisted in order to ensure there would not be Rome rule, as had been urged at that time, but that the new Irish State would pledge itself to give under P.R. due and proper representation to minorities. Deputy Booth must remember that well.  It was because of the sincerity of Griffith and those associated with him, including the present Taoiseach, that pledges were given in <Col N="1957" /> 1919, that if we established here by the success of our arms a new Irish State, that State would ensure that its minorities would be accorded fair representation under the system of P.R.</P>
    <P>That is how P.R. became part and parcel of our history.  It is because of that that P.R., as we know it, means something in comparative Irish history. It is because of that historical background and the pledges given by Griffith and repeated by Collins, pledges which they were prepared to honour even unto their deaths, that we in this Party, as the main Opposition Party, are determined to play fair by those who founded this State.  We are determined to ensure that no improvisation urged now will tear a page or write a line across the pledges given on the foundation of this State. The system has nothing to do with the issue of any British Government.  It was part and parcel of our national heritage.</P>
    <P>Having achieved our independence, we freely and gladly put it into our Constitution in 1922 and the Irish people freely and gladly approved of it in the present Constitution.  I hope that that kind of argument will not further be heard because it is not an argument on the merits.  It is designed merely to cloud the issue.  It is hoped that by using it a blind prejudice may be worked up amongst the people and that many people may vote against the system because of some anti-British feeling they still retain.</P>
    <P>Then it is said that the single-member constituency, with no transferable vote, is something better.  Did you ever hear anything like it?  The same Deputies who are saying: &ldquo;Do not vote for P.R. because it was imposed by the British&rdquo; are seeking to put into operation in this country the system which the British have made peculiarly their own.  There is not a person who has made any study, theoretical or practical, of political matters who must not be aware that in Britain for many years there has been a growing concern about their present system of election.  In Britain itself, many people realise that the system is faulty; that <Col N="1958" /> it is undemocratic; that it brings minority government and that from time to time it has produced considerable injustices; but it is the system, we are told, which will be better than P.R.  We are to do here what they found it necessary to do in the North to maintain in office the Unionist Party.  That is what we are to have here.</P>
    <P>The Deputies who ask the people to vote against P.R. because it was imposed by the British say the suggested system will give stability.  I wonder do the Deputies who use that argument ever pause to think what is meant by &ldquo;stability&rdquo;.  What does &ldquo;stability&rdquo; mean to them?  I know of no word more abused than &ldquo;stability&rdquo;. Surely &ldquo;stability&rdquo; means the continuance of law and order and the institutions of our State?  Surely &ldquo;stability&rdquo; means that the Constitution itself and the organs of society shall continue to operate properly and smoothly?</P>
    <P>Stability does not mean&mdash;the Lord forbid that it should&mdash;that there should not be a change of government.  If stability meant that after every election the same Deputies occupied the same old seats in this House that would not be stability.  That would be atrophy. Really, those who talk about stability misuse the term and what they say is that this will mean that there will not be a change of government and, of course, that is what they really intend and desire.</P>
    <P>We had true stability in this State over the past 36 years.  We had the stability that enabled this Dáil to withstand assaults from without.  We had the stability that enabled our courts, our Garda force, our Army and our laws to be respected up and down the State.  We had the kind of stability that enabled a Government which never had a majority in this House to govern effectively and wisely for ten years.  We had the kind of stability which enabled this State to grow up to full manhood.  We had it under P.R.</P>
    <P>We had at the same time our due and proper change of government without the Constitution or the organs of the State being endangered.  In <Col N="1959" /> 1932, when a Fianna Fáil Government came into office, they took over a machine running well.  They did not try to abuse it.  They did not try to misuse it.  They respected this House because they learned where they had gone wrong in the past.  They upheld the organs of the State because they knew they were sent into this House to take over the Government by a majority of the people.  That was given to them by P.R.</P>
    <P>Throughout the past 36 years in dangerous and difficult times in this State, when a Government had to stand up to make a difficult decision and when individual Ministers had to take their own lives in their hands, they were enabled to do that because they knew that under P.R. they had the backing and support of the majority of the people.  P.R. gave us stability in the past 36 years.  If Deputies do not realise that inside this House, there are people outside who will.</P>
    <P>As I say, those who use this argument misuse it.  Saying one thing, they intend another.  What they really hope to achieve is a situation in which it will not be possible easily to change the Government itself.  Suppose we had a situation south of the Border such as obtains in the Six Counties in the North.  If, after every single general election, as certain as the clock moves on, or as day follows night, the same old Government was bound to be reelected, if the same old team went back to the same old jobs, it might be called stability but I would hazard a guess that it would lead to the break-down of the organs of society.</P>
    <P>I believe that here, south of the Border, there are classes and sections of people who would not easily abide a situation in which they could never change the Government, in which they could never get a new policy in operation.  I believe they would resent the kind of system that gave them back, from a farcical election, and same Government, unvarnished and unchanged each time.</P>
    <P>I want to warn Fianna Fáil Deputies and people outside who may be misled that as sure as the system of P.R. is changed&mdash;if that ever <Col N="1960" /> happens&mdash;we shall have instability, the like of which has never been seen anywhere else throughout the globe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to warn the people and Deputies here whose minds are not blinded with prejudice about the system of election which is proposed.  I just want to give a few examples of what I mean and I hope I shall be permitted to refer to minorities without its being assumed <Col N="1961" /> immediately that I am referring to religious minorities.  I want to remind Deputies that there are definite views of a minority kind held by different section of our people.  There are political movements and organisations in this country designed to represent a section of the people.  There are various farming organisations and their purpose and concern is to represent the interests of farming.  There are different organisations dealing with different forms of activity by different people which represent various sections.</P>
      <P>The big movement, however, in this country is the trade union movement. The trade union movement is part and parcel of Irish life.  It owes its existence to the efforts made by great Irishmen in the past, men like James Connolly and such people.  They were men who played their part in establishing this House and in building up the freedom that this part of the country enjoys to-day.  James Connolly was succeeded later by Big Jim Larkin who fought on the side of the workers and who came into this House to do it&mdash;to ask, to demand and to appeal from whoever was on the Government Benches for the implementation of a policy designed to create more employment and to better the living standards of the Irish workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to remind Fianna Fáil Deputies that men like Connolly and Larkin just cannot be forgotten.  They are not just names that can be scored out of a page of Irish history.  They are part of Irish history.  Were it not for the fact that men such as Larkin could come into this House, to fight inside this House for the things they believed in; were it not for the fact that the gates of Leinster House were opened to them&mdash;provided they were able to get a sufficient number of people to give them a quota&mdash;we would still have minority demands but they would be made down on the Custom House Quay and elsewhere by persons fighting for the people they were pledged to serve.  Were it not for that fact we would have in this country the kind of situation in which the gates of Leinster House would be shut in the <Col N="1962" /> face of a new Connolly, or a new Larkin, or people legitimately representing 800,000 Irish workers.  If that day ever comes, this House itself will be in jeopardy and those who think that they are fashioning comfortable seats for themselves in this House will find that they have been playing with fire and that more than those they set out to burn have felt the flames.</P>
    <P>There are other minorities here apart from the trade union movement. We always have the lunatic fringe amongst our people, those who still think of the things which others have learned to forget: those who still think that an Irish State can be ignored and that Irish law can be shrugged aside; those who still think they are entitled to hold the view that the gun in an individual's hand is the best setter of an argument.  That lunatic fringe has always been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They are entitled to make that opinion the law of the land, provided they get sufficient people to send them in here with a majority, just as others learned that lesson in time.  We have always had that view amongst our people.  Possibly it is part of our temperament.  There are those amongst us who still think that 1922 never dawned.  There are those amongst our people who apparently never realised that the last British soldier left this land of ours 36 years ago.  There are people amongst us who are still fighting fights that are now forgotten and believing views now discarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is that lunatic fringe that did not learn the better way, as Fianna Fáil did 30 years ago.  There are those who never learned to respect this House as Fianna Fáil did in 1927. There are those who never realised that the democratic way and the right way of getting their policy accepted is by securing a majority of votes, as Fianna Fáil did, and getting elected by Deputies as a Government, as Fianna Fáil did.  There are those who have not learned the lesson which the Taoiseach learned in 1927.  They have <Col N="1963" /> a definite point of view.  Deputy Booth may say that they are not entitled to be there.  They are there. There is no good in going around in blinkers, in believing that by closing our eyes, what is in front of our noses will disappear.  They are there at the moment, so much so that a couple of hundred Irishmen have now to be kept in durance, interned in the Curragh.  What is the use of saying whether they are right or wrong? Right or wrong, those are their views.</P>
    <P>I want to say to Deputy Booth that that problem did not arise in the past 18 months or the past three years.  It has been there all along.  It has been eased to some extent because we have always been entitled to say to these people&mdash;no matter what Government has been elected to this House in the past&mdash;&ldquo;You are wrong.  You know how you can make yourselves right, by going to the people and getting the people to accept your policy.  You can then come into the House, as others did before you, and try to make the changes which, in your salad days, you believed in.&rdquo;  The very moment we appear to adopt a system of election which they can assert closes the doors of Leinster House upon them then we lose the authority and the right to enforce our admonitions against them.</P>

I do not care if they call themselves Sinn Féil nowadays.  That is a proud old name given to this country by Arthur Griffith.  No matter what they call themselves, their point of view, up to this, has consistently been represented in this House and it is a point of view, whether Deputy Booth likes it or not, that is held by Irishmen.</P>

      <P>Considering this argument about stability, one <Col N="1965" /> would imagine that we were going to have a change of government every few months.  Of course, that is absurd. Over the past 36 years, we have had only three Prime Minister or Taoisigh &mdash;only three.  In Britain in that period, they had seven different Prime Ministers. Does that mean anything to Fianna Fáil Deputies?  Are they so blinded by prejudice that they cannot realise what is meant by that?  Three Prime Ministers in 36 years&mdash;emphasising that under the system of election here, our people are slow to change but when they change they change.</P>
      <P>Edmund Burke was a great Irishman who was sent from Trinity College across to Westminster in the 18th century.  He defined stability as being change in continuity and continuity in change.  Have we not had that in the past 36 years?  We have not, merely for some quite odd or fanciful reason, put in a Government and taken it out again.  It was ten years before there was a first change of government.  It was 16 years before there was a second change, and in that period, as I say, we had only three leaders of Government in this country.  Where is the instability?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of elections represents the folly of one man.  It is perfectly true that the present Taoiseach has always been concerned to have an election.  He has had them in doubles, in pairs and in braces of elections.  He had an election in 1932 and 1933; 1937 and 1938; 1943 and 1944; 1947 and 1948.</P>
      <P>Mind you, I suppose there was method in his folly because each time he decided to have an election, he said to the people: &ldquo;The reason I want an election is that I want an overall majority.&rdquo;  He got it each time &mdash;under P.R.  Are the people to be blamed for that?  Each time they were told that a Government whose policy they were supporting needed an overall majority in this House, the people gave it to the Taoiseach and his Party.  Who is trying now to bite the hand that fed him?  Who is now being ungrateful to our people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest if Deputy Booth and his colleagues had regard to the extraordinary manner in which an indulgent Irish people have dealt with their Leader and their Party over the past 20 years, they would realise that to speak of the system of P.R. leading to instability is to insult the people themselves.  We all know our people are fundamentally honest.  Our people have always done the thing they believed to be right, If they wanted to give any Party standing before them a complete majority in this House they gave it to them every time; if they felt it was a wrong thing to do, that it might be better not to put one Party in a position of pre-eminence in this House, they did not do it.  Why are Deputies so audacious in this House?  Why are we so preened with our own importance that we can look back over the past 36 years and say the Irish people were mistaken?  That is a bit of audacity in which I do not think any Deputy in this House is entitled to take part.</P>
      <P>It is also said that the present system of P.R. does not lead to strong government. Again, we should have agreement on terms.  I do not know what &ldquo;strong government&rdquo; means.  I thought it should be the concern of this House to get and retain good government.  You have strong government in many cases throughout the world.  It is not necessarily beneficial and power, we know, corrupts.  Surely the concern should be, in examining the record, to see whether we have had good Governments in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all entitled to our points of view.  People are entitled to criticise the things in which my Party believes, the things they have done, the mistakes they have made.  Of course they are entitled to it.  But those who say that P.R. does not lead to strong government should remember that, for ten years from the foundation of this State, there was in charge of this country a band of young men, the first Government of this country, who never had a majority in this House.  I believe they were a good Government.  I believe they were a strong Government also. <Col N="1967" /> I believe they had to take decisions that cannot be compared with what had to be done since.  They were strong because they were good, because they were doing the right thing, following the right policy.</P>
    <P>Strong government; you have strong government now&mdash;and what are we doing?  Instead of trying to solve the problems of the country, we are discussing P.R. here.  A strong Government; mind you, it is not a good Government because it is not putting first things first.  When eventually we all, as we must, stand on this issue before the bar of public opinion, before the people who will decide it, I trust that from this debate at least may come a discarding of some arguments and that the issue will be put properly before the people by those who believe in the merits of the change by doing it honestly and genuinely.</P>
    <P>Other arguments are used.  It is said that the change proposed will lead to a better type of Deputy in this House.  That argument is used by Fianna Fáil.  Since there are 77 Fianna Fáil Deputies in this House, presumably it is used about themselves. Though each Deputy in Fianna Fáil uses that argument, yet when he looks in the looking-glass when he is shaving himself in the morning, he says: &ldquo;I am not talking about myself.&rdquo; I am sure that Deputy Burke will say that the change will bring a better type of Deputy to this House. He has not in mind that Deputy Burke should cease to sit here.  It is more Deputy Burkes that Deputy Burke wants.</P>
    <P>We know well that the kind of change proposed here is unlikely to lead to a better type of representation. I have read what Deputy Booth had to say.  I hope I am not having the somniferous effect on the rest of the House that I am having on Deputy Booth.  Although he has limited experience in this House, Deputy Booth will remember, I am sure, the feeling of dismay which must arise with any Government when, apart from the loss involved, suddenly a by-election has to take place.  The <Col N="1968" /> hearts jump to the mouths.  A cold shiver runs to the spine.  If it is a country constituency, they will look around for the best hurler or the best footballer and try to nab him first. Fianna Fáil Deputies know this very well.  Is that the kind of representation that is good for this House? Under a by-election, you have a single member being sent here&mdash;I agree with the transferable vote but a single member is sent here.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the proposed change takes place, the level of representation in this House will suffer very much.  We have a good House.  I believe, largely speaking, that Deputies in the different Parties&mdash;and I include Deputies not in Parties&mdash;are a good cross-section of our people.  We have a decent good House and a good personnel inside this House.</P>

      <P>The kind of representation now held up to our people to have in this House is that of the so-called Mother of Parliaments, Westminster.  I would say, in regard to some 80 per cent. of the members in that Assembly, that it would take three of them to make one Deputy in an Irish House.  They are elected because they are the local bigwigs or the local something else. They are sent into Westminster representing a Labour constituency, a Tory constituency, not because of any peculiar ability they have but merely because they are the particular persons the boys in the Party machine have selected.</P>

    <P>Here in this House, under P.R., no Deputy can afford to become complacent. If he desires to continue to be a member of this House, he has got to be up and about.  Deputy O'Malley and other Deputies know that well.  You cannot just take your post from the pigeon-hole outside, <Col N="1969" /> stuff it in your pocket and say: &ldquo;Maybe, in Tibb's Eve, I shall get around to answering that.&rdquo;  When your constituents come to you, you have to do as Deputy Burke does&mdash;to make sure that their problem is raised in this House.  Deputy Burke is a past master at that&mdash;and more power to him.  He is representing the people of his constituency.  He is not sitting indolently on a safe seat because the Party boss has put him there.  It might be that the Party bosses might have tried to get rid of Deputy Burke in the past but back in Deputy Burke came because the people Deputy Burke represented had the opportunity, under P.R., to vote for Paddy Burke.</P>

      <P>I am discussing the system.  I want to remind Deputies that, under P.R., each Deputy representing a constituency, particularly if he has colleagues, has to play the part of a proper representative in this House, to speak intelligently, to contribute by discussion to the solution of the people's problems, to look after the particular affairs of his constituency. He knows well that, if he does not, then, when the next election comes, his Party supporters will prefer another candidate in the Party. That is important.</P>

      <P>I do not think they can because, in a single member constituency, under the straight vote, Fianna Fáil supporters who, I am sure, will continue to be Fianna Fáil, must vote for the candidate.  If they do not vote for him, the other side will take the seat.  Whether or not they like his bright blue eyes, whether he is a lazy or an active man, whether or not he can read, whether or not he answers letters, they must vote for him because if they do not the other side get the seat.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke stands in County Dublin with two other good colleagues, the Minister for Defence and somebody else. If the Fianna Fáil supporters in County Dublin turn against Deputy Burke, they will vote for the Minister for Defence or the other candidate. If the Party has sufficient support, they will still have two seats, but out will go poor Deputy Burke.  That has meant that we are not morons in this House.  Each one of us has a part to play in pursuance of our ideals and of the policies in respect of which we were elected.</P>
      <P>Those are a few considerations in favour of the system we now have. There is an old saying that the devil you know is better than the devil you do not know.  We do not know the British system.  We had it here in the British days.  Deputies will remember that in the 1919 election the people turned against the Irish Parliamentary Party&mdash;a Party which, in its own way and in its own time, had rendered tremendous service to the country. But the people turned against it in 1919 and that Party was wiped out, although in that election it polled more votes than Fine Gael polled in the last election.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party still has 40 seats in the House.  We are enabled to live to fight another day.  &ldquo;Béidh lá eile ag an bPáirteach seo&rdquo; was a phrase used by a certain individual one time.  Under the system of single member constituencies the Irish Parliamentary Party did not live to fight another day.  It disappeared in 1919 but, thank God, its history, traditions and principles survived. There is something Deputies should remember.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this dangerous change the Government are asking the people to accept, very serious things can happen. Those in this House at one time may all be wiped out in due course.  This House may be undermined and the Government of this country may be entrusted to those who never had experience of the House before.  A change of government can mean such <Col N="1971" /> a revolution that catastrophe may result. We get away from the change in continuity and continuity in change, which represents the stability that Edmund Burke talked about some hundreds of years ago.  P.R. has given us stability.  In the words of the Taoiseach himself: &ldquo;It has served the country well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We in this country are fortunate to have had P.R.  We are fortunate to have inherited this system as part of the wisdom which Arthur Griffith brought to Irish political life.  It has served this country well.  It has meant that we have been saved from some of the violent changes that took place in other countries.  Of course, we have changed.  Deputies who at one time were on this side of the House walked across and took up government over there.  They did so under the system of P.R.  And when the time came for a change, it came.  But there have not been the dramatic changes in thought associated with the kind of system now urged upon us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Deputy give us any instances of that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be led away.  I believe with Deputy Dillon that this is an Irish question to be decided in an Irish way by Irish people and that you do not learn much by looking over the garden wall and seeing what John Bull and other people may be doing.  But there are examples.  Deputy Booth is probably aware that in South Africa there is a tremendous sentimental factor involved in the policy of racial segregation. Those who believe in racial segregation are operating a system whereby the coloured people are treated openly as under-privileged, herded into particular sections and kept underground. That is opposed to Christian ideals. Deputy Booth may be aware that that policy became the policy in South Africa through a minority Government elected on single member seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the general election of 1953 the South African Nationalist Party&mdash;the Government Party&mdash;polled 598,685 votes, a shade more than 500,000, <Col N="1972" /> and the Opposition&mdash;the Smuts Party &mdash;which opposed their policy, polled 608,000 votes.  They polled more votes than the Nationalist Party, but under the system urged upon us here the Nationalists got 92 seats and the Smuts Party 43 seats.  Thus the Prime Minister was able to say that the policy of racial segregation had been supported by the South African people whereas, in fact, a majority had voted against it.  That is a policy in respect of which there are high feelings on both sides.  Is it to be suggested that that is the kind of system we should have here?</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste was prophetic away back on the 10th November, 1933.  He saw away into the future and the danger that might occur, such as occurred in South Africa.  Deputies will remember that in 1933 it was proposed at the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis that the system of P.R. should be changed and this British system introduced.  The Tánaiste said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;P.R. was certainly a better system than that which prevailed heretofore and which was now in operation in Great Britain.  The system which operated in that country might well give a minority a very substantial majority in Parliament. It had done so in Britain and could do so here by the system of single member constituencies and the non-transferable vote.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are the very words the present Tánaiste used about the proposal he now asks the people to support, a proposal which would lead to minority government, a proposal which would be undemocratic and which might result in a policy being put into operation which had not the support of a majority of the people.</P>

      <P>The writer of that letter very kindly withdrew the letter and apologised.  That was the position.  In 1933 the Tánaiste condemned the system now proposed, and he was quite right.  As he said then, it could lead to minority government and he asked the Fianna Fáil Party at the Árd-Fheis and the people generally to retain P.R.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, if we are supposed to be unrepresentative, everyone in this House knows quite well that we have our title deeds from the people who sent us here; and the Government over there could be a good Government, as well as a strong Government, if they acted properly in the knowledge that they were sent here by a majority of the people.  Our system is a good system.  It is a democratic system and it is an Irish system.  It has worked in this country over the last 36 years.  The change now proposed is, as has been described, an invitation to the people to take a leap in the dark.  We do not believe the future of this country can be decided by any one individual.  We do not think it is right that, merely because the present Taoiseach had a bright idea in bed in the early hours of August last, this country's future should be jeopardised.  We have no doubt that in due course when, after proper examination here, this matter goes for decision to the people, the people will say, as they said in the past: &ldquo;No dictatorship in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of intervening in this debate but I happen to represent the area in which P.R. was first tried out and, reading some of the things which have been said, I felt compelled to put the facts on record. Speaking here on 26th November as reported at column 1009 of Volume 171 Deputy J.A. Costello, the Leader of the Opposition, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...for the first time in this country and the adjoining country of Great Britain elections were held in Sligo under the principles of P.R.  That was not done at the dictate of the British Parliament.  It was done at the request of the people of County Sligo because they found that the other system, the system that the <Col N="1974" /> Taoiseach wants to impose upon this country for parliamentary elections and to impose for all time, caused complete chaos in their local affairs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement is without foundation and, therefore, completely wrong.</P>
    <P>Up to 1919 Sligo Corporation under an old Charter dating back over 300 years could levy a rate only of 5/- or 6/- in the £.  They could do nothing to relieve local conditions.  I remember Sligo town at the time.  I canvassed the town in 1918.  The conditions under which the people lived were appalling. The houses were infested with vermin. Very often they had neither chimneys nor windows.  The streets were unsurfaced. There was no proper sanitary accommodation.  There was no water.  The people began to agitate for better amenities.  This agitation started around 1916 and 1917.  The only way in which the condition could be relieved was to enable the corporation to strike a higher rate.  The corporation asked for leave to strike a higher rate and, following on further agitation by the people and the corporation, a Bill was passed in the British Parliament giving the corporation the necessary power. A condition of the passing of that Bill was that P.R. would be accepted.  The corporation had to pay the costs of having that Bill passed and they amounted to the tidy sum of £986 17s. 7d.  That bill was paid by the Sligo Corporation.  That is the history of the introduction of P.R. in Sligo.</P>
    <P>Lloyd George thought Sligo an ideal spot for P.R.  As everybody knows, the population of Sligo holds a big percentage of Protestants.  They control practically all the business, the shipping, the milling and the hardware. Lloyd George believed that by getting P.R. accepted he would create a Protestant Party in Sligo town but, thanks be to God, he failed&mdash;and I am supported in that by Deputy Booth&mdash; and the Protestants in Sligo have to-day taken their place in the other Parties and they are honoured representatives in both the corporation and the county council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1975" /> The Bill was agreed by a meeting of Sligo Council on 13th February, 1918.  It was agreed to accept P.R. It was agreed that a charge would be levied on the local rates.  The Sligo Corporation Act, 1918, received the royal assent on 30th July, 1918, with the relevant provisions incorporated in it.  The first election of the borough council by P.R. was held on 15th January, 1919, and the first meeting of the new council, comprised of 24 members, was held on 23rd January, 1919.  Sligo town was the unit.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to say how many went forward for election on the first occasion, but on the second or third occasion 80 candidates went forward for 24 seats.  Most Deputies in this House have had experience of Seanad elections.  In the second last election they were confronted with a panel of something in the region of 100.  It is assumed that Deputies are competent to mark ballot papers.  We had those papers in our homes where we could study them.  In the case of the election in Sligo old people and people with bad sight were asked to take this paper with 80 names on it and to select from it the people they wished to represent them.  Not even the most educated could do justice to a ballot paper such as that.</P>

If he has not too much to do, I will ask him to find out in how many ways the ballot paper could be marked when there would be 80 candidates and when he has made that calculation, I will ask him to give Deputy Mulcahy a copy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>No one in the world. Under the straight vote system, where there will be one area, the chances are that there will not be 80 candidates. The point I want to make is that, under the P.R. system, with 80 candidates, or any such number, it is impossible to mark a ballot paper.  We will get away from that point, as Deputy Mulcahy does not like it.</P>
      <P>We remember when experts were sent across from a P.R. society that was formed in England.  We had lectures and classes to instruct us as to how to vote and as to how P.R. should be worked.  As a Deputy pointed out, the cranks became so enamoured of it that they could talk about nothing else and became so obsessed with it that they went around the country pointing out the benefits of P.R.  This system has continued from that day to this.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Lindsay took part in that or not.  I know that any man who spoke in opposition to those cranks was told that he was a fool, that he did not know what he was talking about.  That is the system that obtains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" /> I will give a few examples of what did happen under P.R. in Sligo.  In one area in Sligo, at county council elections, on three different occasions, a certain man headed the poll and on each of those occasions he did not get the seat.  The quota was between 700 and 800.  He got close on 700 first preference votes.  A man who got 200 first preference votes was elected.  If that is majority rule, I do not know what to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>We will still have it for local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait and see.  Not like that.  We know quite well what little care is given to what happens to third, fourth and fifth preference votes.  When a man who secures a number of first preference votes so near the quota is thrown out three times and a man who secured 200 first preference votes is elected on the tenth and eleventh count, it cannot be said that that is a good system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy give us the figures he is talking about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the figures.  I am not able to give the exact figures. As I have said, the quota was between 700 and 800.  This man on three occasions got close on 700 and a man who got 200, in another end of the area, got the seat.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Lindsay will probably remember that in the general election before the last general election an Independent beat a Fine Gael candidate for the last seat, although the Fine Gael candidate had 2,000 more first preference votes.  It goes on the pure chance of the count. I know that because I have watched the working of P.R.</P>

      <P>On the occasion that I am referring to, the Independent beat the other man by five votes.  At the last general election, the very same thing happened.  There were two Fine Gael men running for the last seat and the man who was beaten had almost 1,000 first preference votes.  The man with the smaller number won because, on the chances of the play, he got more transferred votes.  That is P.R. No man need tell me that it is not pure chance.  You could put the names into a hat and you would get as much fair play.</P>
      <P>I have studied P.R. long enough in Sligo.  One thing on which I agree with Deputy Dillon is that it is a complete fraud and a cod.  He was the first man who had the guts to stand up to those fellows and tell them the truth.</P>

      <P>The only argument I heard in this debate that is worth answering is that there was no demand for a change.  I have been engaged in every election since 1918.  I have been engaged in by-elections all over Ireland.  At every election I worked at, either bringing voters to the poll or showing them how to vote, I heard from people: &ldquo;When will you change this rotten system and let us vote so that we will know how we are voting and whom we are voting for?&rdquo; We <Col N="1979" /> are told here that there is no demand for the proposed change in the system. There is a demand.  The people have asked for it time and again since the system was established.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish twitted us on our loyalty and suggested that the Fianna Fáil back benchers are too loyal to take part in this debate, that they did not believe in this change but were too loyal to talk about it.  It was the first time that I ever knew loyalty was a crime.  A Fianna Fáil back bencher does not want to repeat the same thing, like a parrot, over and over again. The leaders have put the case for them and they are quite satisfied.  But we are loyal and we are proud of that loyalty. We are loyal to our leaders, loyal to our comrades and loyal to the people who sent us here.  Further, we are loyal to those who will come after us and it is because of that loyalty that we are not afraid to take a chance, knowing that we will leave them something that will give them security.</P>

      <P>The issue on this Bill is very simple.  What all the talk is about, I do not know.  The issue before the House is whether the people are entitled to be allowed to decide the question or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing new <Col N="1980" /> about it.  The question is: are the people to get a chance of deciding something that is important for the life of this country?  Anyone who votes against the Bill is denying the people that chance and that right, no matter how he may try to disguise it.  The people who are opposing this Bill are afraid of the people and have always been afraid of the people.  We are not afraid of the people.  Therefore, we are voting for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>In opposing this Bill, I want to refute the statement made from the Government Benches that we are denying the right of the people to decide this issue.  What we do suggest is that there are more important issues to be considered at the present time.  I have stated outside and will state here that this is a smokescreen to cover up the failure to fulfil all the promises Fianna Fáil made during the last election.  They wished to suggest that we are opposing in some way the rights of the people.</P>
      <P>In my 36 years here, goodness knows I have always asserted the rights of the people.  We have had lectures from Deputy Booth and others on the position in other countries.  Deputy Booth emphasised the case of France because of the publicity there is about that country and he compared what happened in France with what could happen here.  He omitted to tell the House that France did not have P.R. since 1946 and therefore if French parliamentary institutions have failed &mdash;according to Deputy Booth&mdash;that failure cannot be attributed to P.R.</P>
      <P>The Deputy then supported the Mother of Parliaments and the system associated with it although there are only two other nations that have nontransferable voting.  But because it was England it was all right for Deputy Booth.  The Government's propaganda efforts on this issue will operate so that some of the Fianna Fáil Party will go down to the West and the Midlands and say: &ldquo;Ah, this is a British institution. Britain and Lloyd George forced P.R. upon this country.&rdquo; Deputy Booth will go out with his Party and will say that we want to have elections on a system similar to that which exists in the Mother of Parliaments in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1981" /> Deputy Booth had a horror of Coalitions but his own Government, that is the British Government, has such admiration for them that it has congratulated Australia because Australia has got a Coalition Government. Deputy Booth did not mention that. He objects to Coalition Governments because we brought in and passed the External Relations Act and I am very proud and glad to say that Act was passed.</P>

But after stating that he would support this Bill, Deputy Booth went on to speak in a way that indicated, unconsciously, that he was supporting the amendments to this motion. Although he was supporting the Government proposal to abolish P.R. <Col N="1982" /> he said he expected he would be one of the first casualties.  That is the whole case against P.R.  Here is Deputy Booth with a powerful political machine, a wealthy organisation with Party funds, and if he says he has such doubts about his chance of being elected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>In Volume 171, No. 8, column 1235.  Not alone Deputy Booth but Deputy S. Flanagan also indicated that although he was voting for this Bill, probably many Deputies including himself would not come back again.  What chance has an Independent when a member of Fianna Fáil, with its powerful political machine, feels that he may not get back?  Does that not show that the whole thing is a smokescreen and that it is not being done at all unanimously by the Party, no matter what they say now?  It is introduced to try to cover up the mistakes and the failures of the Party up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Loughman implied that we needed no Opposition, no other Parties; that in Fianna Fáil they had the Popular Front including trade unions, farmers and industrialists, even men who had a hatred of the name of trade unions and, that being the case, with a Popular Front there was no need for the Labour Party or any other Party in the House.  I am sure the farmers will not agree with the Fianna Fáil members who are farmers and who voted with the Government in refusing to give the wheat levy back to the farmers.  I wonder will Fianna Fáil Deputies who are members of trade unions obey the instructions of the congresses not to vote for this Bill?  I can remember the time when some people voted against increases for the old age pensioners and voted for the Standstill Order on wages. Even if we have in that Popular Front <Col N="1983" /> trade unionists, farmers and industrialists we also have, even in the Government Benches, among the Ministers, anti-trade unionists and anti-Labour men&mdash;that is, according to their speeches.</P>
    <P>That being so, I am opposing this proposal.  I have long service in this House and it is not the first time an attempt was made to change my constituency. The first time I was elected, I think, in 1922, our constituency was Wicklow and Kildare.  After some years one portion of that was transferred to Carlow and another portion to Kilkenny.  In a further revision we were given back our own constituency but I do not know what portion of the constituency we shall now have.  I feel, however, that after 36 years, please God, we shall still be there to make another fight to show up the inconsistency of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan said we opposed every Bill introduced by the Government that was of great benefit to the people.  I do not know of any Bill of that type which we have opposed.  We criticised the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he brought in the Transport Bill, when he abolished the Dublin trams and when he was planning to remove all the hire lorries from the country and when he was held up as the rail man, the saviour of the railways&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not aware of opposing any measures, as Deputy Brennan alleged, except those to which I referred.  I referred to the legislation by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. We opposed that and we opposed a Bill he brought in restricting certain rights.  We opposed a Standstill Order designed to keep wages down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>These are all matters which were referred to by other Deputies.  We are justified in opposing this Bill because, no matter what Deputy Booth may say, it will interfere with the rights of a certain minority.  I am living in a constituency where there are more than 4,000 people of the Protestant faith. The best and the most important businessman in my town is a man who differs in religion from the majority of the people, the chairman of our council.  We work together and co-operate without any difficulty in County Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Booth, I know, will try to get out of some of the statements he made and I am certain he will, on reflection, be sorry that he made some of these statements.  We have been here for 35 or 36 years, and, while we may have had differences of opinion on both sides of the House, there was never any contention of a religious nature before, and I regret that it should be brought in now.  I do not want this Parliament to be <Col N="1985" /> like the Parliament in Northern Ireland. What they argue up there is &ldquo;a Protestant Parliament for a Protestant people.&rdquo;  By abolishing P.R. you will be supporting the Northern Ireland attitude and depriving the Nationalists and Catholics in the North of any representation.  I believe the Government in advocating this measure are wrong.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt what the decision on the referendum will be, no matter what the Minister for External Affairs may say in the West and South of Ireland, that this is a Lloyd George stunt; no matter what Deputy Booth and others will say in Southern Ireland to the effect that we want to copy the British Parliament.  If we deny people the right to be elected to this Parliament, they may adopt other means of having their voice heard and they may get sympathy from unthinking people.  The younger men, who have no votes at the present time but who will have in a few years' time, will be brought into the net, perhaps with dire consequences.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government to consider these matters before putting the people to the expense of a referendum. Furthermore, if we are to have a referendum, why not have it on the same day as the Presidential election? This would be better than spending £80,000 or £90,000 for this referendum and then having to spend a further sum of this magnitude for the Presidential election.  Alternatively would it not be feasible when holding the referendum on P.R. to find out whether the people want a President or not?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been so many speakers on this question that it is very difficult to approach it from a <Col N="1986" /> fresh or original angle.  However, I wish to put forward my reasons for opposing this measure.  The first inkling we got of the Taoiseach's decision to remove P.R. was at a Press conference some two or three months ago.  A short time after that we had a Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis in the Mansion House.  That was a gathering of political supporters of Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach saw fit to declare there his intention of removing the present system of election and of substituting for it the direct voting system.  He has now gone a step further and announced his intentions to this House, which Assembly, in my opinion, should have been the first body to hear of his intention to abolish P.R.</P>
      <P>Since that statement was made there has been much speculation throughout the country as to whether P.R. should go; we read in the papers every day where there have been discussions by local authorities.  These authorities have gone so far as to pass resolutions condemning the Taoiseach's action. Again, we read letters in the Press every day criticising this measure.  All this talk and all these letters about this action on the part of the Taoiseach points to a spirit of unrest in the minds of the people.</P>
      <P>We have heard in this House, in support of the Government's contention that P.R. should go, certain reasons given as to way this Bill was introduced.  One of the reasons was that the P.R. system of election tended to create a multiplicity of Parties and tended to set up warring groups.  It was also suggested that it rendered responsible government impossible. Another reason given was that it was imposed on this country by the British. It was said that direct voting provides government by the majority of the people.  I am not impressed by these reasons.  I am convinced that there is a feeling in the minds of the vast majority of the people that this Bill is a ruse by the Taoiseach to ensure the return of the Fianna Fáil Party for the future.  I may be wrong in that belief but it has been expressed to me on more than one occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people think that the Taoiseach <Col N="1987" /> has an ulterior motive in introducing this Bill.  In support of that it has been stated that no attempt was made to abolish the P.R. system during the 16 years Fianna Fáil were in power, from 1932 to 1948.  No expression of opinion was then given that that system of election was unsatisfactory and that it should be replaced by the direct vote.</P>
    <P>For those 16 years that Fianna Fáil were in power they suffered no defeat until 1948.  During those 16 years we had many general elections and Fianna Fáil were returned every time.  I could not say how many general elections there were but there were at least ten, and Fianna Fáil were returned every time under the present system which they now condemn.  It is very significant that the Taoiseach thought of bringing in this proposal only after he received two defeats, one in 1948 and the other in 1954.</P>
    <P>As I have already said one of the reasons given for the introduction of the present measure was that it was introduced into this country, and more or less imposed on the country, by the British Government in 1919.  I am satisfied that previous speakers have conclusively shown that the adoption of the present system of P.R. was an act of the Irish people in 1922.  A Constitution was drawn up in that year; it was endorsed by this Parliament and subsequently endorsed again by the people.</P>
    <P>In 1937 the present Taoiseach drew up the Constitution and retained the present method of election in that Constitution.  I fail to see why a thing should be condemned because it was introduced by the British Government to this country.  That may not necessarily mean that such a thing is bad or injurious to this country and I think we could take many a leaf out of the British book without damage to ourselves. I always thought that P.R. was an act of the Irish people and we are told that it was supported and endorsed by no less a person than Arthur Griffith.  I cannot reconcile the Taoiseach's statement that P.R. should go because it was imposed on us by the British with his action in retaining <Col N="1988" /> it in the Constitution in 1937.  That does not make sense to me.  I am satisfied, regardless of Government speeches on the matter, that the present method was introduced because it represented the express wish of the Irish people at that time.</P>
    <P>It is contended by the Taoiseach and his colleagues that the direct voting system tends to elect a Government which will represent the majority of the people.  When one examines the position in Britain in relation to the last ten general elections, one finds that in only two of these general elections did the elected Government represent the majority of the people.  In eight out of those ten elections a minority Government was returned in Britain. The same can be said of the operation of the system in Canada.</P>
    <P>We in this country have had no experience to go by with regard to Governments elected under the direct voting system and we are stepping into the unknown when we attempt to change the present method.  If the single vote system operated in this country at the present time we could have, as a result of a general election, the Fianna Fáil Party receiving 35 per cent. of the total votes, the Fine Gael Party receiving 34 per cent. and the Labour Party 31 per cent.  I have left out individuals and others Parties and am just taking the three largest Parties for convenience sake.</P>
    <P>If those figures obtain at a general election, under the direct voting system it would mean that Fianna Fáil would be elected though they would not have a majority vote.  They could not claim that they represented the vast majority of the people because, in that particular instance, 65 per cent. of the people would have voted against them and only 35 per cent. for them.  Therefore, I fail to see how a change to the direct voting system will attain, as the Government contend it will, a Government that will represent the vast majority of the people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach claims that the present system leads to multiplicity of Parties.  My comment on that, as already expressed by other speakers, <Col N="1989" /> is that a man should have the right to stand for any Party because, when we consider the matter properly, it is the individual, the individual candidate, who counts and not so much the individual Party.  I contend that if good men are nominated to stand on behalf of a small Party, even an insignificant Party, they should at least have a reasonable chance of election.  I am afraid, however, that if the present system is abolished such men will not have as good a chance of being elected to Dáil Éireann and, indeed, the Dáil could be the poorer as a result.</P>
    <P>Small Parties will be considerably handicapped if we change to a direct system of election, because in single member constituencies you will obviously have the big Parties nominating their respective candidates and, whilst at the present time we have representatives of small Parties in this House, if P.R. goes they will not have a chance of even being nominated.  They may have a chance of being nominated but that will not be of any use to them because, obviously, the members of the two large Parties will defeat them overwhelmingly.  Further, such men will have no chance of being nominated by either of the two big Parties, should they merge with them, because already the two Parties have their own sitting Deputies, and I am sure these Deputies will be very loath to stand down.</P>
    <P>It was also claimed by the Taoiseach that the present system makes for irresponsible government.  If we follow that statement to its logical conclusion Fianna Fáil, I think, must admit that is a reflection on their previous terms of office, and also on their present term.  They have been in power from 1932 to 1948, for 16 years; they are back in power once more and, in the light of the statement that the present system of election makes for irresponsibility in government, in my opinion they stand self-condemned. We have often heard Fianna Fáil claim that they represented the majority view of the people but it now seems that they are not a responsible Government and that the people have been fooled all down the years because the Taoiseach has said that the present <Col N="1990" /> system leads to irresponsibility in government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not say that between 1932 and 1948.  He did, however, claim that Fianna Fáil was a responsible Government, but it now appears from his speech, and from the speeches of those who support this measure, that they are condemning themselves.  Fianna Fáil are a Government elected under P.R. and thus are an irresponsible Government.  In spite of common knowledge to the contrary, a knowledge which I believe is fully shared by the Taoiseach himself, we are asked to believe that countries like Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium, Norway and Western Germany are not progressive because they use the P.R. method of election.  That is a rather ridiculous claim on the part of those who support this Bill.</P>
    <P>We are also told that the present system of election leads to instability in government but I fail to see how that can be.  Again, Fianna Fáil stand condemned because they were elected under P.R. and they have a majority of approximately 17 members at the present time.  Surely a Government which has a majority of 17 over all Parties cannot be termed unstable? To say that the present Government is unstable at least appears to be contrary to the facts since they have that majority of 17.  When the results of the last general election made it known that Fianna Fáil had been returned to power with a majority of 17, the Government then declared to all and sundry that they were a stable Government, and they were going to do this and that to solve the problems of unemployment and emigration. They said that they represented the vast majority of the people, and that they could go forward in confidence to solve all the problems which they might meet during their tenure of office, but now they say they are unstable because they have been elected under the P.R. system.</P>
    <P>It has been said throughout the country, and by many people in my own constituency of Louth, that this measure has been introduced to provide for the rainy day when the Taoiseach retires, a day which probably will not be too long delayed. <Col N="1991" /> I am not suggesting that he should retire.  I am not suggesting that he has lost any of his efficiency, but I am saying that it has been put forward that this measure has been introduced to provide for the rainy day when he will no longer be present to lead his Party or his Government.  He says that P.R. is no good because it leads to instability but, at the same time, he forgets that at present he holds the position of Premier in this country, the position of Taoiseach, as a result of an election held under the P.R. system.</P>
    <P>With regard to this point of stability, we have heard many speeches during the past year or so by a number of Ministers, and in particular by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on the subject of attracting foreign industries and foreign capital in order to solve our unemployment problem.  In those speeches the one point most emphasised was, of course, the fact that we had stable government here in the Twenty-Six Counties.  It now appears that those speeches were not correct, that we have an unstable Government because it has been elected under the P.R. system, and that system must now go because it leads to instability in government.  It is all very confusing. We have only to refer to those other countries which I have enumerated to realise how baseless is the Taoiseach's argument on that point.  I do not think Fianna Fáil would admit they are an unstable Government.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Government imagine that all our economic ills and troubles will be cured, if we revert to a direct method of election in the future.  It must be admitted that there is no automatic panacea for our economic problems.  There is no system of election which will automatically ensure the proper solution of those problems.  It is not so much the system of election which should worry us as the type of Government which is elected.  If we change to a direct method of election, I fail to see how the Government will be in a more secure position to implement the £100,000,000 plan which was recently referred to by the Government.  Are <Col N="1992" /> they not strong enough now to carry out all their promises as they said they would?  They have a strong majority and reverting to a different method of election will not improve the position, so far as our economy is concerned.</P>
    <P>No system of election can solve our problems; no particular system can ensure the election of a Government that will do so.  It is not so much that a different system of election is needed as brains and efficiency.  I contend that these attributes can be found equally in small Parties as in large Parties.</P>
    <P>It appears, too, that history is about to repeat itself when we consider the 32 Counties as a whole.  When the North of Ireland was gerrymandered many years ago to the detriment of the Nationalist minority Fianna Fáil were loud in their condemnation of that action, and rightly so, but how now can we view with patience and indifference a contemplated action of the Taoiseach which may very well result in depriving minorities of the same right of election under a new system as they have under the P.R. system?</P>
    <P>I fear we are going to walk hand in hand with the Six Counties in this regard. We recall on an occasion like this the many statements made by the Taoiseach when he reiterated his oft-expressed opinion that Partition was one of our outstanding problems.  It appears that he is not so convinced now because if a direct voting system is the future method of electing Governments in this part of the country, there will be little attraction held out to our friends over the Border to unite with us as one nation.  In reply to that argument, the Taoiseach contends that minorities could get representation by merging with the majority.  We have only to refer to the set-up in the North of Ireland to realise how ineffective that statement is because we know for certain that the minority in the North of Ireland are not satisfied. Is it now contended that the Nationalist minority should merge with the Unionists so as to have proper representation in the Six Counties?</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are opposed to this Bill because it represents a threat to small Parties.  In the amendment put to the <Col N="1993" /> House by the Leader of the Opposition, it is suggested that a commission of experts should be set up to examine the ineffectiveness of the present system.  I do not claim that the present system is an infallible one and that it is the absolutely correct one; neither do I agree that the one being put forward as an alternative is the proper one to have.  I object especially to this Bill because there has been no real demand for it from the people.</P>
    <P>There was a general election last year and on no occasion was this possibility referred to.  It was never said by Fianna Fáil that they were seeking support for the next five years and that if they got in, they would promise to do away with the present system of election and revert to the direct method.  That was never said and I fail to see how the Taoiseach can justify his contention at column 996, Volume 171, No. 8 of the Official Report of 26th November, 1958, when, referring seemingly to the demand for this measure which was evident to him at least, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been suggested that there has been no public opinion, no voice asking for this.  All I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is that, if he thinks that, he must have had cotton wool in his ears from 1948 to 1951 and 1954 to 1957, because everywhere I went through the country, everyone I met wanted to know when were we going to get rid of that system which was going to ruin the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was stated by the Taoiseach on the Second Stage.  Of course, the Taoiseach refers to the period from 1948 to 1951 and the years from 1954 to 1957&mdash;very significant years because during those years Fianna Fáil were not in power.  I wonder was there any demand between 1932 and 1948, while the Taoiseach was going through the country, for the abolition of this system?  It was not ruining the country, it seems, during those years. It was ruining the country only while Fianna Fáil were out of office.</P>
    <P>I heard speeches in the Dáil many times since I came into the House in <Col N="1994" /> 1954 and on no occasion have I heard it suggested up to the present time that P.R. should go and that it was not a satisfactory method of election.  I may be wrong in that, but at least I have not heard those speeches or read about them.  I am afraid that the Taoiseach's experience of a demand for the removal of this system is shared by very few.</P>
    <P>Reactions have been felt throughout the Twenty-Six Counties as a result of this Bill.  In my own constituency, the people believe that there is an ulterior motive lurking somewhere behind the whole set-up.  The reasons given so far are not accepted by many people; they are not accepted by me.  I am at least a little bit suspicious.  Fine Gael and the other small Parties are united in their opposition to the measure and they are confident that the people will reject it as being worthless and unworkable.</P>
    <P>In passing, I should like to say that it will not only be the Fine Gael supporters, or the Opposition supporters in general, who will vote against this measure.  I am convinced that many Fianna Fáil supporters will say no to the referendum because they realise that it is a bad measure and that it may possibly be the means of removing their favourites from office.  It may be, as Deputy Booth said, that many Fianna Fáil faces will not be seen in the House, if this measure goes through.</P>
    <P>P.R. has been with us for the past 38 years.  That is an important factor when it comes to assessing the merits and demerits of the system.  It is the system we know and, as Deputy J.A. Costello said, we are approaching the end of an era in political life and no one knows what undercurrents and repercussions there might be when the Taoiseach retires.  I suggest it would be safer and wiser to leave things as they are&mdash;at least for the present. I am satisfied that the present system prevents landslides of a reactionary nature.  As I say, it is the traditional system of election, and, as the Taoiseach himself said, it is the system we know.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence referred to the system's complexities and said it was rather cumbersome and that <Col N="1995" /> people did not understand it.  I agree that people do not understand the theoretical working of it, but they know it gives everybody a proportionately equal chance and they are used to it.  They know what the Nos. 1, 2 and 3 mean and they know that &ldquo;No. 3&rdquo; may have a voice in electing a candidate and that &ldquo;Nos. 5 and 6&rdquo; may equally play their part, even though they may not be too well versed in the theoretical and mathematical aspects of it.</P>
    <P>I do not say that there are no defects in the present system because under the P.R. system a candidate could head the poll and yet be defeated eventually.  He could fail eventually to be elected and that actually did happen in the last election in the West of Ireland, where a man headed the poll on the first count and subsequently was eliminated.  Equally, a candidate right at the bottom of the poll on the first count could be elected, if his colleague in the same Party headed the poll with a very substantial surplus on the first count.  There is a seeming paradox there.  The person who is first on the first count may be eliminated while the person who is last may be eventually successful and be elected.</P>
    <P>There are these seeming paradoxes under the present system and again I refer to the amendment which suggests that a commission of experts should go into the whole matter rationally and objectively, and thrash out the matter in an effort to solve these little idiosyncrasies in the present method.  Equally, if we change to the direct method, we have anomalies because a candidate could be elected, even though he represented only a minority of the people. For example, if there were three candidates contesting one seat in a constituency in which the total poll was 20,000, Fianna Fáil could get 8,000, Fine Gael 7,000 and Labour 5,000 votes.  That would mean that under the direct vote system the Fianna Fáil candidate would be elected because Fianna Fáil got the greatest number of votes.  Yet they have 4,000 votes less than the overall total of 12,000 who voted against them.  It is with the <Col N="1996" /> object of reconciling these anomalies and defects in both systems that we suggest a commission of experts should be set up to examine the position.</P>
    <P>I should like to inquire what would be the position regarding the Presidential election and local authority elections.  If we are to have different systems for the various elections&mdash;for local authorities, for Dáil Éireann and for the Presidency&mdash;it will be very confusing for the people.  Again, we must consider the future Seanad elections. No reference, as far as I can recall, has been made to what method will apply in future to the election of Senators.</P>
    <P>It is claimed by Fianna Fáil that they represent a cross-section of the people.  That may be so.  I suppose every Party contend that they represent every section, that they do their best agriculturally, industrially and every other way, for all sections of the people.  Fianna Fáil claim that they represent labour, the trade unions, agriculture, industry, commerce and business and every other aspect of the community, but it is very significant that the Seanad, as has always been said, is composed of vocational groups.  The statement made by Fianna Fáil that they were the Party representing all sections of the people and, therefore, should be the only Party that should govern the people, is a false claim.  When the Taoiseach is replying, I hope he will refer to what system will be used for Seanad elections, for the Presidential election and for the local authority elections.</P>
    <P>With regard to the commission for the revision of constituencies, I notice that provision is made for the appointment of seven members to act on this commission.  I do not see any provision for the filling of vacancies. If a member of this commission resigns for any reason, or is removed, there is no mention at all in the Bill of that vacancy being filled and no mention of any method for filling a vacancy.  That is a very grave omission because if seven members&mdash; naturally it must be an odd number for the commission to come to some kind of a decision&mdash;are considered to <Col N="1997" /> be the proper number, surely the number must always be seven?  If there are seven at the start, there should always be seven sitting on the commission in order that the commission may arrive at a proper decision. I presume that that omission will be rectified.  I hope it will be rectified because I think it is wrong that these vacancies should not be filled, if they occur.</P>
    <P>As regards a decision on the eventual boundary line for the constituencies, I fail to see how there can be a stalemate, if there is an odd number examining the question.  How could there be equal numbers voting for and equal numbers voting against, if there are seven?  I am mentioning that because it is said that the chairman will submit his report and it will be conclusive and final and will be acceptable to the President.  If the other six members of the commission fail to agree amongst themselves as to revision of the constituencies, it will be left to one man to draw up a scheme of new constituencies.  That will be a thankless job for one man, no matter who he is.  He will be criticised by both Parties.  I think the work should develop on the commission as a whole and that it should not be left to one individual, to the chairman of the commission.  Of course, it is to be noted that the Government are open to suggestions on this matter, and I hope they will reconsider the position in that respect and amend it accordingly.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the cost of this referendum.  A figure has been given of £80,000 and I assume that that is the cost only of the Government expenditure which will be incurred.  I wonder is it the total cost?  Does it include the cost to the local authorities who obviously will have to go to a lot of expense in arrangements for booths and paying fees to polling clerks, presiding officers and so forth?  Again, would it not be better to hold the Presidential election and the referendum on the same day, in order to eliminate expense and duplication, not only of expense but of trouble and inconvenience generally?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that it would suit the Government and <Col N="1998" /> the Dáil better if more important matters than this issue of the referendum were tackled first.  What the people want is not so much a different system of election as more secure employment and an improved standard of living.  That is all they want&mdash;issues relating to bread and butter.  That is what they are most interested in.  They are not interested, to my mind, in the method of election, but they are interested in a Government elected democratically by the people which does its best to implement the promises it makes during an election compaign.</P>
    <P>We have at present 65,000 unemployed and we were told 60,000 emigrated in the past year.  I cannot see how a different method of electing a Government will reduce the number of unemployed or stem the tide of emigration.  I am satisfied that the Government have a strong enough majority at present, and are stable enough to attempt to solve these problems. I do not say they can solve them.  No Government can solve all the problems with which it is often faced, but the fact that this Government have been elected under the present system of election, the P.R. system, which is now condemned by the Government elected under that system, is the greatest argument against the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped, optimistically maybe, that this important measure would have been debated in a somewhat different manner from that in which it has been debated in the past few weeks.  I had hoped it would be debated in a non-Party and constructive fashion, as I have pleasure in saying Deputy Coburn has debated it.  Unfortunately many things have been said here in the course of the debate which, to my mind, only tend to cloud the issue before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard allegations of presumption, arrogance and dictatorship levelled against the Fianna Fáil Party, because they have brought this measure before the House.  It is hard to understand on what grounds these allegations are made.  Presumption and arrogance are alleged because the people are asked to give a decision on a matter of national importance or <Col N="1999" /> on something which the Government consider is of national importance.  It is not as if this House were trying to bring in and pass a law which would deprive the people of rights or privileges.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coburn said that Fianna Fáil did not go before the electorate in 1957 and tell them they intended to abolish P.R. Fianna Fáil did not have the power to abolish P.R.  It is the people who make the decision and Fianna Fáil are going to the people and asking them for their decision on the matter, at a time when they think it is opportune to do so.  It is the duty of the Government to take such a course, in a matter of such importance, a matter that will influence the future of this country.  It has been inferred that we should not mould the future of the country, but surely any reasonable person will not suggest that we must not take precautions to see that whatever pitfalls are before us are removed, in our time, from the future, if at all possible.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, we have the allegation that Fianna Fáil are trying to set up a dictatorship.  I believe any intelligent man who makes a remark like that is talking with his tongue in his cheek.  Our Constitution lays down, that after a certain number of years, the Government must go before the people for a decision as to whether they have done their job well or have carried out the tasks entrusted to them as they should.</P>
    <P>In this case Fianna Fáil are asking the people for a decision and an honest decision.  It has not been a characteristic of dictatorships, to my mind, to consult the people at all.  I cannot for the life of me understand how a charge like that could be made by people who have a responsibility, at least to those who elected them.</P>
    <P>I much prefer to deal with the future than the past but it seems to me, if I have to refer to the past, that if we go back to 1948 we find that Fianna Fáil had been about 16 years in office and the people were seemingly willing and may be anxious for a change.  But where had they to turn?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2000" /> I submit if they had confidence in the Fine Gael Party, which I take it was the principal Opposition Party, they would have given a mandate to Fine Gael to form a Government.  It has been said, and maybe with some truth, that they did not give a mandate to Fianna Fáil, but surely they did not give a mandate to any other Party at that time.</P>
    <P>I feel that if the abolition of P.R. were carried out, it would mean the growth of a strong Opposition Party who could put their policy before the people and the people would have an alternative at election time.  It is in the nature of democracies that they do not leave any one Party in office all the time; if they can find a better Party, they are willing to change after a number of years.</P>
    <P>I feel also that if P.R. is retained, it will lead to a multiplicity of Parties. That is my view, and I think a multiplicity of Parties leads very often at least to a dangerous situation.  We all realise, or should realise, the frailty of human nature and if small Parties can form a Government, there is bound to be jockeying for position and bargaining for power.  I suggest that without charging anybody with any ulterior motive.  That position does not lead to stability.  A senior member of the Opposition Party spoke here about their own experience when they were an inter-Party Government and said they had twice to go before the people because of circumstances outside their control, because a small section deserted them or betrayed them, or changed their allegiance, and for no other reason whatever.  At any rate, whatever emerged, the inter-Party Government vanished and they had to go before the people again.  I suggest that does not give stability.  I realise, of course, that no system is perfect. There are two sides to every story and a case may be made in theory at least for the P.R. system.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that however desirable it may be to have all shades of opinion represented in Parliament, it is far less important than having a Party in power that can govern.  It may be necessary or desirable to have several <Col N="2001" /> interests represented, but it is more desirable still, and essential for the country, to have a Government which can govern and which can put an employment policy before the people.</P>
    <P>As I say, the question the people are to be asked to decide is a simple one: are they in favour of single-Party Government or inter-Party Government? Recently, within the past 20 years, they have had experience of both and they should be able to make a wise decision.  I have more confidence in them than a great many Deputies.  I believe they will make a wise decision and I shall be content to abide by any decision they make.  It should not be in any way denied that it is the people who will make the decision.</P>
    <P>I have been listening here, I am sorry to say, since I came into the House, to speeches by various members on the other side about Fianna Fáil having earned the wrath of the electorate for all the sins of omission and commission they have committed during, and since, the last election&mdash; they deceived the people about the food subsidies, broken promises, emigration, unemployment and all the rest.  We have heard all that time out of number.  To my mind, our time has been wasted in this House.  Why should there be any anxiety now to keep this from the people?  You cannot have it both ways.  If we are in so much disgrace and if there is so much resentment against us, then the obvious thing is to let the people decide now and they will take a decision in favour of those who spoke so honestly and so vehemently of their own opinions.</P>
    <P>Somebody has mentioned the cost of the referendum.  The cost, and I do not mind what it is, is small compared with the cost to future generations of being unable to elect a Government that can give them stable government. Nobody can count or estimate the cost of instability of government in a country or what it will lead to eventually.</P>
    <P>I admit and state that I got my seat in this House through the system of P.R.  I would not have got in otherwise. <Col N="2002" /> Nevertheless, I am sincerely and honestly convinced that it is a bad system.  I have been convinced of that for many years.  I have been convinced that it is not as good a system as the direct method of election. I also feel that it is the most important question to be put to the people since the Constitution was put before them in 1937.  Certainly, I am not in the slightest bit worried as to whether or not my face appears here in the future.  If it does not, I have no doubt but that there will be a better representative.  I am sure that the last thought of any honest representative would be the safety of his seat as against the common good.  I hope that the last thought of any Deputy will be his own interests at the expense of the people being deprived of the opportunity of adopting a system of election that will give them an honest Government.  Bear in mind that that Government would put their policy before the people and would come back again in five years' time to accept the verdict of the people. Then, if they had not done well, they would have to make way for another Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>My opposition to the Government's proposals is based on a belief that they are likely to lead to conditions in this country comparable with conditions in countries which have a one-Party Fascist State. They are likely to lead to a decline in parliamentary government in this country and to dictatorial and unrestrained government.</P>
      <P>The risks involved in the proposals which the Government are sponsoring are great.  The reasons these risks are being run are inadequate.  Over the past few weeks, various reasons have been put forward by Government spokesmen as to the desirability of introducing a change in our electoral system.  Any analysis of what has occurred in this House clearly demonstates that the one reason the Government have brought forward these proposals is because, on two occasions within recent years, the present system of election caused them to suffer electoral defeats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to my mind manifest that the <Col N="2003" /> dislike of the inter-Party Governments has so warped and clouded the mind of the Taoiseach that he is incapable of forming a rational judgment on the system of election which made possible the formation of the inter-Party Governments.  I have said advisedly &ldquo;the mind of the Taoiseach&rdquo; because it is of some consequence in discussing this matter to recall that not one of the people who have spoken in this debate, with the exception of the Taoiseach, has ever spoken before in public condemning the system of P.R.</P>
    <P>At not one Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis, except this year, have resolutions been passed against the system of P.R.  At no general election was it made an issue.  In the 1954 General Election the <i>Irish Times</i>, by a questionnaire, asked the present Taoiseach, the then Leader of the Opposition, whether, if returned to power, he would abolish P.R.  His answer was: &ldquo;P.R. is not an issue in this election&rdquo; and he added that his views on the subjects were well known.</P>
    <P>P.R. was not an issue in the 1954 election.  It was not an issue in the 1957 election.  Not one of the Deputies who have come into the House and spoken against P.R. ever, to my knowledge&mdash;and I challenge them to prove it&mdash;made a speech against the system of P.R.  That is why I said that this proposal emanates from a decision arrived at personally by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Within the past two months, for the first time since the Government was formed last year, the Taoiseach said that P.R. should be abolished and that he would discuss the matter with his colleagues.  Other reasons have been put forward in the course of this debate against the present system of P.R.&mdash;reasons which, to my mind, are fatuous, irresponsible and fundamentally dishonest.  The Minister for External Affairs, like a backward schoolboy who has learned the wrong lesson, keeps repeating that P.R. was imposed upon us by the British.  P.R. was accepted by the Irish people in the Constitution of 1922.  It was inserted in the draft Constitution by the present Government in 1937 and accepted by <Col N="2004" /> the people when they passed the Contitution of 1937.</P>
    <P>Equally fatuous, to my mind, is the argument, again propounded by the Minister for External Affairs and taken up by some of the back benchers of his Party, that P.R. is likely to lead to dictatorship in this country.  He points to this danger by reference to conditions in Italy in 1922 and conditions in Germany when the Nazis came into power.  The answer to that argument is twofold.  In the first place, the Fascists got into power in 1922 in Italy and in 1931 in Germany. Notwithstanding this, the present Government inserted and copper-fastened P.R. into our Constitution in 1937.  In the second place, I think the Italian and German people are the best judges themselves of what occurred in their own country.  I think the German people would be wise enough to know it P.R. made possible the emergence of Nazism in Germany and would not have written it into the Constitution adopted in that country after the war. I think the Italian people, with their violent anti-Fascist feelings after the war, would not have written P.R. into their Constitution if P.R. were responsible for bringing Fascism into Italy.</P>
    <P>There are theoretical arguments for and against every electoral system. One of the theoretical arguments that can be put forward against P.R. is that it leads to instability in government. The Taoiseach never mentioned that argument when moving the Second Reading of this Bill.  It has been an argument very little used here for very good reason.  We have had no more general elections in this country since 1922 than were held in Great Britain under the single member constituency system.  Under P.R. our Governments have been just as stable over the period of the last 36 years as Governments in Great Britain were under the single member constituency system.  The real reason&mdash; indeed the reason which is not hidden by the members of the Government and their supporters, the reason paraded here by them&mdash;is their dislike of Coalition Governments.</P>
    <P>Some of the spokesmen here on behalf of Fianna Fáil asked us to believe <Col N="2005" /> that they are sincere in their opposition to the P.R. system of election to the Dáil.  I am perfectly prepared to accept there are some members of the Fianna Fáil Party and of the Government who have now been persuaded by the Taoiseach that the P.R. system is not a good one.  But if they are sincere, I want them to examine one aspect by which they have arrived at their judgment.  The opinion of the Government and its supporters on the system of P.R. is based on their political judgments of the work of the two inter-Party Governments.  Because they believe those Governments were failures, they believe that the system of government which elected them is a bad one.  Let me repeat: these are political judgments, forged in the heat of Party battle, and if that is the basis on which a judgment is based, I submit it is very difficult to see how that judgment is an unbiased and unprejudiced one.</P>
    <P>Sincerity is not enough.  I am sure the Pharisees were sincere men; you must also be right.  On a subject of such vital importance as this, on proposals which are likely to have very serious consequences, it is not sufficient to say you are sincere in believing that the present system is wrong.  It is necessary to examine the basis on which you have arrived at a decision.  Because the Government has specifically stated they oppose the P.R. system because it creates Coalitions, it is manifest that this judgment on this issue is biased and prejudiced and that it is impossible for them to arrive at a final decision on a subject that has such considerable political content.</P>
    <P>In discussing the merits and demerits of the P.R. system of election, it is relevant to point out that there is only one democratic country in Europe that has the single member constituency system.  That is the United Kingdom.  Of all the democratic countries in the world, only a small minority have the single member constituency system, such as the Government is now proposing.  The other countries of Western Europe&mdash;small countries such as Denmark, Luxembourg, Belgium, Holland, Norway and Sweden and larger and more powerful countries like Western Germany and <Col N="2006" /> Italy&mdash;all have systems of P.R.  Even Australia, whose Parliament is part of the heritage of British rule, is not based on the same system of government as pertains in Great Britain. The Government is trying to suggest that this country should adopt a system of government which only a minority of democratic countries has adopted.</P>
    <P>The reasons why, in the last 30 years or so, P.R. has come to be accepted as a fair system of election are very obvious.  The system under which the British Parliament is elected is a system which is likely to lead to, and has in fact led to, dictatorial forms of government.  It is a system which is likely to result in, and has in fact resulted in, Governments with a minority vote in the country obtaining a large majority of votes in Parliament. In other words, it is a system which gives unrepresentative Parliament. Earlier to-day, Deputy O'Higgins quoted figures for the South African elections in 1948 and 1953.  I do not intend to repeat those figures.  But experience in South Africa has demonstrated that it is possible and likely for a Government to be elected with a minority vote in the country.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that in recent years, in England at any rate, there has been a fair balance in the two-Party system, that Governments have come and gone, that Parliament has remained stable and that democratic institutions have not been endangered. I do not think there is much use in our looking abroad to try to find how different forms of government are elected and how electoral systems work in other countries.  Like other speakers, I believe we should examine our own affairs here and draw from our own experience.</P>
    <P>As the British system has been held up to us as an example, we have to bear in mind how and why the British system, which has not worked well in other countries, has worked in England.  It is for the simple reason that, for hundreds of years now, the system has developed in Great Britain.  You now have there, which you would not have here, the tradition of single-member constituencies, some of which return Conservative members <Col N="2007" /> to Parliament and some of which return Labour members to Parliament, no matter what Government is in office or what candidate the Party concerned puts forward.  These traditional Labour and Conservative seats have so enabled the Government and Opposition to be maintained that the number of seats that can be regarded as marginal is quite small.  No matter what shifts there are in public opinion, there is still a large and effective Opposition Party in the country.  We have not got those balancing forces in this country.  We have not got the traditions Great Britain has for working this most difficult and dangerous system of government.</P>
    <P>There are other disadvantages flowing from the British system which it is desired our people should now accept here.  Anybody who has any knowledge of the manner in which English politics work knows the great power of the local political organisation in choosing candidates for election. The real power in the choice of a member of Parliament very frequently vests in the local political machine and not in the people. There are constituencies in Great Britain in which, it is admitted by many writers on political affairs, the people will vote for the Conservative candidate no matter what his status is; and there are constituencies in which the people will vote for the Labour candidate, no matter what his status is.  The real tussle at election time is not at the polls.  It is not in the election campaign.  The real tussle rests in trying to get nomination from the Party machine before the election.</P>
    <P>Under our system the local constituency executives select the candidates to go forward, subject to control from the centre in some instances.  But, at any rate, the people in the constituencies have an opportunity of choice as between the various individuals put forward by the different Parties.  One of the grave disadvantages, if these proposals now put forward are accepted by the people, will be the growth of the power and influence of the Party machine in this country.  I <Col N="2008" /> have said that the danger I see in these proposals is a breakdown in our normal system of parliamentary government. Our system of parliamentary government will break down if there is no effective opposition.  Government spokesmen have stated that they wish to see an Opposition Party formed and an alternative Government available to the people so that the people could choose for one Party as against another at election time.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that we are not discussing this matter in a debating society.  We are not discussing it in a vacuum.  We are dealing with the flesh and blood realities of Irish politics in 1958, with the Fianna Fáil Party in power and the opposition to it coming from the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan, Sinn Féin and a number of Independents.  If the Opposition Party, to which reference has been made, is not formed and if this Government goes forward at the next general election, having passed successfully these proposals, there can be only one result.  These proposals, if put into operation, will mean that the people who get a minority vote in a constituency can be elected.  These proposals will mean that the Party which gets a minority vote will be able to get a majority of the seats in Parliament and I foresee as a very real danger the emergence of a very strong single Party and a very small Opposition.</P>
    <P>Power corrupts the best Party, and election defeat disheartens the most valiant souls in opposition.  Power takes power to itself and, in this country, with the traditions which we have, I see it very difficult to carry on effective opposition if, in fact, there is only a handful of Deputies in opposition here.  I see it very difficult to have an alternative Party available at all if one Party, with all the power and the influence that people think a Party in power has, will be in office for five years.  I fail to see how an Opposition Party of small numbers in the Dáil will get the support from people to offer themselves as candidates.  I fail to see how an Opposition of small numbers in the Dáil will get the subscriptions <Col N="2009" /> from the public necessary to carry on a political organisation.  I fail to see how such a Party will be able to maintain itself adequately in the Dáil and carry on parliamentary government for five years in face of a Party, with not just an overall majority but an overwhelming majority.  These are possibilities in the near future.</P>
    <P>They are also possibilities in the more distant future because, as has been pointed out here by several spokesmen, one of the disadvantages of the British system is that where you have not got the built-in balancing forces, which the British have built up over the years, this single-member constituency system, by which members can be elected on a simple majority, leads to violent swings.  It is perfectly legitimate for us, debating this subject now, to look into the future to see what possibility there is of a violent swing in favour of some unconstitutional group which, for one reason or another, may have made itself popular with the electorate.  Such things have happened in other countries. They could happen here.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have stated that there is only one issue before the Dáil at the present time and that the Opposition are, in fact, hindering a democratic process in debating this subject at all.  It is suggested that we are standing in the way of the people in debating here the merits and demerits of this measure, and that this is a matter for the people to decide.  Such a view demonstrates a very poor and low opinion&mdash;a low opinion&mdash;which I believe some members of the Government have&mdash;of the functions of Parliament. It is our duty to see that this Dáil is the national forum for public discussion, and that matters decided at Party meetings are not just steamrolled through Parliament.  It is our duty as an Opposition to inform the people through the medium of the public Press of the dangers we see inherent in these proposals.</P>
    <P>If there is even a modicum of truth in the fears we have of what may happen in this country as a result of the change in the electoral system, then these proposals should be dropped.  The very fact that these <Col N="2010" /> dangers, to which I and other spokesmen have referred, exist and have, in fact, been experienced in other countries is reason enough for dropping these proposals, even though circumstances in the future may not produce conditions so disastrous as we now think are possible.</P>
    <P>The danger that we see is a real one and the justification for bringing in these proposals is inadequate.  I am satisfied that if we can explain to the people effectively, by means of the public Press, the very real dangers which the abolition of P.R. may, in the peculiar circumstances here in Ireland, bring to us in future, these proposals will be rejected.  We have, I think, been fulfilling a task of national importance in debating here for the last three weeks the measures, proposed by the Government for inadequate reasons, which are likely to produce conditions in this country comparable to those existing in Fascist States and conditions in which the very existence of parliamentary government will be threatened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>My main objection to this Bill is the time chosen for the introduction of a measure of such importance to the future of this country. This measure has not been properly thought out by the Fianna Fáil Party or else they are not in sufficiently close touch with the people.  If they were in close touch with the people, they would not introduce this Bill at this particular time when we have passed through one of the worst years, as far as the farming community and the agricultural industry are concerned, almost in living memory.  My main objection to the Bill, therefore, is based entirely on the timing.  I have other various objections, and I support the many Deputies on this side of the House who spoke against the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see that, if this Bill is presented to the people in its present form, it will give rise to a certain amount of irritation and to unnecessary expense.  I issue a timely warning that it will, in the long run, cause friction and unhappiness in the years to come and in, perhaps, the not too far distant future.  I have heard no solid reasons from the other side of the <Col N="2011" /> House for the abolition of P.R.  One need not go outside this country to express an opinion on the utility or serviceability of the P.R. system.  I shall not make comparisons with other countries.  I have been in this House since 1943 and, in my opinion, P.R. has served its purpose very well.</P>
    <P>The only reason I have heard adduced from the other side of the House for the abolition of P.R. is that the system is cumbersome and gives rise to multiplicity of Parties.  I do not at all agree that it is a cumbersome system.  I think it is a very fair and democratic system and the people of the country have been sufficiently educated in the system to carry on under it for the next number of years.  The people understand P.R. thoroughly.</P>
    <P>As far as the production of multiplicity of Parties is concerned, I do not see much harm in that.  As a matter of fact, I entirely agree with it. Deputies on the other side of the House think the Labour Party serves no useful purpose in this House, that the Clann na Talmhan Party serves no useful purpose here and that the members of these Parties must be liquidated or put out of the House.  If that is the intention of the Government, the more courageous way to tackle the problem would be to bring in an emergency Order and to say: &ldquo;These are illegal and unnecessary organisations.&rdquo;  That would be a more courageous way of eliminating these Parties from public life.  In my opinion, the numerous Parties we have had in inter-Party Governments served a useful purpose and represented a big section of the community.  They should hold their place and be allowed to hold their place in our national Assembly.</P>
    <P>I can see the growing danger of dictatorship.  If this measure becomes law and by referendum receives the assent of the people, I can see we are heading straight for dictatorship.  God forbid that we should be heading in that direction because it would be a bad day for the country when we would have a dictatorship.  As I have said, I have heard no sound or solid <Col N="2012" /> reason adduced by the members on the other side of the House for this measure and I am still waiting patiently.  I have heard many speeches from the other side of the House but have yet to hear one concrete argument in favour of the abolition of P.R.</P>
    <P>The leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly the members of the Government, must be completely out of touch with the people in rural Ireland.  This Bill is highly unnecessary. In the early stages of the debate, three weeks ago, people down the country were taking it in a calm and cool way, not looking at the serious side of it, but, as time went on and as the Opposition Parties began to expound their opinions as to what the abolition of P.R. meant, the people began to wake up and I find in the country at the present time&mdash;and I am speaking very sincerely now&mdash;not alone among the opponents of the Fianna Fáil Party throughout the length and breadth of the country but among Fianna Fáil supporters, a spirit of resentment and irritation aroused by the introduction of this measure.</P>
    <P>Had this measure been introduced at any other time, say, after a good and prosperous year, there might be some justification for it.  Have the Government considered the plight of the country at the present time?  Have they looked at the unemployment figures?  Have they considered the disastrous results of a bad year for wheat production and for the production of other crops?  Have they studied the emigration figures?</P>
    <P>This measures has been rushed unnecessarily. I give sound advice to the Taoiseach, who is wholly responsible for the introduction of this measure.  I would censure him.  If in future years the consequences of amending the Constitution and abolishing P.R. militate against the welfare of this country, I shall certainly lay the blame on the shoulders of the Taoiseach for having introduced this measure.</P>
    <P>This is a dangerous measure and I think quite a number of people will agree that the abolition or elimination of small Parties from the House is not good.  What will happen to these <Col N="2013" /> Parties and the people they represent here?  Do the Fianna Fáil Party not know that they will create a spirit of uneasiness, that there will be an uprising against such treatment of minorities? Do they not know that&mdash;I hope it does not happen&mdash;those Parties who have been deprieved of representation here may join some underground movement, and, in their irritation, resort to hostile measures to enforce their right to representation?  I can see that happening; I know it is coming, but God forbid that it should come.  Perhaps in their saner moments and after this week particularly, when the views of the Opposition have been put clearly and lucidly across this House to the members of the Government, there is still hope&mdash;perhaps I am over-optimistic&mdash;that the Taoiseach in his wisdom will withdraw this Bill from the House forthwith.</P>
    <P>I am issuing a solemn warning and I am basing my views on the opinions I have come across in the past week or ten days.  I know the people of the country are resentful and irritated by the introduction of this Bill and at some not far distant time&mdash;it may be very soon&mdash;that resentment may grow to immense proportions and give the Government a very unpleasant time. The Taoiseach on occasions is quite a moderate man.  I must give credit where credit is due.  For many years, he has been a great figure in this country and his time is passing.  At this stage of his career, is he going to throw a blight on everything that he has done for the past 30 years?  Is he to retire&mdash;we must all retire some time through death or otherwise&mdash; and perhaps see everything good he has done being undone by some revolutionary movement that may arise here?  I say that in his saner moments he should consider this.</P>
    <P>Some people say that the straight vote in a single seat constituency is most suitable for this country.  I entirely disagree because I cannot see how minorities will get any representation. I can prophesy now that should this Bill go through, some day or other there will be no Opposition in this House.  That can easily be managed and I shall tell you how. Where you have a Party, any Party, <Col N="2014" /> with plenty of money and newspapers behind them which can provide plenty of propaganda, I say that they can carry an election and secure a majority, not a substantial majority, but a sufficient majority in this House, to enable them to eliminate anything in the line of opposition.  This may lead to corruption in elections.  I have no hesitation in saying that, because a strong Party, in the case of a single-member constituency, may get certain people to stand for them, knowing quite well that these people will not be elected.  But they can split the vote of the Opposition Party, with the result that the strong Party will benefit. That could happen&mdash;I am not accusing any Party of being so corrupt as to employ such tactics but we must remember we are not all saints in this country.</P>
    <P>I am totally against this measure and everything I can possibly do up and down the country, in my own constituency and outside it, as far as I can travel, to induce the people to vote against the abolition of P.R., I shall do.  I advise the Taoiseach in his own interest and the interest of his Party, and particularly in the interests of this country, not to hesitate to withdraw this measure from the House at once.</P>

      <P>I have listened carefully to the debate and read the contributions from both sides of the House, and I have studied the different reasons advanced pro and con.  In many instances, Deputies stated they were not satisfied with the present system. They know it has been a freakish system, giving freakish results, and one of the main things they have learned from their experience of Coalition Governments is that they might get a &ldquo;lucky-dip&rdquo; Government. They do not know what kind of Government they will get, as a result of a combination of different political Parties or groups getting together after, but not before, an election.  Practically every speaker I have heard to-night referred in one way or another to the weaknesses of this system as we know it.  There was the extraordinary case mentioned by one Deputy of the fate of the former Deputy Mannion <Col N="2015" /> from Connemara who, although he headed the pole, was not elected. That is one of the results one can get from this freakish system when one compares it with the straight vote.</P>
      <P>When we talk about minorities, it is clear that under this system there is a tendency to give minorities the power out of proportion to their numbers and what they represent.  We have had some extraordinary examples of that under coalition government here and if Deputy D. Costello wants to suggest that I, or the Party, should not use our experience with coalition government here as a reason for abolishing this system, he completely misunderstands this Party's whole attitude to the system of P.R.  One of our reasons, and in fact that reason that is freshest in our minds, is the disastrous effect brought about by this system in providing this country with coalition government and the results of coalition government.</P>

We have seen extraordinary political somersaults brought about by small minority groups in Coalition Governments.  We have the extraordinary position of the traditional Commonwealth Party completely reversing their oars as a result of the action of a few people who were in a Coalition Government.  We had the then Taoiseach announcing in Canada the repeal of the External Relations Act and reversing not only his own policy but the policy of his Party over many years.

Whatever other effect it may have had, one thing it proved to all and sundry&mdash;what the present Taoiseach maintained, of course&mdash;was that this country, since the passing of the Constitution in 1937, was a Republic. However, this operation went on over in Canada at the behest of a very minor minority group in that set-up, which is an indication of how minorities brought into a Coalition Government can reverse engines and make major national decisions although the number of people they represent throughout the State is negligible.</P>

      <P>We stated at all times that in a two-line Bill we could repeal the External Relations Act.  Fine Gael were saying we were living a <Col N="2017" /> lie, that we were still in the Commonwealth and were not a Republic, but it remained for their period of office to prove that what we said was correct because in a two-line Bill in this House we did repeal the External Relations Act.  At all events in dealing with this constitutional change, we shall not go out to make any announcements in Canada.  We are making them in this House and the Irish people will be able to judge one way or the other whether the system we have, which has now been in operation since 1922, is to be accepted or rejected.</P>
      <P>I should like to quote from the speech on this measure of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello.  At column 1024, Volume 171, of the Official Debates of the 26th November, 1958, he made this assertion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I object most strongly to having any hand, act or part in trying to mould the future of this country. I object strenuously to the horrid phrase &lsquo;the foreseeable future&rsquo;. There is no such thing.  But we are reaching out our hands under this proposition into the future and trying to impose our will upon the people of the future.  We are doing that in circumstances in which we have not the remotest idea of what conditions will be when this proposed system comes into operation a few years hence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, strongly objects to our trying to mould the future of our nation in this Parliament.  I should have thought one of the primary duties of Parliament in a democracy would be to mould the future of our nation, to lay down a solid foundation for that future.  One of the primary tasks of Parliament should be to ensure a bright future for the nation.  In any case, it appears that Deputy Costello will not have any hand, act or part in moulding the future of this nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In organising our society we must think very carefully of the foundation on which it should be laid.  One of the most important things, as far as our future and our parliamentary institution is concerned, is to have a proper <Col N="2018" /> basis for it, a stable and reliable basis. I think it is clear to practically all thinking people in Ireland that P.R. never worked satisfactorily here, that it always led to crises.  Even as far back as 1927, when it was possibly first tested here in Parliament, a Government had to hang on by the casting vote of a chairman.  It was not until this very last election, when the people were driven to desperation, that they came out and gave a solid mandate to us to get rid of Coalition Governments. The people having given that mandate, it is obvious that the system that leads to Coalition Governments must go.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan wished to prove last night that this Party never got a majority of the votes cast by the electorate. If Deputy McGilligan is right in that argument, that we have never got a majority of the votes cast although we have been the largest Party in the House, surely that is a very strong argument in favour of the abolition of P.R.?  It must be a cracked system if, right down through the years with the exception of two periods, the Fianna Fáil Party got control of the Government on a minority of the people's votes.  If Deputy McGilligan's argument on that score is correct, it is obviously an argument which proves that there is something fundamentally wrong with the P.R. system as it has been practised here.  There have been different P.R. systems in different countries to which I shall refer briefly in a moment, but in so far as it has worked here up to the present time, it has worked for certain reasons which will not be recurring reasons as far as one can judge.</P>
    <P>There were very special reasons why the system worked here at all.  The system worked here because, going back to the pro-Treaty and anti-Treaty days, the country was mainly divided into two large groups.  These political associations tended to bring into this House two large Parties and were it not for that, P.R. would probably have founded here much earlier than it did.  You had the pro-Treaty and anti-Treaty groups which gave us the two-Party system with some very small splinter groups in the early days of the history of this State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2019" /> There were certain other major issues which tended to get the people to give a strong majority to one particular side.  You had the fighting of an economic war here, when we were engaged in an economic struggle with an outside people.  That is something that will not occur again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and his successors are quite free now.  They will never have to pay those annuities again as a result of the fight we fought.  That struggle tended to show the people the direct road and for that reason the people, in that major national issue, rallied behind the leadership given to them from this Party.  You also had the return of the ports, the passing of the Constitution and our neutrality, which was promulgated before the war, and which was agreed to by practically everybody in this House.  You had all these issues which tended to make the people make the best of the P.R. system as they knew it.  All those issues are now past.  In addition, this Party and this nation had the outstanding qualities of leadership of the present Taoiseach down through these years.  If it had not been for that it might well be that this system of P.R. would have foundered long ago.</P>
      <P>Does anybody in this House who was present at the counting of votes understand the P.R. voting system? Does 90 per cent. of the electorate understand this system?  Somebody on the opposite benches said that the people come out of the polling booths and ask for directions as to Party affiliations.  How many people who watched the counting of votes will deny that many voters stopped having marked their first or second preferences?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because I think the people are intelligent that I am prepared to leave the decision to the people.  Because they are intelligent, I know that they will do away with this <Col N="2020" /> system which could become a millstone around the neck of our democracy.  It is because I know that the people are satisfied that this has not been a good system that I am satisfied that they will get rid of it.  I know that this is possibly not a very fair jury before which to put these arguments because in this forum there are many Deputies who have vested interests.  There are very many Deputies who feel that, if we had a straight vote, they would disappear from this House and it is very hard to expect a completely impartial view from many Deputies when they feel that their own future is in danger.</P>
      <P>However, surely the people opposite who have been so vehement in their opposition to this measure, if they are so confident in their arguments and their appeal to the intelligence of the people, should have no fears as to what will happen the referendum when it goes to the people.  All these speeches that I have listened to remind me of the wailing wall of Jerusalem. All that and all the crying we have heard is a confession of the failure of the people opposite to get the people of this country to support their viewpoint. I should think, if Deputies opposite are so confident of the validity of their arguments, that there should be no need for all this obstruction.  If they are so confident, they should take the view that the people will have a chance to decide the issue and say to themselves: &ldquo;The people will throw out the proposals by an overwhelming majority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This much is true.  The direct vote has worked in the two great democracies of the present day, in Britain and the United States of America.  It has worked, and worked successfully, in these two countries.  It is true that Deputy Dillon stated here that the Americans are only a polyglot people and that what might suit there might not suit here.  That is an argument that will not cut any ice with anybody. Where you have democracy working and working successfully it is doing so under the straight vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see what happened to a number of countries which, before the war, had one form or other of P.R. and where democracy failed from within <Col N="2021" /> as a result of that system.  There were Italy, Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece and Yugoslavia and to a certain extent Latvia, Czechoslovakia and Roumania.  Note what happened in all these countries.  Under the systems of P.R. which they had, there grew up a multiplicity of groups which gave disruptive elements a foothold to work from the inside and thus destroy their institutions.  That is what happened in these countries and what led to dictatorships in these countries.  The mess in which these countries found themselves in those days, and in which some of them even still find themselves, was due to the system of P.R. which they adopted.</P>
    <P>We see what happened in France in recent times.  The situation was quite clear and is still fresh in our minds when, only a couple of months ago, nobody reading the papers could gamble overnight as to whether there would be a civil war in France or not. There was a situation in France which made a visit to that country like a visit to London and walking down Whitehall to see the Changing of the Guard, except that one went to Paris to see the changing of the Government every second night.</P>

      <P>And as a result of that, their nation was virtually on the brink of civil war when they resurrected General de Gaulle to get them out of the trouble, and he is making no mistake about what he is doing under his new Constitution and his new system of election.  In view of these experiences, and taking the States where this system in one form or another worked, it has not worked successfully in any country.  It has brought disaster in its wake in many countries, and it is because we want to be sure that disaster will not come in its wake in this country that we decided to let the people make up <Col N="2022" /> their minds, and give them the opportunity, having heard both sides of the case, of deciding whether they should retain the system or reject it.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy said he thought it was an inopportune time to introduce this measure.  I think it was Deputy Beirne, of the Clann na Talmhan Party, who said that after a bad year it was inopportune to talk about things like this.  I gathered from the Deputy by implication that possibly if there were a good year, he might consider this.  At all events, it would appear from the Clann na Talmhan amendment which is tabled that they want to get rid of the system as at present.  That amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill as it does not make provision in the proposed single member constituencies for voting on the system of P.R. by means of the single transferable vote.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I gathered from that that Clann na Talmhan want to scrap the system as we know it.  They want single seat constituencies.  That is the effect of their amendment.  That is what Clann na Talmhan are suggesting the House should do, so at least we have one minority group in the House who are also sick and tired of the P.R. system as it works and who, I assume, see the dangers of it.  At all events, they want to bring about some kind of change in that system.</P>
      <P>We had an Independent Deputy speaking here who also wants the straight vote system.  I think it was an Independent Deputy from Limerick, and he has made up his own mind and has given his own reasons as to why he wants it to go.  Therefore, it would appear to me there is at least one minority group and one of the Independent members who want to change the system we have, no matter what we should get in place of it, some of them going further than others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new system that we visualise, we will have single seat constituencies, and some of the criticism that has been voiced here with reference <Col N="2023" /> to the present system has been that in some cases constituencies are very unwieldy and stretch over long distances.  I happen to come from one such constituency and, on occasion, it is necessary to travel a distance of 90 miles from one meeting to another in the same constituency.  From that point of view, the system is bad and unworkable. If there were a single seat constituency, a compact group and compact area, I believe the people would be better served and, under such a system, Deputies would be much more in touch with their constituents and with their businesses than is possible under the multi-seat constituency system we have under the existing law.</P>
    <P>As to the opportuneness or otherwise of the time, we all know that, under the law as it stands, next year there must be a revision of constituencies, even under the old P.R. system and, therefore, I think this is a most opportune time to examine the whole system and see whether the people should change it, amend it or retain it.  I can visualise no more suitable time than the present.  It is not necessary for me to stress the fact that, but for the result under the existing system at the last election, it would not be possible for an enabling measure of this kind to be given to the people so that they might have an opportunity to express their views.  I have no doubt that if we had no Party in control and if we had a number of individual groups, for the reasons I have mentioned before, legislation like this could never pass through this House and, therefore, the people could never have an opportunity of stating whether they wanted to get rid of the system or whether they wanted the straight vote.  At all events, they will get that opportunity now and we will see what the people who have had long experience of the operation of P.R., as we know it in this country, will do about it.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is not true to state, as has been suggested by Deputy J.A. Costello, that this would be binding the country for all time.  If at some future time the people want to change back, or change to some other system, the people will have the right to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan attacked the procedure laid down to deal with constituencies, or the creation of new constituencies, under this measure.  In fact, Deputy McGilligan set out to talk about everything and anything which was not before the House or which was <Col N="2025" /> not in this Bill.  I am quite sure he did that with a purpose.  He proceeded to talk about everything from the White Paper on economics to the policy of Fianna Fáil Governments back over a long number of years.  That, again, I take it, was for the purpose of trying to throw dust in the eyes of the people and divert their minds from the real simple issues involved, upon which the people will get an opportunity of voting.</P>
    <P>He attacked by innuendo, if not by direct implication, the Supreme Court and High Court judges and the way they were appointed.  He also &ldquo;had a go&rdquo; at the President, Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh, as to how he would operate under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Is everything he said not true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Did it occur to Deputy McGilligan that his colleague, Deputy MacEoin, might be very annoyed with his attack last night?  It appears to me that it will be the new President of Ireland who will exercise the functions under this Bill.  It would appear extraordinary to me that Deputy McGilligan should think so little of Deputy MacEoin's chances of the Presidency that he still talks about what originally appointed Fianna Fáil Presidents might do with the powers conferred on them under this measure.</P>
      <P>The whole suggestion was that in an issue of this kind the judges would be venal.  Indeed, he followed the former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, who said at column 1030, Volume 171 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...That is all I have to do.  I will appoint CD, who is a tool of the Government in power, who is what the late Kevin O'Higgins would have called a legal careerist, who got his job on the bench because he was the lickspittle of a political Party.  That is the system supposed to give us impartiality and supposed to create public confidence in this whited sepulchre, the commission set up under this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So we are informed by Deputy Costello apparently that the judges of <Col N="2026" /> the High Court or the Supreme Court would become lickspittles in operating the measure set up here.  That is followed by Deputy McGilligan who said the same words in a different way in his speech last night.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is the reason for that.  The way the proposed commission will deal with these constituencies is set out very clearly.  The judge, whoever he may be, will be appointed by the President, whoever he may be, after consultation with the Council of State.  The Opposition will be represented on this commission by three people picked by the Ceann Comhairle, whoever he is at the time. The Taoiseach will nominate his own three to that commission.  If there is any better way of getting an impartial tribunal in this country to deal with the division of constituencies, I should like to hear it from somebody, but I deplore the suggestion that any of the judges who have been elevated to either the High Court or the Supreme Court, no matter what their political colour or connections were prior to their elevation, should be abused in this way in this House and that it should be suggested they would not do their duty under the law when called upon by the President of Ireland to do so.</P>
    <P>Of course, there could be another reason for this particular form of attack.  I have always noticed that when the Fine Gael Party were in the political doldrums, some type of smear campaign started against some institution of State.  They are now in the political doldrums and I assume this is the highlight and the starting point of the new smear campaign when they started to attack the people sitting in the High Court and the Supreme Court, and suggested they would be the creatures of the political Parties who were in power when they were appointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking from these benches, I do not deny that part of the reason for our knowing that the P.R. system is a bad system is our experience of Coalition Governments in this country.  The question was put by Deputy D. Costello, as to why P.R. was put in the Constitution in 1937.  The answer is very simple.  In the evolution of a nation, you can take only one major constitutional step at a time.  When we were endeavouring to get that Constitution through it was bitterly opposed by all those Deputies <Col N="2028" /> sitting opposite and was misrepresented up and down the country.  In every possible way they could, they tried to confuse the people.  It was a sufficient burden on our hands to get the people to adopt that Constitution and shake off the shackles imposed on the nation.  One great national goal was in sight.  If at that time the issue of P.R. was also thrown in, it would still further confuse the issue before the people.</P>
      <P>I remember during that campaign it was suggested to the women of Ireland that the new Constitution would mean a change in their kitchens and that they would never be let out.  It is amazing that when responsible men come out with statements of that kind they will get a number of people to believe them. The fundamental aim, from the national point of view, was to get the Constitution through.  If the Taoiseach at that time tried to change the system at the same time as he brought in the new Constitution, there would be the danger that the people would be so confused by the misrepresentation that the majority of them would not vote for it.</P>
      <P>Let me say that as far as the P.R. system of voting is concerned it has proved itself after trial in this country to be a freak system.  It has proved itself on trial to give the people, not what they voted for, but a lucky-dip Government with, perhaps, the tail wagging the dog instead of the dog wagging the tail.  It has given this country instability and, in so far as it is our duty to provide a solid foundation for the future of this nation, I say to the people: &ldquo;Let us adopt the straight vote which has been successful in the United States of America, where democracy has been working for a long time, as it has also been successful in England.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am very glad to have an opportunity of expressing my opinion on the measure before the House and I have no hesitation in declaring my opposition to it.  If I were looking for a reason to convince me of its merit, I would fail to get one from the Deputies who have spoken on the opposite side.  It is a strange thing to hear a Minister of the Fianna Fáil Government stating, as the Minister for the Gaeltacht has just stated, that P.R. is a freak system of election. It is very strange that after all those years have passed and after all the experience gained, both in Government and out of Government, it took Fianna Fáil until 1958 to decide that this system was unsuitable for the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were looking for guidance in this matter I would prefer to go to the founders of this State.  I shall quote from Arthur Griffith, the founder of <Col N="2030" /> Sinn Féin, speaking as far back as 1911.  Nobody in this House, I am sure, will doubt the honesty, sincerity and national outlook of Arthur Griffith.  In the Sinn Féin movement Arthur Griffith had with him many of the people associated with 1916 and 1921.  We were engaged in a struggle for freedom for many years after many centuries of occupation and it fell to Griffith to devise some means, other than the British system, to elect people to represent this country.</P>
    <P>In 1911 Arthur Griffith spoke as a member of the Proportional Representation Society of this country.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;P.R. secures that the majority of the elected shall rule, and that minorities shall be represented in proposition to their strength.  It is the one just system of election under democratic government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When Griffith got the opportunity of drafting the Constitution in 1922, he provided for P.R. Griffith, a founder of this State, and an associate of all those whom we honour and shall honour, no matter how time goes on, was clearly convinced when drafting the Constitution that care should be taken that minority groups should get just representation.  He was mindful of the fact that in the northern part of this country there was the Unionist element who, for reasons of their own, were divided amongst themselves in many cases but, on the question of the independence of this country, preferred to remain attached to the British Government.  Arthur Griffith naturally thought that people such as those should get due representation and he made provision for such representation in 1922.  I think the ex-Unionist element agreed that they were not overlooked and provision was made for them in that Constitution, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>That system obtained from 1922 to 1932 when there was a change of government and it still obtained after the change of government.  When the Taoiseach came to change the Constitution in 1937 this was what he said about the P.R. system:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The system we have, we know; the people know it.  On the whole <Col N="2031" /> it has worked out pretty well.  I think that we have a good deal to be thankful for in this country; we have to be very grateful that we have had the system of P.R. here.  It gives a certain amount of stability, and on the system of the single transferable vote you have fair representation of Parties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What could be clearer than that?  He approved of the P.R. system.  Those are his words, not mine.  These are also the views of men who have been closely associated with the national movement.  Nothing could be clearer, to my mind, than the fact that this issue was considered, and considered very carefully, from time to time and under different circumstances.  Then we had a change of government in 1948. That system obtained until the next election in 1951, when we changed again to a Fianna Fáil Government. Nobody said anything about it; nobody suggested any unfairness in it.  I have been associated with elections all the time from 1937 and I have always found that all Parties had nothing but praise for that system.  They considered it to be fair.  It gave every fellow a chance and nobody need be afraid to go forward for election because he knew his friends and knew what transferable votes he would get from other Parties.  In all sincerity, I think that is a very democratic way of giving people an opportunity to go forward for parliamentary election.</P>
    <P>In 1954, Deputy Costello came into power again.  At that time, the same system of P.R. obtained in both local and Dáil elections.  In 1957, the present Government came back to power again, and now after one and a half years or nearly two years of Fianna Fáil government, suddenly, overnight, it has been decided that this is a freak system, a bad system of election.  Every member of the Fianna Fáil Party who has spoken here to-night has re-echoed that it is a bad system.  It is very strange that it took them all these years, from 1922 to 1958, to decide that it is a bad system.</P>
    <P>People ask me what is all this about, what is the necessity for having this referendum?  I will quote, for the benefit <Col N="2032" /> of the Dáil, the opinions of a number of people trained and versed in economics, who held a meeting in Dublin on, I understand, last Friday night.  The meeting was reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Saturday, December 6th.  At the Economic Congress in Dublin of the Irish Universities' Societies' Association, Mr. D. Hamilton made this statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At a time when our efforts should be directed towards preparing the economy in the light of markets emerging in Europe and when a spirit of co-operation is essential to the achieving of this, the Irish people are again dividing over matters of nationalism and over the method by which our Government representatives are elected.</P>
    <P>The emphasis here should be on developing our economy so as to alleviate unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>He told the meeting that Irish people were noted for their lack of co-operative spirit and their distrust of their neighbours, which was evidenced by the poor response to the efforts of Sir Horace Plunkett, Father Finlay and others to develop the co-operative movement and also by the apparent lack of co-operation between the political Parties.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hamilton said that the work of O.E.E.C. should serve as an example of what co-operation could do to increase economic welfare. Ireland, although a member of O.E.E.C., had progressed economically at a slower rate than most of the other member countries.&rdquo;</P>

These are the matters that should be engaging our wholehearted attention, and there should be no question of the House being divided now, after an election held exactly one year and nine months ago, in which the people gave their decision and decided that Fianna Fáil <Col N="2033" /> were entitled to be the Government of this country for the next five years.</P>
      <P>I should much prefer to be discussing these problems I have mentioned than discussing P.R.  It is unfortunate that a matter like this is engaging our attention instead of unemployment and emigration.  As Deputy McGilligan stated, the population of my city&mdash;I represent Limerick&mdash;is 52,000.  When one realises that that figure corresponds exactly to the number of unemployed people and that the city of Cork has a population of 60,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the words of the Taoiseach, it has been a fair system since 1937.</P>

    <P>Why the decision to abolish P.R.? We all know that for some months past the Fianna Fáil Party have been holding meetings, and at those meetings the decision to abolish P.R. was discussed.  I assume&mdash;I have no reason to know what goes on at these meetings&mdash;that they discussed the proposed boundaries.  Maps may have been produced&mdash;I do not say they were because that has been denied&mdash;but P.R. was discussed, and it was decided at that Party meeting, and brought forward to the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis to be endorsed, that the Party would <Col N="2034" /> agree unanimously to the abolition of P.R.</P>
    <P>Why that decision was arrived at I do not know, but it does strike me, and I was asked by several people, why is it being pushed on the country at the moment?  People asked me is it not a fact that Fianna Fáil have an overall majority and practically three years of government to run. They are a strong Government; they claim to be a stable Government, and they can make that claim.  In these circumstances, why annoy the people at the present time with these matters when other problems are more pressing?</P>
    <P>That is a matter for which my constituents have asked for an explanation. I have no explanation to give because none of the Fianna Fáil speakers has given me any clear indication that the intention of the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party is other than to hand down as a legacy to his Party the government of this country.  We naturally ask has the Taoiseach lost faith in P.R.?  If he has, he must swallow his words of 1937.  It is quite evident that the Taoiseach is more concerned with Fianna Fáil ruling in this country than he is with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Another explanation many people give is that at election times when Fianna Fáil go around canvassing, they never mention the names of the candidates.  They just announce themselves: &ldquo;We are de Valera's Party.&rdquo;  I think there is something in that.  If he retires and goes out of office, Fianna Fáil candidates can no longer say they are de Valera's men. They will have to say &ldquo;Johnny Murphy or &ldquo;Johnny Ryan&rdquo;, or whoever they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carew</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the reasons why I assume this P.R. Bill has come before us.  That is why we are asked to make a decision.  That is why the Irish people are being divided now in an election; it is called a referendum but it is really an election.  For these and for many other reasons, I do not think it is fair to the people that a <Col N="2035" /> Government who have been elected for five years, and who have an overall majority, should come along and disturb them at this time.  Another matter has been mentioned and made little of.  We think very little now of £1,000,000.  It will cost £80,000 at least&mdash;perhaps much more&mdash;because the Party machines will have to pour out money and the Party with the most money will get the most support in relation to this referendum.</P>
      <P>The question has been asked: &ldquo;Why be afraid of small Parties?&rdquo; Is it not a fact that we have had all down the years in this House Parties representing various interests?  We have a Farmers' Party, even though they may number only three or four here.  There are Independent members, some of whom do not wish to be associated with any Party.  They are entitled to be in this House and they hold independent views.  I know that this House has had sad experience of some Independents because one never knew what they would do. They proved themselves political weather-cocks, more concerned with stunting, when it came to having influence on any particular Party.</P>
      <P>We have a Labour Party here who represent a very large section of our community.  The Labour Party represents all the organised workers in this country and they are entitled to be in this House.  I definitely say that they are so entitled.  I have been associated with Labour in Limerick and I have always found myself in happy company.  I found that the Labour Party had the proper approach.  I found that the men in it had a deep interest in our civic life.</P>
      <P>I fail to see why this Bill is being brought before this House to liquidate the Farmers, the Independents and Labour.  You might say to me: &ldquo;There might be some very popular man who will be elected.&rdquo;  It is evident that the system of election now proposed&mdash;and I believe it is the opinion of Fianna Fáil&mdash;will increase the number of Fianna Fáil representatives in this House.  I think the intention behind this Bill is to get that increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2036" /> Here is another fact which concerns me.  About 20 years ago, Fianna Fáil, in reorganising the constituencies in this country, brought in 22 three-seat constituencies.  As we all know, if Fianna Fáil could get about 51 per cent. of the votes in those constituencies, they would get two seats. They have succeeded fairly well in doing that, but they have not succeeded as well as they might have liked because, in getting a majority in some of those constituencies, the Labour Party, Sinn Féin and Fine Gael have got seats as well.  They now fear that those Parties may turn the tables on them.  They now feel that the position in the 22 three-seat constituencies may react against them and so they have brought in this system under which every county will be divided into single-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the position in Limerick.  At present we have seven seats&mdash;four in East Limerick and three in West Limerick.  I understand that under the Bill we may have a constituency of 20,000 people or we may have a constituency of 30,000 people&mdash; 20,000 minimum, 30,000 maximum.  If that be so, it is possible that Limerick may be divided into six single-seat constituencies.  Then a situation will arise when the four or five Parties who contested these elections on previous occasions may find themselves with a majority of votes but still beaten by a minority vote.</P>
    <P>Suppose four representatives in Limerick go for any constituency in the city or county and that one of them gets 28 per cent. of the votes and the three others 24 per cent. each.  Then, without any other count, the man with 28 per cent. is declared elected and the three Parties who each got 24 per cent. of the votes or, in all, 72 per cent. of the votes, are not represented.  I ask anybody if that is a fair system.</P>
    <P>Are the Farmers, the Independents, the Labour Party and Sinn Féin not entitled to try at the election?  Are they not equally entitled, with all other sections, to have a candidate or must we now go back to the old days when it was the man with the money who was elected in this country?  It may be that some system of that nature is being <Col N="2037" /> brought our now.  It may be that small Parties are not even to get a chance to know how they would do in any election. Surely that is unfair.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour contest a seat, and the Farmers and Sinn Féin are cut out, a man with 28 per cent. of the poll is still elected.  Suppose that a man gets 36 per cent. of the votes and that the others get 32 per cent. each. Then the man with 36 per cent. of the votes is elected and the two candidates who, between them, got 64 per cent. of the votes are eliminated.  That is an unfair system.  That is why I read the quotation from Arthur Griffith who, in serious times in the history of this country, gave it as his opinion that P.R. was a just system.  That was endorsed by the Taoiseach in 1937 but it is rejected by him in 1958.</P>
    <P>Is it not clear that there is a motive behind this proposed referendum?  Is it not also clear that at every election you will get constituents who will vote only for their own Party?  They are &ldquo;plumpers&rdquo; for the Farmers, Indepents, Labour or Sinn Féin.  That happened in Limerick.  In all the elections I have been in, I have seen all these Parties represented and I feel that to deprive these people of the opportunity of going out and voting in and election is not a fair system of election. It is much better to let these people come out and to let them find out their own strength.  If they find their strength is not what they thought it was, then they have no grievance.  It is a very unfair system to deprive anybody of the opportunity of going out and exercising the franchise.  I am sure some of those people will not vote at all in an election if the straight vote system is brought in.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Fianna Fáil Party and the Taoiseach are now so wedded to the single-member constituency. Is it not a fact that they have been telling us all these years about the gerrymandering in the North?  Is it not a fact that we were told, in respect of two or three counties there, that, if they had a proper system of election, they would vote themselves out of Northern Ireland?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2038" /> It is very unfair for the Taoiseach to come along now and swallow all the things he has been saying over the years.  This country should aim at the unity of all sections and creeds. Amongst our countrymen in Northern Ireland we can find many good Irishmen to give valuable service to this country.  But if we are to adopt this system, I believe many of our countrymen in this part of the country, not of our Faith or political way of life, will resent not being given an opportunity of partaking in either local or parliamentary elections.  It is true that the remedy has been suggested: &ldquo;Join one of the Parties.&rdquo;  Many of them have told me they would not like to join any Party.  But they have come into our local councils and have given valuable advice and help.  We are always very glad to have them represented on our councils.</P>
    <P>Why is this change being brought about?  It is quite clear that the 1948 election proved that an alternative to Fianna Fáil could be found.  Is it because of 1948 and 1954 that the Taoiseach has now decided he will make it impossible for the people to come together in the national interest to form a Government?  Many people have talked about France, Belgium, Germany and other continental countries.  As the Taoiseach once said here: &ldquo;It would make a cat laugh.&rdquo; The comparisons I have heard here would make a cat laugh.  Here is a country of 3,000,000 people being compared with countries of 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 people who have a different way of life.  We all know this is a thinly populated country, and each section has to be small because of the character of our everyday life.  The farmers, for example, are entitled to come in here as an organised group and it would be a tragedy if Labour were not represented also.  Labour are entitled to be here; they should be here and they are making a contribution to the national economy.</P>
    <P>In regard to the commission to fix boundaries, we have been told there will be three Fianna Fáil members, three members of the Opposition selected by the Ceann Comhairle and a chairman.  That may appear to be all right, but you can take it that the <Col N="2039" /> three Fianna Fáil members will have their cards marked for them.  The chairman will be appointed by the President.  We all have respect for the President, but we know he was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We feel he will probably select as chairman somebody who, like himself, has given service to that Party.  We cannot help feeling that that chairman will be disposed to the point of view of the three Fianna Fáil members.</P>

If it suits the three Fianna Fáil members to have two seats in Limerick City, they will do so.  On the other hand, they might take 10,000 people and put them in with the rural area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of a local authority, I am entitled to ask is P.R. to be abolished in local elections?  This matter is not in the present Bill, but it is logical to assume that if P.R. is a freak system in parliamentary elections, <Col N="2040" /> it is equally so in local elections. I should be very disturbed if the Government proceeded to abolish it for local elections.  If this Bill is passed, I do not believe that Government can have two systems of elections.  That would be illogical.  If we are to abolish the P.R. system in local elections and go back to the wards and single members, we are going back to something we got rid of&mdash;the ward system which brought about the ward heeler and all associated with him.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carew</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling. Sir, but this matter is a fear in the minds of the people in Limerick City. We have been hearing from various people that strength and stability are very necessary for the country.  We all agree, but we know that the consequences of strong government can be disastrous for the country.  The dairying farmers and the wheat farmers have good reason this year to know the effects of strong government.  The people who have to make the most of their weekly wages know the effect of strong government; it is reflected in the price they have to pay for bread, butter and flour as a result of the last Budget.  These are the matters that concern the people.  These are the matters we will have to put before the people when we come to advise them as to how they should vote on this referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at the moment four elected representatives to this House who do not sit in the House.  It would be a tragedy if this Bill were to exclude them from any opportunity of being elected to the Dáil in the future. <Col N="2041" /> Rather than condemn them too much, we should devote our best efforts to trying to induce them to come in here and serve the country in a constitutional way.  None of us has any regard for violence.  It does nobody any good. I would prefer to wait 50 or 100 years for a united Ireland rather than achieve it through bloodshed.  Many of us fear that, if those young men are denied the opportunity of seeking election to this House, they will resort to other methods to further their aims.  They are, I suppose, enthusiasts and, if they feel that things have been so arranged as to prevent their election, they may adopt other measures to further their aims.</P>
    <P>I have always advised Sinn Féin supporters in my constituency&mdash;good friends and good neighbours that they are&mdash;that their methods are the wrong ones: &ldquo;You are going the wrong way. You are damaging the national interest. This is not the way you would like your children to follow.&rdquo;  From any point of view, it would be much better to have some system of election, such as P.R., to give them their chance of eventually coming in here.  They will soon learn from experience.  They will find out that the people are not with them and, when they do, they will be satisfied.  If they are deprived of their opportunity they will feel that the big Parties have denied them something.  I know this Bill will go through because the Government have a majority, but, when it goes before the people, I sincerely hope the people will give their answer in a decisive way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I was down in my constituency over the weekend and the first question my constituents asked me was: &ldquo;What is the motive behind this Bill or what is the necessity for a change from P.R. to the single member constituency and the straight vote?&rdquo; I have been here for the past fortnight listening to the debate and I am still not clear as to what is the actual motive behind this.  If the argument for it was that it would change the country and improve conditions for everybody, or something like that, that would be something. The Taoiseach in his statement said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2042" />&ldquo;It has been suggested there has been no public opinion, no voice asking for this.  All I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is that, if he thinks that, he must have had cottonwool in his ears from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957, because everywhere I went through the country, everyone I met wanted to know when were we going to get rid of that system which was going to ruin the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure the Taoiseach did go down on odd occasions through the country.  I wonder what people did he meet?  Did he meet the ordinary man in the street?  I am sure he did not. He met those who have vested interests in Fianna Fáil and who expect patronage from Fianna Fáil. I wonder did he meet down the country any of the 12 big business men, any of the industrialists, who sent out the appeal for funds for Fianna Fáil in 1948 to help them fight the election then.  These people knew what they wanted.  They knew that, by returning Fianna Fáil to Government, they would get certain facilities; permits were necessary then for the importation of certain commodities because many of the emergency regulations were still in operation. For every £10 they subscribed to the Party funds then, they expected a tenfold return subsequently.  I am sure it was these people the Taoiseach met because these people would, if they could, have no other Government but Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste asked: &ldquo;If the people want the change, why should they be denied the chance?&rdquo; Do the people want the change?  That is the question. From whom did the demand for a change emanate?  Was there any discussion in any public body in which it was stated the Government were not performing their duties properly and a change in the system of Government would lead to better government?  Did even the most insignificant organisation or association pass any resolution asking for a change in the system of election? Many resolutions are sent up from various bodies throughout the country asking to have the roads made safer, <Col N="2043" /> asking to have people's lives preserved on the roads, but, as far as I know, there was never any demand from anybody for a change in our system of election.</P>
    <P>The fact that it was proposed to change the system came as a bombshell when the news appeared in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i>  Evidently the news leaked out and the political correspondent was quick enough to get on to it.  That was the source from which the people learned that there was to be a change.  If there was any sense of responsibility in the Government, they would have made a definite statement in the first instance and not have permitted the news to leak out from a Cabinet meeting or through the Party organisation.  I do not think the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, any more than anybody else, knew of the proposed change until it appeared in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i></P>
    <P>Another question the people are asking is: &ldquo;What is the point of putting the country to the expense of a referendum? In reply to a question here, it was stated that the cost to the Central Fund would be at least £80,000.  I have no doubt that the total cost will exceed £250,000.  Why should the country be put to that expense merely because one individual thinks it would be good for the country or good for his own Party?</P>
    <P>At the present time the country requires stability and confidence, not turmoil and uncertainty.  There is unemployment. Things have reached a very low ebb.  Once there is even talk of an election, all discussion revolves around that and people will not settle down to work.</P>
    <P>The case has been made by some Deputies that the straight vote would reduce the number of Parties.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht said this evening that minorities get representation in the House at the present time out of all proportion to the numbers they represent in the country.  I wonder is that a fact?  Is he talking off the cuff or has he any proof that that is the fact?</P>
    <P>In the 25 years from 1932 to 1957 <Col N="2044" /> there were ten general elections.  The distribution of seats between the Parties was a very close reflection of the distribution of votes actually cast. Over the ten elections the average percentage of first preference votes gained by the various Parties was: Fianna Fáil, 45 per cent. of the votes and 48 per cent. of the seats; Fine Gael, 30 per cent. of the votes and 33 per cent. of the seats; Labour, 16 per cent. of the votes and 14 per cent. of the seats. &ldquo;Others&rdquo; got 9 per cent. of the votes and 5 per cent. of the seats.  Could anything be fairer than that?  The electors got representation within 2 or 3 per cent. of the votes cast for each Party.  Is that not very fair representation?</P>
    <P>Is it a fact that Fianna Fáil hope that by this change, in getting 45 per cent. of the votes they will get 100 per cent. of the seats?  Is that the idea?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently it is.  They hope to be able to secure government by a minority vote.  As I have demonstrated, the present system gives a very fair and true reflection of what the people want.  It could not be any fairer under any other system.  Every Party got representation within 2 or 3 per cent. of the number of votes they obtained.  I do not think the Minister for the Gaeltacht was very sure of himself when he said that minorities get representation out of all proportion to the numbers they represent.  According to the figures I have given, &ldquo;Others&rdquo; got 9 per cent. of the votes and gained 5 per cent. of the seats&mdash;less representation, proportionately, than either Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or Labour. That completely answers the statement of the Minister for the Gaeltacht this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another case put up is that under P.R. people do not know how to vote and many papers are spoiled.  Over the same period, the number of spoiled papers in the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny in any election was about 1.1 per cent.  That is a very small number allowing for the fact that some people designedly destroy the papers and others, possibly through being illiterate or excited, do not mark the <Col N="2045" /> papers properly.  It is a very small percentage. It shows that the people have a very good grip of P.R. and know how to cast their votes.</P>
    <P>The case has been made here by the Taoiseach that small Parties can put up an attractive programme.  I wonder he did not blush when he made that case.  Could any small Party put up a programme one-half as attractive as the programme Fianna Fáil put up before the last election?  In Kilkenny I saw posters which said: &ldquo;Wives, get your husbands out to work.  Let us go ahead again.  Just change the Government and the country will move along straightaway.&rdquo;  The Tánaiste, when he was in opposition, stated that he was prepared to put up £100,000,000, a blue print for prosperity, and provide 100,000 jobs.  How many jobs have they provided?  They have a strong Government.  One gets tired when there is a division in the House and the Government have a majority of 16 or 17 every time.  What have they done? What results have we got from it?</P>
    <P>The Government have now been in office for two years.  We find that the number of emigrants is 60,000 and the number of unemployed 60,000.  Apparently, the same thing will happen next year.  There is this difference.  Before the present Government came into office, men who were out of work went to England and sent home the wherewithal to maintain the family at home whereas now they bring their wives and families with them.  They have lost confidence in the Government and in the country.  That is the result of two years of strong Government.  It is not two years of good Government.  If we had good Government, that would be changed.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting of the corporation of Kilkenny last week.  We were discussing special relief grants for Christmas.  A prominent member of the Fianna Fáil Party said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We must remember that we never had more unemployment than we have to-day and surely we would not miss the few coppers we would put on the rates to help towards relieving these poor, destitute, unemployed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2046" /> That is not a member of the Fine Gael Party speaking.  That is a quotation from the <i>Kilkenny People.</i>  That was said by a Fianna Fáil member of that corporation, a responsible member, who has been elected for over 30 years. I have no doubt that, if he thought things had improved under the Fianna Fáil Government, he would be the first to say it.  He says: &ldquo;Unemployment was never as high.&rdquo;  That is after two years of strong Government.</P>

      <P>It is quite relevant because the Taoiseach stated that small Parties can put up an attractive programme as they will not have the responsibility of forming a Government. No small Party could put up as attractive a programme as Fianna Fáil put up before the last election although they knew that they might be elected and have the responsibility of forming a Government.  These are the results.</P>
      <P>I should like if the Ministers who have been talking here would tell us, if the straight vote system was adopted and if by obtaining 45 per cent. of the votes cast they obtained 100 per cent. representation in the Dáil, would they be able to give us some promise that we would come to prosperity? As far as I can see, the Government have just sat down since they came into office.</P>

      <P>Three members will be recommended by the Taoiseach.  We know the type he will put on.  Three members will be recommended by the Ceann Comhairle.  But the point about this is that their decision, no matter what it is, cannot be challenged in the courts.  They are above the courts.  We know what can be and has been done about gerrymandering in Northern Ireland.  We have the case of Derry City where there is a very large Nationalist majority and on the corporation there is a Unionist majority. The minority in the city has the majority in the council, and I have no doubt the same thing will happen here and that you will have gerrymandering. Whatever protestations may be made you are bound to have it here and the result will be what we might call dictatorship.</P>
      <P>We have had experience before of Fianna Fáil in office for 16 years continuously, being re-elected Government after Government, and when they did not get a clear majority they went back to the country to get a majority because the people said: &ldquo;We must have some Government.&rdquo;  But we know the corruption that went on at that time.  We know that if somebody got a permit or anything like that, the local secretary of the Fianna Fáil Cumann demanded £10 or £20 from him.</P>

      <P>My suggestion is: why have a referendum?  Why not go right away to the country?  If the Government loses on the referendum question they must have an election; they cannot go on without the confidence of the people.  If they win on the referendum they will also go to the country so that we are bound to have a general election in a very short time, although that has been denied by some Fianna Fáil speakers.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Taoiseach and the Government to reconsider their decision and not put the country through this upset and turmoil in the next few months.  If they want a vote of confidence or any reassurance let them have a straightforward general election and let the people show how they feel.  But I know that the Government want to stay in power no matter what the feelings of the people are. We know by gerrymandering the votes what it is possible to secure under the straight voting system and the single member constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to, and reading the contributions from the Government side in support of this Bill one must conclude that the Opposition are opposing the Bill solely because we fear to face the people.  That has prompted me to stand up here and say to the House that it is not fear on my part of the consequences of the referendum for me personally that moves me. I stand up to speak against the Bill because I honestly believe it will have serious effects on the social and economic life of our people.  Why bring in this Bill at this time?  The Taoiseach has said it is an appropriate time. Would the reason be that he is afraid he will not again get the chance from the people he got at the last election? After all, under P.R. at the last election a strong Government was elected which placed him in the position of leader and personally I can never understand <Col N="2050" /> why the Taoiseach, as Leader of that Government, should take advantage of the opportunities he got through P.R. to do away with P.R.</P>
      <P>Before P.R. is abolished and before the referendum question is decided, undoubtedly the Government must put more concrete facts and reasons to the people prior to the people acting on what they have been told.  We must remember that we are speaking to an intelligent people, people made intelligent by the things that have happened in this House and through their experience of what has been said in different constituencies, of promises made and never fulfilled.</P>
      <P>In the past it was the general opinion &mdash;and rightly so&mdash;that the country needed strong Government, a Government which could at least put in their term of office and in that way have a good chance of putting into operation at least some part of the policy which they put before the electorate.  We have a strong Government now and undoubtedly if the Taoiseach so desires they will complete their full term of office.  It is for that reason that, I think, rightly or wrongly, at this time in the history of the country the Taoiseach should leave the question of P.R. alone. With the Government he has behind him he should take up the immediate problems confronting the nation.</P>
      <P>Those are not problems which have arisen overnight.  Unfortunately for the country they are problems which have been allowed to develop over the years until now they are endangering the very life-blood of the nation.  As a humble back-bencher here I think it is time to stop this dilly-dallying about a referendum, or as to what way this Government or that Government should be formed.  When the members of a Government are elected, they must do their duty by the people.  They must forget about Party interests and work for the people who put them on the Government side of the House and for no other body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Monday last I read about the Minister for External Affairs going down to Wexford to commemorate, and I dare say celebrate, the 21st anniversary of the Constitution, to celebrate the 21st anniversary of a Constitution that this <Col N="2051" /> House has been rattling upside down for the past three weeks and which had solidly embeded in one of its Articles the provision that elections should be fought on the P.R. system, the system the people knew and understood. The very Minister who has been a Minister in that Government for 16 years of those 21, has told us here that it was the system of P.R. that has handicapped the progress and the onward march of this country and that if the system were not abolished it would do more harm in the future. I do not want to be too hard or critical but even a Minister of State can at times make a foolish statement.  Undoubtedly that was as foolish a statement as I ever heard and, in fishing parlance, it is a bait to which the fish will not rise.</P>
    <P>The manner in which Governments are formed in other countries has been argued.  What does that matter to us? We have here a population of less than 3,000,000 people and it is dwindling day by day.  Do you think they are worried whether it is P.R. or the straight vote we adopt?  It means absolutely nothing to them because the time has arrived when the people do not care what Government are elected or whether they are elected on the P.R. system or the straight vote.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say to the Taoiseach, representing the same county as I do, he being the senior member for that county, that he should forget P.R. for the moment and tackle the immediate problems that confront us.  He has a strong Government behind him, a Government put there by P.R., a system which he now wants to abolish.  I should like him with the help of a constructive Opposition, an Opposition who are disposed to help in every way they can, to seek ways and means by which this country could be run at a lesser sum than it is costing the taxpayers and the ratepayers to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pass judgment on this Bill and on the circumstances in which it was put before the House.  I sincerely regret it has been thought wise to introduce this Bill in the present condition of things throughout the country.  It is obvious to everyone that this country is in the worst economic position it has been in over the last 60 years.  I have been actively concerned in this country's affairs over that period and never have I known the country to be so badly off, economically and socially.</P>
      <P>Never during that period, when this country was struggling for its very existence, was it in the depressed and the disillusioned state in which it is now. There was always hope and fight in the people.  Now there is none, none whatever. My great regret about this House all over the years is that we made no effort to build up a tradition behind the House.  The members of the House itself did not try to build up respect or tradition for the things done in the House.  There has been no effort to make sacrosanct the traditions of the House so that the people in it and the people in the country will look up to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to refer to the condition of affairs in an adjoining country or to say that the method of voting there has brought about such and such a condition.  My memory can go back to 1896 and I know what happened in that country.  What has the straight vote brought there?  Has it not brought the greatest landslides that could come under any system?  Again I say that there has been no attempt <Col N="2053" /> made towards the building up of a tradition in this House.  The whole policy has been that whatever one Party builds up when in office, the next Party will try to pull down.  There is no respect for anything in this House. The young people are disillusioned and have no respect for this House or for any other institution in this country.  I do not know when we are going to have respect for ourselves, for this House and for the Constitution of this country.  We have a Constitution introduced one day by one Party and the next day the other Party sets out to tear it up, just like a lot of children.</P>
    <P>We are in this House to-night ignoring certain factors in this country which are really the important things and which, in my opinion, should be a reason for the rejection of this Bill. There is no use comparing this country with other countries.  In this country, there has been a hidden background all the time which has been a threat to the stability of the State. That is what annoyed me when I saw this Bill.  It is aimed at a certain section and it ignores that condition of things.</P>
    <P>There never was an election in this country since the State was founded that was fought on a policy.  There have been nothing but slogans in our elections and there has been nothing said about policy.  Should the young people who have come into politics since the time of Sinn Féin, who have come into politics since 1914, 1916 and 1920, not respect the memory of the men who brought them here?</P>
    <P>They talk about P.R. being imposed on us by Great Britain.  Nothing could be more untrue.  P.R. was founded in this country by Arthur Griffith.  There is an oil painting of him in the main hall.  Does that mean anything? Should not this House build around that man, build around the tradition that he left in this country and around the work he did for us?  There is no respect for his memory and no attempt to make sacrosanct the system that was part of the work of his lifetime.</P>
    <P>Has there not been a continuous attempt since then, sometimes openly and sometimes concealed, to tear down the entire institutions of this State, to <Col N="2054" /> tear down the Government, if it could be done?  Is that not the whole trouble behind the state of the country at the moment and is that not the real reason why there is no stability in the country itself or in the people in it?  Now the young people are so disillusioned that they are shaking the dust of the country from their feet.  What is the use of ignoring that?</P>
    <P>I have given my whole life to trying to lay the ghost of religious intolerance in this country and here, in 1958, we find it being dragged out in this House. One might as well go back to 30 or 40 years ago in Belfast on 12th July.  Can we not concede that here we have a country for all of us, irrespective of the colour of our skins or where we worship on Sundays?  I have lived with Protestants, and was reared with them, and spent a long part of my life in Belfast and I have never had any word of one kind or another with my Protestant fellow citizens.  Deputies will appreciate how grievously I regret to hear this matter raised in this House in 1958.</P>
    <P>P.R. is not the issue in this.  The issue in this is that there is now an underground body in this country, and, if you attempt to stultify them by passing this Bill, it will make them all the more energetic.  I have heard talk of a strong Government.  Is the whole thing not a joke?  This Government has the numbers.  It should be a strong Government, but is it?  Are the events taking place in this country at the moment the fruits of strong Government? Are they not the fruits of the weakest Government we have ever had in this country?  A Government with a majority of one would be better. Governments should not be strong; they should be good.  Citizens nowadays do not know where they are or what is going to happen to them.  No citizen of this country to-day knows what is going to come out of the present condition of affairs and that condition of affairs has been caused by the inactivity of the Government.</P>
    <P>That is the reason the young people of this country are deserting it.  I am sorry to say it but, speaking from conviction and experience, and knowing what is going on, I must say that there will be huge tracts of <Col N="2055" /> country in which there will not be a solitary living being.  They will be as deserted as in the days before Cromwell and Queen Elizabeth's troops came here.  The tragedy is that they will not be so deserted due to any action of a foreign Government but due to the action of a Government of our own, elected by our own people, a Government returned with a sweeping majority, a Government that was to do this, that and the other thing.  They have done so little and the people have become so disillusioned by their conduct and their broken promises that they are flying from the country.  I have lived, and worked, and hoped in this House that under a native Government our people would excel those of any other country.</P>
    <P>I am sorry, but I cannot avoid thinking that the real purpose of this Bill is to eliminate one Party, not a group of small Parties, and if that be its purpose, there can be nothing more inane.  That is the very course that will add impetus to the drive of these men.  Have they no support in the country?  A band of them have broken loose and none of them has been arrested.  What is the implication of that?  Is it not that the community is in sympathy with them? Why has none of them been arrested? Do we not remember conditions like that existing in this country before? Did we not see that condition in the Sinn Féin days, through the Land League days, and through the days of the Young Ireland Movement? It is exactly the same picture to-day and we are sitting here as if in a home for imbeciles, talking as if everything in the garden was lovely, as if the roses were in bloom, and as if this situation did not exist at all. We had better sit up and take notice.</P>
    <P>The Government swept into office in a land-side victory and it is said that could not have happened under the direct vote.  Anybody who is old enough in this House can throw his mind back over the political history of the past 50 or 60 years in Britain, and if some here are not old enough to do that I am sure they have plenty of friends outside who can tell them <Col N="2056" /> about it.  Do you not remember the Khaki Election of 1903, after the Boer War, when the Liberal Government swept into office?  They were in office until 1906 and then they were swept from office again.  Even the great Arthur Balfour, that brilliant Englishman, at times friendly to this country, at times unfriendly&mdash;he did good things for it but at one time he threatened, when things were not going so well so far as he was concerned as administrator of this country, that the resources of civilisation were not yet exhausted&mdash;lost his seat in Manchester under the direct vote system.</P>
    <P>There are Deputies sitting here to-day who say that when P.R. is abolished we will get strong Government. They have been saying that for the past fortnight, and they are supposed to be educated men.  Did they come in here with blinkers on?  Were they born yesterday?  Do they think we all came in with the last load of straw?  Is it not disgusting that representing decent people, hard-working people, we should have to listen to this sort of thing for a fortnight instead of dealing with the affairs of those people whom we represent?</P>
    <P>It is said the direct vote system will give us strong Government but what follows from that?  I have been associated with politics for the past 60 years and I have never yet seen a Government that got a sweeping majority that was worth tuppence, and was not swept out of office at the next election. That sort of talk is pulling the wool over people's eyes.  Because the people have no experience of that system, they may think they are being told the truth. It is not true.  Nothing could be more untrue.</P>
    <P>You can pass this Bill; you can get direct voting, but the same things will happen under it as happened under P.R.  I have always been an Irish Nationalist, but not in its narrow sense.  I am an Irish Nationalist in its broadest sense, and I do not want to say things which might embitter matters with reference to what has been said about bringing Protestants down here.  It was said here to-night, by a Deputy from my own constituency, that the reason why the Protestants of Ulster would not come in here was that we have unstable <Col N="2057" /> Government, because of P.R.  Was there ever such a futile statement made anywhere?  I could tell that Deputy a few things, but I will not because I do not want to embitter matters.  I believe in living in peace with my people, whether Protestant, Catholic, Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil or anything else, and I am not going to break that practice.  That is a faith with me and I will keep it.  The Protestants of Ulster will not come in here because of P.R.&mdash;imagine saying that to my fellow Protestant citizens! That is not the reason why this Bill has been introduced&mdash;it is not the true reason.</P>
    <P>Pass this Bill&mdash;go home and you have a victory.  The House completely ignores this Bill; it does not know what it is about and it cares less.  What does the woman with a family care about this Bill?  All she is concerned with is the securing of something that will keep herself and her children until Christmas.  She is concerned only with the price of flour being 6/- a stone and butter 4/4 a lb.  That is the P.R. about which she is concerned, and what is the House doing about that?  It has spent a fortnight or three weeks discussing this Bill and has not concerned itself with the welfare of the people at this period of the year.</P>
    <P>The House has brought itself into contempt, and the time spent debating this Bill will bring the House into greater contempt.  It will drive the young people of the country into Sinn Féin and let no one make any mistake about that.  What hope have the young people when they see the conduct and behaviour of this House?  What has this House done since the last election to improve their condition?  For what have fathers and mothers sacrificed themselves trying to educate their children?  Is there a Deputy who could get six jobs for six young boys who have left school?  If there is, let him put up his hand.  There is no reply.</P>
    <P>It was stated that the direct vote would result in a better type of representative in this House.  I consider that an insult to the Irish nation and people.  Irish representatives are able to take their place among the politicians <Col N="2058" /> and statesmen of the world.  This House represents a clear cross-section of the people.  How did they get there? They were proposed at conventions and while they may be wrong sometimes, in the main, the results have been quite good.  The Deputies elected to this House represents a good cross-section of our people.  I say that honestly and if I went out of this House to-morrow, I would say the same thing.  I have friends in every Party in this House.  To suggest that a better type of representative would result from the adoption of the straight vote is a gross insult to the people in this House and to the people who sent them here&mdash;the Irish electorate.  I am conceited enough to think that members of this House could take their place among the statesmen of the world.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have indicated, I protest against this Bill.  I am convinced that its real purpose is to sidetrack the people to whom I have referred and who are not represented in this House.  They are fundamentally wrong.  I tell them that they will never conquer Ulster by force.  I stated here before, when there was a challenge in this House to use poison gas, I would defy them to do it.</P>
    <P>Is it the purpose of the Bill to drive the people out of this House into a body which is illegal, which is unlawful and which has as its purpose the overthrowing of the established order of things in this State?  Is that the motive behind this Bill?  Does anybody ask himself whether that is so?  Is there any other obvious reason for it?</P>
    <P>The founders of this State adopted P.R.  The Government at the time of the Treaty continued it and the Taoiseach, when producing his testament to the Irish people, embodied it in the Constitution of 1937.  Was the Taoiseach of age then?  Had he got his milk teeth?  Was he hanging on to the apron strings of those who nurtured him?  The Constitution was to be the Charter of the Irish people for all time.  He solemnly inserted P.R. in it and boasted because he did so. He referred to the blessing it was. What happened since?  I suggest that <Col N="2059" /> there is something ulterior in it, and I ask this House to reject the measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill first came before the House, it was opposed and I did not vote on the resulting division.  The reason for that inaction on my part was that, from the time it was first mentioned that such a proposal was likely to come forward, it was obvious to me that, under the Constitution, the people would have to decide and I could not feel that I could vote against a Bill which would require the consent of the people to become law; nor did I wish to vote in favour of the Bill without first of all having heard the arguments for and against, and having had the opportunity to express my opinions.</P>
      <P>I can say that those who opposed the Bill on its introduction probably have a case.  For myself, neither then nor since have I heard any argument which would convince me that the people should not have the opportunity to decide such a question.  The proposition that the time is not opportune and the much worse proposition that the people would not know what the issues really were did not seem to me to be valid arguments against the people being asked their opinion.  As far as referenda are concerned, I think this instrument for finding the people's opinion might have been used on other occasions to great advantage, possibly not always merely to secure what might have been obvious was general opinion but as a means of discovering just how many people did not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I come to the Bill itself, there is one point I should like to mention. There has been a fair amount of reference to a particular minority, and, as I intend to refer to the minority which I consider I represent, I feel I should make it clear to the House just what I conceive that minority to be.  I admit it is reasonably understandable in this country that there should be some confusion of thought about this point, but I do agree with Deputy Booth in that, first of all, it is most undesirable that it should be in anyone's mind that the religious minority in this country require political representation and, <Col N="2060" /> secondly, I agree with him that to consider that the religious minority and the political minority are completely coterminous&mdash;it is the only word I can think of&mdash;is very wrong.</P>
    <P>I should qualify that in some respects.  For historical reasons I do not think there is any doubt that, in the three Ulster counties the religious minority, and the political minority to which I want to refer, are almost identical.  The political minority to which I referred is one for which, in present circumstances, it is difficult to find a name.  It used to be called &ldquo;Unionist&rdquo; but that is a term which I think could not now be applied.  I doubt if anybody in Ireland, north or south of the Border, would want Unionism in its old sense, say pre-1922, of wanting one Parliament for the British Isles at Westminster.  The reasons might not be the same on both sides of the Border but by and large it is probably true.  But there is a political minority here which believes that we should not have left the British Commonwealth.  That is the political minority which I consider I represent.</P>
    <P>As I said, as a hard matter of historical fact, it is probably true that in my constituency the religious minority and this political minority are the same but as you go south that becomes less and less true.  There are many people in the South of Ireland of my religious persuasion who are, and have been for generations, convinced Republicans.  I think it is also true that there are many people in the South of Ireland who are members of the religious majority and who agree with my minority views.</P>
    <P>I mention this because probably I shall have occasion to refer to the minority I represent and I want to make it clear that I am talking about that political minority when talking about my minority.  As I said already, I agree with Deputy Booth that it is an understandable point of view, in a general way, that there is an association between this political and religious minority.  It is not really so, although I admit that historically it is to some degree understandable but I do think <Col N="2061" /> that people would be better to get away from that idea.</P>
    <P>To come now to the Bill.  First of all there is this vexed question of representation. I think that an undue amount of weight is attached to the necessity for representation of views and the sort of general view that when people come in here they are representatives. For instance, in regard to myself, I am elected by about 6,000 voters.  We have some common denominator, some common factor, but among those 6,000 voters there are businessmen, farmers, farm labourers and professional people.  Once the subject that happens to be under discussion in this House ceases to be one to which this common factor of a political outlook on a particular point of view would apply, do I cease to be a representative?  Of course I do to some degree.</P>
    <P>I think undue weight is laid in this House on the subject of the members being representative.  I have always held strong views on that.  It is so easy to slip from the word &ldquo;representative&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;delegate&rdquo; and I think that, by and large, in the minds of too many Deputies is the feeling that they are delegates.  If that is so then on every question that arises they should go back and ask the people who voted for them whether they think alike on that subject.  My own view on Parliament is that that line of approach is disastrous and should not be followed. I do not think it is a logical assumption that when I come in here, representing 6,000 people, I can represent those 6,000 voters equally on every subject which comes up for discussion.</P>
    <P>There is another point about this question of P.R.  The theory of it sounds very well but in practice so many other factors come in that they seem to me to leave the theory very far behind the practice.  For instance, it is not sufficient that a minority should have a certain strength in the country, a geographical angle comes in as well. With the country now more or less divided into three member constituencies that tendency, if this present proposal is not accepted by the people, will increase.  The plain fact is it is possible to have a minority of 15 or <Col N="2062" /> 20 per cent., evenly distributed throughout the country, who could not get one representative into the House, whereas a two per cent. minority of the entire country, if it happened to be situated inside the bounds of one constituency, can get a representative in.</P>
    <P>The theory of P.R., looking at the country as a whole, depends on a good deal of codology.  I admit that some nearer approach to direct P.R. of various shades of thought might be obtained within the bounds of the present system by making constituencies larger and allowing more members per constituency.  By doing that you will give the possibility of representation to minorities.  How big must a minority be to require representation in the national Parliament? Is it to be one to 147, which appears to be the logical thing?  If it is, there is only one way and that is to make the country one constituency which I do not think anybody would consider a feasible thing to do, but logically, under P.R. it is the only way to secure in a House of 147, that every 147th of opinion be represented.</P>
    <P>Once you move from that, you become more and more illogical and when you come down to the three member constituency I cannot see very much left of P.R., so called, at all.  As I say, to get into this House in the three member constituency, supposing your point of view is different from that of the other people in the constituency, you require a 25 per cent. minority in that constituency.</P>
    <P>It sounds very well to talk about P.R. but personally I do not think we have it at the moment.  Who is to blame for that?  I do not propose to discuss it.  It does not seem to me to matter.  The plain fact is, we pretend we have P.R. when in fact we have not.  It is obvious that not only must there be a considerable minority to get a representative into the House at all but that it must be geographically well situated, so that from that point of view alone I am inclined to sheer away from the present system because it appears, on paper, to be doing something which in fact it does not.  Apart from that consideration altogether, just what are the advantages of multi-member constituencies?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2063" /> I was not a member of this House for more than four or five years when I began to realise that there were grave defects, and, I believe, parliamentary defects, which sprang from the system of multi-member constituencies&mdash;for one thing, the size of the constituencies.  The bigger the constituency, the more difficult it is for an individual Deputy to give real attention to those matters which are of particular interest to his constituents. I admit that problem is more pressing for an Independent Deputy than it is for a Party member, but it is a very real difficulty.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of discussion here, and even more particularly in the correspondence columns of the Press, on the subject of the closeness of a member to his constituents in single and multi-member constituencies. It would be illogical to talk about the parallels drawn between what would happen here and what does happen in Great Britain, because the proposed constituencies here are very much smaller than the constituencies in Great Britain are.  Some members, I am afraid, have been making abstruse calculations as to what might happen under this system, as to the number of voters who would, in fact, turn out in the constituencies. They based their calculations on 20,000 voters.  Nobody mentioned it, but on that assumption, I presume that the age at which one can vote is to be reduced from 21 to one, if constituencies are to be limited to 20,000 or 30,000 inhabitants.  How, in constituencies of that size, there could be 20,000 voters, I have not yet worked out.  The size of the constituencies is a very important matter but constituencies of the size which are suggested in this Bill appear to me to be something which would be of very great benefit to whomever sits to represent them.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested, for instance, by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, who, if I may say so, made one of the few reasoned speeches against the Bill I either heard or read, that the present system gives voters a better choice within the Party they favour.  There <Col N="2064" /> is, I think, something to be said for that but what interested me was that it seemed to me to be clear from the argument put forward by the Deputy that he was favouring a point of view which I know is common both inside and outside this House, that is, that many people here and outside look upon members of this House as individuals elected to protect the rights of individuals against the State, rather than as members of a legislature.</P>
    <P>The only word I can think of for that is one that has a bad flavour attached to it, that is, &ldquo;carpetbagging&rdquo;. If I use that word, I do not mean it in any insulting way but everyone will know it in relation to this particular point of view that the most essential function of a Deputy is to make sure that Mrs. O'Reilly gets her old age pension when she comes to the right age for it.  If I may digress, a great deal of codology goes on so far as that type of representation by members of this House is concerned.</P>
    <P>My own experience in the past 15 years has been that, while there are undoubtedly hard cases that turn up in respect of old age pensions, or such matters, the vast majority of the people would get the things to which they are entitled without the intervention of a Deputy.  In my view, Deputies themselves have encouraged that opinion among the people, that they are an essential link in the chain.  This point of view, that people are elected here primarily to make sure that individuals receive their rights, is one which, I think, is encouraged by the system of multi-member constituencies.  Inside all constituencies, there is a fair amount of trying to out-do the other fellow who represents the same constituency. It is a bad thing for a Parliament to be based on that idea.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins also referred to the system in Great Britain by which, under the single member constituency system, there are many&mdash;about 80 per cent., I think he said&mdash;safe Party men who sit in Parliament but about whom no one in the constituency knows very much.  They voted for them because they were good safe Party men.  I do not think that is true, to begin with.  Deputy <Col N="2065" /> O'Higgins is quite wrong in that respect.  The British electorate is not nearly as interested in this pure Party outlook as we, unfortunately, are in this country.  Members over there have to work very hard and I should have thought it was generally accepted that they are more inclined in the United Kingdom to switch from one Party to another than we are here. We are very much inclined, too much inclined, I think, to stick by the Party and not allow other considerations to come in.</P>
    <P>I have been directly involved in a number of elections, and one of the things that is continually cropping up is this business of: &ldquo;Well, now, we are not going to let the Party down&rdquo;. A general appeal to Party fervour appears to me to be quite common here and I doubt very much if we have really as big a floating vote as they have in the United Kingdom, so I do not think Deputy O'Higgins is quite right in that respect.</P>
    <P>There is one point which I feel very strongly about.  We have neglected here, or failed to make use of, Parliamentary Committees, to the extent to which I should like to see them used.  The business of the State is becoming more and more involved as time goes on, and Parliament has had to give up to Ministers, functions which I am sure Parliament would have preferred to keep to itself. The modern State is such a complex affair that Parliament, unless it sat 24 hours a day seven days a week for 52 weeks a year, would never get through the mass of detail, so that we have had to allow a good deal of legislation by Ministerial Order.  A safeguard against that would be strong parliamentary committees.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, multi-member constituencies react against good parliamentary committees.  I admit it is a matter of opinion, but so far as I can read what happens in the United Kingdom, the great strength of their very excellent parliamentary committees is the good, safe, backbencher who, in a safe constituency, can devote a considerable amount of time and work to the functions of those <Col N="2066" /> committees because he is in a safe seat.</P>
    <P>The great trouble about committee work, of course, is that there is no publicity attached to it, and I think Deputies here&mdash;and very sensibly&mdash; are inclined to fight shy of committees, because, while they are engaging themselves in committee work, the other representatives of the same constituency are busy cutting the ground from under their feet at home and in this House, which it is very easy to do. I do not know whether everyone has thought this out consciously, but I myself feel, and have felt for some years, that at the back of their minds when it comes to committee work there is this feeling that it is rather unrewarding from the publicity point of view.  I think that is a great pity and there is a great deal that could be done.  I am talking not only about speed but about efficiency in the work of parliamentary committees.  If there is to be efficiency it means more than just turning up at the meeting and making an odd remark.  It means a good deal of spade work behind the scenes which takes up time.</P>
    <P>Personally, I am satisfied that the great strength of the system in West-minister is the good, safe backbencher. Speaking of a member of Parliament, whatever my political views may be, I prefer a parliamentarian all the time.  Anything we can do to ensure a better parliamentary system is very important.</P>
    <P>Other things happen which arise from multi-member constituencies. For instance there is the sort of stooge candidate.  The unfortunate fellow is landed in as a second or third or fourth string, as the case may be, because the main candidate comes from one end of the constituency.  The Party managers recognise that local interest is a very important thing.  Therefore, somebody has to be put up at the other end of the constituency, not that anyone thinks he will be elected but in order to draw out the local votes.  He will die in the process but his preferences will go to the No. 1 candidate of the Party&mdash;and once one Party does it certainly one other Party is bound to follow one other Party is bound to follow suit.  How the Parties continue to find these unfortunate people is <Col N="2067" /> something that has never failed to surprise me.  It just shows what Party loyalty can mean.  There is also this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is the same danger because the constituency will be smaller.  There will be no question of finding somebody 40 miles away.  Any Party with any reasonable sort of general appeal can usually, in the middle of a small constituency, find somebody of general appeal.  These unfortunate stooges will not have to be found and I think that will be a good job.</P>
      <P>There is also the plain fact that people do get in here who may not have a great knowledge of parliamentary affairs and who may not have a great knowledge of national affairs but they get dragged in on the triumphant heels of some popular personality. This is a difficult subject to dwell on because it is almost implied criticism of members of this House.  I would be far from wanting to do that.  I admit it could work the other way.  I can think of one most useful members of this House who gets in, dragged on the heels of somebody who is no use in the House at all.  No names, no pack drill. What this has to do with the niceties of P.R., I have not heard anybody explain and I do not think, by and large, it is any great help to the country.</P>
      <P>I think, more or less, the Parties think that they find good candidates&mdash; and when I say &ldquo;good candidates&rdquo; I do not want to suggest that the personnel of the present Dáil are not good representative of the people.  They are probably good representatives of the people but, with my view of Parliament, I am not prepared to admit that a good representative of the people is a good Parliamentarian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2068" /> I think that a single-member constitunecy would tend to bring into the national Parliament people with a better outlook.  It has been argued here that under single-member constituencies by the straight vote a great part of the electorate would be disfranchised. From the point of view of purity of language, I do not quite see it.  The people, presumably, would have voted.  They would hardly be disfranchised.  They may be unrepresented but not disfranchised.</P>
    <P>The theory behind this argument appears to be that if a Fianna Fáil Deputy is elected for the constituency, Fine Gael supporters are now left with nobody to whom they can tell their woes about old age pensions, and so on.  If that is the experience of Deputies it is very strange to me.  I have found it almost invariable that when I go to a Department on behalf of a constituent I find there are letters or representations of some form from the other members of my constituency. Certainly where it is a case of real hardship, nobody I have ever come across has had much hesitation in approaching all the Deputies for the constituency&mdash;possibly even assuring each of them that they are life-long supporters.  However, whether or not they go to that length I have not found that people are at all shy about approaching Deputies of another Party.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that everybody who did not vote for the successful candidate will now be left out in the cold is a very bad impression to give.  If there are people with that point of view then the sooner they are disabused of it the better for the country. One of the most disastrous things about the present set-up in this country is that what seemed to me to be dead ashes get warmed into fire and that people can be persuaded that because somebody is in a different Party he is the next thing to the Devil incarnate and is not to be approached.  That is a disaster, nationally.  If single-member constituencies will help to do away with that outlook then it is only another reason why single-member constituencies should be brought in.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that it is <Col N="2069" /> all right to say and possibly to prove to my own satisfaction that single member constituencies would give a good Parliament but it is possible, with single member constituencies, to have the election by means of a transferable vote as does happen at present when there is a by-election.  It has been argued here that the straight vote in three-or four- or five-corner fights can result in the successful candidate merely representing a minority and that is very true.  But there is a good deal of loose thinking about this point. Early in the debate&mdash;it seems a long time ago now&mdash;Deputy Blowick referred to what could happen in a case where 12,001 people were voting.  If one candidate gets 4,001 votes and the other two candidates get 4,000 votes each he said it was a ridiculous situation that the fellow with 4,001 votes gets in and the other 8,000 people are disfranchised.  At first glance, this does look a bit odd but it is not necessarily odder than what happens <Col N="2070" /> now.  Let us take this particular case as it has been given here against the Bill.  There are now two candidates with 4,000 votes each.  One of them has to be eliminated.  The first thing they do is to decided, by drawing out of a hat, which is eliminated.  The second preferences of those 4,000 people who voted for the eliminated candidate now assume the same value as the original first preferences of the other 8,001 people.  That appears to me neither mathematically nor logically very sensible.</P>
