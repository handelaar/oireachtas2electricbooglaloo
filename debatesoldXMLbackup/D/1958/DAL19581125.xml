    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach how selection boards under the auspices of the Local Appointments Commission are constituted; whether the panel of personnel of such selection boards is revised from time to time and, if so, the date of last revision; what scale of remuneration, fees or allowances and expenses is allowed to members for each session; and whether as a general rule the recommended applicants, as placed in order of preference by selection boards, are accepted and recommended for appointments by the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (thar cheann an Taoisigh) Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (thar cheann an Taoisigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>These boards, although popularly known as selection boards, are, in fact, and are called by the Local Appointments Commissioners, interview boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each board is constituted by the commissioners, personally, from a list of names submitted to them by the secretary of the commission.  The choice of professional and technical experts depends on the kind of post to be filled.  There is a lay chairman. The names put before the commissioners are selected from panels compiled over many years from membership of the various professional bodies, learned societies, university staffs, serving and retired public officials, business people and other persons of <Col N="752" /> standing throughout the State.  The panels are constantly being reviewed, but there is no formal revision at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>Membership of an interview board is honorary and the only expenses allowed are the travelling and subsistence expenses, if any, incurred in attending the sessions of the board.</P>
    <P>Each interview board is asked to advise the commissioners as to the qualifications of the candidates in respect of such matters as training, experience and suitability and to place in order of merit, in those respects, the candidates whom it considers to be qualified.</P>
    <P>In addition to the qualifications on which the interview board advises, the commissioners have regard to candidates' knowledge of Irish.  Preferences or extra marks are awarded for such knowledge in accordance with certain well-defined rules.  These preferences or extra marks may, and sometimes do, result in the commissioners' selecting, for recommendation to the local authority concerned, a candidate other than the candidate whom the interview board placed first.  Prospective candidates are made aware of this possibility. Even where the award of these preferences or extra marks produces no change in the order of merit in which the interview board has placed the candidates, the candidate placed first may subsequently decide not to proceed with his candidature, or may prefer another post of which he has the choice or may fail to satisfy the commissioners that he possesses the prescribed qualifications in respect of age, health or character.  Subject to the exceptions I have indicated, it is the practice of the commissioners to select for recommendation to the local authority the candidate whom the interview board has placed first in order of merit.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail myself of this opportunity of paying tribute to the invaluable public service given by the members of these interview boards. This service is given, as I have said, without remuneration or recompense and often at much personal inconvenience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether in view of the rising trend of unemployment and emigration he will state what plans the Government have to offset this situation by productive schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>The available statistical evidence does not support the premises on which the Deputy's question is based.</P>
      <P>As regards unemployment, the number of persons on the live register does not disclose a rising trend when account is taken of the effect of the annual Employment Period Orders and the normal seasonal variations; the latest available figure &mdash; that for the 15th instant &mdash; is 64,459, as compared with 65,801 on the corresponding date last year and 69,926 on the corresponding date in 1956.  It will be observed that the latest available figure for the live register shows a reduction of 5,467 compared with two years ago.  In relation to emigration, as has been frequently explained in this House, it is not possible to compile annual figures and the latest available estimates of net emigration are those for the period 1951-1956, based on the Report of the Census of Population for April, 1956.</P>
      <P>For the Government's plans in the matter, I would refer the Deputy to the White Paper entitled Programme for Economic Expansion which was laid before the Dáil on the 11th instant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received only two proposals from the Kildare County Council in regard to the provision of dispensary accommodation.  These proposals envisaged the construction of new dispensaries at Leixlip and Kilcock. Although I am not aware that the urgency of proceeding with these proposals is significantly greater than it was under our predecessors, I have, in view of the substantial improvement which has taken place in the financial position since early last year, found it possible to approve of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that the Minister knows so little about the condition of dispensaries in the County Kildare, may I ask him whether he is aware of the fact that the Kildare County Council in 1953 &mdash; the Minister might note the year &mdash; found it necessary to prepare proposals for a substantial reconstruction and renovation programme in respect of these dispensaries which were then found to be inadequate, unsuitable and as irksome as possible in the facilities provided, so far as the patients are concerned? Would the Minister make further inquiries as to what happened to this <Col N="764" /> report and see whether steps could not be taken in view of the substantial improvement in the financial position, to carry out some of the proposals then examined by the Kildare County Council?</P>

      <P>When the Deputy has finished his speech, I should like to reply to his question.  I am aware that a dispensary building programme was submitted to the Department of Health in the year 1953.  It is now almost complete and has resulted in the provision of dispensaries and doctors' residences at Johnstown Bridge, Carbury, Kilcullen, Fontstown and Droichead Nua and new dispensaries at Ballymore-Eustace and Naas. I am sorry if the Deputy, who was a member of the Government at that time, did not know what was going on.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The employment periods of 1958 were a fortnight longer than those of recent years.</P>
      <P>The question of the scope and duration of Employment Period Orders is examined afresh every year and the duration of the employment periods this year was fixed after full consideration of all the relevant factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first week of the extension of the employment periods the live register was 3,823 lower than in the corresponding week of 1957 and in the second week it was 7,356 lower.  However, not all of this reduction can be attributed to the effect of extending the duration of the Employment Period Orders.  In the week following the termination of the Employment Period Orders this year the live register was <Col N="769" /> still 2,007 lower than in the corresponding week of 1957.</P>

      <P>At the end of October, which is the normal time at which the Employment Period Orders cease to operate, there were approximately 50,000 persons registered and available for employment in the exchanges. Why then was it desirable or necessary for the Government to prevent other people from registering on the basis that there was an abundance of work available when those 50,000 people at the exchanges could not get that work?  Am I right in assuming that the period was extended by a fortnight to save money and to rig the figures at the employment exchanges?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare why girls who were employed in McDevitt's Knitting Factory, at Meenbanid, County Donegal, and who paid employment contributions at the rate of 4/1 per week, have now for the first time been informed that their work has been classified as that of outworkers, their contributions and weekly benefit being correspondingly reduced; and if this change of policy will apply to all girls and other employees of factories in the Gaeltacht from now forth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of a claim for unemployment benefit made by an insured woman, a question arose as to the rate of employment contributions which were properly payable under the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 <Col N="772" /> and 1956, in respect of her employment.</P>
      <P>Following exhaustive inquiries it transpired that she had been employed as a glove knitter by Messrs. McDevitt and Company Limited, Glenties, in the private dwelling-house of their agent at Meenbanid, the premises not being under the control or management of that firm.  Accordingly it was decided by a deciding officer that her employment was that of an outworker as described in paragraph 7 of Part I of the First Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and that a special rate of employment contribution, not reckonable for unemployment benefit, was payable in respect of the employment.  She lodged an appeal which is receiving urgent attention.</P>
      <P>There has been no change of policy since the Social Welfare Act, 1952, came into force in relation to the insurance of persons employed as outworkers.  The Deputy will realise that the employment to which his question relates differs radically from employment in a recognised factory where the employees work in their employers' premises under regular supervision and control.</P>

Further, is it not a fact that, prior to this year, those girls were paid unemployment benefit at the higher rate and contributed a higher rate than has now been determined by the Department? In view of the fact that these girls are employed in a building under the supervision of the employers' agent, will the Parliamentary Secretary reconsider the decision and grant them the higher benefit to which they are entitled?</P>

      <P>The expenses immediately associated with a draw, namely those relating to preparing for and holding the draw, distributing the prizes and dealing with the withdrawals which follow a draw, amount to £1,000 approximately.  It is necessary, for several reasons, that a draw for prizes be followed by an issue of bonds to the public.  The advantage of the publicity aroused by the draw would otherwise be lost.  A fresh issue attracts new money to offset the withdrawals which occur after every draw and prize winners are enabled to reinvest their winnings if they so wish. The cost of an issue, including, advertising, printing and commission, is approximately £14,000 and would be much the same whether issues were held twice a year or more frequently.</P>

While progress has been made on the designing of a drainage scheme, it will be some months yet before a report can be furnished for consideration as to whether an economic scheme is possible.  If, as I hope, such a scheme emerges, time will be needed for compliance with the statutory requirements, and there is no prospect that drainage works can be started before the date mentioned in the question.</P>

Negotiations for the purchase of seven other areas totalling 285 acres are in progress and there are 28 cases involving a total of 510 acres which have been inspected but about which no decision in regard to acquisition has yet been reached.</P>
      <P>The type of cutaway offered to the Forestry Division in the Donadea area is generally suitable for planting; similar areas have already been successfully planted elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Facilities for the purchase of new sea fishing boats through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will be made more attractive in three ways from the 1st April, 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> Firstly, the cost of the boats will be reduced by 15 per cent. by means of grants from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the rate of interest payable by hire purchasers will be reduced by Exchequer subvention to 4 per cent.; the current interest rate is 6¾ per cent.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the deposit payable by fishermen may, in exceptional cases, be reduced to 5 per cent.; the present minimum deposit is 10 per cent. of the cost.</P>
    <P>The grant and the lowest interest rate will together have the effect of reducing the repayments due by a hire purchaser by more than 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the case of a boat issued during the remainder of the present financial year, the current repayment terms will apply up to the 1st April, 1959, and the grant and reduced interest rate will be made available from that date.  The new facilities are not applicable to boats already issued.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that these facilities will lead to a substantial increase in our fishing fleet by stimulating the purchase of boats by fishermen and others who are competent to operate them successfully.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation generally to the question of the extension of the school-leaving age this seems to me to be rather a matter of providing increased educational facilities than of extending compulsorily <Col N="801" /> the age limit.  The number of pupils in the 14-16 age group in attendance at full-time courses of education has been increasing steadily year by year as the facilities have been increased.  The fact that about 60 per cent. of children in the 14-15 age group and about 48 per cent. of those in the 15-16 age group are in whole-time attendance at recognised schools is evidence of this.  The facilities are continuing to increase and with them the percentage attendance.</P>

      <P>State grants have been paid in respect of the paper <i>Inniu</i> since the financial year 1944-45 and the total amount paid from then to 31st March, 1958, is approximately £61,000.

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the last two portions of the question, the position is that grants to Irish language periodicals are payable by the Minister for Education, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  There are no general regulations governing the grant of aid to Irish language periodicals, each case being considered separately but with due regard to the need for assistance, the type of periodical, the reading public served by it and the amount of money which it is possible to provide for this purpose <Col N="803" /> annually.

      <P>I understand that the county council is now endeavouring to acquire the necessary lands for intake, reservoirs, etc.  If these cannot be obtained by agreement, it will be necessary for the council to apply for another provisional Order under a different statutory code from the Water Supplies Act, 1942, under which they obtained the water rights.  In view of my statutory position in regard to the making and confirmation of such an Order, it would not be open to me to intervene in the local negotiations at this stage.</P>

The amount shown as available for 1958-59 does not include the Main Road Upkeep grant, which has not yet been allocated, pending discussion of the provision made by the county council from their own funds for road upkeep. Pending clarification of the foregoing issue, the amounts of the main and county road improvement grants have been provisionally reduced by the amount £4,100, by which the council's provision for upkeep fell short of last year's. The figure for 1958-59 takes this reduction into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £25,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The original grant for Córas Tráchtála this year was £135,000.  The purpose of this additional sum which it is now proposed to make available is to supplement the company's allocation in the current year in support of the campaign to increase exports of whiskey to the United States of America.  In respect of the original allocation, which was intended to be applied to the institutional advertising of Irish whiskey, Córas Tráchtála Teoranta had an understanding with the distillers that they would match that amount in expenditure on their own behalf on individual brand advertising.  It is intended to extend that understanding to embrace as far as possible the additional amount now being provided.  It is, of course, essential to the success of the campaign that the institutional advertising undertaken by Córas Tráchtála Teoranta is exploited through concurrent and intensive advertising of individual brands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The volume of exports to the United States of whiskey over the past three years has shown very little change, <Col N="844" /> being almost constant at the figure of approximately 39,000 proof gallons. The more significant figure for consumption, however, shows evidence of an increasing consumer demand. According to the reports of the research agency in New York, which advise Córas Tráchtála in this regard, the consumption of Irish whiskey in the United States increased by 7.3 per cent. in the first quarter of this year although the total consumption of distilled spirits in the United States fell during the same period by 3 per cent. and, in the second quarter of this year, consumption of Irish whiskey increased by 22.1 per cent.  The distillers and Córas Tráchtála expect a further increase in demand following upon the stepped-up advertising campaign which began in September of this year.  There are good indications that the current advertising programme is successful in arousing interest which it is anticipated will benefit sales in due course and lead to a consequent increase in shipments of whiskey from here.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that whiskey shipments from this country over any given time do not reflect the level of consumption.  Increased shipments to American importers frequently lag many months behind an increase in demand at the consumer level.  This is particularly observable for Irish, as distinct from other whiskeys, because of the presence in the United States of stocks which are heavy in proportion to demand. Surplus stocks already held in the United States must move out before shippers in Ireland will benefit from increased demand.  The purpose of the advertising campaign is to achieve the speediest possible reduction in these surplus stocks as the quickest way of ensuring a continuing increase in the level of exports of Irish whiskey to the United States.  I am sure Deputies will approve generally of the purpose of this Vote, and for that reason I anticipate it will be accepted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make only one comment.  Is the Minister satisfied, with the increased demand as shown in the figures for the first <Col N="845" /> two quarters of this year, that this sum of money will be adequate to ensure, if the demand persists, it will be possible to have sufficient supplies available?  One of the criticisms which is frequently heard about exports, particularly of specialised commodities&mdash;and I think Irish whiskey comes within that category &mdash; is that, after initial quantities are supplied, when subsequent inquiries are made by potential customers it is not possible to meet the demand as quickly as the customer expects it to be met.</P>
      <P>I have often felt, and have expressed the view in this House, that while most energetic efforts are, or have been, made by Governments and State Departments to establish new industries, over a great number of years, the distilling industry has been one that has declined.  For that reason any help which can be given to expand the opportunities for its development, or at least to maintain the existing level of production and employment, is welcome.  It is an industry which provides male employment. It has a high reputation for the quality of the article produced and it uses home-grown raw materials. There are, therefore, abundant reasons why it is in the national interests that it should be fostered to the maximum extent, and the only question I would like answered is: are we satisfied, will the House be satisfied, that sufficient money will be made available, if necessary, to further the joint promotional effort of the Irish distillers and Córas Tráchtála?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of this Estimate and, indeed, I should like to see the Estimate enlarged many times, because the problem with which we have to deal is not one that can be measured in the sum of money provided for in this Estimate.  The question of our ability to export to the American market has a long history. When we could have got into the market and made lifelong friends there, during the last emergency, it was decided to restrict our exports to America so as to conserve the Irish whiskey for use on the home market, where it not only satisfied our spirituous requirements as a people but, <Col N="846" /> as well, helped to make a substantial contribution to an Exchequer which was then running into difficulties because of its inability to raise revenue with the same buoyancy as revenue can be raised in times of peace. We have paid a heavy price for that policy, and the result of that policy in the United States has been that we lost the potential of good customers that could have been built up during that period.</P>
      <P>During that same period our competitors, the Scottish distillers, were encouraged to send as much whiskey as they could to America so as to earn dollars which were essential to meet the demands of the British war effort. However, I do not think it serves any valuable purpose to-day to hold an inquest on the wisdom of what we did during the war years.  That belongs to history but, if we had the hind sight then that we have now, it might have been better, even with some deprivation of our own spirituous requirements, on the part of our own people, to send more whiskey to America to build up friends in the trade, to establish the foothold which the Scottish distillers have been able to establish in the American market.</P>
      <P>The Scottish industry realises £30,000,000 to £35,000,000 a year from its exports, as compared with approximately £250,000 which we earn here. That comparison shows we are very sadly in the rearguard when it comes to earning money on the basis of our whiskey exports.  It is essential, therefore, to get into the American market because, from the point of view of consumption of whiskey, it is the best potential market in the world. There you have a people who drink whiskey in substantial quantities.  They drink a spirit which is whiskey, or akin to whiskey and, in my view, the American market offers the best possible market for the disposal of Irish whiskey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, the old problem of whether the whiskey that is exported should be our traditional brand of whiskey or whether it should be a patent whiskey, which has been given a taste somewhat comparable to that of Scottish whiskey, and without what <Col N="847" /> the Americans say is the &ldquo;strong hangover&rdquo; with which some of them associate traditional Irish whiskey. Personally, I believe we can cater for both those markets in America, the market which will take a traditional whiskey and the market which will take a patent whiskey produced to satisfy American tastes.</P>
    <P>No matter what we export to the United States in the form of whiskey it will have to be fortified by an immense advertising campaign, and an expenditure of £25,000 on advertising in America is really a trivial expenditure. Some of the single-page advertisements in the large newspapers there cost £1,500 to £2,000, and in America the various areas are served by local papers, and the national papers are not read in all areas as they are here and in Britain.  The immensity of the task of spreading a knowledge of Irish whiskey throughout America is so great as to constitute a challenge to our ability to face up to it.  There are millions of people in America who know Irish whiskey has a great tradition and who know that connoisseurs are prepared to give it an excellent certificate, but there are also millions of people in America who do not know that Ireland produces whiskey at all. There are hundreds of thousands of drug stores and public houses in America which have never seen a bottle of Irish whiskey, and that shows the immensity of the problem confronting us.</P>
    <P>Our Irish whiskey industry is, in fact, an amazing industry when everything is considered.  It is a purely Irish industry, using almost exclusively Irish materials.  It employs a substantial number of people and the employment given by the distillers in this country is regular.  It is made employment and there has never been, to my knowledge, and serious dispute over conditions of employment or wages in the distilling industry.  Therefore, distilling deserves well of us.  It has given substantial employment.  It is a substantial consumer of home produced cereals.</P>
    <P>For these reasons alone we ought to endeavour to help the industry in every possible way.  In fact, we have never really taken any serious steps to <Col N="848" /> help the industry because the taxation on spirits has increased rapidly and is now at an all-time high level.  On comparison it will be found that our taxation on spirits is probably the highest imposed by any country in the world. So that, without tariff aid, without subsidy and despite the fact that high taxation is imposed on the Irish produce, the industry has been able to keep itself alive and relatively thriving and at the same time has been able in difficult circumstances to keep a hold on certain limited foreign markets.</P>
    <P>Of course, the export of whiskey could be of immense benefit not only to the national economy but could serve in a useful way to advertise the products of Ireland throughout the world.  Therefore, I think there will be a fund of goodwill in all parts of the House for any proposal calculated to advertise Irish whiskey abroad and particularly in the American market. A short time ago I discussed with an American gentleman who has given substantial proof of his interest in and sympathy towards the Irish distilling industry the best methods by which Irish whiskey could be sold in America.  I asked him what his views were on the possibility of breaking into the American market in a fairly substantial way and in a manner that held out some hope that we would ultimately establish a pretty substantial foothold in that market.</P>
    <P>He said that the publicity in recent years for Irish whiskey had now reached the stage in which we had beaten down the hostility towards Irish whiskey but that we had not yet succeeded in making it a popular beverage in America, that there still was an enormous amount of work to be done in that field.  He said that advertising was one of the best means of helping to sell our whiskey, but in his view it was necessary that individual representatives of standing and energy should be appointed to maintain contact with the American distilling companies and wholesale houses to induce them to push out Irish whiskey for sale through their wholesalers and, through them, to the retailers. He said that mere advertising in itself would not bring about the desired impetus to sales which was desired.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> There is another matter which shows how necessary it is to publicise the quality of Irish whiskey and the re-known it has achieved among connoisseurs. At many Irish functions in America you would not see Irish whiskey served at all or, if you did, it would be a negligible proportion of the total offered and consumed at a banquet. There should be an enormous potential goodwill for Irish whiskey in America.  There are 20,000,000 people of Irish birth or extraction there.  We ought to have some special heart-call to them to help the motherland by buying Irish whiskey if they want to drink whiskey at all.  How to tap that goodwill has to be thought out in such a way that we shall be able to indent on that potential patronage for the sales of Irish whiskey in America.</P>
    <P>Many Irish organisations are easily contacted.  Especially along the eastern coast of America, there are many people of Irish birth or extraction. Some serious effort ought to be made to use these organisations as a nucleus for popularising Irish whiskey, not merely at their own functions but at all other functions they attend or over which they wield some influence. If we are merely to publish advertisements and then sit back to see the effect on the potential consumer, I am afraid we shall be disappointed.</P>
    <P>I do not think advertising alone &mdash; especially the small type of advertising we can do on £25,000 augmented by another £25,000 from the distillers &mdash; is likely to bring us any substantial or impressive results.  Indeed, these figures of increased consumption of Irish whiskey in America which the Minister used are really statistically insignificant, especially when you remember that in the long run these figures are really very little more than guesses and do not at all purport to rest on any scientific basis of accuracy. What we have got to do in the American market in particular is to appoint live, active representatives and to make contacts with all those who can influence the sales and marketing of Irish whiskey.  That advice comes to me from persons associated with the third largest distillery in the United States.  They have been able to make an outstanding success of <Col N="850" /> their own business and they ought to know how to market profitably the products of other countries.</P>
    <P>However, on the general question, I fully support the Estimate.  In this matter we have to cast our bread on the waters in the hope that better supplies will come back, but we have got to do it in a two-pronged way.  We have got to advertise as extensively as our resources permit in a market that is the best in the world from the point of view of its potential demand for Irish whiskey, but that advertising must be supplemented by an energetic, dynamic personal drive in all directions by persons who are equipped to carry out successfully a drive of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week a question was put down in the Dáil by Deputy Burke in connection with the sales of Irish whiskey to America.  To my amazement I read in the <i>Irish Press</i> the following day that the consumption of Irish whiskey in America had gone up and that a great future lay ahead of Irish distillers there.  I felt there was something rather peculiar about the reply given in the House on that occasion, so I drafted a question, which was answered to-day, in connection with this very important commodity and its sale in America.  The Minister has sought to suggest through so-called agents in America that the consumption of Irish whiskey there is on the increase, while the figures for the actual exports of Irish whiskey show a reduction.  The attempt is made to suggest that, even though our exports may go down in one year, as they are going down at the moment, that in itself is no harm, that it is quite possible that there are large stocks of our whiskey on hand in America and that it is out of those stocks that the alleged increased consumption is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the case, let us look at the position of whiskey.  For the first nine months of this year the Scottish distillers had an all-time record of exports to America, while the value of Irish whiskey exported dropped from £268,933 in the first nine months of last year to £257,319 for the first nine <Col N="851" /> months of the current year.  It is on those facts we must go and not on the wishful thinking of agents in America.</P>
    <P>This whole question was discussed in the House on a number of occasions. The present Tánaiste was in opposition when a motion in connection with the distillery industry received thorough consideration in the House.  At that time the then Tánaiste, Deputy Norton, specifically guaranteed that if the distillers did not wake up and do their duty in regard to the expansion of the whiskey industry he would take the steps I recommended in this House namely, nationalise.</P>
    <P>Since 1954 to the present time the actual increase in the export of Irish whiskey has been negligible.  We were told that an immense drive was under way to popularise a number of blended whiskeys &mdash; new products &mdash; in the American market.  I tried in this House by way of Parliamentary Questions to extract from the Minister what were the exact sales of blended whiskey in America and a reply would not be given.  Is there any reason why the House and the country cannot be told what the actual export value of the blended whiskey is each year, having regard to the fact that the country, the public and the taxpayers are now going to subsidise the Irish distillers?</P>
    <P>When the blended whiskeys went on the American market, it was conveyed to me by the representatives of the particular company that these blended whiskeys would not for at least ten to 15 years, if ever, be made available on the home market; that their entire supplies would be utilised for and would be necessary to supply the demand in America.  What is the position?  You can visit any country &ldquo;pub&rdquo; and you will find the shelves lined with whiskeys alleged to suit the American market.  We must face the facts.  How is it that this blended whiskey is available all over the country when we were assured that it was for the export market?</P>
    <P>Some Deputies suggested that during the war years the wrong policy was pursued by the Government.  I am not trying to blame any particular Government for this at the moment.  I <Col N="852" /> blame the distilling industry and I challenge contradiction when I say that the year prohibition was repealed in America the Irish distillers were requested to come into the American market.  They got first preference in the American market for the sale of Irish whiskey.</P>
    <P>The answer of the two major distilleries at the time was that they were not interested in the American market. They were not interested in the export trade.  They were only interested in the home market.  The result was that the Scots went into the American market. Since 1932 they have gradually built up their sales to the tune of £45,000,000 worth of whiskey.  When we find that the over-all consumption of spirits in America is over £600,000,000 we can see the opening that is there or should be there for the sale of Irish whiskey. When we see that Scotch whiskey represents a little over 5 per cent. of the total consumption in America, surely there is room, if our distillers are doing their duty, to move in and get another 5 per cent.?</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton pointed out how important this industry can be.  I have said a thousand times already that it could be of far greater importance than the cattle trade if it were properly developed.  What have we done?  We have left the distilling industry in the hands of the most conservative people who, over the years, for the past 80 years, when they got an opportunity, utilised for the whiskey itself raw materials from other countries if they could get them cheaper than those produced in Ireland.  They are on record for that.  They maintained on many occasions that the raw materials, rye, oats, and barley, came from Scotland and elsewhere rather than from crops grown in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There can be no denying the fact that these people have failed over the years to expand this important industry. What are we doing now?  We come into this House and we are going to give £25,000 to Córas Tráchtála to help the distillers sell their individual blends in America.  Deputy Norton and other Deputies will recollect that American experts gave it as their opinion that if Irish whiskey, either of <Col N="853" /> the blended type or the old pot-still type, were to be a success in America it would be necessary for the distillers to organise and pool their resources; that instead of each of them working in haphazard fashion on the various parts of the American coast they should combine to produce a standard whiskey for that market and utilise the American distributive trade.  No effort has been made to do that.</P>
    <P>The only way we are giving publicity at the moment to the limited sales of Irish whiskey in America is to hold dinner parties, cocktail parties and to invite people from this country to meet Pressmen in New York, Boston and San Francisco, drink a few bottles and have sore heads and that is the end of it.  There was no attempt made by our distillers to move in and offer the whiskey to any particular distributor there many of whom had to sell £50,000,000 to £150,000,000 worth of liquor throughout the States.  No effort was ever made to deal with those people.</P>
    <P>Instead of that we waste money every few months on publicity stunts. There is no long-term plan proposed that will hold what we have in the American market and build therefrom. The £25,000 or £50,000 spent on whiskey in America is not even the proverbial drop in the ocean as far as a publicity campaign is concerned. The Scotch distillers spend more money on publicity than we would get for the entire sales of our whiskey to America.</P>
    <P>I am in an awkward position in this matter because I want to see this trade develop but I am convinced we are going the wrong way about it.  Every time this House gives a little help to the distillers we are allowing them to hang on to the old ways.  They will make no real effort to do their duty and create any real expansion in this industry.  The Minister should send for the distillers and tell them to pool their whiskey resources, and get over here from America, if necessary, some chemical experts who will in conjunction with scientists and chemists in the distilleries here produce a type of whiskey that will suit the American palate.  In addition, I think whiskey <Col N="854" /> for export should have the approval of a bureau of standards and be sold in conjunction with some of the large distributing interests in America on a profit basis to the particular distributing firms.  We should hand over the sales to one of these large companies in operation in America. That can be done.  The offer was made to Government Departments here and of course it was turned down because the distillers refused to sink their individual interests.  They want to stay in their own old groove and they refuse to co-operate.  When they refuse to co-operate in a major issue like this, is it right for us to ask the general public to subsidise these distillers who will not do their duty?</P>
    <P>The question of protecting even the type of whiskey that is going out is neglected.  There is no means of prosecuting publicans in the United States if they sell a whiskey described as Irish whiskey but which is made, possibly in a back room, in America, whereas the Scots can deal quickly and efficiently with those people if an attempt is made to misuse the word &ldquo;Scotch&rdquo; on the bottle.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether under this measure any help is to be given with regard to the sales of whiskey in Britain.  It may be that that position will be kept dark.  Do we intend to make any provision at this stage to ensure that no whiskey will be allowed out except in bottles, and to prevent this bulk export of whiskey which is now taking place at a very young age?  It is desirable to ensure that Irish whiskey leaving here in bulk for Britain does not become portion of the ingredients for Scotch whisky.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that Irish whiskey which leaves here for Britain finds its way to America as Scotch whisky.  The portion that is used is possibly small but nevertheless Irish whiskey is a raw material for the Scotch whisky going to America.  That is a matter that should be examined.  There is no real effort made to complete in Britain and have Irish whiskey sold on its merits there.  I have not got the figures with me and I may be incorrect but my recollection is that the value of Scotch whisky sold in Ireland last year was <Col N="855" /> greater than the value of the Irish whiskey we exported.  At any rate, there is very little difference between the two sets of figures and, as far as the balance of payments is concerned, the sales of whiskey are not even doing a good day's work.</P>
    <P>If the distillers want to stick to the present arrangement why not make the Scotch whisky drinkers here pay for the export publicity campaign for the export of whiskey?  Is there anything wrong with putting another 6d. on the glass of Scotch and utilising that money for the purpose of selling Irish whiskey in America?  If anybody here feels like drinking Scotch whisky they should be charged more than they would be charged for Irish whiskey. That would be better than putting a burden on the ordinary individual in the State to subsidise the distillers.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to let us know when he is replying what is the position at the moment with regard to the effort to sell these types of blended whiskey in America.  Will he also let us know the reason why in reply to Dáil questions the Central Statistics Office cannot separate the figures and give us the figures for the sale of pot-still as distinct from those for the sale of blended whiskey.  It is not an unfair request and I think the Minister is in a position to make that information available.  In view of the fact that this House is to vote a sum of money to enable the distillers to sell this product abroad, surely the public are entitled to know what is the export value of the particular types of whiskey.  I ask him to give us that information in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to make a speech but I wish to ask two questions.  I understand this £25,000 is to be spent in combination with another £25,000 put up by the Irish distillers and that it is in connection with the advertisement of Irish whiskey in America and has nothing to do with the sales of whiskey in Britain.  Can the Minister give even a rough estimate of what other moneys have been expended by Córas Tráchtála in connection with the sale of Irish whiskey in the States?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> Secondly the Minister talked about an increase in the consumption of Irish whiskey, I think he said in the first quarter of this year, and gave that as a percentage.  What is the exact figure? What did it increase from and to what figure?  Would the Minister tell us, looking back about five years, what was the revenue derived by the distillers from the sale of the product in the States then and by what has it advanced?  Will he give us the exact figure instead of a percentage and let us know what has been the rate of increase over a number of years?  I should like a balance sheet showing what Córas Tráchtála has received from this House to spend on pushing these sales and what is the result.  I understand the result has been insignificant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much in favour of this Estimate because whiskey is one of the exports which is produced entirely from raw material here.  Not only will it give employment to those employed in distilleries but it will also be of great benefit to those who produced the raw material which is produced entirely on the land of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance in his last Budget voted £25,000 for the export of whiskey principally to America. For Deputy McQuillan's information the distillers came together as a unified body and put up another £25,000.  Am I to understand that this Supplementary Estimate is for a further £25,000? The total amount expended in the United States for the purpose of advertising and distributing Irish whiskey is £75,000.  I do not think it is anything like adequate.  In the light of circumstances and in view of the fact that this is an export which is entirely dependent on our raw materials, which is productive and which can eventually increase employment considerably in this country not only in our towns but in rural areas as well, I think we should spend far more money on advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Scottish distillers.  It may interest the House to know that the Scottish distillers spend £1,000,000 per year on <Col N="857" /> advertising their product in the United States.  When we come to regard the miserly amount of £75,000 which we spend on advertising Irish whiskey in the United States and then consider the £1,000,000 which the Scottish distillers spend every year in advertising their product, what chance has Irish whiskey against such terrific advertising of Scotch whisky all over the United States?</P>
    <P>I am assured by a representative of the distillers who is in a position to speak for the five or six distilleries that exist here in Ireland that plenty of reserves are available.  I am assured that were we to increase our exports by four times their present level there would still be sufficient to cater for the increased exports over a great many years.</P>
    <P>The Report of Córas Tráchtála shows that for the past 12 months our exports of Irish whiskey to Britain have increased to the extent of £50,000.  It says that export stocks have been sent to America.  It is not very clear how these stocks have been sent to America, under what circumstances, whether they have been sent as a donation for the purpose of advertising or to places that have stocked this whiskey and have been unable to sell it.  I am very doubtful of that.</P>
    <P>Irish whiskey is a pot-still whiskey and is able to hold its own with any other whiskey in the world.  The proof of that is simple.  Anybody will notice that people who come to live in this country and who have lived in Britain before that &mdash; we have had quite a lot of people coming in here over the past ten years who have been accustomed all their lives to drinking Scotch whiskey &mdash; will, for about their first two months in this country, look for Scotch whiskey.  However, once they get the taste for Irish whiskey one never hears of them looking for Scotch whisky again.  Irish whiskey is an acquired taste and it can hold its own with any other product.  If it is given a fair chance by advertising, the results will come.</P>
    <P>This Government has always stressed that its policy is to increase our exports.  I feel that a lot of money <Col N="858" /> has been wasted in certain directions, which I cannot deal with now as it does not come under this Estimate, in trying to expand our exports.  Here is a simple thing.  As Deputy McQuillan, Deputy Norton, Deputy Cosgrave and other speakers have stated, you have an absolutely illimitable market in the United States.</P>
    <P>Our product is not a modern product. Distilling has been going on here from time immemorial.  We have something that is recognised by those who know the difference as being one of the best if not in fact the very best of its kind in the world. Surely it is in our own interests to spend more money on advertising this product?  Distillers will naturally get the benefit of such advertising but bear in mind that we are also assisting a great body of people engaged in this industry throughout the country as a whole.  In his capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister should go to the Government and suggest to them that in view of the tremendous market that exists in the United States for Irish whiskey more funds should be made available so as to put us on a par with the level of advertising of Scotch whiskey in the United States.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to know that we import more continental wines, in cash, than we export whiskey out of Ireland.  The Minister is free to deny that statement, if it is wrong.  I have not the actual figures but I have that information on very reliable authority. The wines imported into this country are advertised.  All the people concerned with the production of wine for Europe advertise freely everywhere. Therefore, with a product such as Irish whiskey, with its potentialities from the point of view of providing increased employment at home, it is foolishness on our part not to go ahead and to expend more money on advertising it abroad so as to get as wide a market as possible for it.</P>
    <P>The Government's White Paper contains all sorts of extravagant schemes for establishing new markets, and so on.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce should direct his <Col N="859" /> attention to an effort to double, at least, our whiskey exports.  The only way in which that can be done within a reasonable time is by placing the necessary sums of money for advertising purposes at the disposal of the people who are in control.</P>
    <P>With regard to the type of whiskey exported, as I know the position, the whiskey is entirely exported by the distillers. They handle the export of the whiskey or their agents do it for them. It does not go through any middlemen, or very little, if so.  All Irish whiskey is mature.  No whiskey going out of this country is less than seven years old.</P>
    <P>Scotch whisky which is being exported across the Atlantic to the tune of about £45,000,000 or £50,000,000 in value per year is not as mature as ours. I think it is a blended whisky.  Most of our whiskey for export is pot-still.  In the limited area in which Irish whiskey has got a foothold in America &mdash; and it is a very limited area indeed &mdash; the demand for it is far in excess of the demand for Scotch whisky.  Some Deputies suggested that we should direct our advertising towards Irish organisations in America and Irish nationals and persons or bodies with Irish affiliations.</P>
    <P>In an enormous country such as the United States, with a population of 175,000,000, what is this small sum to us to increase our sales?  I consider it is quite inadequate but, at the same time, I am glad to see this Estimate coming forward.  We are thankful for small mercies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Supplementary Estimate.  I am wondering if the best means of selling Irish whiskey in the United States is through the efforts of Córas Tráchtála or whether the distillers who manufacture it are the people best experienced to sell their own product in the United States.  If they are, why have they not been doing it over all the years?  Is it, as Deputy McQuillan suggested, because they are conservative and satisfied with a comfortable market here at home or are they suffering under certain disabilities which <Col N="860" /> a discussion between the distillers and the Minister might help to resolve?</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that the distillers have a very small home market here, compared with the Scottish distillers who include the entire island of Great Britain in their home market, and that they are suffering from a severe disability due to the high rate of taxation in this country.  If that is a fact, and if some relief to the distillers would help to encourage them, and promote sales in the United States and elsewhere, I think the Minister should give serious cognisance to assisting them from that point of view.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the distillers should persevere in selling the traditional pot-still whiskey, or whether they should lean towards the branded whiskey which seems to suit the American palate more.  One thing I am quite certain of is that the sale of any Irish whiskey in the United States will be an extremely slow and tedious business.  The fact that the Scottish distillers are spending £1,000,000 a year and getting £45,000,000 a year in return is not so much out of line with our own expenditure of £50,000 to £60,000 for a return of £300,000 received for our exports.  Like everything else in this country I think we must measure the expenditure by the return we are likely to get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what efforts have been made by the distillers on their own to make an extensive survey of the American market.  I should have thought that before any money was expended the first thing to do would be to employ, either from their own distilling industry or outside it, experts to study the vast American market and, on the basis of the knowledge acquired from an expert survey, to decide how this money to promote sales of Irish whiskey in the United States could be best applied.  Perhaps the Minister, in replying to this debate, will give the House some information on whether such a survey has been carried out into the best way of promoting the sales of Irish whiskey in the United States by carrying on a sales campaign.  As previous speakers have said, £50,000 or £60,000 spent on advertising in the United States is only a drop in the <Col N="861" /> ocean.  It will do some good, a limited amount of good, but taking the size of that market as a whole it will have a very small impact on the size of the sales of Irish whiskey in the United States.</P>
    <P>I do not think you can make any worthwhile sales of whiskey or of any other goods, on the basis of appealing to Irish sentiment among hard-headed American people.  The only way you will sell any Irish goods to the United States is on the basis of quality, price, and service and by making energetic efforts to put the goods across.  Nothing else will succeed in the United States, and the fact that there is a very big population of Irish descent in the United States means very little in terms of business when it comes to trying to sell them something.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister, when he is replying, will indicate why is there such a potential for selling in the United States with an industry which is so peculiarly suited to this country, an industry which is decentralised, which draws its materials from the soil? Why is it that over the years our success has been so miserable in exporting Irish whiskey, not alone to the United States but elsewhere as well?  There must be some reasons for our failure to make a success of the export of whiskey, and we must tackle those reasons from the ground up.  If the increase in this Vote was likely to do any good I would be quite prepared to support the Minister if he came to the House for a substantially larger sum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think whiskey is a very desirable product to export and, that being so, I think there is justification for special action by the Government to support the efforts of those engaged in its production to increase their export potential.  There was a time in history in which Irish whiskey distillers had a paramount place in world export markets.  I do not know if that position can be regained, but the fact that it was held once at least suggests that possibility.  Certainly, I think we should try to recover some of the ground that has been lost and it will be of very great advantage to this country if we succeed in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whiskey is peculiarly a 100 per cent. <Col N="862" /> native product.  It is produced by a number of firms which are distributed around the country and the development of its production can distribute secondary benefits to many other industries and many other producers in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked if we have available supplies in sufficient quantities to take care of any increased demand that may be generated by this campaign.  I think there is no doubt about that.  I think the supplies at present available in bond in Ireland, and in store abroad, are more than sufficient to meet any increase in demand that may be produced in the next few years.  The production of whiskey is, of course, a long-term process and as demand tends to increase, as trade prospects improve, it is to be assumed the future distillation programmes of our distillers will be expanded in the light of the better selling prospects.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that the amount of money which can be made available, whether from Córas Tráchtála or the Irish distillers themselves, for the promotion of a sales campagin in the United States of America, is small in relation to the size of the American market.  So far as Government support for that campaign is concerned the amount provided is as much as we can afford to give, having regard to our resources and the amount the distillers can put in must naturally reflect their own trade returns and, particularly, the volume of their sales in the home market.  But, even if the amount is, as Deputy Esmonde says, completely inadequate, it is, at least, a very great deal more than was ever provided before for a campaign of this kind.  At the same time, the size of the American market and the amount of expenditure required to make any serious impact on it are fully appreciated, but the sums now allocated to the campagin, if well used, can succeed in achieving results, and the indications are that results are already being achieved.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that in some way the unsatisfactory position with regard to whiskey exports is due to the policy adopted during the war. I think that is nonsensical.  If the <Col N="863" /> record of the war years, and the measures taken to protect the national interests during that very difficult time are to be examined, then they should be examined as a whole and judged as a whole.  So far as I am concerned I have no anxiety about that judgment. What we did then in relation to the restriction of exports was not solely for the purpose of protecting the Revenue.  There were other very important considerations as well.  I am quite certain that, if we had so stimulated whiskey exports during that period, assuming that to be possible due to our shipping difficulties, as to produce a shortage at home, Deputy Norton would have led the volume of protest that would have broken out here in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is true that during those years, and immediately after the war, the British Government did so restrict the sales of Scotch whisky on the British market that there was a very pronounced scarcity, and they did so for the purpose of forcing available supplies into export channels.  We did not adopt that course exactly but towards the end of the war, and immediately after it, I had a number of discussions with Irish whiskey distillers with the purpose of inducing them to expand their distillations.  It is to be realised that increased distillations undertaken then would not have made available increased supplies for export for six or seven years to come, and the volume of exports permitted were related to the matured supplies then available but, I found the distillers reluctant to undertake that increased distillation programme, notwithstanding that they were offered increased availability of scarce commodities required for the production of whiskey.</P>
    <P>I want to say that since I came back to office I had other discussions with the whiskey distillers and I found a completely different atmosphere amongst them.  Whatever might have been said about the conservatism and unadventurous attitude which they showed ten, 12 or 15 years ago, there is no sign of it now.  Indeed, I would put the whiskey distillers of the country amongst the most enterprising <Col N="864" /> of our industrial firms at the present moment.  They are not merely engaged upon a vigorous trade campaign, as the House is aware, but they are undertaking extensions of their activities involving quite substantial investments of additional capital.</P>
    <P>This campaign which Córas Tráchtála is supporting is directed entirely to the American market.  The whiskey distillers themselves are endeavouring to promote increased sales in other markets but, so far as the State supported side of their activities is concerned, the American market is the sole target.  It is not correct to assume, as Deputy Russell appears to assume, that Córas Tráchtála is undertaking the sale of whiskey in America.  Córas Tráchtála is initiating a trade promotional campaign for Irish whiskey, irrespective of brand.  The individual distillers press the sales of their own brands and are solely responsible for arrangements for selling in the United States market.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan appears to suggest that it would, in some way, be beneficial to the increased sale of Irish whiskey abroad to prohibit the export of immature spirit.  I do not think that Deputy McQuillan understands the operations of the distilling industry very well.  A very high proportion of the total production of the Irish distillers is disposed of as immature spirit to bonders and blenders and, if they were deprived of that market, their capacity to promote increased sales abroad would be very greatly reduced. Indeed there are some distilleries which are almost entirely dependent upon the sales of immature spirit and undertake distillations on the strength of commissions received in advance of the opening of the season.  I think also that a tax upon Scotch whisky would be the height of nonsense.  The export of alcoholic drinks of one kind or another is one of our biggest single trades and to invite retaliation from abroad by imposing taxes of a discriminatory type upon the imports of similar products would be very very foolish indeed.</P>
    <P>The total amount being expended upon this United States campaign is <Col N="865" /> more than the £25,000 additional money now being provided.  It will be remembered that the Minister for Finance mentioned in his Budget statement that he had been pressed by the distillers to give them some relief so as to enable them to allocate from their own resources more money to trade promotional activities.  He did not find it possible to give it to them in the form of a tax relief but he did find it possible to give to Córas Tráchtála this £25,000 over and above the sums they were previously spending on this activity.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan asked for a balance sheet but I think it is far too soon to be seeking that.  There is also another aspect of this question which should be kept in mind.  Córas Tráchtála was set up to organise increased export trade, to encourage and assist individual Irish firms to explore export markets throughout the world and to help them to avail of any that appeared to have likely prospects.  One of the methods by which Córas Tráchtála can achieve its aims in that respect is by inducing firms in a particular industry to combine amongst themselves in joint trade promotional activities. The first group of industrialists who combined and availed of the facilities which Córas Tráchtála was offering were the whiskey distillers and it is important that we should, by the support we gave to that combined trade promotional efforts, show our willingness to give equivalent support to any other trade which tackles export problems in the same way.  The example of the co-operative enterprise shown by the whiskey distillers is one I frequently quote to other industrialists in an effort to induce them to approach their problems in the same way.</P>
    <P>While it is true that the amount of money provided by Córas Tráchtála for this particular campaign is not very substantial I do not want to suggest it can be increased.  I do not even suggest it can be repeated for subsequent years.  The total sum we have found it possible to make available for all the activities of Córas Tráchtála is £160,000.  It will be appreciated that the whiskey campaign in the United States has taken <Col N="866" /> a very high proportion of that amount and it may not be possible to renew it in future years.  I feel satisfied that if the results already achieved in increased sales in the United States continue they will encourage the whiskey distillers themselves to continue the same type of successful promotional activities from their own resources.</P>

      <P>Before Section 6 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) In each financial year of the board an account shall be kept by the board of all moneys received or expended by the board &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) under the Shannon Fisheries Acts, 1935 and 1938,</P>
      <P>(b)  in the performance of the duties imposed on the board by Part III of the Shannon Fisheries Act, 1935, in relation to the Shannon fisheries, within the meaning of that Act, and</P>
      <P>(c)  in the exercise of the powers of the board under Section 16, as extended by this Act, of the Act of 1945, </P>
      <P>and the balance on foot of the account shall be incorporated in the general accounts of the board.</P>
      <P>(2)  Sub-section (1) of Section 7 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, shall not apply in relation to moneys in relation to which this section applies, and sub-sections (2) and (3) and, in so far as it provides for the sending of accounts to the Minister and for the publication and putting on sale of copies of accounts, sub-section (4) of that section shall apply in relation to an account kept under this section as if it were an account kept under that section.</P>
      <P>(3)  Section 17 of the Shannon Fisheries Act, 1935 and sub-section (3) of Section 16 of the Act of 1945 are hereby repealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On reconsideration of Section 6 it was thought better to scrap it altogether and to replace it with a section which would set out clearly the obligations of the board in regard to keeping their fishery accounts.  The original section <Col N="869" /> referred back to sections in previous Acts and did not appear to be completely satisfactory.  This section as it now stands, sets out in precise and clear form the total obligations of the board in regard to the form and presentation of the accounts of the board in relation to its fishery operations.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a word about the provisions of the section.  I want to make it clear that all we are proposing to do here in regard to the powers of the E.S.B., is to enable them to pay compensation in the cases set out.  They did not have that power heretofore and it was never, in fact, contemplated that they would ever pay compensation for the closing of a public road or a public bridge. In this case, it is proposed, because of the circumstances, to enable them to pay compensation and in fact they have now entered into an agreement with the majority of the people concerned and I think they will succeed in making <Col N="870" /> agreements with all of them as to the amount of compensation in each case.</P>
      <P>I would not contemplate arbitration. Indeed, I could not conceive the terms of reference you would give an arbitrator asked to determine what compensation might be due in circumstances where a public road or bridge ceased to be open to the public.  I do not anticipate there will be any difficulty in concluding all negotiations in this instance.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete sub-sections (2) and (3) and substitute the following new subsections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( )  Where a person who is either an officer or a servant in the employment of the board becomes a member of either House of the Oireachtas &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) he shall, during the period (in this section referred to as the secondment period) commencing upon his becoming entitled under the Standing Orders of that House to sit therein and ending either when he ceases to be a member of that House or, if it should sooner happen, upon his resignation or retirement from such employment or upon the termination of such employment by the board, stand seconded from such employment, (b) he shall not be paid by, or entitled to receive from, the board any salary or wages, as the case</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> may be, in respect of the secondment period,</P>
    <P>(c) notwithstanding any provision of the Acts, as amended by this Act, or of any scheme made in pursuance of the Superannuation Act of 1942 &mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the secondment period shall, for the purposes of any such scheme, be deemed to be service of that person which is reckonable for superannuation benefits under the scheme if, but only if &mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  he was in the permanent employment of the board and was a contributor under the scheme immediately before the commencement of the secondment period and is not an excluded person (which expression has the same meaning in this and the next following sub-section as it has in Section 13 of the Superannuation Act of 1942),</P>
    <P>(II) he elects, by notice in writing given to the board within three months after the commencement of the secondment period, to pay contributions under the scheme in respect of the secondment period in accordance with the provisions of this sub-section, and</P>
    <P>(III)  he pays, at such times and in such manner as the committee duly appointed under the scheme to administer the scheme may specify, contributions under the scheme in respect of the secondment period equal in amount to the aggregate of the contributions which he would have paid and the contributions which the board would have paid in respect of the secondment period if he had remained without secondment under this sub-section in the service of the board during the secondment period and had been in <Col N="872" /> receipt of remuneration from the board during that period, </P>
    <P>(ii) the board shall not pay any contributions under the scheme in respect of the secondment period, but that part of the contributions payable by him as aforesaid which is equal to the amount of the contributions which the board would have paid under the scheme in respect of the secondment period if he had remained without secondment under this sub-section in the service of the board during the secondment period and had been in receipt of remuneration from the board during that period shall, for the purposes of the scheme, be deemed to have been paid by the board,</P>
    <P>(iii) if the secondment period is terminated by his death or by his retirement from such employment, he shall, for the purposes of the scheme, be deemed to have died in or to have been retired from the service of the board, as the case may be, and to have been in receipt of remuneration from the board immediately before such death or retirement, as the case may be,</P>
    <P>(iv) if he does not pay or if, having paid contributions under the scheme in accordance with the provisions of this sub-section, he ceases to pay contributions as aforesaid, he shall, for the purposes of the scheme, be deemed to have resigned from such employment &mdash;</P>
    <P>(I) in case he ceases to pay contributions as aforesaid, on the date of the last payment, and</P>
    <P>(II) in any other case, immediately before the commencement of the secondment period, and </P>
    <P>(v) a reference in this or the next following sub-section to the receipt by any person of remuneration from the board shall be taken as a reference to <Col N="873" /> the receipt by that person of remuneration from the board at the rate at which he was being remunerated by the board on the last day of his whole-time employment with the board before his secondment under this sub-section, and </P>
    <P>(d) (i) notwithstanding any provisions of the Acts, as amended by this Act, if he is an excluded person and was in the permanent employment of the board immediately before the commencement of the secondment period, the secondment period shall, for the purposes of the payment of and calculation of the amount of any superannuation benefit to which he is entitled, be deemed to be service of that person which is reckonable for superannuation benefits payable by the board under Section 39 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, or Section 13 of the Superannuation Act of 1942 and he shall, for the purposes aforesaid, be deemed to have been in receipt of remuneration from the board during the secondment period, and</P>
    <P>(ii) if the secondment period is terminated by his death or by his retirement from such employment, he shall, for the purposes aforesaid, be deemed to have died in or to have been retired from the service of the board, as the case may be, and to have been in receipt of remuneration from the board immediately before such death or retirement, as the case may be. </P>
    <P>( ) if a person who is or was an officer or servant of the board becomes entitled to a pension under the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Acts, 1938 to 1952 &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) he shall not be entitled to reckon the whole or any part of his period of pensionable service, within the meaning of those Acts, for any superannuation benefits <Col N="874" /> payable under a scheme made in pursuance of the Superannuation Act of 1942 or payable by the board,</P>
    <P>(b) if he has paid any contributions in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (2) of this section in respect of that period, so much thereof as is equal to the amount of the contributions which he would have paid in respect of that period under the scheme if he had remained without secondment under sub-section (2) of this section in the service of the board during that period and had been in receipt of remuneration from the board during that period, shall be returned to him if and when a payment of benefit or a return of other contributions is made to him under the scheme, and</P>
    <P>(c) if he is an excluded person, an amount equal to the amount which would have been returned to him under paragraph (b) of this sub-section if he had not been an excluded person and had paid contributions in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (2) of this section in respect of that period shall be paid to him by the board if and when a payment of benefit or other payment on foot of his superannuation entitlement is made to him by the board. </P>
    <P>This is a fairly protracted amendment but I foreshadowed it on the Second Reading.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide that where an employee of the E.S.B. goes up for election to the Dáil and secures election he will be seconded from the employment of the board but entitled to go back to that employment when he ceases to be a member of the Dáil and will, in the meantime, be able to preserve his pension rights by paying both his own and the board's contributions to the pension fund.  By and large, that is the purpose of the section. There are special provisions dealing with the case of an E.S.B. employee seconded from the board becoming a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary and qualifying for a Ministerial or a Parliamentary Secretary's <Col N="875" /> pension.  In that case the amount of his pension from the board would be modified accordingly.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision that an employee so elected may, if he wishes, cease to pay these contributions and will thereby be regarded as having resigned from the board's employment and having surrendered his pension rights with them.  I mentioned on the Second Reading that the aim was to endeavour, as far as possible, to put employees of the E.S.B. on much the same basis as employees of C.I.E. have been in regard to election to the Dáil.  Up to the present, of course, they were completely debarred from seeking election; now they are permitted to seek election but not to function as employees of the board during their period as elected representatives.</P>

      <P>I am not quite sure what the Deputy has in mind.  Section 12 says that the board may, if they think fit, increase the pension of any person &ldquo;by such amount as the board think proper having regard to all the circumstances but subject to the limitation that the increase shall not exceed the appropriate sum&rdquo; set out in Section 1.  The reason it is in that form is because the manual workers' pension scheme is in such a complicated condition that only experts can <Col N="878" /> understand it and it would have been quite impossible to insert in the Bill clauses designed to give effect to the full intention here.</P>
      <P>The intention is that the same increase in pensions to former employees of the board will be achieved as were achieved for all other pensioners by the Pension Increase Act of 1956; in other words, the pensions of certain persons who were employed by the board will be increased by the amount set out in Section 1 in the same way as other pensioners got increased pensions by the general Increase of Pensions Act of 1956.</P>

Provision was made in the Act to add a certain number of years in the case of those who, at the date of the passing of the Act, were not less than 40 years of age.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  There shall be granted and paid to each of Dr. T.A. McLaughlin and J.M. Fay, who each served as full-time members of the E.S.B., compensation by way of a gratuity equal to 128ths of the amount of the salary and emoluments of which each was in receipt at the date of the termination of his service with the said board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is an effort to meet in <Col N="879" /> a fair and reasonable way the cases of two former full-time directors of the board, other than the chairman whose case is dealt with in Section 14.  The position is, as the Minister and House are probably aware, that the E.S.B. was the first State board established. When the Act establishing the board was in process of going through the Dáil it was stated that it was proposed that the full-time members of the board would be pensionable.  At that time the pension for persons in the public service was at the rate of two-thirds of salary.  Subsequently that was altered to half salary plus a lump sum of one and a half years' salary in lieu of the two-thirds method of calculation.  The Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act of 1942 provided that the whole-time members of the board would have pensions at the rate of 20/48ths.  That was the first occasion on which the undertaking given when the 1927 Act was passed was implemented.  Subsequently, in 1954, the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act passed in that year altered the 20/48ths to 24/48ths, or half salary, and made no provision for a lump sum.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the section in the Bill before the House is that half salary and a gratuity will be paid to the chairman.  As the Minister explained on the Second Reading, the reason for that is because the chairman was prior to his appointment to the E.S.B. a full-time civil servant with 18 or 19 years' service and, had he retired from the Civil Service at that time, he would have been entitled to half salary plus a lump sum.</P>
    <P>The position of the two other directors is somewhat different.  One of them was in the Army, subsequently a civil servant, and ultimately joined the board of the E.S.B.  The other pursued a very exhaustive course of study culminating in a number of degrees, secured mainly as a result of winning scholarships.  During the period when he might have been gainfully employed by the State in some capacity or another he was acquiring very specialised knowledge, both in universities here and in Germany.  When the E.S.B. was established he became a foundation member of the board.  It is <Col N="880" /> not necessary for me to enlarge here on the immeasurable services he rendered to the board or the work he did.</P>
    <P>Now the directors of the board were precluded from joining the superannuation scheme when it was established in 1942.  Both of these directors have served for lengthy periods with the board &mdash; one from the foundation of the board, with a short break, up to last year, and the other from 1930 up to last year.  I believe there is a strong case for treating these two directors on the same basis.  Their service and their previous experience are not quite comparable, but one is at least comparable with the chairman inasmuch as he was a civil servant.  The other, Dr. McLaughlin, acquired exhaustive experience before joining the board on its foundation.  The position is that Dr. McLaughlin was retired from the board at the age of 61.  The chairman, I understand, will have the right to continue until 68.  Taking into account the relative ages, Dr. McLaughlin suffered a disability.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that this is a precedent or that there is a danger of creating special treatment but I think that is answered by the fact that the E.S.B. was the first State board and, although a number of State boards have been established since the setting up of the E.S.B., the conditions have not been comparable and in recent times a more uniform pattern of dealing with directors has been established.  Two former civil servants on other State boards have been dealt with on lines similar to the treatment being afforded to Mr. Browne, Chairman of the E.S.B.  Mr. Courtney, who was Chairman of C.I.E. and Dr. Beddy, Chairman of the Industrial Development Authority, had their service in the Civil Service included for pension and gratuity purposes.</P>
    <P>It is unlikely that future boards will have full-time directors other than the chairman or, probably, the managing director or general manager.  In any event, if directors are appointed in future to State boards they will know the basis on which they are being appointed.  In the case of Dr. <Col N="881" /> McLaughlin and Mr. Fay, they joined the E.S.B. before any pension rights had been settled or granted.  The only undertaking was that given by the Minister moving the Act when he stated in the course of the debate that it was proposed to make them pensionable. Therefore, the question of a precedent or different treatment for certain directors compared with others does not arise.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that in this case there is a very strong argument in favour of giving to these two former full-time directors a gratuity on the same basis as applies in the case of the present chairman when he retires and as applied in the case of a former chairman of C.I.E. and the chairman of the Industrial Development Authority.  It is true that only one of these directors, namely, Mr. Fay, had service in the Civil Service but, as I have said, during the period when both Mr. Fay and Mr. Browne were gaining the time qualification during their service in the Civil Service, Dr. McLaughlin acquired specialised knowledge which has undoubtedly been of benefit to the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>The E.S.B. is a vast undertaking. The total capital invested now amounts to about £100,000,000 and to these two men, as well as to many others, much of the credit for that achievement is due.  I believe, therefore, that this is a reasonable proposal and I put it to the Minister that it is a proposal which could be accepted on the basis that, while no specific terms were expressed, an undertaking was given and, on the basis of the scheme which was subsequently settled, there is a reasonable case for giving the same treatment to all the full-time directors as is given to the chairman of this board and as has been given in the two other cases that I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be associated with the amendment in the name of Deputy Cosgrave.  The country generally owes a great deal to the efficiency of the E.S.B.  It is an undertaking of which we can be very proud and which during the emergency years enabled many citizens to earn their living and to cook and to keep <Col N="882" /> their houses heated and lighted.  The essential services were maintained during the emergency years and industry as a whole owes a great deal to the board.</P>
      <P>Dr. McLaughlin and Mr. Fay spent the greater part of their working years in this concern, the benefits of which have been enjoyed by the country at large, and we would be remiss if we did not reward these men, give them what is really their due, for having spent so many years in building up this huge enterprise.  Therefore, I trust the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I, also, should like to support Deputy Cosgrave's amendment.  Most Deputies and people outside are conscious of the treatmendous service which Dr. McLaughlin and Mr. Fay have given to the success of the electricity undertaking which was started in this country almost 30 years ago.  The amendment that has been put forward by Deputy Cosgrave is couched in reasonable terms.  It asks no more than would appear to be what is owing to both these directors and I would hope that the Minister will see his way to accept the principle involved in the amendment in recognition of the lifetime service which Dr. McLaughlin, in particular, has given to the building up of the first major undertaking of this kind in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave said that the purpose of his amendment was to provide similar conditions for retirement for Dr. McLaughlin and Mr. Fay as are provided in this Bill for Mr. Browne.  I think, however, he completely misconceives the situation because, if I were to do what he said, both of these former members of the E.S.B. would be greatly worse off than they are now.  The terms of the pension provision for Dr. McLaughlin and Mr. Fay, that is to say, the pension which they are receiving related to the length of their service to the E.S.B., are much better than the terms which are proposed here for the chairman, Mr. Browne. I should, perhaps, explain that a little further without going into any personal details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> Under the Civil Service (Regulations) Acts the retirement provision is intended to be reasonable for those who have spent a long period in the service of the State, the maximum provision being earnable by those who have served the State for 40 years.  In the case, however, of all State-sponsored bodies it is customary to base eligibility for pension upon shorter service because of the fact that most people who come to serve on these boards in a whole-time capacity are appointed much later in life than is normal in the case of entry to the Civil Service.  In the case of the E.S.B. the full pension of half the retiring pay can be attained after 24 years service.  As I said, in the case of the Civil Service a pension of half-pay can be earned only after 40 years' service.</P>
    <P>In the case of Mr. Browne, the chairman of the E.S.B., he was appointed to the Civil Service in 1911 and he became chairman of the E.S.B. in 1930. When he became chairman of the E.S.B. he retained all his entitlement to pension and gratuity in respect of his period in the Civil Service under the Civil Service code.  His service with the E.S.B. would entitle him to full pension on the basis of half of his retiring pay under the existing scheme relating to whole-time members of the E.S.B. and also to secure on his retirement his rights as a former civil servant.</P>
    <P>The effect of Section 14 is that there will be applied in his case the normal provisions which apply in the Civil Service, that is to say, his pension will be based upon eightieths.  His 40 years' service will entitle him to full pension and his 45 years' service will entitle him, in addition, to a gratuity, based upon thirtieths.  In return for the application to him of these conditions, he is surrendering all and any entitlement he may have to a pension under the Civil Service Acts.</P>
    <P>Were similar conditions to be applied in the case of Dr. McLaughlin and Mr. Fay, both of them would suffer a very considerable diminution in their pensions.  Dr. McLaughlin had a total of 29 years' service in the <Col N="884" /> E.S.B. and Mr. Fay a total of 27 years. The effect of providing in their case the same provisions as are made for the chairman would mean a very substantial reduction in their present pension. It is true they would get a gratuity, but on the basis of their normal expectation of life the amount of that gratuity would not make up for the amount of the reduction in pension they would suffer.  It is clear, therefore, that the present provision in relation to these two former members of the board is really quite generous.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned that the old position in relation to the Civil Service was a retiring pension of two-thirds salary without a gratuity.  That applied up to some date in the 1920s when the present system of half salary plus gratuity was substituted for it; but even that two-thirds salary under the old Civil Service provision &mdash; it applied to those who were appointed to the Civil Service before 1909 &mdash; was secured only after 30 years' service.  Therefore, even in respect of that old provision, the present arrangements for the two former members of the E.S.B. which have been mentioned are more generous.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I could not agree to this amendment.  Indeed, there is no precedent whatever for the giving of a gratuity in addition to pension after the comparatively short service which both these gentlemen gave.  The gratuity provision is something that was substituted for another provision in respect of people who had very long service.  As I said, in the case of these gentlemen the present situation is better for them than if we applied to them the same proposals as are now contained in this Bill in relation to the chairman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be true that these two members had substantially shorter service, but that merely emphasises the point I made earlier. Both of them had a different background. They were both engineers. One of them had served in the Army and subsequently served in the Civil Service.  The other, Dr. McLaughlin, was engaged in what are called, I suppose, advanced or prolonged studies of a scientific nature.  I do not think it <Col N="885" /> would be a good thing that, say, all the directors should have that particular type of qualification.  It so happened that Mr. Browne had longer Civil Service service than Mr. Fay; but my point is that the other qualifications or work which they did would surely entitle them to reckon that work and that experience in the same way as the service which a person serving with an uninterrupted term in the Civil Service would have.</P>
      <P>Under the Local Authorities (Superannuation) Act of 1948 there is power to add years.  In one case &mdash; admittedly in the case of the abolition of the office &mdash; when the office of the former Clerk of the Seanad was abolished, added years were granted.  I feel that, in this particular case, basing them on comparable service, undoubtedly they have shorter continuous service but it is only reasonable to take into account the experience which they had got and the experience gained in other fields, which was applied to the benefit of this undertaking.  Therefore, while it does not reckon in the ordinary sense of service in an uninterrupted way, nevertheless there is a strong case for taking it into account in directing the treatment which should be given to them.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy knows that particular cases make bad law.  The Deputy suggests that the circumstances of one case need not necessarily tie in with another.  I disagree with that completely.  I think that our aim should be to provide similarity of conditions for all the whole-time executives of State boards. We have not got that at the moment &mdash; indeed, we have a wide dissimilarity &mdash; but the Government is determined to try to establish a basis for creating similar conditions in regard to pension rights and similar benefits enjoyed by the whole-time executives of State boards.  One could not contemplate any circumstances under which service for as short a period as 24 years would qualify not merely for full pension but a gratuity as well.  It would be far and away above anything that any other State official could hope to secure.  Indeed, the retirement after 24 years' service, on half pay is, I <Col N="886" /> think, a generous provision and I certainly would not like to hold out the prospect of making any more generous provision in relation to these particular former members of the E.S.B. or to other whole-time executives of State boards.  I am quite certain that having regard to the standards of private employers these conditions are quite reasonable and generous.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that particular cases make bad law. Surely he is also aware that generalisations can lead to injustice.  In this particular case concerning these two men, Dr. McLaughlin spent a number of years preparing himself for the work which he afterwards did in the E.S.B. At that stage the E.S.B. could not have employed a junior person, as the board needed a person of the widest possible electrical experience.  At the beginning, starting that vast undertaking, they had to turn to experienced people and these are the two particular cases that do not make any precedent, because it was at the beginning of the E.S.B. when they had to get experienced men that these two men came in and it is not fair to compare them with people who spent their whole lives in the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>Frankly, I was rather disappointed at the Minister's reception of this amendment.  I can see and I can understand the difficulties that may be created for the Minister or any Minister in relation to exceptional treatment as applied to individuals. But this particular section sought to be amended is a special section dealing with a special case.  If we include the amendment, we are dealing with one of the most particular cases we have had in this country over the last 36 years.  In effect, we are dealing with the men who pioneered one of the major State undertakings since we established this State in 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. McLaughlin, who was the technical brain behind the electricity undertaking at the end of the 20s, went into the E.S.B. as a young man in his early 30s.  He is now discharged from the service at the age of 61.  Is it to be suggested that, merely because some administrative problems may be involved, the Minister representing the people should be churlish, hesitant and grudging in relation to the manner in which a lifetime of service should be compensated and recognised by the State?  I would urge on the Minister that you cannot apply Civil Service canons and principles to a case of this kind.  To pioneer the Shannon scheme and the electricity undertaking in this country at the turn of the 20s required guts, energy, imagination and vision; and, fortunately for the country, they were available in the persons of those who piloted and initiated this scheme. Merely because from 1930 to 1957 or 1958 is a period of time which is short of an ordained number of years in the accepted code for pensions and <Col N="888" /> schemes of that kind should not prevent us here from recognising the work which has been given to the State by both Dr. McLaughlin and Mr. Fay.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister this argument.  I think it is important that we are dealing with pioneering members.  We are dealing with those who contributed to the success of a scheme which was largely of an experimental kind some 30 years ago.  In 30 or 40 years' time directors who join the E.S.B. now and who serve for 30 or 40 years are serving in an undertaking that is well established, that has a wealth of experience behind it and they have not to face the kinds of problems the early directors had to face.  I feel, by reason of the fact that these two directors contributed as pioneers to the undertaking in its early days, when all the problems had to be faced, when all the technical and administrative problems had to be overcome, when they had &mdash; certainly in the case of Dr. McLaughlin &mdash; to spend some time equipping themselves for their tasks, that we should now recognise that it is not merely a problem of asking &ldquo;How long did you serve?&rdquo; and saying, &ldquo;merely because you only served 25, 26, 27 or 28 years, you shall be entitled only to such and such a pension&rdquo;.  There is a lot more in it than that.  It is not merely the length of service; it is the success that has been achieved.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned that in relation to other bodies Dr. McLaughlin and Mr. Fay would require 16 or 17 years more service to achieve the rights they now have.  That is true but it is only a debating point, as the Minister himself knows.  Certainly, in the part of the State service of which I had some experience, in relation to local authority service, the maximum service for pension rights may be 30 years, 35 years, 40 years or whatever it may be, but it is certainly the experience of anyone in the Custom House that unless there is a very exceptional case the power to add years is regularly exercised.  A local authority officer, who may have 24 or 25 years' service short of such as would entitle him to full pension rights, generally gets the added years so that, in fact, he is entitled&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frequently if the gap is short enough it is bridged both by the local authority and the Minister responsible in order to entitle the officer to full pension rights.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare mentioned the cases of medical officers in the Department of Health.  I do not think that is a fair argument.  I am sure it is known to the Parliamentary Secretary, if not, it is known to the Minister, that for many years medical personnel in the Department of Health have been making the case that they have had to face seven, eight nine, or perhaps ten years qualifying for the post to which they are eventually appointed.  They have urged for many years that portion of the necessary period of qualification and service outside the Custom House should be reckoned at the end of their service for superannuation purposes.</P>
      <P>I think quite a separate approach should be made in regard to superannuation to the technician, scientist or the person who has to equip himself before he begins service with an undertaking in order to do it properly. In regard to a seconded civil servant who, because of his individual ability or personal attributes, is seconded to a particular job it is easy enough to say that he went into the Civil Service on such and such a date, commenced this job on another date and has been there so long that we will add his Civil Service period for pension purposes. That is understandable and it is done very fairly and properly in relation to the chairman of the board in this section but the Minister should have regard to the fact that the scientist, the technician, the technical brain behind this undertaking and behind its success at the time, had to invest quite a lot of his time, youth and energy in acquiring the necessary scientific equipment to bring into the board and eventually invest it in its success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ask the Minister representing the people in this regard to recognise that <Col N="890" /> Dr. McLaughlin's service should not merely be measured by the years he served as director, which I would regard as a lifetime, but also recognise that he spent quite a number of years before he went into the board enabling himself to do his work properly.</P>

      <P>It is quite unrealistic to suggest that the matter can be decided on the merits of individual cases.  I am not prepared to agree. No Minister could agree that the qualities required on the board amongst the whole-time members of the E.S.B. in the past are superior to those qualities required by whole-time members of that board or any other State board in the future.  Does Deputy O'Higgins contemplate some future Minister, when approached by some other whole-time executive from the E.S.B. or some other board, saying he was not as good as those in the past?  I suggest that is an impossible case to put forward here.  When Dr. McLaughlin and Mr. Fay were appointed to the supply board there was no provision of any kind attaching.</P>

      <P>No. I state that there was no pension provision and no understanding that there would be a pension provided.  I enacted legislation which provided a pension on the basis of 20/24ths.  I think that is what it was.  It was a provision which did not enable them at any time to secure a pension of half pay on retirement. Later, I amended that provision to secure that they would be entitled, after 24 years, to a pension of half pay when they were retired.  They regarded that arrangement as completely satisfactory and, indeed, as generous.  Having regard to the provisions for civil servants and others, it is generous and makes ample provision for any time they may have spent before being appointed to the board <Col N="891" /> preparing themselves for the duties attached to such membership.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that either of these former employees of the board suggested this amendment.  I am not even certain they wished to have it moved here.  I think the amendment is the product of a misunderstanding of the provisions proposed in this Bill for the present chairman of the board, Mr. Browne.  If we gave to Dr. McLaughlin and Mr. Fay the same terms as we gave Mr. Browne, it would mean a substantial diminution on their present pensions and the gratuities would be substantially less than the amounts they would lose having regard to their normal expectation of life.  I regard the present arrangement as quite satisfactory.  It is generous&mdash;more generous than the present arrangement for pensions to most other people employed in the State service in any capacity.</P>
      <P>I would much prefer to work towards uniformity in regard to these arrangements rather than towards any special provisions for special cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that we should work towards uniformity but it was not these directors who fixed the terms.  The fact that there is not uniformity does not lie at the door of the directors of any of the State companies.  Ministers or Governments are responsible.  It is true that in successive measures they introduced different terms for different boards.  Some are appointed directly by the Minister for a further term. Others are appointed by Governments and still others hold office as nominees of the Minister for Finance probably with the consent of whatever other Minister is concerned.</P>
      <P>The lack of uniformity is the responsibility of Governments or Ministers. I certainly share the idea that uniformity should be established.  In fact, there is even some case for introducing legislation to change Acts in order to bring them into line so that there will be a general uniform system, but these particular directors were appointed, as I said initially, and as the Minister mentioned a few moments ago, without having pension rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> I have here a quotation from Deputy McGilligan who was Minister at the time.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I believe that a board such as this should eventually establish a pension scheme for the officials.  In fact, I have a certain idea that there might be a pension scheme for members of the board, because they will be taken from fairly lucrative occupations, so as to get the proper men and they are given a small tenure of office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These people accepted offers on an expressed understanding.  It may not have been made to them in any written undertaking.  They accepted at that time what the Minister said as covering Government and parliamentary responsibility for it.  It is true that if they got the terms which the Minister mentioned they would get conditions comparable to the chairman.  Whatever about the future treatment of directors&mdash;there will, in future, be very few full-time directors, probably only the chairman and the managing director who will probably be an official of the board&mdash;as I believe this is the only instance of full-time directors other than the chairman, there is some case for giving them consideration that they have served in a full-time capacity when other directors, with the exception of chairmen of State companies, do not do so.</P>
    <P>The practice of boards in recent times has been to have the chairman alone on full-time and probably the managing director.  As I say the directors themselves were appointed and remained as such because continuing Governments or successive Governments reappointed them in that capacity.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that the services rendered by Dr. McLaughlin particularly in the initiation of this scheme were outstanding. There will not be another situation in which you will have a similar case.  I want to submit to the House, to the Minister and to the Government that the work done by Dr. McLaughlin and his colleagues over a number of years was of such an outstanding nature that if there were an order of chivalry it would be bestowed upon him and it would carry with it a very substantial financial advantage. But the Minister has tackled this as if they had done an ordinary day's work. I think the Minister should forget his prejudices.</P>

      <P>Again, what the Minister considers contemptible does not worry me.  If they were in any other country&mdash;and some people across there are very happy to follow the examples of other countries and cite other countries as to what should and should not be done&mdash;is it not true that they would get that honour?  But no matter how outstanding they are, they are to be regulated into the common herd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generalities are very important and very sound principles are equally important, but in this case we have two men with outstanding merit who have rendered signal services to the country. The Government and the Minister do not think it worth while to say: &ldquo;Yes, they are outstanding.  They are not in the same category as others.&rdquo;  There is little likelihood that new developments of that calibre will be initiated in this country again, although we hope there will be, and if there are citizens of this country who have taken <Col N="894" /> a great interest in the building up of industries or institutions that will be of much advantage to the country, we should recognise them as being of outstanding merit.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government to reconsider the matter and not just throw it overboard like that.</P>

      <P>This question as to the method of pensioning directors of State-sponsored bodies has been the subject of much discussion particularly in the State-sponsored bodies over many years.  There are some directors of State-sponsored bodies who have no pension whatever.  For example, no member of the Labour Court is pensionable and I do not think members of the Industrial Development Authority are pensionable.  The members of quite a number of other State-sponsored bodies have no pension at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me come to this scheme.  Many of these people would be reaching the stage at which they will leave the State service without any pension or gratuity whatever unless the State takes some steps to provide for them, and frankly on the obvious merits of the case I think a case can be made.  I certainly made it in my time as Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Department of Finance that a scheme ought to be devised to provide pensions for those who give certain minimum periods of service as directors of State-sponsored undertakings and I hope the present Minister will pursue that policy.  It is indefensible to take these people into employment, to avail of their services for a long time, sometimes at rates of pay which are less than they can command on the commercial market, and <Col N="895" /> allow them to go out without any pension or gratuity whatever.</P>
      <P>In this case of the E.S.B. directors, I had representations made to me.  The chairman of the board made representations and felt that he was not being fairly treated in respect of his pension. The chairman of the board was a civil servant who was seconded, I think, from the Revenue Commissioners to the E.S.B.  On secondment to the E.S.B. his pension arrangements were frozen; in other words it was ascertained what pension he would have been entitled to at the time of his secondment and that was, as it were, parked there for him and it would be paid to him when he reached the normal retiring age from the Civil Service at 65.  In the E.S.B. he is on an entirely different basis.  Subject to correction, I think his pension in the E.S.B. is 1/48th of his pay for each year of service subject to a maximum of 24/48ths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been changed here.  It is 1/80th.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The chairman felt he ought to get a lump sum as well, as he would have got had he remained in the Civil Service.  There was some force in that because of the unusual position in which he stood as a civil servant coming to the E.S.B. I considered the matter at great length.  I was anxious to avoid any obvious injustice and at the same time not to create a situation in which others without a claim as strong as the chairman's would use the chairman's rather unique and strong position to say: &ldquo;We are entitled to the same benefits.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said to the chairman of the E.S.B. that I was prepared to allow him to do either of two things, but not both.  I said: &ldquo;You cannot get a lump sum in addition to your pension because other people in that category are not getting that lump sum, but you can have this alternative.  You can aggregate your Civil Service service and your E.S.B. service and then you can calculate your pension on the Civil Service pattern.  If you calculate on the Civil Service pattern then you will be entitled to not 1/48th for each year of service but <Col N="896" /> 1/80th for each year of service and you will be entitled to the customary Civil Service lump sum of 1/30th for each year of service, subject to a maximum of 45 1/30ths.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The chairman would get half his pay as pension under the E.S.B. scheme because 24 years' service would qualify him for half pay where the pension was based on 48ths.  However, under the Civil Service scheme, he would have to give 40 years' service before he would get half pay.</P>
    <P>Thus, the position was that if the chairman is getting under this Bill&mdash; and I undertook the governmental approval to give him this&mdash;a lump sum and a half pension he is getting it only because he has rendered a sufficiency of service, that is, 40 years, under the Civil Service pattern to get half pay as a pension.  He gets the lump sum because the lump sum in the Civil Service goes where the pension is based on 80ths as against 48ths, under the E.S.B. scheme.  Possibly the E.S.B. directors could have the same but if they opt for the same or if it were offered to them they would get a lesser pension and I do not think it would be advantageous to them in the long run.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the chairman of the E.S.B. is in a rather unique position because of his previous service in the Civil Service.  In fact, for the purpose of this Bill and for the purpose of his pay and lump sum, he is being treated in exactly the same way as the former chairman of C.I.E.</P>
    <P>It must be said as well that, under the new scheme which provides for the pension of the chairman here, he loses the Civil Service pension which had been marked for him for many years. I do not know whether or not he knows it but it seems to me he could have claimed it, since he was 65 years of age.  However, if he had claimed, the eagle eyes of the Department of Finance would have seen that and provided in this Bill that he would get this pension provided only he refunded what he would have been entitled to since 65 years of age.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between the chairman and the other members.  If something is to be done for the other members, that could be considered, <Col N="897" /> but there are other people in the State service who would have to be considered and there are persons in the State service who have no pension and gratuity at all.  They have a claim for urgent consideration because of the complete absence of any provision for them on retirement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be aware from the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with this Bill, that the main purpose of the Bill is to increase from £600 to £800 per annum the remuneration limit for insurability under the Social Welfare Acts of persons employed otherwise than by way of manual labour.  The £600 remuneration limit was fixed by the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  By reason of increases in wages and salaries over the last few years, many persons have ceased to be insurable owing to their remuneration having gone above the £600 limit and thus can no longer obtain the benefits to which they were formerly entitled, and for which they may have paid contributions over a long period. Accordingly it is proposed to increase the remuneration limit to £800 to restore insurance cover to such <Col N="899" /> persons.  Section 2 of the Bill makes the necessary provision.</P>
      <P>Under the Social Welfare Acts persons who become insured remain insured throughout their lives until they reach 70 years of age.  Thus, persons whose employment ceased to be insurable by reason of their remuneration having exceeded the £600 limit will still have to their credit contributions they paid in the past.  When their employment again becomes insurable on the coming into operation of this Act, there would, however, be a gap in their contribution records which would disentitle them to benefit for a substantial period after re-entry.  Provision is being made in sub-section (1) of Section 3 to credit contributions to such persons to enable them to satisfy the contribution conditions for benefit on again becoming insurable.</P>
      <P>The only further provision requiring comment is that contained in sub-section (2) of Section 3.  I should explain that this of itself makes no change in the law relating to insurability. It merely provides for the crediting of contributions in the event of persons, hitherto insurable for limited benefits only, becoming by virtue of subsequent regulations insurable for a new benefit.  Such persons would get credits for purposes of the contribution conditions for the new benefit, just as new entrants to insurance get pre-entry credits under the law as it stands.</P>

It is the case of a person who was in insurable employment and then his salary or income went beyond the £600 limit.  He then died and his widow is being held as not entitled to the widow's contributory pension because, at the time he died, and for some years before that, he was not in insurable employment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because I think it is bringing our social legislation into conformity with realities.  The Bill provides for extending insurability to those whose incomes exceed £600 and do not exceed £800, but when you remember that the £ to-day is worth less than 8/- then what we are merely doing is extending insurability for social welfare purposes to persons whose pre-war wages or salaries amounted to less than £5 a week.  There is nothing very revolutionary in that.  In fact, I would prefer to see the ceilling abolished entirely and a comprehensive scheme of social insurance introduced which would provide for our people here some of the benefits which are provided for those who reside in Britain and the Six Counties, where their comprehensive <Col N="901" /> social legislation is much better in scope, and more generous in character than our legislation here.</P>
      <P>However, even this small step is welcome.  It will enable people with incomes above £600, and not exceeding £800, to cover themselves against such contingencies as the death of a breadwinner, unemployment, and sickness, and these are three scourges which it is not possible completely to insulate oneself against.  Any facilities for enabling workers, no matter what their capacity may be, to insure against these hazards is always welcome. There is one point in this Bill about which I am not very clear and I would like to get from the Parliamentary Secretary a definition of what he really means when he talks of providing credits to certain persons &ldquo;to enable them to satisfy the contribution conditions for benefit on again becoming insurable&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would take up his pencil for a moment while I put this question to him.  Take the case of an insured person who had less than £600 a year in 1955 and was, therefore, insurable.  In 1956 his pay went over the £600 mark and consequently he ceased to be insurable in 1956.  He retained that or a higher rate of pay in 1957 and he was, therefore, not insurable in 1957.  That position carried on and he is not insurable to-day because he has an income exceeding £600 per annum.  He is, however, entitled to-day, as he was since 1956, to become a voluntary contributor, not for unemployment benefit and not for sickness benefit, but he could become a voluntary contributor for widows' and orphans' pension purposes.  However, there were many such persons who did not avail of that facility, whether through inertia or because they long-fingered the opportunity they had of applying to become voluntary contributors until such time as their rights lapsed. I want to find out from the Parliamentary Secretary what the position of such a person will be as from the 1st January.  That person will become insurable again under this Bill when it becomes an Act.  What credits will be given to him to enable him to satisfy <Col N="902" /> the contribution conditions for entitlement to benefit?  Will he be given credits for the years 1956, 1957 and 1958 or will he be given credits for only one year?</P>
    <P>This is my second question.  If the person were insured in 1956, not insured in 1957 or 1958 because he had more than £600 per annum, he will however be insured in 1959, what credits will he get and how will he stand in respect of entitlement to benefit as from the 1st January or as from a later date in 1959?  I would like specific answers to these two questions and if I got them it would save me from having to make a much longer speech.  I do not know whether I can fragment my speech, awaiting answers from the Parliamentary Secretary, with the right to go on.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would like to answer my questions now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Norton and others in the House I welcome this change in the social welfare legislation which raises the ceiling for insurable employment from £600 to £800 a year. All of us will agree that there has been a long standing need to have that increase but it is a pity that a Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill such as this should be brought in for this specific purpose because I am sure if the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister will look around they will find that the provisions of the social welfare code need to be amended in very many respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the Long Title describes the Bill as one to &ldquo;amend and extend the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 and 1956.&rdquo;  It seems to be useless at this stage to ask the Government to improve the social welfare code to the extent of giving increases to very many people, many thousands of people, who are now dependent on social welfare benefits.  At all stages since the Government came into office they have resisted appeals, not alone from this House but from many deserving and well-intentioned associations outside, asking that increases be given especially to old age pensioners and to widows and orphans in receipt of non-contributory pensions and to others who receive benefits through social insurance.  As a matter of fact, rather than improve the social welfare code it seems to me that there is a special purge by the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to deprive hundreds, aye, thousands, of people from receiving the small pittance of which they are in receipt by <Col N="905" /> way of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>From the information I got from the Parliamentary Secretary to-day it seems to me that very many more people are being refused unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit than heretofore.  It seems from the speeches that we hear from the Government Benches that the majority of people now in receipt of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit are suspect.  Some of us do not mind when we hear certain sections of the community describe unemployed people who are in receipt of these benefits as wasters and scoundrels and as people receiving money for nothing and people who have substantial means but still draw money from the State.  When we have that attitude pursued by the Minister for Social Welfare, and in many cases by his Parliamentary Secretary, we begin to wonder if it is the deliberate intention of the Government and of the Minister for Social Welfare to attempt to save substantial sums of money by taking from these deserving sections of the community. We had another example of it in the past six months when the Unemployment Period Orders were extended by two weeks and the effect was to save £10,000 to £20,000 at the expense of those receiving unemployment benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to ask the Government to reconsider their whole attitude to appeals for improvement in the different allowances paid under the social welfare code.  I would respectfully ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider another very deserving section&mdash;those people in receipt of unemployment assistance, or should I say those people who should be in receipt of unemployment assistance?</P>
      <P>I have with me this admirable booklet issued by the Department of Social Welfare which sets out the various benefits available to those dependent on State assistance and those who are insured.  So far as unemployment assistance is concerned one of the qualifications is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the applicant is resident in the State, and has, at any time, been resident in the State for a continuous period of at least six months, that he or she is between the ages of 18 and 70 and that his or her means are not more than £98 16s. a year if living in an urban area or not more than £72 16s. a year if living elsewhere in the State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I submit to the Parliamentary Secretary that it is well-nigh time that the provision in regard to means be radically changed.  I have in mind many thousands of people whom one could describe as self-employed, for example fishermen, handymen in the country, men who ply trades as masons or carpenters, people who take task work.  These people could earn £98 16s. in three months or in six months, but the very fact that they got £98 16s. in a year and are not insurable means that for the rest of the year, if they cannot find work, they are not eligible for unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is unfair when we remember that the man who earns £10 for six months of the years is eligible after that possibly for unemployment benefit, but even if not entitled to <Col N="907" /> unemployment benefit, he is entitled to draw unemployment assistance.  He may draw £260 for six months. Because he is an insured person, or has been one, he is entitled to unemployment assistance.  But if he earns the same sum of money in some employment which is not insurable he is not entitled to unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I would therefore ask the Parliamentary Secretary at least to consider amending that portion of the social welfare code.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle says I may not talk about old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions or children's allowances and I therefore conclude by saying that while this is a welcome improvement I think it is generally rather a pity that the Bill should be introduced merely for the purpose of raising the ceiling from £600 to £800 a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the other Deputies in welcoming this amending measure.  Owing to the falling value of money it is time this step was taken and I must congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the manner in which he sets out to do the job.  I think raising the ceiling to £800, under present circumstances, is a reasonable approach and I am sure that in so far as this measure will facilitate insured people in regard to hospital benefits the extension now proposed will be very welcome.  From what I can gather from speeches already made I think there is more or less general agreement on this whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the scope of the existing organisation, especially in the case of field workers controlled by the Department of Social Welfare, will have to be considerably extended as a result of this legislation.  It is estimated, I understand, that income from increased membership will be approximately £130,000 per annum and that in itself will impose a rather severe strain on the existing organisation.  If the benefit the insured people are entitled to is to be paid promptly it will be necessary to extend the scope of the Department's organisation.  The <Col N="908" /> Parliamentary Secretary might very usefully specially consider one section of his staff that will have to deal with the problems arising from this legislation. I refer to the social welfare agents who were formerly National Health Insurance agents.</P>
    <P>Improved facilities are long overdue to these men particularly in regard to remuneration.  This legislation will add considerably to the numbers on their registers and I sincerely hope they will be rewarded for the extra duties to be imposed on them.  In the rural districts, where these agents come into the picture more than in urban areas, I think the time has arrived when some improvements might be recommended in their office organisation.  The men must provide offices at their own expense, except where they work in the Department's offices in the big towns. Most of them work on rather meagre salaries and cannot afford to supply first-class office organisation.  I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary now has an opportunity of examining the present situation and of coming to the assistance of the agents formerly employed by the National Health Society.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Corish who referred to the difficulties he alleged exist at present in getting unemployment, assistance and benefit.  Of course the purge that the Deputy complained of started, as far as I know, when he was Minister for Social Welfare and has continued under the present Minister and Parliamentary Secretary.  I have met many complaints arising as a result of the purge to which the Deputy refers and I think we can say that the worst of it is over.  Undoubtedly there are cases of suspicion particularly in connection with unemployment benefit. The social welfare code of 1952 has in some way, I think, influenced a number of people to try to qualify for benefit in a manner they could not easily attempt under the former Act. Cases of suspicion under this heading should be investigated but my complaint is that the investigation takes far too long.  Previously I appealed to the Parliamentary Secretary to try to make some arrangement to give priority to the investigation of such cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> The average claimant for unemployment benefit is usually a person, who through no fault of his or her own, is obliged to avail of that assistance during a period of unemployment.  It causes undue hardship if the relative claim is held up for any unreasonable period.  The general experience is that claims are held in suspense for five or six weeks.  That would be the minimum but I have met cases where it is ten or 12 weeks.  There is no delay when the claims get to headquarters; they are then dealt with expeditiously. The delay occurs mostly in the country because the social welfare officers are not handling the investigations immediately they receive a claim.  I do not know if that is due to the system under which the Department works but if it is I sincerely suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should look into the matter and try to give priority to these investigations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to certain anomalies connected with insurability of self-employed people and I share his views to a very large extent in that connection.  I am only sorry the Deputy did not find it possible to do something about that matter when he was Minister.  Sooner or later this very vexed question must be tackled.  I hope that this can be done by regulation and I take it the Minister will now look into the matter.</P>
    <P>There are many categories excluded from the full scope of insurance.  They are described as self-employed people. If they are self-employed, that is not their fault.  Indeed, such employment is altogether to their credit.  They are engaged in occupations which are not sufficiently remunerative to attract the industrial-minded type of employer and in order to keep themselves in employment, these particular workers have to engage in occupations on a share basis.  That refers particularly to fishing and, most particularly, to inshore and fresh-water fishing.</P>
    <P>These men are handicapped in relation to the assessment of means for the purpose of unemployment assistance. Any profit they make over a period is assessed purely as profit and that adversely affects their interests.  If they were ordinary wage earners they could earn ten times more over a <Col N="910" /> longer or shorter period and such earnings would not affect their position in relation to unemployment assistance. The present system imposes an unfair hardship on these self-employed people and I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will examine the position and try to meet, by regulation if possible and, if not, by amending legislation, the hardships to which I have referred.  I am glad that this measure has been introduced at this stage; it will be greatly appreciated by those wage earners in the £600 to £800 category.  It will give them much needed protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I read on the Order Paper some time ago that leave was being asked to introduce a Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill I tried to forecast what the contents of that Bill might be.  Here, I see that it is described as &ldquo;an Act to amend and extend the Social Welfare Acts of 1952 and 1956.&rdquo;  We know those two Acts cover a multiplicity of problems in relation to various classes of wage earners.  When I was trying to forecast what might be contained in this measure my thoughts immediately went to the old age pensioner trying to live on 26/- a week.  They travelled from there to the widow in receipt of a non-contributory pension and, from there, to those who are receiving unemployment assistance.  All those recipients, and they are numerous, are trying to live at the moment on an allowance which is not sufficient to keep body and soul together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here, we have a Bill intended to make the position easier for those who hitherto were able to avail of benefits under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, when their earnings were something in the region of £10 10s. per week, or less.  This Bill proposes that they will be entitled to avail of the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts if they are in receipt of £15 10s. per week.  Priority should have been given in this Bill to those who are receiving something less than a subsistence allowance.  This Bill will be a bitter disappointment to the categories I have mentioned&mdash;the old age pensioner, the non-contributory widow and the assistance classes.  They were the first who should have been considered <Col N="911" /> when amending legislation was contemplated.  Recently, we read that some 40,000 people were obliged to emigrate since the beginning of this year.  They were obliged to emigrate because they were not able to meet their responsibilities and commitments &mdash;many of them have families and dependants&mdash;on unemployment assistance and they had to seek a living wage elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Rising costs have deprived many people of benefits to which they were entitled hitherto.  Rising costs and the subsequent rise in wages put them in the position that they could not avail of benefits available to those receiving less than £11 10s. per week.  The ceiling is now being raised to approximately £15 10s. per week and those people will, to a certain extent, be able to avail of the benefits provided under the Social Welfare Acts in future.  I know that many of these people are living under very difficult conditions.  They have large families. They are trying to meet commitments, such as purchasing their own homes, liability for rates and other charges which apply to them.  Their liabilities are heavy and, with the passing of the years, their liabilities have increased.</P>
    <P>Some of these people were obliged to meet hospital charges in relation to members of their families.  There was a discretion for the purpose of enabling such people to get some kind of help under the existing Social Welfare Acts but, unfortunately, that was entirely discretionary.  It was not written into the Acts specifically. The result was that the moment they went over the £600 ceiling they were immediately faced with the obligation of meeting all these costs themselves.</P>
    <P>There are tragic conditions amongst families earning between £600 and £800 a year just as there are tragic conditions in families earning only £6 or £7 a week or families living on subsistence allowances.  There are tragedies in families of all classes.  The Act, so far as the limit of £600 applied, very often demonstrated the real hardship that can come upon a family where there was a chronic invalid child or <Col N="912" /> children requiring hospital attention and who were excluded from its provisions. Such people had been making contributions and were deprived of the benefit of those contributions when the income limit of £600 was exceeded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moloney referred to the position of persons who are described as self-employed and because of that description are unable to avail in full of the benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.  It occurred to me that such persons should be given an opportunity to qualify in full provided that they make income-tax returns annually.  If their income did not exceed the limits prescribed in this Bill, it would be fair to permit them to avail in full of the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>In so far as this Bill brings relief to quite a number of persons who have heavy responsibilities, I welcome it.  I feel the Bill was overdue having regard to the fact that there were so many persons who had gone over the £600 limit and who were finding it difficult to make ends meet and, in particular, finding it difficult to make up for the social services which they could have obtained before their income exceeded that figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill merely deals with a category of persons whose incomes are between £600 and £800. It brings them into insurance.  We all know the hardship that can occur when the bread-winner of a family is taken away and the widow is left with a noncontributory pension.  This Bill enables the widow to get a contributory pension.  That is one of the benefits of the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish was very severe in his criticism and went outside the scope of this Bill.  I shall be brief in my reply to him.  The Social Welfare Acts lay down the conditions to be fulfilled by persons claiming benefits.  It is the responsibility of the Department to ensure that those conditions are complied with.  Persons who do not satisfy the conditions cannot be allowed benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moloney referred to the social welfare officers in the Department. I do not know whether he was critical of them or not.  They are as fine a set of men as there are in the <Col N="913" /> Civil Service.  They have a most unpleasant job.  The means test is there and they have to carry out the rules and regulations given to them and, by and large, they do it fairly and honestly. Nobody envies them their position. Consequently, if the reference to them is in the way of criticism, I resent it very much.  I repeat, that they are conscientious officers who do their duty fairly and well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moloney also advocated an increase in the number of national health agents and officials of the Department.  We estimate that the number of persons who will come in as a result of this Bill will be about 18,000 and of them at least one-half will be State employees so that the amount of work that will devolve on the 260-odd agents will be very small.  This is not the place nor is this the occasion to deal with the remuneration of national health agents but I must say <i>en passant</i> that in the majority of cases it is not their only ocupation.  Many of them have other means of livelihood.  There are very few established in the Department outside the cities.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins was dealing with the case of people who died within the last two years.  When a person dies, any question of benefits accruing to him under the Social Welfare Acts must be determined by reference to his record at the time of his death. There can be no question of applying the provisions of this Bill retrospectively in such a case.  Contributions can be refunded only where they are paid in error.  They cannot be refunded by reason of the death of the insured contributor.</P>
    <P>One of the things that Deputy Corish advocated was an alteration in the means limit under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  This Bill does not deal with that but, if I may take the liberty in debate to deal with that point, I may say that if there is any set of people who receive social welfare benefits who need consideration it is those who have no income or means whatsoever, the people at the bottom rung of the ladder, and before anyone should attempt to raise the level of income of beneficiaries under the Act, <Col N="914" /> that category of people would need to be examined first of all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is concomitant with the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill and the basic reason for introducing it is the same, namely, to give entitlement to approximately the same number of persons, to the benefit of services under the Health Act, 1953, as were so entitled when the Act was introduced.  It will be recalled that the Bill to provide these services was introduced in 1952 and became law, not without opposition, in 1953.  Under it general institutional and specialist services, the maternity and child health service and the mental treatment service, became available to persons and their dependants in one or other of four categories.  Roughly speaking, these categories, which together make up what have become known as the lower and middle income groups, at the moment are composed of persons insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952; other adult-persons whose yearly means are less than £600; farmers the rateable valuation <Col N="917" /> of whose holdings is £50 or less; and persons outside these three categories who cannot, without undue hardship, provide the services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>The number of landowners with properties not exceeding £50 in valuation has not sensibly changed since 1952.  On the other hand, the number of persons within the remaining categories who were eligible for health services in 1953 has contracted substantially, because so many people are earning so much more.  The effect of this has been that many wage-earners for whose benefit the 1953 Act was enacted have ceased to be eligible for an important group of services which it was intended should be made available for them.  The aim of this Bill is to restore to those thus extruded the benefits which under the original Act they were entitled to.  Perhaps at this point I should stress that irrespective of the level of their earnings persons who can demonstrate hardship will, as heretofore, be eligible for the institutional and specialist services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the intrinsic justice of reinstating all those for whose benefit these health services were originally provided, I should like to point out that the amendments of the Social Welfare Acts proposed by the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill would make the assessment of entitlement a more complicated matter than it is at present if we did not make the income limitations under both codes coincide. At present, in so far as insured persons seeking health services are concerned, it is necessary only to establish that the appropriate contributions have been paid under the Social Welfare Acts. Once this fact has been established, it is not necessary to make further inquiries into the person's means or into the means of the members of his family residing with him.  Eligibility in this context is related to insurance under the Social Welfare Act of 1952. Unless the Health Act is amended to change this reference to cover the 1952 Act as extended by the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, which the House has just passed, those within the £600 to £800 limits would not become entitled, as insured persons to Health <Col N="918" /> Act benefits.  It would, therefore, be necessary to establish, in relation to each person in non-manual employment insured under the Social Welfare Acts, whether or not his annual income were above or below the old level of £600.  To attempt so to distinguish between the persons paying insurance contributions under the Social Welfare Acts would be administratively difficult and costly.</P>
    <P>In the case of the second category &mdash;non-insured adult persons whose yearly means are less than £600 and their dependents&mdash;the case for increasing the limit is, if anything, stronger than for the insured.  In the case of a person claiming entitlement under this, the assessment of eligibility is made on a family basis, which is not the case under the Social Welfare Act.  This, of course, makes it relatively more difficult for a non-insured person to establish his entitlement to the services; and it would be indefensible further to disimprove his position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the insured by not making a corresponding easing of the income limit.</P>
    <P>In the Health Act, 1953, yearly means for the purpose of determining eligibility for the &ldquo;under £600&rdquo; group includes the means of any unmarried son or daughter, stepson or stepdaughter living with the applicant. It has been represented to me that it is unfair to take all the income of such persons into account.  A typical case might prove the point.  Take for example, a married couple.  The husband retired with a pension of, say, £3 a week.  Living with their parents are a son and daughter who are working and earning, say, £9 a week. Because the family income under the law as it stands is £12 a week, or £612 a year, the parents are ineligible for services under the Act while the children, if they are in insurable employment are eligible.  Both the children might be saving to get married and, reasonably enough in those circumstances, not handing up all or even the major part of their earnings.  It is hard, I think the House will admit, to justify refusing services to the parents in such circumstances. <Col N="919" /> The extension of the family income limit from £600 to £800 will no doubt improve the position in such cases, but I feel that something more is required and, consequently, sub-section (4) of Section 1 provides that wherever the family includes more than one member with an income, the first £100 of each son's or daughter's income will be disregarded in calculating the aggregate of the family income.  I feel that the figure of £100 is a fair compromise between the interests of the family on the one hand and of the ratepayers and taxpayers on the other.  It is not unreasonable, however, to put a limit on the number of hundred pounds to be disregarded in this fashion and the limitation imposed in the Bill is £300.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to say how many people will be covered by the new provisions or what the additional cost will be, but it is estimated that the benefits of the Act may be extended to about 80,000 additional persons and that the additional cost will be of the order of £120,000, half of which will be borne by the Exchequer and half by the ratepayers. I am reluctant, as I have made clear in the past, to add substantially to the public expenditure on health services, but I feel that the additional charge must be accepted.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as I said at the outset, will in effect bring back within the scope of the services provided under the Health Acts a considerable number of persons for whom it was intended to provide such services when the 1953 Act was passed.  Clearly it involves no departure in principle from legislation which has already had the approval of the Oireachtas.  In those circumstances I trust the House will see its way to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>One cannot help feeling that when the Minister went to the trouble of introducing this Bill into the Dáil&mdash;a Bill which involves an amendment of our Health Act code&mdash;it was a pity he did not decide to deal with more than is dealt with in this Bill.  This is an insignificant measure designed to deal with, comparatively speaking, a very small <Col N="920" /> category of persons.  Indeed, I would have thought that what this Bill is designed to do could already have been done by the Minister by appropriate regulations dealing with the hardship classes under Section 15 of the Act.  I cannot help feeling that the Minister introducing this Bill is adopting the slogan &ldquo;much ado about nothing&rdquo;. Perhaps the Minister finds a Bill of this kind a welcome relief from writing letters to the newspapers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister proposes here is to adjust the charges of the Health Act, 1953, in accordance with what has already been done by this House a few minutes ago by amendment to the Social Welfare Act.  Since, under the Social Welfare Act, a limit for insurable purposes of £800 was laid down, it was obviously felt by the Minister that there should be written into the Health Act £800 instead of £600, although there is rather a <i>non sequitur</i> there because the £600 in the Health Act refers largely to self-employed persons.</P>
      <P>To appreciate the small scope of this Bill, Deputies must remember that those entitled under the Health Act code to institutional and other services, apart from general medical services, are covered by the definition of eligible farmers up to £50 and an insurable person under the Social Welfare code. Those who come in by reason of the fact that the family income is less than £600 must be a very small number, but it is sought to provide in this Bill that in relation to that small category of persons the family income limit shall in future be £800.</P>
      <P>To the extent that the Minister feels that the scope of the Health Act should be extended to deal with persons of that kind, certainly he is entitled to this measure.  I do not think anyone here could have the view that a person whose family income does not exceed £800 is a person in no need of some assistance from the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to health legislation we are all of the view that where a case of need has been established there is not only a necessity but also an <Col N="921" /> obligation on the State to assist.  The State assists the people in the class dubbed the middle income group because there is a gap between what they can provide themselves and what the actual cost is to them.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, there are persons whose family means might exceed £800 who are equally in need of State assistance by way of aided hospital and institutional services.  I should not like the Minister to feel that, while we agree with his Bill, we are doing anything of a notable kind for persons who might need assistance from the local authorities.  We are merely adjusting the £600 figure in the Health Act, 1953, in relation to the falling value of money over the past five years.  We are doing no more.</P>
    <P>We intend to affect by this legislation a very small percentage of those who need some form of State assistance in relation to health services. This is a very insignificant measure.  If the Minister has thought about it he might have been able to do this by a regulation or by a circular letter to the health authorities telling them to arrange in their treatment of cases of hardship in future for those whose family means did not exceed £800. The Minister finds it necessary to bring a Bill in here and I would not deprive him of the satisfaction which that undoubtedly means to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In the White Paper the Minister described this as being a corollary to the Social Welfare Bill which we have just passed.  As Deputy O'Higgins said, if one examines it it will be seen that it is an insignificant Bill.  I do not know whether or not that arises out of the fact that the Social Welfare Bill was introduced first when the Minister was not here. I do not know who took the initiative. I am not aware whether it was the Minister for Health or the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appears to occupy the role of Pooh Bah.  I think it is the Minister for Social Welfare we should blame.  This Bill is a corollary to the Social Welfare <Col N="922" /> Bill.  The Minister has gone just a little further.  For that he ought to be congratulated.  He says that the first £100 of the son or daughter, subject to a limit of £300 in the case of any family, is to be disregarded when treatment is suggested for those in the middle income group and whose income now must not exceed £800.  That is a very good departure and for that I should like to congratulate the Minister.</P>
      <P>He has done that in respect of the middle income group.  I do not know whether or not it would be appropriate to suggest on this Bill that the Minister ought to examine the case of the lower income group.  As far as my experience goes, all the income going into the one house is taken into consideration for the purpose of assessing means to establish entitlement or otherwise to Government health services.  If the Minister concerns himself about the proposal in respect of the lower income group and makes a change somewhat on the lines suggested, I think he would be doing something to eliminate a big number of grievances in regard to the Health Act services as far as that particular group is concerned.</P>
      <P>However, that may not be entirely a matter for the Minister.  As far as I am aware, he can only advise and not direct because I do not think he has power within the parent Act to lay down means in respect of the lower income group to the local authorities. I can assure the Minister that it is operated very harshly indeed by the local authorities who in all cases happen to be county managers or somebody appointed or designated by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also stated that this amendment does not debar a local authority, a county or city manager from assisting or providing health services for people with an income of over £800 per year where he is satisfied that they could not afford hospital maintenance, hospital treatment or specialist treatment.  In actual practice, the local authorities or the managers stick rigidly to the formula of the £600 per annum now <Col N="923" /> and will stick rigidly to the ceiling of £800 per year in the future.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, that was not the intention of the Act.  Various Ministers have given it as their opinion that there should be some sort of elasticity in approaching problems where families with an income of £800 per year cannot afford to pay big hospital bills, specialist or surgical fees.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what effect this measure will have on the voluntary health insurance scheme. As far as my information goes, it seems that the voluntary health insurance scheme has been an outstanding success but whether or not it has reached the zenith of its success I do not know nor do I know whether it is deemed to be an economic scheme.  I should like to know what, if any, effect this amendment will have on the voluntary health insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister apologises and says that this scheme is going to cost £120,000; that £60,000 will be borne by the State and £60,000 by the local authorities.  I do not think he need worry to any great extent about the burden this £60,000 will place on the local authorities throughout the country when one remembers that 80,000 people, as I think the Minister said, will, benefit by it.  I do not mind telling the Minister that the local authorities have devised ways and means of extracting money from him under the Health Act.</P>
    <P>I can give him one very good example.  It is one he should look into. Tens of thousands of people in this country had been drawing what is described as home assistance for a number of years past until the introduction of the disabled persons maintenance allowance.  The practice of some local authorities in the past two or three years has been to transfer many of these people from home assistance to the disabled persons maintenance allowance.  Any person who can prove by the production of a medical certificate that he or she is not fit to work is transferred to the disabled persons maintenance allowance. There is thus qualification for recoupment to the extent of 50 per cent. from the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> In my opinion many of these are purely home assistance cases.  The local authority saves money by taking them on home assistance and qualifies for the 50 per cent. refund from the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>There are two questions I wished to ask, the first of which has in a sense been asked&mdash;the effect of this measure on voluntary health insurance.  The second matter arises on the amendment that is proposed in regard to the allowance of £100 for certain members of the family up to a total of £300.  If I understand the thinking behind that section it is that if there is a relation, within the categories mentioned, in a family earning, £100 of the earnings of any one of those can be disregarded up to a total of £300.  That means that if there is only one such relation in a family a benefit of only £100 is given whereas if there are three or more such relations a benefit of £300 would be given. It seems to me that the case which would more nearly require it would be the case where there was only one such person in the family.  That is what leads me to ask the Minister whether he has considered a flat ceiling of £300 irrespective of how many are in the family.  I am just asking that in the form of a question at this stage and the necessary amendment could be considered later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one matter I should like to mention to the Minister at this stage although it would probably be more appropriate on Committee. I represent a constituency, as do many other Deputies where a number of our constituents have to depend on emigration and migration, particularly the latter, for a livelihood.  I know <Col N="925" /> a number of families in West Donegal where five or six members of the family migrate to Britain for 11 months of the year and return to this country for only two or three weeks during the summer when the public works on which they are engaged in Britain are closed down.  Their residence for all practical purposes is in Britain; they contribute very little to the household &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; or fund at home and pay their income-tax in Britain.  But when the father or mother of the household wishes to take advantage of the Health Act, the earnings of those unfortunate migrants who cannot procure employment here are taken into account in assessing the means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just the point.  I know cases where the local authority take into account the earnings of the entire household.  They may be migratory workers in England who are here for only a month at the very most during the summer and possibly another week at Christmas, but their earnings are taken into account in assessing the entire family income and very often these people are debarred from the benefit of the Health Act as a result of that.  If the Minister inquires from my local authority in County Donegal he will find out that not only must they give the names of the members of the household but the names of their employers in Britain; we all know the very large percentage of earnings which goes into the British Exchequer by way of income-tax, but that is not even taken into account.  The gross earnings of the members of the household in Britain are assessed for the purpose of the Health Act.  That is something the Minister should look into.</P>

They are taxed in Britain and we delve into their pockets when they come back, which is very unfair.  We have the same thing in investigating the means for the supplementary housing grants. The earnings they make in Great Britain are out of proportion in relation to this country but the cost of living in Britain is completely different. I would ask the Minister to look into the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather amused at Deputy O'Higgins describing this Bill as an insignificant little measure. It is a very significant measure and one that will save us many headaches particularly the part which deals with the raising of the ceiling limit from £600 to £800 and also the question of exclusion of a certain income of members of the family up to a maximum of £300.  Unfortunately it has been rather difficult to get the county health authorities to consider favourably the claims, in cases of hardship, of those who were outside the statutory limit in the past.  I myself have some experience in that connection and the only way I could make any reasonable headway was either to get the person concerned to appeal, if an appeal is appropriate or, alternatively, to ask the Department of Health to use their good offices with the local authority.</P>
      <P>I found that, on a number of occasions when steps of that kind were taken, some appreciable measure of relief was given.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy Corish who said that the county managers are inclined to stick hard and fast to the rule.  My experience was that, in the first instance, when I generally tried to settle the question through the local authority the latter would always insist that when the ceiling was exceeded there was no case of hardship and no matter how strongly you built up your case it was very difficult to get it accepted.  I think that was one good reason why the Minister thought fit to increase this limit.  I am glad he accepted that principle and generally accepted, I am sure, various representations made to him over the past couple of years.</P>
      <P>A very important addition to this measure is the fact that certain family income may now be excluded up to a limit of £300.  I think it is unnecessary for me to say why that should be the case because, in the course of his speech, the Minister pin-pointed the particular reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are just a few points, arising out of the Minister's introductory speech, to which I should like to refer. The first concerns insured persons who are now raised to a ceiling of £800 and <Col N="929" /> the special treatment to which that category of persons is entitled.  I have never been able to get clear whether they had a free choice of hospital.  I always assumed that insured persons were entitled to treatment in any hospital of their choice and that, because they were insured&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I accept your ruling and shall avail, I suppose, of another occasion to try to bring this matter to light.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other provisions in the Bill, what is very important is that it will facilitate particularly people who are subjects for treatment of mental disease.  There was a very significant drawback in the existing legislation, particularly for that type of person, because the admission to and the cost of treatment in mental hospitals was a great bone of contention. Patients were subject to being billed by the hospital authority for treatment and, in the case of some mental illnesses which were unfortunately likely to last a long time, the people who were responsible for the patient&mdash;the parents or members of the family who might normally be responsible for him&mdash;were placed in a very difficult position.  The health authorities, in cases of that kind, were rather insistent on some contribution. Very often, an exorbitant contribution was demanded.  From that point of view, I think the measure is a very marked advance and something that will help in no small way to get over that particular difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point arises out of a matter raised by Deputy O'Donnell.  I am rather surprised to hear that in his local authority the income of members of the family employed abroad was taken <Col N="930" /> into account when making assessments in relation to the Health Act.  Our general experience in our local authority was that only the income of those members of the family employed in the State and who were normally living in the household for some period of the year was taken into account. There may be a different system in every local authority.  I agree that there should be uniformity on this matter.  If there is any way in which the Minister could put that problem right, it would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill mainly tries to follow the lines set already by the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1958, in relation to the extension of the income limit from £600 to £800.  A very significant omission in this Bill which is entitled.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An Act to amend and extend the Health Acts, 1947 to 1957, and the Mental Treatment Acts, 1945 to 1957,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>is that it omits any relief whatsoever for persons with a valuation limit of £50.  That valuation of £50 was written into the previous Acts.</P>
      <P>Are we to assume that this Bill was brought in here to come to the rescue of people who were deprived of any advantages available under the previous Health and Mental Treatment Acts because their incomes went up over £600, which is approximately £11 10s. per week?  Because their incomes when up over £11 10s. a week, they were left without the benefits which can be provided under this Bill now if their incomes will not exceed £15 15s. a week.  Surely the Minister does not contend that costs for the holders of agricultural land and farmers whose valuations were £50, to which the existing legislation applies, have not gone up?  It is obvious that their costs have also gone up but there is not provision in this Bill to increase by 33? per cent. the valuation limit, which we ought to expect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A £50 valuation in certain parts of the country may seem a high figure but, particularly in the counties of Leinster, £50 is a very modest valuation. The man trying to live on land <Col N="931" /> with a valuation of £50 is getting a very bare living.  The statistics can show the average earnings of such farmers. It is obvious from those statistics that they should not have been omitted from the provisions of this Bill and that they should have been given the benefit of an extension of 33? per cent. in relation to the income which applied when the previous legislation was passed.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I should like to mention is that when it was listed for the First Reading, when we did not know what we might expect in this Bill, it was thought it would be designed to meet many of the hardships which wage-earners are obliged to face at the present time.  We know, for instance, that the Minister increased the maximum daily hospital charge from 6/- per day up to 10/- per day. In addition to that, those people are obliged to pay for X-rays and specialist fees.  No consideration has been given to those people.  Many of them, on £6 or £7 a week, are frequently being turned down by the various local authorities who contribute the balance of the hospital maintenance charges on their behalf.</P>
    <P>These people, and I mention people who might only be earning £5 or £6 a week, are obliged to pay anything up to 10/- per day for their maintenance in hospital, in addition to X-ray and specialist charges.  Nothing whatsoever has been done for them.  The county manager has the discretion to hear their cases but he follows the regulations, and he sends them a notice saying that people who, by their own industry cannot provide for themselves and their families, are the only people who will escape this daily charge for hospital maintenance.</P>
    <P>Those are people who meet real hardships, and they are frequently compelled by county councils and county managers to pay a bill that mounts up against them, owing to an unfortunate illness over a prolonged period.  That large bill has to be met by the payment of instalments over a long period, just because the county manager finds it necessary to interpret the Bill pointing out that they do not <Col N="932" /> belong to the assistance classes.  If they were wage earners, and if they were receiving over £5 a week, they were immediately liable for the payment of these hospital maintenance charges because the county manager, according to existing regulations, cannot see his way to remit them.</P>
    <P>This Bill has stepped a little further towards the relief of families who are obliged to undergo hospital treatment, but this £100 allowance for any wage earner in the family, in addition to the head of the household, could lead to a position where the head of the house would be earning £799, and there might be three members of his family earning wages, which would mean that the limit, for all practical purposes, would be raised, not from £600 to £800, but from £800 to £1,100.  I feel that this Bill was necessary, and it did not come before its time as far as it brings advantages to the people who were disqualified from the benefit provided by the existing Acts, when their earnings went up over £600 a year, which is slightly over £11 10s. a week.</P>
    <P>Rising costs obviously made it necessary for their incomes to be increased and now benefit will apply to people whose earnings do not exceed approximately £15 15s. per week. However, I think that when people with these scales were being considered the Minister should also have paid attention to the other end of the scale, in relation to the persons who were on low wage levels, apart from the assistance classes who are, of course, entitled to full and free services.</P>
    <P>Here, again, we have the example where a family may have the tragedy of an invalid child to look after and, of course, under the existing legislation if they are earning more than £11 10s. per week it would be necessary for them to meet the full cost of maintaining such an invalid child in an institution, or elsewhere.  I believe this will be a great advantage for those people because the maintenance of an invalid child, at the present time, in appropriate institutions is very high.  I think in these times we ought to give consideration, as far as the State is concerned, to ensure that families who <Col N="933" /> are unfortunate enough to have an invalid child, which is unmanageable at home by reason of mental illness or physical defect, should have proper institutions provided for them.</P>
    <P>At the present time the existing institutions for such children are managed and controlled by voluntary or religious organisations.  It is very humane work.  It is, if you like, the utmost for the highest, realising the real difficulties which would be caused in the home if people were compelled to keep those children.  I would like to mention that many of those families find it difficult to find a suitable place for such invalid children.  I feel that, within the health code, we ought to make an organised effort to ensure that proper attention can be given to those invalid children, and that their parents and families should be relieved of the hardship of trying to maintain them, or the worry of trying to find a place for them, because there is limited accommodation and a limited number of institutions dealing with patients of that type.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this Bill has been introduced, particularly as it deals with the invalid side as well as the normal health services.  Finally, I am disappointed that this Bill did not embrace more aspects of our existing health services.  Anybody who has anything to do with the administration of our health regulations, at the present time, knows that there is a considerable amount of confusion and disappointment caused when the regulations are being implemented and interpreted. It is hard to know whether the cause of that confusion is owing to misinterpretation, or to a defect in the existing health legislation, but anybody who has reason to avail of the services under these Acts usually find they get the wrong end of the stick, and the existing Acts do not provide for them the services which they had expected.  The health department of every county council is probably the busiest department, and it is busy because they are trying to administer the existing health legislation and interpret it for so many people who find they completely misunderstood it, and who find it does not <Col N="934" /> apply to them in the way they had expected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one or two brief comments on this Bill.  While I welcome the Bill it is a fact that mainly it is restoring the position that existed previously, and is now bringing the income limit more in line with the reduced value of money.  The Minister for Health, possibly, may be commended in his capacity as Minister for Social Welfare.  In practice it is extending to people with an income up to £800 benefits which were enjoyed by them when we had a somewhat lower cost of living and their income was £600.  The Minister, however, in referring to Section 1 (4) where he indicates his proposal to disregard the income of members of the family, a son or a daughter, stated in the course of his remarks that in his view such additional wage earners or salary earners in the family do not normally contribute the whole&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not say that.  I am sorry.  I shall tell the Deputy what I said.  I was giving an example.  I was pointing out it was possible that there might be a house with parents who had low incomes and there might be a son and a daughter living there and both the son and the daughter were contemplating marriage. I said that in those circumstances it would not be reasonable to expect that they gave up all or the major part of their income because they would be saving up for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I misunderstood the Minister but I will just refer to those particular circumstances. In no circumstances that I am aware of does the son or daughter give up all his or her income.  In fact, I think it fair to say that in the majority of cases they would not give up the major part of their income and I am not even alluding to those contemplating marriage.  If the Minister is concerned, as he said he was, with the family in which the son or daughter is contemplating marriage, I wonder if he will examine this aspect of the matter.  Frequently the position, particularly in the classes mentioned in the Bill&mdash;non-manual workers who <Col N="935" /> come within the middle income group &mdash;the practice is that, by arrangement with the parents, the son or daughter, for a fairly considerable period prior to marriage, give up not the whole or major portion of their income but none of their salary.  That is quite a common practice and in that regard the parents recognise the need for, and are prepared to make, sacrifices in order to try and assist their children who are contemplating marriage.  Consequently, if the Minister accepts that as a more than common position perhaps he might look again at the new steps he proposes to take.  This step of disregarding some of the earnings is a new step, even though I may be permitted to describe it as a very weak and faltering step, but nevertheless it is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>While the provisions of the Bill are an improvement and because they are an improvement in the Health Act, they should be welcomed generally in the Dáil.  In many cases when Acts of the House come to be implemented, both in rural areas and in constituencies in the City of Dublin, the intentions behind the introduction of an Act are frequently not given effect. For instance, reference has been made to the special maintenance allowance and, in effect, as has been mentioned by Deputy Corish, instead of those maintenance regulations being of value all that has occurred when it came to operating these regulations in many cases was that they were substituted for home assistance for persons suffering from diseases which prevented them from earning a livelihood or providing for themselves.  This was an Act of this House which was specifically designed to assist in a more concrete way people confined to bed, confined to the house, or people who, because of ill health, were unable to follow a vocation and provide for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of getting additional help what happened because of the way these things are implemented was that the recipient in many cases instead of receiving 10/- or 12/- home assistance got the equivalent in maintenance assistance.  The same thing can occur <Col N="936" /> generally in the application of benefits even under this Bill.  The intention of the House in passing the Health Act was to assist the people whether they were of the lower income class, or whether they were covered in the insured sections of the Bill or whether they would come under the middle income group, but when it comes to implementing the benefits then there is another story.</P>
    <P>I had a recent case where it was only possible after prolonged representations, to get the manager or his representatives, to mitigate payments for institutional services.  It was a case where they were aware of all the facts for some months and yet it took quite a considerable amount of representation before they saw the justification of mitigating the charge for institutional treatment.  I would ask the Minister to consider the position where there are a number of salary earners in the family of a person covered under this Bill, a non-manual worker or a person in the middle income group.  Many are at present earning a salary of £10 or £12 a week.  If they have one or two grown-up children also earning they may well be, because of the combined income, completely outside the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In many cases&mdash;and I am sure the Minister is aware of the fact&mdash;where people are covered by the health regulations and fall ill, not only do they have to face the normal expenditure, the normal hardships consequent on such illness but in many cases they must suffer additional economic hardship arising from the necessity, in the case of fathers of families to employ housekeepers to look after the house during the course of the illness.</P>
    <P>So far as the Bill is a small step forward it is welcome, but I would ask the Minister to consider the cases he mentioned himself, cases of young people intending to get married.  I would ask him to take into consideration that in many such cases the boy or girl concerned may make little or no contribution to the family expenses in the two years before the marriage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words regarding the operation of the Health Act.  The people were led to believe that if they earned less than £600 per annum they could get certain benefits under the Act but in actual practice they were turned down while earning as little as £450 in many cases.  There is, in fact, a means test. Families with five or six children have been turned down where the income was only £9 per week, whereas £600 per annum would represent £11 10s. per week.  Some of these people have come to me frantic with worry because they get hospital bills for £30 or £40, as if they could afford to meet them.</P>
      <P>I know that this Act has done more harm than good to the health of children. Formerly the children could go to the local dispensary and get treatment for colds and other childish ailments.  Now they are not treated unless they have a blue card.  The parents would have to get a private doctor and pay for medicine.  Those families that are just able to live cannot afford to pay out 10/- or 15/- for a child's cold in any week.  I have the experience, being a member of Dublin Corporation, of dealing with a large number of rent cases.  One of the excuses I got&mdash;and they gave evidence of it&mdash;was that they could not pay the rent because they had to pay the doctor in the same week.</P>
      <P>If it is understood that those with less than £600 get certain benefits, then that should be the case.  We put the question to our city manager on many occasions but no one answered. He says he will treat a case on its merits.  Whatever that means I do not know, but we do know that people come down there and cannot get a blue card.  They are not sending their children to doctors.  Formerly they could get a bottle for the child but now the child is allowed to suffer on. These regulations have done considerable harm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year during the 'flu period people had two or three children down with 'flu.  These people could afford to have the doctor only once and the children had to suffer on.  That is the effect of the Health Act.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter <Col N="938" /> further and to remember that families with £8 or £9 cannot afford to go to the doctor every time a child has a cold.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that at least they can get dispensary treatment even if they must pay for hospital treatment, and in that case that they should be able to pay on an instalment system so that they would not get these demands for £30 or £40.  I know of some people who ran away to England on account of them.  This Act is not operating as well as the Minister thinks and more harm than good is being done at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill to extend the limit from £600 to £800 for purposes of institutional and specialist services under the Health Act will be welcomed generally throughout the country.  In some cases the limit may be up to £1,100.  I want to know for my own information what percentage of the population will be covered in the lower income and middle income groups by the extension of the limit from £600 to £1,100.  We know that the percentage generally for the lower income group is 30 per cent. of the population but what percentage will now come under the Health Act as a result of the new limit?  It would be very enlightening to know that.</P>
      <P>I wonder what the effect of this Bill will be on the Voluntary Health Insurance Act?  I hope it is not intended to torpedo that scheme.  If the limit is raised to £800 and in some cases to £1,100 the income that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board expected will be seriously curtailed because I believe a large proportion of the population will be covered and what will be left to the Voluntary Health Board will be very little.</P>
      <P>I would also like some information regarding the conditions on which doctors were employed in recent years and who were given certain private practice.  Under the conditions of their appointment they were given private beds in hospitals.  How will they be affected by the extension of the income limit to £800?  I hope the Minister, when replying, will be able to give some information on these points.</P>

      <P>The provisions of this Bill must be welcomed by everybody as not alone in their nature acceptable but as highly desirable, having regard to the economic conditions in which we live and the rapidity with which they change, that change having in its turn, an adverse effect on static incomes.</P>
      <P>Apart from that welcoming statement I rise as a seeker after uniformity. Some Deputies seem to think on reading paragraph 4 and its sub-paragraphs that an income can go as far as £1,100 per annum, that is, the total income of a household, before that family is excluded from the provisions of this Bill.  I may be wrong, and this is a matter that has given rise to query on each side of the House&mdash;Deputy Vivion de Valera raised it and it was also mentioned by other Deputies&mdash; but I take a different view of this provision and I am afraid it is a view which will be taken by those responsible for the implementation of these provisions.  Take a man with an income of say £501 per annum with two children earning between them £600. Of that £600, I take it that £300 will be disregarded for the purpose of computing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Then let us take it that there are three children earning among them £600.  Of that £600, £300 will be disregarded bringing the total income of the household&mdash;the £300 that is taken into consideration from the earnings of the three children and the £501 from the earnings of the parent&mdash;to £801 thereby putting him outside the scope of the benefits intended by this Bill.  That is the meaning I take out of it.  Other people have taken the meaning that the ceiling must be £1,100 before anything happens. I think that is something upon which the Minister should be quite specific in his reply before members of his own Party in particular are let loose on the country over the weekend to praise him for this wonderful lift in relation to the new health scheme.  It is essential that there should be clarification of this matter and what is intended should be perfectly clear. <Col N="940" /> Uniformity should prevail in the implementation of measures of this kind. All too often it is the experience of Deputies on both sides to find two people in rural areas, with similar holdings, similar incomes, similar stock, and A has his medical card while B has been refused it.  It is that kind of thing which leads people into the belief that they have to belong to some camp or other before they can qualify.</P>

      <P>There is also the corollary, following from Deputy Brennan's interjection, that A's lies may be more acceptable than B's or, to go a step further, that the telling of the truth may be less effective than the telling of lies.</P>
      <P>In matters of this kind uniformity of implementation is most desirable.  The Minister should concede that principle straightway.  Deputy Sherwin has told us that he knows people with £450 income who were denied the benefits of this type of legislation.  It is all very well for local authorities to say that each case is considered on its merits and certain people have to be rejected because their means exceed the statutory limit.  What amazes me is that people are not more challenging in relation to the rights they should enjoy under the various provisions of these enactments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though this is clearly just another patch on the patchwork quilt we call health services, I suppose it must be welcomed. It is clear to anybody who has any experience of the operation of health services at the moment that it cannot possibly answer the needs of the people for a properly organised health service based on a completely free and no-means-test principle.  The raising of the income level from £600 to £800&mdash;and even if it is extended to £1,100&mdash;will not be an answer to the real needs of the people for a proper health service.  As long as the means test persists we will have different standards of health services.  We will have the best that money can buy for those who can afford it and a <Col N="941" /> lower standard for those in the lower income groups subject to means test. There is no doubt about that from a medical point of view.</P>
      <P>Anybody who has any experience knows that, when there is a choice as between private medicine and means-test medicine, the best service is available to those who can pay as against those who are subject to a means test. We have plenty of examples to show that the proper solution will only be found by getting rid of the means test altogether.  That has been proved in our own country in relation to the tuberculosis service and the fever hospital service.  We have the example then of the British health service which probably is the finest in the world and in which there is no means test.  That is the only kind of service which will give equity of treatment.</P>
      <P>In 1951, when we had this crisis and all the discussion on the means test or no-means-test, people were slightly confused on the issue as to what precisely was meant by a means test at that time.  One constructive and useful purpose achieved by the legislation which has been passed since then is that it has educated the people in a most acute and painful way into the real meaning of what a means test constitutes in health services.  When the time comes for us to have another national debate on health services, one thing is certain; the ordinary people will be unanimous in their understanding of the real implications and the injustices inevitable in a means test and the need for its complete elimination from our health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this small advance since it will help to continue the education of our people and ensure that we will have in time a free health service similar to the T.B. service and the fever hospital service now.  At the moment there is no general practitioner service so far as the lower income and middle groups are concerned.  A mother with even one child is often in dire need of such a service when she is not sure whether the child is suffering from some simple ailment or in the early stages of pneumonia.  Her problem is a grave one and her position has motivated the legislators in more progressive <Col N="942" /> countries into ensuring that health is something which is above the market place, something for which the community must provide so that nobody need worry unduly should ill health strike.</P>
    <P>This Bill, I suppose, is just another short step towards the just society that we all hope to see established in time. It is quite clear that administering a means test is a very difficult task. Local authority officials are themselves confused.  They try to interpret the laws we pass and we cannot blame them if they adhere to a rigidly literal interpretation of what we enact.  Their interpretation may be strictly legal and very parsimonious indeed.  The Minister should consider this question of the administration of means tests.  First of all, there is the tremendous cost involved in keeping the bureaucracy needed to inquire into means and to changes of means by improvement in salary and improvement in conditions, which are extremely complicated things to assess.</P>
    <P>That was put to me as one of the biggest objections by some members of the British Labour Party who were over here eight, nine or ten years ago when we were discussing the whole question of means test.  Obviously, they had an ideological objection to a means test but they said that probably the biggest objection to the inclusion of a means test in that service was the necessity to retain the very expensive and complicated bureaucracies in order to try to assess means.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has any close contact with his constituents will know that there are difficult borderline cases, people who are certain they should be included in the scheme and who are not included and who have a great sense of grievance against people who, they think, have £15 or £20 a week and who get the blue card, the red ticket or whatever it may be.  There is this sense of real or imagined injustice as a result of the very variable interpretation of the legislation that passes through the House.</P>
    <P>These are the main considerations, the medical consideration, clearly, being the most important.  We have shown in our legislation that you will <Col N="943" /> get the most just, equitable and efficient form of health service where you get rid of the means test altogether.</P>
    <P>A second point is that where you have a means test there are borderline cases which create so much discordance amongst neighbours and a sense of grievance, real or imaginary, and because of that the means test is undesirable. Further, there is the needless expense of the administration of a means test which is involved in the retention of a very considerable bureaucracy by each local authority.  There is the further consideration that the inquiry into means, which, no doubt, in most cases is done in as tactful a way as possible, is a thing which leads to a great deal of hardship where there are young people trying to save up to marry, and so on, who find as members of families that they are suddenly billed for the sickness of a member of the family.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough in a family to have the awful worry of one of the members being sick without having in addition the responsibility of having to try to find the money to pay the bills at the end of the person's illness.  It is a matter which I would ask the Minister seriously to consider.  There was a time when he had the most progressive views on these questions.  I should like him to think about it again because if he were to go around the average mothers in the poorer areas of his constituency, those who are not in benefit, he would find that there is a considerable amount of hardship and a lot of distress amongst people who do not come under the existing health schemes.</P>
    <P>The only other consideration that the Minister might bear in mind is that in the whole question of the treatment of the sick early diagnosis is of considerable importance.  Where people are faced with the ordeal of going through a means test in order to get access to the benefits of a health service they tend to defer going to the doctor, in which case, by the time they go they are very much more in need, very much more sick than if they could have ready access to the health service. We found in the tuberculosis service <Col N="944" /> that one of the greatest aids to early diagnosis was the ready access to a health service.  It is a most important consideration.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will understand from his own experience that people naturally will tend to defer as long as they can committing themselves, first of all, to finding out if they are seriously sick and to defer the treatment of serious illness until they are, possibly, incurable or in such a condition that it will take a very much longer time to cure them than would have been necessary if they had a health service readily and easily available and did not have the overriding fear that when the time came to pay for treatment they would not have the money.  The only solution is, not merely to shift up the means test level &mdash;which, of course is always welcome and I welcome this as an improvement in the level&mdash;but to get rid of it altogether.  If the Minister does that, he will make a real contribution towards the betterment of the health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Browne will, I hope, appreciate that it is not out of any discourtesy to him that I do not propose to discuss the principle of the means test upon a measure of this kind. This is a Bill to amend the Act of 1953 and the principle of the means test is embodied in that Act, so I do not think it is really germane to the present measure to discuss it at length.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins described it as an insignificant measure.  I am sorry if a letter of mine has caused him to look at this Bill through the large end of the telescope and, therefore, rather to whittle down its significance; but you cannot so describe a measure which is going to give to 80,000 persons the benefit of the services provided under Section 15 of the Act of 1953.  Of course, it is not by any means as comprehensive in its scope as some Deputies would like, but it does represent an attempt, at any rate, to retrieve the position and to bring back again within the ambit of the Act all of those whom the Act was originally intended to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who have been displaced in their entitlement by reason of the <Col N="945" /> change in the level of prices over the past five years have been mainly those engaged in trade and industry and commerce.  Farmers' valuations have not changed.  I would say that the vast majority of landholders, or even every surviving farmer, who was entitled to the benefit of Section 15 when the Act was passed remains entitled to it; and I cannot see any justification in present circumstances for raising the valuation limit so far as they are concerned.  That is my answer to the criticism which Deputy Rooney made of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins suggested that it would have been possible to do what the Bill proposes by having resort to the hardship provisions of the Principal Act.  It is suggested that we could do it by regulation.  I doubt whether we could do it by regulation.  He went further and suggested that a circular letter to the county managers would bring within the scope of this measure those whom it is intended to benefit. There are 80,000 persons who will benefit under this Bill.  They will be entitled to the institutional and specialist services which are provided under Section 15 of the Act.  I think it would be a very irregular procedure and certainly a very deplorable one if, without resort to or sanction of Dáil Éireann, we were to widen the scope of the existing services to that extent.  It would be undesirable also from another point of view.  After all, if we tried to do it in the way the Deputy has suggested, it would mean that those 80,000 persons would be getting their entitlement at the sole discretion of the county manager.  I think it is very much better to give them legal entitlement to the services under Section 15.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish and Deputy Vivion de Valera, and subsequently Deputy Carty, asked how the voluntary health insurance scheme would be affected by this measure.  I do not think it will be affected to any significant degree.  One cannot say how many of the 80,000 persons who will be brought again within the scope of the Act of 1953 might have covered themselves now or in the future under the voluntary health insurance scheme. <Col N="946" /> It is reasonably clear, however, that the larger proportion of those who have availed themselves of the schemes of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board are people who would be above the £800 limit.  That is the opinion which I think it is fair to form from the facts which have been submitted to me.</P>
    <P>When the voluntary scheme was originally in contemplation, it was assumed that about 500,000 persons represented the maximum number which in all circumstances might be covered by the schemes of the board. That was an absolute maximum. The actual number who would cover themselves by agreements with the board would normally be very much less than this.  According to the board's first annual report, there are two categories of persons covered by its schemes.  The first comprises those who have insured themselves under the basic scheme&mdash;they number 8,000 persons.  Those who have covered themselves by the more expensive schemes amount to 15,000 persons.  It is clear from those figures that the general tendency has been to accept the more expensive schemes.  For that reason, I assume that by far the greater portion of the 80,000 who would be covered by this amending Bill are persons who would not be insured at all under the voluntary health insurance scheme.  I do not think that the board itself would differ greatly with me in that opinion.</P>
    <P>Another point was raised by Deputy Vivion de Valera in the first instance, and referred to again by Deputy Lindsay. I think both Deputies were labouring under a misapprehension. Deputy Lindsay was nearer the mark than Deputy de Valera was, because Deputy Lindsay assumed that there could be a case of a parent who had an income of £501 and had three children each of whom was earning £200 a year.  He said, of course, that only £100 of the earnings of each child&mdash; that is, £300 in all&mdash;would be disregarded from the point of view of calculating the family income.  That is quite correct; but because we disregard the first £100 of each child's income <Col N="947" /> when we are calculating the total family income, it does not follow that the family income is only £801.  The total income earned by all the members of the family normally resident in that one household remains at £1,101, in the case which Deputy Lindsay cited, even if for the purpose of this scheme we are aggregating that at only £801.  Of course, it looks a terrible hardship to say that a man is to be excluded from the benefit of this scheme because his income is £801, but I would suggest that if he takes one Saturday morning off in the year he would very quickly get rid of that impediment to participation in the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think my explanation has also answered Deputy Vivion de Valera's criticism.  The real point is that while we are prepared to assume and are assuming for the purpose of the concession that every child will earn more than £100, it is not necessary to assume that at all.  We are assuming that the income of the family will be the income of the parent plus the income of up to three children who may earn £100 or more than £100.  If each child should happen to be earning more than £100, then the income of the family, whether we make the allowance or not, is the larger the more the children earn.  If there is only one child earning, there is no reason for saying that that child should be treated, so far as the assessment of his income is concerned for the purposes of this legislation, as if he were three children&mdash;which is, I think, the point Deputy de Valera was making, that we should give £300 in the case of the one child because he was the only earner in the household who was not a parent and was not the head of the household. On that aspect, surely it will be understood that the other children have no income and therefore their earnings cannot go in any way to swell the total of the family income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I understand that.  What we are talking about here is not the personal income of any one individual: what we are discussing is the income of a family treated as a unit.  For that purpose the operative limit of income under the legislation is £800; but it is quite correct to say that in certain circumstances it may be £1,100&mdash;the £800 plus £100 for each of the three children.  There is no use in trying to ring the changes on this.  For all practical purposes we take the £100 as the norm and we say that if by any chance a child earns £100 or under, even though the aggregate family income may be in fact £900, it is still treated as £800.</P>
      <P>I must say I am sorry I cannot have very much sympathy with the point which Deputy Larkin made.  After all, the Constitution provides and I think the canons of Christianity also regard the family as a unit.  Children are bound as a matter of natural duty to care for and assist their parents.  That is a fundamental principle.  If those children are to get married or something like that and the parents decide they will not ask them to contribute to the support of the household, I do not think those parents have any right to pass portion of the burden of maintaining the household on to other persons quite outside the family.  That is my answer to Deputy Larkin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did cite the case of children saving up to get married as a justification of what I was proposing to do.  As an example, I said it might happen that there would be circumstances in which it was not equitable, having regard by and large to general considerations, to regard the whole of a child's earning as inuring to the benefit of the family as a unit.  Deputy Larkin said they would probably spend quite an amount upon themselves, but if they do that they do so with the permission of their <Col N="949" /> parents; and if parents permit their children to spend every penny they earn and to disregard their responsibility to the family as a whole, as I say, that is the look out of the parents. They cannot expect that other people will bear the burden the children of the household are not prepared to accept.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carty wanted to know how this Bill would affect the position of doctors.  The position of doctors will remain unchanged under this Bill, the only thing being that if any of those 80,000 persons require the services concerned they will be entitled to them.  Otherwise the position so far as the medical profession is concerned will be quite unchanged.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell cited the case of persons in Donegal who were earning their livelihood abroad.  He did not make a very good case because he mentioned that these people only returned home perhaps for a month during the summer and perhaps a week at Christmas, making five weeks in all; but they were regarded as being &ldquo;normally resident&rdquo; and therefore their income was aggregated with that of the members of the family who remained at home.  Of course, I cannot be responsible for the way which the term &ldquo;normally resident&rdquo; is interpreted but it would seem to me that that certainly was not a case of normally resident, even if they did happen to appear on the electoral register.  There is another way of dealing with that which I will not suggest to Deputy O'Donnell because he probably knows it.  I am sure if he were to adopt the remedy he has in mind it would be found to cut both ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But he made a suggestion which at first sight appears to be a very facile solution.  He says we should exclude from the calculation of family income income not earned within the State.  I can see many objections <Col N="950" /> to that argument.  I can think of a person making a trip on an ocean liner.  The income made during that period would not be income earned within the State.  If he happened to be sailing with a master's ticket or a first mate's ticket and making very substantial income and maintaining a home here he would still under those circumstances appear to qualify for a medical card.  In the same way you might have a person selling on commission, going abroad and securing a very substantial contract on which he would be paid very substantial commission. That would not be income earned within the State but still he would become entitled in certain circumstances to have his name entered in the medical register.  I suggest the more you would examine that remedy for the problem Deputy O'Donnell has in mind, the less you would find it to be administratively possible or an equitable solution.</P>

      <P>In dealing on the Second Stage with the question of the contribution, the Minister gave the House a little homily on the duties of the family.  I wonder would he follow that up by giving the House some information?  The information may not be readily available to him, but nevertheless I want to ask this question: &ldquo;What percentage of the children of the nation hand up the major portion or even 40 per cent. of their income towards the family budget?&rdquo; We can hear laid down what may be accepted as the basic truths of the duties of the members of the family to each other, the duties of the children to their parents and so on. As a member of a local authority, this type of problem comes to my attention very frequently.  The Minister makes his position clear.  He says it is the duty of the sons and daughters in employment to contribute if necessary the major portion of their own earnings towards the family income.  But in practice that is not followed anywhere in this country.  As I understand it, the general practice is that sons and daughters earning, in the normal circumstances when the parents are healthy and the father working, contribute to their own keep, their shelter, their food, perhaps, and their clothes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be very much interested if the Minister could indicate whether employed children contribute to any extent on the lines he states.  If such an ideal situation existed, there would be a good deal less trouble and fewer economic difficulties in many of our families.  As members of the Minister's own Party are surely aware and as the local authorities are aware, when it comes to the question of contributing to the family income by way of assisting in the payment of rent these employed children indicate very very often that they have their own personal <Col N="952" /> commitments, including the necessity of providing for an approaching marriage, which might preclude their making any significant contribution to the family income.</P>
    <P>Whatever the Minister may say, it is not the practice in the country for the children who are earning to contribute the major portion or even 50 per cent. or, indeed, 40 per cent., except in some rare cases directly towards the family.</P>

    <Title>Committee On Finance. - Rent Restrictions (Continuance and Amendment) Bill, 1958&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Last year when asking the House to approve of extending the Rent Restrictions Acts up to the end of this year, I indicated that a fresh examination of the rent control problem had been initiated departmentally in order to take account of the economic and other changes that have taken place since 1951-52, when the Conroy Report on rent control was prepared.  During the present year the Government have examined the major aspects of the problem and have authorised the drafting of a comprehensive Bill which will repeal the existing Acts and re-enact them with <Col N="953" /> modifications.  The drafting of the Bill is at present proceeding but, owing to its length and the technical and complex character of the subject, it will take some time to prepare.  I expect, however, to be in a position to introduce it in the New Year, when Deputies will have an opportunity of discussing the Government's proposals. Pending the enactment of the comprehensive Bill, it is desirable that the Acts should not be allowed to expire and, accordingly, this Bill proposes to preserve the <i>status quo</i> for landlords and tenants in the meantime.  I ask the House to give it a Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>From its very nature, this is merely a continuation Bill to preserve the <i>status quo</i> and the amount of control we have, in pursuance of the rent restrictions codes at the moment. We on this side of the House agree to give this Bill a Second Reading.  It is also extremely heartening to find that the Government are preoccupied with problems arising out of landlord and tenant law and rent restrictions generally.  All I can say is that this speed on behalf of the Government must be due to the inclusion in the Cabinet of my successor, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, who, in 1950, had some hard things to say about commissions and the great lack of necessity for them.</P>
      <P>It is to be hoped that there will not be any undue delay in the presentation of this comprehensive Bill to the House and its subsequent implementation. If there is to be any delay, I would commend to the Minister the advice of the Minister for the Gaeltacht, then Deputy Moran, contained in column 1129 of Volume 123 of the Official Report in which he stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We know that, but there is no necessity to wait until the 31st December, 1952, to face up to the problem.  I am telling the Minister here and now that that problem can be met by him and by the Government, <Col N="954" /> if they are prepared to face their responsibilities inside 24 hours; and there is no reason why the tenants in this country should be exploited because the Minister or the Government are not capable of making up their minds on this vital problem until 31st December, 1952.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those were the words spoken on the occasion of the introduction by Deputy MacEoin, when he was Minister for Justice, of a continuation Bill similar to this.</P>
    <P>I just use that quotation as an example of the difference between attitudes at various times and in various regimes here.  As I said, I welcome this initiative on the part of the Government.  I think the measure will be welcomed by everybody, by those who practise in the courts in the various aspects of rent restrictions and by the landlords and tenants.  I hope everything will be brought up to date, due regard being had to the hardships of each party and the economic values obtaining at the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to add to what I already said.  It is hoped to bring in the comprehensive measure some time in the New Year when every Deputy will be provided with an opportunity of discussing the Bill and putting forward his own views on the question.  I do not think there is anything I could add to that.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take remaining stages today.</P>
      <P>Bill considered in Committee.</P>
      <P>Sections 1 to 3, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P>Title agreed to.</P>

      <P>The best available indicator of the general purchasing power of money in this connection is the consumer price index.  Between mid-May, 1956, and mid-August, 1958 (the latest date for which figures are available) this index (base: mid-August, 1947=100) increased by 9.0 per cent.  The following statement shows the weekly amounts (to the nearest penny) which represented 9.0 per cent. of each of the minimum weekly rates specified in the Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) Order, 1956.</P>
      <P>ADJUSTMENTS in the statutory minimum wage rates proportional to the change in the Consumer Price Index between mid-May 1956 and mid-August 1958.</P>
