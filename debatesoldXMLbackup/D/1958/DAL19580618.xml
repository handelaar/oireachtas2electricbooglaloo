    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together. I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to a question by Deputy Norton on this subject on 12th March last.  On that occasion, I indicated that in my view improvements in the conditions of employment of workers, over and above those prescribed by legislation, can be more satisfactorily arranged by the negotiation of voluntary agreements between representative organisations of employers and employees and that legislation to amend the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1938, was not at present in contemplation.  I see no reason to alter this view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in so far as the larger units of workers have generally enjoyed the benefits of the Holidays (Employees) Acts, because of the machinery he has mentioned, at this stage he might think it worthwhile to extend the protection of the Government and the Dáil to those employed in the smaller units where it is difficult to ensure that reasonable periods of rest are provided by trade union-employer negotiation? Would the Minister consider that angle of the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is as I have expressed it.  I prefer that progress in this matter should not be made under the compulsion of legislation.  If, however, it were demonstrated that there were difficulties existing of a character which only legislation could resolve, I would be prepared to consider the matter further, but with some reluctance. The evidence would have to be very conclusive that State action was essential to get the desired results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has answered Question No. 5. Surely that is not a matter for trade union-employer negotiation?  The qualification is laid down in the 1939 Act and that Act can be amended only by the Minister and the Oireachtas.  Has the Minister considered the desirability of introducing a change in the legislation following upon, first of all, the increase in the cost of living over the years and, secondly, the wage adjustments which have necessarily taken place, particularly in relation to the current value of the £ as against the period referred to in the 1939 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered Question No. 5.  At least, the limitation to which the question refers does not prevent anyone enjoying any benefit.  If it were that kind of limitation it would require revision.  It merely means that the compulsory application of the legislation is confined to a particular class and while, no doubt, the limit fixed in the Act is now out of date, at the same time my feeling is that it is preferable that the extension of the benefit should be on the basis of voluntarily concluded negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether any financial assistance is to be made available to the Bon Secours Hospital, Cork, so that its new maternity wing may function as a teaching hospital; and, if so, when such financial aid may be expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that what the Deputy has in mind is the possibility of making a grant available from the Hospitals' <Col N="168" /> Trust Fund towards the capital cost incurred by the Bon Secours Order in providing a new maternity unit as an extension to their hospital.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to a capital grant was decided some years ago.  I am in full agreement with that decision. The order first applied for a grant in October, 1954.  At that point I understand that planning of the new unit was being finalised and the order were hoping that building work could be undertaken shortly afterwards. The application was carefully considered in the light of the position of the Hospitals' Trust Fund at that time and other long-standing commitments in respect of the provision of maternity accommodation in the Cork area. The order were informed in December, 1954, that the position of the fund would not permit of any financial assistance being made available towards the cost of the project and that it had been decided that within the limited funds available the authorities of Erinville Hospital who had been pressing for many years for assistance to enable them to improve the very unsatisfactory accommodation in their present hospital should be assisted to provide such accommodation on the existing site.</P>
      <P>The Bon Secours Order proceeded with the new extension notwithstanding the decision that a grant could not be made available.  They repeated their application on a number of occasions subsequently but there was no alternative to informing them that the earlier decision could not be altered.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state the weekly amount of the recent Civil Service award offered to (a) full-time and (b) part-time local agents of his Department; and, if there is a differentiation, what considerations have <Col N="169" /> applied when determining whether agents are full-time or part-time employees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy) Michael Joseph Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The term local agent covers all agents employed by my Department, excluding the established agents serving in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  All local agents without differentiation are regarded as part-time employees and, as such, qualified for the award of 5/- per week granted to part-time civil servants generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary think it is just that full-time men should get an increase of 5/- and that part-time men should get 10/-?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not fully understand the Deputy, but the answer to the question put to me here is that the particular employees are part-time and as such got an increase of 5/- each. Many of them are postmen or rent collectors; more are home assistance officers; and their maximum working time, with five exceptions, does not exceed 20 hours a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare why share fishermen are not eligible for unemployment benefits under the current social welfare code, as such workers are insurable under the Social Welfare Acts in all other respects; whether he is aware that the present arrangement imposes a severe hardship on the persons affected; and, if so, whether he is now prepared to make a special examination of the matter with a view to restoring to these fishermen, and to such other categories of not fully insured workers as he considers appropriate, the standard rates of unemployment benefit under the ordinary qualifying conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Social Welfare (Modifications of Insurance) Regulations the employment of share fishermen is insurable at a special rate of contribution which <Col N="170" /> does not include cover for unemployment benefit.  I am not aware that this provision imposes a severe hardship on the persons concerned.</P>

      <P>The number of national schools in the constituency of Dublin South (Central) is 50 and the average number of pupils on the rolls in those schools during the year ended 30th June, 1957, was 16,132.  I am advised that five of the schools are in need of replacement by new schools.  The preliminary arrangements for the erection of new schools to replace two of these schools are well advanced.  In the case of the three remaining schools (which form one group) it has not been possible, so far, to obtain a suitable site for the required new schools.</P>

These matters have not yet been dealt with and, until they are dealt with by the local authority, there is nothing my Department can do.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Sanction to the acceptance by Dublin Corporation of a tender for the building of a scheme of 70 flats at Vicar Street was given on 11th October, 1957.  A decision on a revised proposal of the corporation to build 54 flats on the site was given by my Department's letter of 28th May last. I am not in a position to state yet when the building of the flats will be commenced.</P>
      <P>I should add, however, as I intimated to the deputation which I met from the Dublin Corporation yesterday afternoon&mdash;and also the representatives of the Francis Street Traders' Association&mdash;that I shall have a decision conveyed to the corporation in time for the housing committee meeting, which I understand will take place on Friday morning.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the Deputy's assertion; but I think the Deputy will agree with me when I say that, while he makes that suggestion to me, it should not in any way imply that it is the fault of the Department. Faults they may have, but I do not think they can be blamed for the seven or eight years' delay in this case.  It has had a rather long and chequered history, as we know, and the only thing I can say about it is that, as far as my Department and I <Col N="177" /> are concerned, the very fact that we are now at this stage meeting the corporation to find a compromise to the deadlock reached on this particular matter is due entirely to our desire to get the building started&mdash;even though it may well be that it is not as we would like it to be started.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the period is long, but I do not agree that it is a delay which has been occasioned by the failure of my Department to grant sanction.  I think the House should be aware that the delay&mdash;the recent delay, leaving out the past history of the scheme altogether&mdash;has been brought about by virtue of the fact that the original scheme as presented and agreed to by the Department was found, on investigation, not to have got the full rights and clearance of the public roadway that existed in the midst of the proposed site.  That oversight was not an oversight on the part of the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Resolution is preparatory to amendment No. 14 which deals with entertainments tax. Amendment No. 14, if agreed to, will be a new section in the Bill which will restrict, as from 19th June, 1958, the operation of Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1953, to film shows not exceeding 2½ hours in length.  This section in the Bill proposed to give a remission of tax under certain conditions and it is proposed to amend the Bill now so that these concessions in entertainments tax will not be given to people under certain conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> First, I should say that Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1953, authorises a 50 per cent. repayment of entertainments duty in respect of cinema shows one-third of which consists of an Irish-language film or one-half of which consists of films in a language other than English; but from mid-1957 onwards there was a gross abuse of this provision. Until mid-1957, there was no claim for remission under this section. At that time, a certain proprietor of cinemas began showing Irish language films in two of his cinemas for about 1½ hours either before or after the usual evening programme of English-language films which lasted from 8 p.m. until about 10.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>In that way, the Irish-language film actually formed one-third of the total film show because it was shown for 1½ hours from 6.30 until 8 and the ordinary film show followed from 8 to 10.30, and he was therefore entitled to repayment of the entertainment duty.  Having succeeded in two of his cinemas, he extended the practice to five other cinemas and this practice was followed by other cinema-owners, until, in March, 1958, the concession had extended to 36 houses altogether.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Irish-language film was shown in these houses left no doubt whatever that it was used merely as a legal device to get remission of entertainments duty. There was no publicity indicating that an Irish film was being shown and there was a very small attendance&mdash; in fact, in some cases, none.  People came in in the ordinary way about 8 o'clock when the Irish film was almost completed.  Also, the practice in many places was to show a very short Irish film over and over again until 1½ hours were completed.</P>
    <P>To counter these abuses, the Government, on March 21st last, under the Imposition of Duties Act made an Order entitled Imposition of Duties (Entertainment) No. 23 Order restricting, with immediate effect, the operation of the concession provision precisely on the lines set out in the draft section which is now on the paper as amendment No. 14.  Since that, there has been no claim for any refund of <Col N="184" /> entertainments tax.  As Deputies are aware, it is necessary to confirm such Orders and the object of amendment No. 14 is to confirm by law the Order made at that time.  The amendment has to be preceded by the Financial Resolution which I have moved.</P>

      <P>If this is passed, for the purpose of this section, it will mean a 2½ hour show where one-third of the 2½ hours is devoted to an Irish-language film, or where one-half of the 2½ hours is devoted to films in a language other than English.  That will be the condition to be complied with in order to get a refund.</P>

      <P>I do not think we should blame the cinema proprietors altogether in this matter.  I happened to attend a show in Sligo some six or eight weeks ago and an excellent Irish film was shown at 10.30 at the end of the ordinary show.  I counted the number of people who remained for that Irish film and it was six people out of a capacity house.  I certainly agree with the amendment as put down by the Minister, but we should not blame the cinema proprietors altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What will the effect of this be?  The original proposal, I take it, was to promote the showing of these Gael Linn films.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the original purpose, and as the scheme was first adumbrated, it seems to have failed in its purpose and this amendment will operate now to wipe out the scheme altogether?  I think that is what Deputy Mulcahy's query to the Minister was intended to elicit.  If we pass this Resolution, what is left of the original scheme to promote the showing of these Irish language films?  Is <Col N="185" /> there any inducement left to show them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The original intention when this clause was put in was to give proprietors of cinemas an inducement to show Irish films, but it was thought at the time that the Irish film would be part of the programme. It was never contemplated that the proprietor could show the Irish film before the doors usually opened.  Now they are opened at 6.30 and they start showing.  This was a plain device to collect a refund.  That is all.  We are back, really, to the original intention.</P>
      <P>I cannot say we will get any results from this.  Somebody mentioned Gael Linn.  I think they have a very short Irish item.  There is no tax concession due on that at all.  As far as I know, the showing of the Gael Linn item takes only about two-and-a-half minutes.  That does not qualify for any refund of tax.</P>

      <P>Are there any films in existence that would make it possible for a cinema proprietor to conform to the spirit and letter of this concession, or are we making a concession here which nobody can avail of?  Is there in existence a film of sufficient length and substance to constitute a third <Col N="186" /> part of a normal cinema programme? If there is, or if there is in contemplation the preparation of such a film, I can understand the purpose of this. If there is not any film in existence which will provide one-third of the normal programme, what kind of shadow-boxing are we going on with here by making a provision to induce people to show a film that does not exist and that has no prospect of existing?  Has the Minister in mind the existence of any film which would fill the terms of this concession?</P>

At that time we produced some films on health subjects that were in both Irish and English.  I think they ran for about 15 minutes.  There were a number of them.  I think others films as well as health films were produced at that time and since.  From the revenue point of view, I know that no genuine cinema-owner has claimed a refund.</P>

      <P>(a) provisions with respect to the computation of the profits or gains or losses of trades comprising dealings in securities in cases where dividends on shares are received which are to be regarded as paid to any extent out of profits accumulated before the shares were acquired, or out of other past profits,</P>

    <P>This brings in a bigger subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister's explanation of this.  The second part of this is most outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It concerns what is referred to popularly as &ldquo;dividend stripping&rdquo;.  As Deputy Sweetman said, it is a difficult and involved problem.  I can best explain it, as it was explained to me, by giving an example.</P>
      <P>It is done by three classes of people -a finance company, which is in the best position to do it; a charity or so-called charity, which also can benefit from it and an ordinary trading company. I should like to take the three separately so as to give an idea of how they operate.  In all three cases, I can take the same example of the company they are about to strip which we will refer to as company &ldquo;A&rdquo;.  The company they are about to strip is usually a semi-dormant company which has made big profits which are lying there and they have not made up their minds about what to do with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Company &ldquo;A&rdquo;, let us say, has reserves amounting to about £135,000, on which tax is paid. I am taking £135,000 because I am assuming a dividend of £125,000 which means a gross of £200,000.  With income-tax at the rate of 7/6 in the £, the net is £125,000.  The finance company say: &ldquo;We will buy it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>These figures could not be right.  There would be corporation profits tax to throw the calculation out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are paid also, but we cannot get them back, let us say. I am dealing only with income-tax. Company &ldquo;A&rdquo; has this £135,000.  Company <Col N="190" />&ldquo;B&rdquo;, which is a finance company, purchase the company and agree to give £135,000 for it.  Having got the company for £135,000, they arrange that the company taken over pays out a dividend of £125,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister prefer that we should let him get to the end before we ask him questions? I do not understand how anybody would sell what is worth £135,000 for £125,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps when I finish, you will see it is all the same.  They purchase it for £135,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Here the Minister has an admirable brief, if he would take it over immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if the Deputy would not instruct me in this matter.  Let me go on in my own way. It might not be as competently done as the Deputy would do it, but let me continue in my own way.  They purchase the company for £135,000.  They get the company to declare a dividend of £125,000 and sell the original company back to the owners for £10,000. Let us take the company.  They sold it for £135,000 and they buy it back for £10,000.  There was £10,000 of the profits left in it so they buy it back for £10,000.  They are in the very same position as they were before they started.  They neither lose nor gain anything.  The finance company that buys it gets the company to declare a dividend and pays out £125,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention at this stage that the stock and trade, the business, of a finance company is buying and selling shares and, if it makes a loss on the buying of shares, it shows a loss in its balance sheet, and if it makes a gain, it shows a profit.  They are able to show as a result of this transaction they bought a company for £135,000. They sold it for £10,000 and they show a loss of £125,000 on their trading. Therefore, they can go to the Revenue Commissioners and say: &ldquo;We have shown a loss of £125,000.  We have in this company a dividend, on which income-tax is paid, or £125,000 net, that is £200,000 gross, and we are entitled to a refund of income-tax.&rdquo;  They <Col N="191" /> are entitled to get that refund back so there is a clear profit of the income-tax. That is where the problem comes in. It is a fairly substantial sum as a rule because they do not go in for a small deal.  The point is: how is it proposed to stop that?  As I said, under the present law the thing, of course, is legal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly legal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is legal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear whether the Minister said &ldquo;legal&rdquo; or &ldquo;illegal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the present law, if the finance company shows a loss in its dealing in shares it is entitled to a refund of income-tax to the extent that they made a loss.  The way it is proposed to deal with that is that the dividend payable of £125,000 will be charged as income and, of course, the loss will be wiped out and there will be no refund requested from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The second class of companies or people that could benefit in this way are charities.  I know I shall be told charities will not do this.</P>

      <P>I may not have given the figures as I should have given them. They bought for £135,000.  They left £10,000 in the company; they did not take all the £135,000 of assets out of the company.  They sold it back to the original company for £10,000 but they still had £10,000 assets left in it.</P>

      <P>It will be said that most charities will not do this.  That is quite true but it is possible a charity may get through as a charity and then engage in this sort of business.  As a charity, where they buy that sort of company, they would go through the same performance as the others did and, at the end, would say to the Revenue Commissioners: &ldquo;We have here £125,000 after reduction of £75,000 tax and we are exempt from taxes and, therefore, we are entitled to get the income-tax back.&rdquo;  Again, as the law stands, that would have to be done.  It was rather difficult to deal with charities but what is proposed in the Bill is that where a finance company would be dealt with as I have already outlined, in such cases if a charity is concerned then no tax refund will be given.  That is how we shall deal with charities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Resolution does not prevent that still operating?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  An ordinary trading company can be a company dealing in anything, in goods or services, but not a finance company.  Where an ordinary company has made a loss, as Deputies, of course, are aware, that loss can be <Col N="193" /> carried on to the next year and, if there is a profit, the loss can be put up against the profit and it saves the income-tax in years to come.  However, such a company may not like to wait for five or six years to get back their loss in that way, and they have an easier way of doing it.  At the present time to buy this company the same operation is gone through.  They have £200,000 in dividends on which income-tax is paid and they claim income-tax back as against their loss, their ordinary loss in trading and again as the law stands they would have to get it.</P>
      <P>In this case we have to deal with it somewhat differently and the clause that is put in to deal with it really has the effect of closing the gap by imposing a restriction on the income which may be used by a non-finance company to support a loss claim.  These are the three types of cases we have to deal with and they are being dealt with in that way.  Against that, of course, we have to bring in the overall various safeguards to safeguard what may be an honest transaction but which might not look an honest transaction on the face of it.</P>
      <P>First of all, we cannot use these clauses unless at least 10 per cent. of the shares or assets of the company is purchased by a particular person.  In order to prevent three or four people combining and each buying 8 per cent. or 9 per cent., we also deal with transactions which take place at the same time by a number of people, and if the sum total is over 10 per cent. they can be dealt with.</P>
      <P>If a dividend is paid in a case like this it would reduce suspicions but if the company goes on&mdash;the stripable company as I should say in this case &mdash;and no dividend is paid out of the proposed purchase transaction that company will not, of course, be liable, will not be covered by the clauses which are put in.  In other words, it is only dividends paid out of ante-purchase profits that will be liable to be dealt with by these provisions.  Also, a normal dividend will not be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, for instance, one company takes over another, which has very big <Col N="194" /> assets, admittedly, paying let us say, a dividend of 15 per cent. before it was taken over, and this company says they could easily pay 17½ per cent., we shall say: &ldquo;That is all right.  That is normal. Two and a half per cent. is not abnormal.&rdquo;  But, if it went up to 50 or 60 per cent., we would have to take notice of the fact.  If the normal dividend or around the normal dividend is payable, no action will be taken. Also, if in purchasing the company they were getting a dividend on their money which would be only around the normal return from a stock exchange quotation at the time that would save them from any treatment under these provisions here.</P>
    <P>Lastly, if a company is taken over in that way and no dividend is paid for six years, then the matter finishes. They may distribute their money after six years, because it is felt that people who are dealing in this, who are taking advantage, let us say, of the present law in these matters, are people who are looking for quick returns and I think there is no danger in saying: &ldquo;You must wait for six years before you reap any benefit from such a transaction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I also want to deal with the fact that there is a retrospective clause in this and I want to say that, frankly, I am looking for retrospection.</P>

      <P>What?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking for retrospection in these clauses.  I do not want to have any doubt about that. One case at least has come to light but, unfortunately, we do not know how many cases will come to light on transactions that took place since 5th April, 1957, because those who are claiming refund of income-tax and so on may yet claim it on the year 1957 and may claim it, indeed, for, say, some months to come.  We do not know, therefore, what amount may be claimed by way of refund of income-tax in this particular type of business and, for that reason, I am asking the Dáil to give me permission to go back to any transaction which took place since 5th April, 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, I admit, very involved and very difficult.  I must say, it took me a long <Col N="195" /> time to get even the understanding I have and I feel that I am not a very good exponent, that I cannot explain clearly to Deputies what the whole thing amounts to.  However, if we are asked questions, we shall be able to get a clearer understanding of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Resolution is in two parts.  In regard to part (1) the Minister attempted to give us an explanation.  I am afraid I did not follow it at all.  I could not understand what he was getting at.  It seems to me that, in the first case the Minister mentioned, there is £135,000 in the kitty which has already borne taxation, that the company is sold for that amount, that the company that is then purchased distributes £125,000 by way of dividend and, having done so, leaves £10,000 in the kitty and sells it back. It means that the vending company in those circumstances is exactly where it was.  The £125,000 that has been paid out in dividends by the purchasing company is liable to tax in the hands of the recipients and the people who have received that dividend, if it is paid out, have to account for that dividend in the ordinary way.  It seems to me that people when they receive dividends have to account for them.</P>
      <P>In the sale of the capital assets, if there is £125,000 of a loss it offsets on paper the profit, but then the £125,000, unless it is paid out, is still in the kitty and it has got to be paid out, some way and, when it is paid out, unless the company is liquidated, the person who receives the money gets the profit.  If the case made is that the company is put into liquidation then, perhaps, there might be a case that the moneys are paid out as capital and reach the hands of the creditors as capital payments from the liquidator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Excuse me.  There is just one point there.  Perhaps we are on different lines.  Company B takes over company A.  Company A is still a company which has paid tax on its <Col N="196" /> profits.  It declares a dividend.  There is no tax payable on that dividend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But the tax has already been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure £65,000 is not right because corporation profits tax comes into it.  There is no question of the refund of corporation profits tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something they save.  The company A saves surtax because it is capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The holder receives his £125,000 and that is paid to him under deduction of tax, the tax having already been paid-£65,000. However, so far as that is concerned, that is a much more technical part of the subject that I propose to argue in much greater detail on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  It is in relation to sub-section (2) of the Resolution and the retrospective effect of it that I want to address myself and to endeavour to persuade the Minister that retrospection in this connection is one of the most damaging things that could be done to the whole financial structure of the State.  We are trying to get external capital in.  No one will ever come into this country if he feels that there is a prospect of retrospective tax law.  The Minister, when he was speaking, made it perfectly clear that what has been done is legal.  If the law requires to be changed as from to-day, as it was changed in Resolution No. 3 in respect of the remission for an Irish-language film to cinemas, then that is a question which we can argue on the merits of the change but there can be no argument of any sort, kind or description that would justify the retrospective element that there is in part (2) of the Resolution.</P>
      <P>I think that even a case of retrospective tax law of that sort is contrary to the Constitution and it would be upset under the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether it is or is not constitutionally correct, for any Government to bring in tax retrospection undermines the whole confidence in civilised Government.  For the purpose of discussing <Col N="197" /> part (2), it does not matter in the slightest whether the Minister is 100 per cent. right on the merits of part (1).  Certain people have done things that were absolutely lawful and because the Minister and I, if you like, as his predecessor, did not wake up in time to an amendment that it was thought should be introduced into the law, these people have carried out the law and now the Minister wants to wreak vengeance on them.  That is not the way to carry on business; that is not the way to instil confidence; and certainly it is not the way to get anybody to come into this country with foreign capital for the establishment of business.</P>
    <P>This is the beginning of the slippery slope.  It has been brought in here, perhaps, because the Minister and his advisers feel that it would be unpopular to defend stripping dividends and therefore they can get away with it.  I do not know enough about the practice to know whether it should be popular or unpopular, but I feel sure that is why it is put in here.  Once you start on the principle of retrospection in relation to taxation, there is nowhere you can stop.  Whether the Minister has his own mind made up, or whether this whole House has its mind made up, as to where retrospection should stop, you will never persuade other people that is so.</P>
    <P>Once you start on this, one businessman after another will say to himself: &ldquo;There is no use my taking certain steps to expand my business. It is perfectly legal as it is, but next year the Minister may come along and penalise me for doing it and put me under a charge for tax which I did not think I would have to pay under the existing law and that I did not have to pay under the existing law.&rdquo;  Supposing a liquidator is involved.  Supposing in pursuance of the present legal position, an accountant of repute &mdash;and there are half a dozen firms in Dublin who are well known as accountants of repute-was the liquidator of one of those companies and has distributed its effects, in accordance with the existing law and fortified by the advice of counsel, it means under this Resolution that that man is personally <Col N="198" /> liable for making good, because the tax law has been changed retrospectively from what it was when he carried out the transaction in accordance with the law.</P>
    <P>This matter was discussed across the water and there the Minister's counterpart, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, had a very different case to make.  He made the case that he gave notice two years ago that if any attempt was made to sidestep his pronunciamento at that time he would block it as from that date.  It then became clear to him there was considerable doubt as to whether the announcement he had made was sufficiently clear on its face and in its terms and because of the principle involved in tax retrospection, he abandoned the retrospective aspect of his section. Here the Minister has no such excuse.</P>
    <P>So far as I am aware the Minister never referred to this matter in public at all until the Resolution appeared on the Order Paper.  I would ask the Minister to correct me in that if I am wrong.  I think there was never any such suggestion made at any time, until the day before yesterday, that this practice was to be changed and that anybody who had taken advantage of the law as it was would get the position varied so that the law as it was at time of his action was not the law at all.</P>
    <P>I certainly never made any reference to it.  I do not think Deputy MacEntee, when he was Minister for Finance, ever made any reference to this process and I do not think Deputy McGilligan, when he was Minister for Finance, made any reference to it, either.  It is perfectly clear to me there never has been any suggestion by any Minister for Finance that such a practice was one that he was determined to block and that if clever people found a way around the block age proposed at that time, he would make sure that the loophole in the legislation was closed, and closed with retrospective effect.  There is no, excuse for this except convenience, the convenience to the Minister and the convenience to revenue&mdash;I mean the tax revenue of the State, not the revenue personnel&mdash;and that will be <Col N="199" /> vastly overshadowed by the damage that will be done.</P>
    <P>I venture to say that when this sub-section is known&mdash;if the Minister does not change his mind and I believe he will&mdash;not one single foreign industrialist will ever come into this country again and invest his money in it.  I have experience in my professional capacity, and other members of the House have experience in their professional capacities, of meeting people who come in here and want to consider setting up industry here.  One thing I am always asked is what is the taxation position and on innumerable occasions I have been asked: &ldquo;Is there any danger of the taxation position being changed retrospectively?&rdquo; We have always been able to hold our heads high in Ireland and been able to say that we did not believe in doing that.  We took the line that if we required to amend the laws, the laws would be amended with effect as from that date, but that we would not take the position in which people would be enticed here, and having been enticed, would then be, so to speak, hit on the head and hit in their pockets with retrospective legislation, so that, in relation to taxation, something that was perfectly legal was made illegal in order that the Minister could collect the few pounds involved.  I do not know how much is involved.  I accept the Minister's word that in these cases it is not going to be worth while unless the sum is substantial.</P>
    <P>Nothing can justify the principle contained in clause (2) and I venture to say there is not a single person engaged in business who would not tell the Minister the same thing, that what he will get out of this sub-section (2) will be an insignificant trifle compared with the damage he will do to the whole confidence and structure of the State, and particularly that his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, may write off completely any prospect of getting in external capital and that we might as well wind up the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention further to the subject <Col N="200" /> matter of clause (2) of this Resolution. Deputy Sweetman has dealt with the possible repercussions of it on investment of foreign capital and I agree with him entirely.  As well as that, there is a very great additional evil, of which I imagine most Deputies are quite well aware.  The situation can here arise and in fact, does arise, in which one individual, of whom the Minister has knowledge, has carried through a perfectly legal transaction. The Minister now asks us to legislate to declare that transaction unlawful retrospectively.  There is in the minds of most Deputies the idea that that cannot mean any more than that there shall be claimed back from him a certain sum of money.  It means a great deal more.  If as a result of the retrospective legislation it now transpires that this individual is liable to pay income-tax that he did not know he was liable to be called upon to pay, the Revenue Commissioners have power under Section 27 of the 1946 Act to issue a writ, get a judgment against him for it and, if he has not got the wherewithal to pay it, to get the writ returned <i>nulla bona</i> by the sheriff, get it countersigned by the county registrar, by which instrument the superintendent of the Guards can come and remove the gentleman to whom the Minister has referred to Mountjoy or Limerick jails and there detain him for six months without further legal procedure of any kind until such time as the amount of tax claimed is paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister reflects for a moment I think he will agree with me that it is entirely unthinkable that this House, by Resolution, should put any citizen of the State in that position as a result of retrospective legislation consequent upon his doing something which we are all agreed was perfectly lawful under the law as enacted by Oireachtas Eireann.  For the broader reasons outlined by Deputy Sweetman, as well as the very important domestic reason to which I have directed the Minister's attention, I would urge the Minister most strongly to drop paragraph 2 of this Resolution.  It will be more expedient to discuss the details, with special reference to the impact of this Resolution upon a charity, on the appropriate section of the Bill and confine <Col N="201" /> our discussion at this stage to the principle enshrined in paragraph 2.  I would ask the Minister to drop paragraph 2 and discuss the merits of the procedure in the ordinary context when we come to deal with the section.</P>
    <P>In that connection, if the Minister could be persuaded to adopt that course, might I suggest this to him? These are highly technical matters.  It would be of great assistance to the House if he would ask the Revenue Commissioners to set out in black and white a typical case, without any disguise, and to communicate it to the House, either by circulating it or by reading it out to the House and thus endorse in the Official Report verbatim the language employed by the Revenue Commissioners to indicate a typical case.  It is extremely difficult to paraphrase a report of a matter of this kind.  It is very hard to follow it.  But if you have time to read it set out coldly with typical cases, then you can grasp it in a better fashion.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine that there would be much difficulty on any side of the House in accepting in principle the restriction on what is commonly known as dividend stripping in regard to finance companies and trading companies. I should like, however, to be a little bit clearer in my mind on the merits of the proposal as far as it relates to charities.  As Deputy Sweetman says, this matter was very exhaustively discussed in the British House of Commons within the last three months.  This Resolution is taken <i>en bloc</i> from the appropriate financial legislation in Great Britain. There, the defence was made that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had given notice so long ago as two years of his intention to introduce retrospective legislation if this practice continued. The Chancellor of the Exchequer claimed that the warning he had given in 1955 was that if this practice were continued in the City of London, he would introduce retroactive legislation to deprive those who continued the practice of any profit they might derive from it.  It was argued in the House of Commons that no matter how explicit <Col N="202" /> the warning may have been two or three years ago, the principle of retroactive taxation legislation was so repugnant to the whole spirit of parliamentary democracy that the warning he gave did not constitute a valid foundation for a retroactive resolution of that kind.  Mr. Heathcote Amory accepted that view and actually withdrew the resolution in so far as it purported to be retroactive.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Sweetman is right. The right to say that the damage that will be done by abridging our right to say that the practice of retroactive legislation, especially in regard to taxation, is unknown in this country is far more precious than any remedial result the Minister can hope to have by the retroactive action in paragraph 2 of this Resolution.  I press him very strongly to drop paragraph 2 and allow us to debate the merits of the general proposal on the appropriate section of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have practically nothing to add to what Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Dillon have said about the proposal to make these provisions retrospective.  It is important that I, on this side of the House, should add my voice to the appeal made to the Minister so that he can realise that the feeling that these provisions are not wise is not confined to the Opposition.  That is the only reason I speak on the Resolution.</P>
      <P>The moment I saw the draft of the new part of the Bill I was immediately struck by the fact that the proposals were to be retrospective.  It seemed to me extraordinary that that should be so, particularly in view of the full debate there was in Britain on this very aspect.  As has been stated, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in spite of the excellent defence he had which is not available to the Minister here, withdrew the proposal to make the legislation retrospective in view of the volume of opinion opposed to it.  I would also appeal to the Minister not to persist in making these provisions retrospective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> We all agree that dividend stripping is nothing more or less than a legal wangle to procure a refund of income-tax which should not be properly due. But, nevertheless, no amount of revenue which the Minister could get under these provisions would compensate for the sacrifice of this vital principle of not making tax legislation retrospective.  I say that as one who has some knowledge and experience of the operation of the Income Tax Acts and of the whole code.  I should like to say that I agree entirely with the arguments put up by Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Dillon and to make it clear to the Minister that the same feelings are held by some Deputies on this side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one aspect on the general issue which I should like to suggest to the Minister. It is desirable that the Minister should give us a definition of the crime, a simple statement in clear basic English or basic Irish as to what the crime is in the complicated sequence of events described by him.  Could he indicate at what particular point the commission of the crime is arrived at?  Could he give us a picture of the beneficiaries as a result of the crime?  In view of the complicated statement that has been made, it is desirable that we should have these points made clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other speakers in disapproving of retrospective legislation in this matter.  I rather think the Minister when introducing this section was not entirely happy in his own mind.  To date, only one case has been made known to the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister feels that others may arise and in order to safeguard that possibility, he is introducing this retrospective legislation. That is not a sufficiently good ground for departing from a well-established precedent.  Retrospective legislation is not in accordance with normal democratic procedure.  Like Deputy Sweetman, I think this will do considerably more harm than is visualised.  I should like to ask the Minister to reconsider the position <Col N="204" /> and not to introduce this retrospective legislation.  It will do more harm than good.</P>

      <P>When I mentioned charities, I gave them as an example of a body exempt from income-tax and, therefore, where income-tax has been paid on any shares, or anything like that, they would be entitled to a refund.  The same would apply to trust funds, superannuation funds and to the fund envisaged under this Bill, namely, superannuation for the self-employed. There are other funds, too.  I want to make it clear that we are not dealing with charities alone.  We are dealing with all funds exempt from income-tax in the second category that I mentioned.</P>
      <P>The example given by Deputy Sweetman of a liquidator being put in a very invidious position could not arise.  This will not apply to a liquidator and therefore the position envisaged by Deputy Sweetman could not arise.</P>

It would be a different matter if we had paid out money and were seeking to get it back.  Retrospection applies only to the extent that it absolves the Exchequer from paying out money that may be claimed, but not yet paid.  There will be no refund, therefore, from anybody under this clause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>£135,000, and they got back £125,000 plus £10,000.  I am not sure what the expenses are.  We will leave out the stamp duty.  It is true that this has been legal so far.  It was referred to in another place as &ldquo;legal robbery.&rdquo;  I think that is a very good description.</P>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Mulcahy's query as to what the crime is, the position can be stated in this way: provision was made in the income-tax code to give a refund in certain circumstances&mdash;as I said earlier, to charities or funds of that kind, or, where a person had suffered a genuine loss in trade, such a person might possibly be entitled to a refund of income-tax in order to make up for that loss.  The position is different in the case of a person coming in to take advantage; that is the offence we are trying to deal with now.  Call it a crime, if you like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not, as Deputy Sweetman said, merely a matter of convenience to deal with it in this way.  It is really a question of cash because we are dealing with a device which was discovered only recently.  It was discovered first in England and then the idea came in here.  It was a device to take money from the Exchequer in a very shady manner, to say the least of it.  It is not money which might be got in a commercial way in which a person might have to take a risk or show some business acumen in order to make money.  It is simply a matter of taking money from the Exchequer.  I do not think there is much to be gained by quoting what has been done in England.  We are not, after all, in a position to appreciate conditions there. Almost half the House of Commons were for retrospection.  The curious <Col N="206" /> thing was that it was the Opposition who wanted retrospection.  The Government were against it.  The position is reversed here.</P>

People who come in here to do business will be sensible enough to understand the position.  Every honest man would say that we should take all possible steps to deal with this.  We are taking such steps and we are asking for retrospection only to the extent of the cases that we have.  We have heard of one case, but nothing has been done about it.  One application has been made and there is another application which may be made.  I see no objection whatsoever to telling the House what the extent of these losses will be, but I have no information on that.  At this stage, it would even be impossible to hazard a guess as to what they may amount to; they may not amount to more than the cases we know of already.  We have had one application and there is a certain suspicion in another case; it may not go any further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be about £100,000.  I cannot give that as a correct figure, but it is round about that, as far as I know.  I may be putting it too high.  Everybody says this is a practice that should be stopped.  The only objection appears to be: &ldquo;You should not make it retrospective.&rdquo; I am asking that we should go back to the 1st April, 1957, in other words, to the cases that we would be asked to deal with this year, some of which may not have arrived yet.  I am asking for permission to do it in that way especially when I can say we are not asking any of those people to suffer a loss on the transaction.  We shall deal with them only in so far as they <Col N="207" /> attempt to take easy money out of the Exchequer, which is a very different matter indeed from the ordinary transaction with which one might be asked to deal under the income-tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister to use his own business acumen in relation to this matter and not to be blinded entirely by the revenue aspect of it.  The Minister, when he was not a Minister, had certain business contacts with companies outside and he must know very well from that, that once it becomes common knowledge, as it will become common knowledge when this is passed that retrospective legislation is to be enacted by the Dáil in relation to taxation, the whole structure and foundation of confidence will be utterly lost.</P>
      <P>I thought when the Minister was risking literally the structure on which business is built in the country there would be something far more substantial involved in terms of money than the figure he mentioned.  I do not agree with the Minister that he is entitled to say, even in relation to the transactions that have occurred, that they are not honest.  There are only two standards of honesty that I know, first, one's conscience according to whatever Church one belongs to and the other the law of the land.  By both of those standards the transactions are honest up to the time the law is changed; then they cease to be honest. Once the law of the land is changed anybody who attempts to do something against the law is dishonest.  I do not think the Minister will get anybody to agree with him from a religious point of view that it was dishonest to carry through a perfectly legal transaction of the type the Minister indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether that is so or not, it is all past.  It is from now on that counts. If the Minister was making the case for the future that these transactions meant that some people were getting away without paying their full burden of taxation, then the House might be prepared to sit down and discuss the details of the proposals but the provisions that are inherent and specific in sub-section (2) go back to the 6th <Col N="208" /> April, 1957.  The Minister may think that because it affects only those cases it will not have any effect on confidence. Everybody will accept this sub-section, this retrospection, as being the thin end of the wedge and the beginning of the slippery slope, more particularly people whom we are trying to induce to come in from outside.  The game is not worth the candle; the damage that will be done is not worth it even if the Minister were to lose ten times the figure he has suggested is involved.</P>
    <P>I shall not argue at length with the Minister about the question of loss, but he is wrong.  There is loss.  In order to arrive at the situation in the case to which the Minister has referred&mdash;I know nothing about that case&mdash;stamp duty must have been paid to the extent of £1,350, from the Minister's own figures.  To arrive at that condition there must have been very substantial fees incurred to accountants, to barristers and solicitors, and it is quite possible that the stamp duty that would have been payable would have been payable on a very much higher figure because there might have been stamp duty on the re-transfer.  No matter what happens, whoever has been engaged in this practice has incurred loss if this provision goes through as it is.</P>
    <P>However, I am not so much interested in that.  That is in the past. What I am interested in is that when any foreigner comes to me or to any other professional person in Dublin, be he accountant, solicitor, manufacturer or anybody else and asks, as I have been asked: &ldquo;Is there any danger that taxation laws will be amended retrospectively?&rdquo;, we shall now have to say to him: &ldquo;There is. The precedent is here in the 1958 Finance Act and if the Government find they do not like the way you are arranging your tax affairs then they can make a change and knock you back.&rdquo;  Nobody will come in here in such circumstances.  You might as well wind up the Industrial Development Authority and bring back its representatives from America, because once that gets out there is not a hope of anyone coming in here and starting an industry.</P>

      <P>I do not think the ordinary taxpayer will be impressed one whit by this talk about retrospection.  I imagine the Revenue Commissioners are already in receipt of thousands of returns from taxpayers of their ordinary income.  These taxpayers are asked to declare what their income has been for the year ended 5th April, 1958. Does that not take us back to April, 1957, and are not all these income-tax returns retrospective if you wish to interpret a declaration of what your income has been for the past year as retrospective?  That is an entirely new twist to give to this principle of retrospection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey had quite a different idea in mind altogether. The ordinary taxpayer would certainly have a great grievance if, having had his taxable assets looked into for a year past, he were to be told that very large finance corporations could get away with that retrospective year by a subterfuge.  The shoe is really on the other foot and the Minister is serving the interests of the ordinary taxpayer by what he is doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks be to God, in this Parliament every Deputy is free to speak his mind whether he knows what he is talking about or whether he does not.  There is no limitation, but I want to put it to the Minister that describing the undesirable character of the activity against which this Resolution is directed is quite irrelevant to the principle enshrined in paragraph (2).  The Minister and I would have felt deeply against the people who sent ships to sea overloaded, but they did not commit an offence until Plimsoll passed his Act of Parliament and it would not have been right to make them criminally <Col N="210" /> responsible for doing something that the Minister and I would both agree was unfair, unjust and improper, by passing a retrospective Act of Parliament to that effect.</P>
      <P>The Minister, who has had some experience of the insurance business in his private capacity, will remember the impact of the 1909 Insurance Act in England.  One of the things it did was to put an end to the system of industrial insurance companies lapsing people's insurance policies for default in payments.  It imposed on the insurance companies an obligation to give a paid-up policy in respect of any lapsed policy and not simply to confiscate the other party's money.  If that Insurance Act had sought to do in 1909 what this Resolution seeks to do to-day, it would have wiped out a great many of the industrial insurance companies of England.  Indeed, if our own Insurance Act had attempted to do retrospectively what we ourselves did in 1936, we would have wiped out a great many of the industrial insurance companies in this country.</P>
      <P>I think a good many people might have argued for that, on the merits of the issue of the lapsed policy but I think the right view prevailed.  That was that the law speaks as from the date of its enactment and that people are entitled to carry on their lives under the law by showing it the due deference of full comprehension and complying with it.  The whole of civilised existence practically breaks down if we are to live under a system whereunder, having taken every conceivable precaution to ascertain what the law is, we exert ourselves to comply with it, only to be told 12 months later that, despite our care to comply with the law, we are to be declared to be in default, retrospectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am deliberately following a somewhat different line from that adopted by Deputy Sweetman, who points out the dangers of this to confidence.  I do not think that aspect of the question can be overemphasised and I think it a vitally important one.  I am concerned for a much more, to me, fundamental principle&mdash;that is, the whole question of retrospection by penal or quasi-penal legislation.  I think it wrong and <Col N="211" /> unjust and that the purpose to be achieved is out of all proportion to the evil that this Resolution seeks to abate through the medium of paragraph (2). If, in the course of the last 12 months, some people have got away with something that we wish we had foreseen, the prudent course is to say: &ldquo;Well, we shall try not to let that happen again,&rdquo; rather than tear down the whole structure of precedents which has given the law its certainty in this country heretofore, in order to chase a very restricted number of persons who might have had to pay more income-tax than they otherwise would.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister that it is quite illusory for him to say that this practice of dividend stripping has only recently come to notice.  There is not a single accountant of standing, there is not a single officer of the Revenue Commissioners, who did not follow closely the whole discussion which took place in regard to this practice on the occasion when Mr. Thorney-croft issued his first warning in the British House of Commons in 1955.  The practice was well known to revenue officials, to accountants and to solicitors with any experience of company law.  I suggest to the Minister that, inasmuch as the warning issued in the British House of Commons was not issued here, it almost amounted to a declaration that, so far as our Department of Finance was concerned, we did not take so grave a view of it as the British Exchequer did.  That is understandable, because as compared with the dimensions of the practice in Great Britain, our activities were microscopic.</P>
    <P>I am rather inclined to agree with the Minister in his intention to put an end to the practice particularly in regard to the first and third categories he mentioned.  I should like to look at the second category more closely when the matter is being discussed in the Bill.  I urge most strenuously that a very strong and reasoned case is being made to him against paragraph (2) of this Resolution.  It is useful from the point of view of our institutions of Government and of the functioning of this Dáil, that on occasion the Minister will meet the views of the Opposition. <Col N="212" /> The Minister has had support from his own Parliamentary Secretary and he will weigh the arguments advanced by his Parliamentary Secretary against the arguments advanced from other parts of the House, both behind him and in front of him.</P>
    <P>I do not think this case is being put in any controversial way and it would not be a bad thing if, on this occasion, the Minister announced that he was prepared to drop the retrospective clauses on the understanding that the matter could be discussed on its merits, on consideration of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should merely like to reiterate the point that this whole situation and the necessity for this section arise because the present Minister and his predecessor, apparently, could not take effective steps in time to put a stop to this practice; and I do not think that is a good reason for introducing retrospective tax legislation.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Dillon said is perfectly true, that this practice of dividend stripping was known.  There was no known case of it here until actually the Finance Bill had been circulated, because if we had thought there was a case before the Bill was circulated we would have put in the clauses then.  It was only when the Bill had gone out that we discovered the first case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed this problem on a very objective basis and it is not a political question.  I would be very sorry to drive the debate in any other direction.  However, we are dealing with a class of people here that are not the same as the ordinary individual one meets here, like the ordinary industrialist who is making <Col N="213" /> returns under the income-tax code, or even the industrial insurance person, or anybody of that kind.  We must remember that they are at least foreign-inspired if not coming in personally to take part in this issue.  I do not want to raise any prejudice against them by saying they are foreign but the idea is foreign to us anyway, and they have engaged to some extent &mdash;I do not know how much&mdash;in it.  I do not want to give the Dáil the impression that it may be £1,000,000 or £2,000,000; I am trying to give the figure as far as I can give it.  The position really is that they have their hand in the till; they are able to pull out the money and we are saying: &ldquo;No, we are not allowing you to pull it out.&rdquo;  That is the position as it appears to me.</P>
      <P>I must say I am not one bit anxious in regard to the position about foreigners coming in to invest their money.  I think they will all understand the position very well.  It is a very different thing from retrospection with regard to income-tax by making people pay more, or anything like that.  Here is a thing that every decent person, whether in this country, in England or elsewhere says should be stopped.  I have not met anybody who says it should not be stopped.  I am saying we should stop it from those who are even now putting their hand into the till.  I have not the legal power to say: &ldquo;Take your hand out&rdquo; at the moment but I am asking the Dáil to give me the power to say: &ldquo;Leave it there,&rdquo; or to say: &ldquo;If you leave your hand there another few days, you can take it out empty.&rdquo;  That is all I am asking by way of retrospection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could understand the term &ldquo;retrospection&rdquo; being applied if this was going on for a number of years, if it was well known as a legal matter.  I would see a big objection to it then but this was something never done by anybody before in this country.  We have discovered the first case: we do not know how many more are to come. They will not lose anything by it.  I am asking the Dáil to agree to this and I am prepared to meet the point raised by Deputy Sweetman in regard to any <Col N="214" /> expenses that may be involved being covered.  It should be possible to meet it that way but it is hardly worth considering because the expenses are very small compared with the total gains expected.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to Deputies that we are not dealing with an ordinary case here; we are dealing with a very unexpected case&mdash;never known here before. These people are taking money out of the till and, to the extent they take it out, the unfortunate taxpayers have to make it up and I do not think we should allow that.  That is why I say we must date it back to the 5th April, 1957.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me there is some confusion between what is legal and what is desirable from the point of view of the Minister.  That appears to cover what the Minister is saying. I agree there are some financial practices which are most undesirable from the revenue point of view but that does not necessarily mean they are shameful.  The fact they have not occurred before does not, to my mind, justify the Minister in saying this is something foreign; this is something which foreign influence has brought to bear on us or that foreign influence has brought about this whole situation. The real point is that these men who, since they have not broken the law, are presumed to be lawful, proper businessmen, have taken certain action which was approved by the law and from which they properly anticipated that certain benefits would result to them.  I can quite see that the revenue does not want any benefit removed from themselves to anybody else but the fact remains that an investment, as it were, has been made by certain people who quite properly expected the result of that investment would be a refund of tax by the revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What disturbs me even more about <Col N="215" /> this is that it does not appear to be an isolated case.  I do not want to anticipate the debate on the Finance Bill itself except to say that paragraph (b) sub-section (1) of Section 31 enshrines a rather similar provision.  It is retrospective and, even though it does not take money away from a person retrospectively, it damages the quite lawful anticipation of a person of a financial benefit.  It is a distinction which is too fine for me to appreciate&mdash;the distinction between taking money away from a person retrospectively and refusing to allow a person to receive something which they are properly and legally entitled to expect.</P>
    <P>I am not sufficiently aware of the technicalities of dividend stripping to know in detail what the practice is but I am fully prepared to accept the view which appears to be general that dividend stripping is not a good thing. But you simply cannot legislate against things to which you object.  Whatever has been done has been done legally and if some action has to be taken it should be properly taken.  From the revenue point of view, I am all in favour of blocking loopholes but if there is a loophole which has been left open and through which somebody has gone, in a proper way and with full legal rights, they have a legal right to the refund.  I think it is a most appalling precedent if we once enter on the course the Minister suggests.</P>
    <P>I am particularly upset because, as I said, there is another somewhat similar provision in the Finance Bill itself.  I would plead with the Minister, in spite of the pressure he is labouring under at the moment from the Revenue Commissioners, to bear his loss.  We must all take a share of this loss.  Loss is something that we all meet in business; as a businessman you realise you must stand up to losses and that there is no use in crying over spilt milk.  The situation is not irretrievable; the loophole can and will be blocked although that does not mean there will not be other loopholes.  Still it does not mean that anybody who had properly got through the loophole will be caught afterwards and the money taken from <Col N="216" /> them.  If it was money legally acquired at the time of going through the loophole, it will not be withheld from him. We are on a very slippery slope here. I strongly support what has been said against the Resolution.  I am very sorry to have to oppose the Minister's Resolution and I would appeal to him not to put it to a division if there is any other way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister is in the position that he has been advised strongly on this point by the Revenue Commissioners.  I shall not say one word that can be taken as critical of them because it is improper to criticise civil servants in this House and because I have immense respect for the manner in which they address themselves to their tasks.  But I want to say they are in a position in which absolutely, inevitably, they cannot see the wood for the trees.  Their job is to deal with trees day in and day out.  Their job is to produce the estimates on which the Minister bases his financial policy and not merely to produce those estimates but to do their utmost to see that the estimates are realised.  That is their job. It is inevitable, therefore, that they must approach problems like this from the point of view of the old saying: &ldquo;You cannot see the wood for the trees.&rdquo;  They would not be human if they were not looking at it in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> The Minister and the Government should take the wider issue that is involved-the issue which has been very well put by Deputy Booth that there is no difference between taking an exaction out of a man and telling a man he will not get what he has at this moment a legal right to obtain.  Nobody will go into the definition the Minister makes between these and other cases.  Everybody will feel that, in the future, some other Minister for Finance will have the opportunity of quoting this as a precedent&mdash;of going back and saying that, notwithstanding what the law was at the time certain transactions were carried out, he intends, retrospectively, to tax those transactions.</P>
    <P>Daily, in the House, we see precedent after precedent being built up&mdash; desirably so.  This is a precedent which, if started, will build up a chain in the other way.  It will undermine completely confidence in our taxation structure, confidence in our financial policy at home and, even more so, abroad among those whom we wish to get in at the moment.  I urge the Minister very strongly to reconsider clause (2).  If the provisions of the Bill are not strong enough to enable the Minister to do what he wants for the future, I shall not argue with him about that.  He can satisfy himself completely in that respect.</P>
    <P>The House will be all of one mind as regards the position in the future.  The position in the past is a very different thing indeed.  I urge the Minister with all the vehemence I can command to reconsider this matter.  We have discussed this objectively and not politically. There is no question of Party politics in relation to this matter.  It is being discussed entirely objectively. The Minister would be doing a service not merely to the country but to his own Government by yielding to the representations made to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess I was very much in sympathy with the Minister's point of view.  I do not like to think that perhaps some financial shark is getting away with it.  At the same time, I should not like to go as far as Deputy Sweetman went.  We can <Col N="218" /> probably do without industrialists who will be so easily scared off.</P>
      <P>However, it is a bad principle.  I doubt if it will have the effect on the ordinary taxpayer which the Minister suggests.  The Minister made the case that if they had to give this money back, the ordinary taxpayer would have to make it good.  I suggest that that need not happen.  The Revenue Commissioners hold an increasingly large balance, which they do not pay into the Exchequer, and this loss could be offset by depleting that balance without affecting payments into the Exchequer.  Whatever way it is borne, I think it must be borne, rather than introduce retrospective taxation.</P>
      <P>It is all right for the Minister to say he would have no intention: Ministers on both sides of the House have always said they have no intention but five or ten years later somebody else may come along in the cheerful hope that the circumstances have been forgotten and claim it as a precedent.  The type of debate that arises on precedents is not one that ever makes the position very clear.  I do not want to throw a spanner into the amiable debate which is going on at the moment.</P>
      <P>I do not know very much about this finance business or what share-stripping means.  I gather it is about three years since this cropped up in England. When it did crop up in England, under very much the same type of income-tax code, why were no immediate steps taken to provide for plugging this hole?  The fact that a case has arisen here only now does not seem to matter.  Surely the duty of a Minister for Finance and his officials is to take warning from other people? There is a good old saying that a fool learns by experience, but a wise man learns by the experience of others.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That for the purpose of any Act of the present session to charge and impose certain duties of customs and inland revenue (including excise), to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provisions in connection with finance, it is expedient to authorise as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  to redeem borrowings, and interest thereon, in respect of capital services, there shall be charged annually on the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof a sum of £601,122 in the twenty-nine successive financial years and a sum of £717,012 in the thirty successive financial years commencing in each case with the financial year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, and</P>
      <P>(b)  relief from tax, either by repayment or otherwise as the Revenue Commissioners consider proper, shall be given, in relation to the period between the passing of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956 (No. 47 of 1956), and the passing of the said Act of the present session, where such relief is appropriate on account of amendment of the expression &ldquo;goods&rdquo; (as defined in Section 10 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956) effected by the said Act of the present session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (a) deals with Section 56 and paragraph (b) with Section 51 of the Bill.  Section 56 deals with capital services redemption and Section 51 is necessary under the concession given <Col N="220" /> for export profits.  Deputies will remember that, in these concessions for export profits, we included fish farms and mushrooms.  It will be retrospective to the time it was passed, but, in this case, they will get money rather than pay out.  This will be necessary if there is a claim for any refund of income-tax paid on profits for export since 1956 and before this date.  We cannot give the refund unless we get this legislation.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear Deputy Sweetman sees a clear distinction between a Money Resolution and a Financial Resolution.  So far as I am concerned I can see no difference whatever, but that much having been recorded, I should like to ask this question: what capital sum is serviced as to interest and redemption by £601,122, as now altered to £717,012?  That suggests to me that the capital sum outstanding has increased during the last 12 months and the redemption and interest fund appropriate has proportionately increased.  That figure cannot be related to the total borrowings of the Exchequer.  It must be related to one figure rather than to the total borrowings. What is the figure to which that annual resolution applies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This, I think, is clarified under Section 56.  I just cannot find Section 56 at the moment, but you will find in Section 56 there was an estimate made at the beginning of the year, and that was changed to the true sum at the end of the year.  The second amount is the estimate for the coming year.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section I stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section I, the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Health, addressed the National Health Council the other day and, in the course of his remarks said that in his view the most urgent requirement was a reduction in the level of taxation.  I want to ask the Minister if that represents Government policy and, if so, when is it going to be translated into action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it hardly necessary to say that it is Government policy to reduce taxation.  I could almost say that is true not only of the Fianna Fáil Government but of every Government we had during the last 30 years. None of them succeeded in achieving that but in this Bill, as we go through it now on amendments, Deputies will come across many cases where I am trying to collect income-tax where it is not, in my opinion, being properly paid at the moment.  On this whole question of income-tax my view about it is that it is a very unpopular thing but we should try, as far as we possibly can, to make it equitable.  Every person liable to pay income-tax should pay it.  At any rate that would help. I do not say it would achieve our <Col N="223" /> object but it would help towards making it possible to reduce income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would be in general agreement with the Minister on that, but I understand that the view of the Minister for Health was that the level of taxation should be reduced.  The reason I raise this on Section 1 is that Section 1 continues the rate of income-tax at the existing level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister would make some observations on this.  It is undeniable that the rate of taxation at present is such as to do away with a great deal of the inducement to production that must be fostered if we are to survive.  So far as personal taxation is concerned, to suggest, with the present value of money, that surtax should start at an income of £1,500 a year is farcical. That £1,500 would only be about £700 in the value of money in pre-war days when surtax was initially introduced. This position will have to be faced up to but, while I agree with the Minister when he says if everybody paid it would be a lot easier, I should like to know has he any estimate of the amount that would be saved, so to speak, if everybody paid the amount they were legally liable to pay.</P>
      <P>I am not talking of tax avoidance; I am talking purely of tax evasion. Tax avoidance is where people legally order their affairs in such a way that there is no liability to taxation because they are not making the profits out of which to pay tax; tax evasion is where people dishonestly avoid paying taxation which they should properly pay.  I believe that is dishonest, though I find it difficult to get agreement from people, whose standards I would have thought should be higher than mine, that it is dishonest deliberatley to refrain from paying the taxation for which one is liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one time, a figure of 2/- in the £ was suggested; in other words, if everybody paid what he was legally bound to pay, 5/6 in the £ would produce the same amount of money as the <Col N="224" /> 7/6 rate.  It is about ten years ago that I remember that figure being quoted.  Has the Minister got any more modern figure?  Of course, the figure is one that would have to be treated with the utmost reserve.  It would not be even approximate; it would be only &ldquo;of the order&rdquo;.  We should like to know that figure.</P>
    <P>On this section, we should also like to know from the Minister what progress the Income-Tax Commission is making.  This seems to be the proper section on which to raise that matter. I agree with the Minister that it is desirable, so long as there is income-tax, that its incidence should be equitable.  That is one of the reasons why I set up the Income-Tax Commission and I should like to know what progress they have made towards achieving that equity in payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question as to what we might get in if tax evasion were cut out completely is one I am not able to answer.  Neither can the Revenue Commissioners answer it. They do not know; they can only guess.  If they knew what tax evasion there was, they could get after it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>A guess would suit me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They can make only a very wide guess.  Let us approach it in this way: to take 6d. off the rate for income-tax would cost about £1,500,000.  At 7/6, we get in from income-tax alone £22,000,000.  That means that every 6d. is worth roughly £1,500,000.  The question is: could we take off 6d. if we could stop tax evasion?  We do not know.  The Revenue Commissioners are not even optimistic enough to say we could.  We have to leave it at that&mdash;we do not know.  All we can do, I suppose, is, in our yearly Finance Bill, to do the best we can to stop tax evasion, to stop all the holes that are there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not understand the difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance, if he takes that line.  I am not worried about tax avoidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy is right.  I mean tax avoidance.  Tax <Col N="225" /> evasion, to some extent, also, can be reduced.  We can help the Revenue Commissioners by legislation in the way of making it easier for them to get after tax evasion.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Income-Tax Commission, the Deputy is aware that one cannot press commissions unduly.  One can only ask from time to time how they are getting on, or something like that.  I do not think there is any indication that they will report in the near future.  That is all I can say.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 4, line 28, before &ldquo;occupied&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;outside the areas specified in the Schedule to Ordú na Limistéirí Gaeltachta, 1956 (I.R. Uimh. 245 de 1956).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to recall to the House that the preservation of the Gaeltacht is a fundamental national objective.  The difficulty is to provide suitable remunerative employment for the people in that area. It has always been agreed that market gardening is a particularly suitable form of activity for that area.  In that connection, there has been passed by this House the glasshouse scheme.  A big effort in that connection is to be made in the near future.  Plans are being prepared privately for putting into operation which should bring about a considerable expansion of market gardening activities by the residents of Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>I am sure it will be agreed that any encouragement this House could give to such a desirable objective should be given.  It may be said that very few people in the Gaeltacht areas pay any income-tax.  I have in mind the case of an industrious young single man in the Gaeltacht area.  If he were to go into this line of activity, he would not need to earn a very substantial amount of income before becoming liable to pay a substantial amount of income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might point out for a moment the development of this matter.  As many Deputies are aware, the provisions in <Col N="226" /> relation to market gardening activities up to now have been governed by Rule 8 of the rules applicable to Schedule B.  These rules provide that market gardening is different from any other farming activity.  A farmer is taxed on his activities on the basis of the valuation of his land.  Rule 8 of the rules applicable to Schedule B singles out market gardening from all other similar types of activity and says that in relation to that activity, the person concerned shall be taxed under Schedule B, but shall be taxed on the basis of the profits he makes, not on the basis of the valuation of the land concerned.  That Rule 8 is now being repealed by this Bill and in its place we will have Section 2.</P>
    <P>Section 2 takes this whole thing one stage further.  It puts beyond any doubt the question of taxing market gardening activities on the basis of profits.  It removes them from Schedule B because, I understand, there has been some ambiguity in that connection, and it states categorically that the moment this Bill is passed market gardening activities will definitely be taxed under Schedule D, the same as any other trade or profession, and taxed on the basis of profits.</P>
    <P>My amendment is directed towards exempting market gardening activities, in so far as they are carried on in Gaeltacht areas, from these provisions. I want to revert to the position where any person carrying on market gardening activities would be taxed on the basis of the valuation of the land involved only, and not on the basis of the profits he makes from market gardening. I do not think that is a very big thing to ask, particularly when it was never intended that this provision about market gardening activities being taxed on profits would apply to the type of people I have in mind in a Gaeltacht area.  Obviously, it was thought that market gardening was an intensive form of farming which took place on the borders of large cities and, therefore, was more of a business than a farming activity and, therefore, was more appropriately taxable on a profits basis than on a valuation basis, so that I think I am only conforming <Col N="227" /> to the original idea behind this whole matter of taxing market gardening activities by asking that the type of people I have in mind in Gaeltacht areas should be exempt.</P>
    <P>I say that also because there was a case taken here in 1945 which had to go to the Supreme Court before it could be decided that Rule 8 of the rules applicable to Schedule B applies to Ireland at all.  That was the case of McGarry <i>v.</i> Spencer.</P>
    <P>What I am asking the Minister to do in my amendment is not very much. No loss of revenue will be involved. The Minister may say that he cannot accede to my request, because, if he did so, there would be a rush of people to this area to carry on market gardening there, on the basis that they would be exempt from tax on profits.  In answer to that, I would say that that would be a very good thing.</P>
    <P>The issue involved here is far more than the narrow issue of raising a certain amount of revenue.  It is a question of national policy that the Gaeltacht areas should be preserved and developed and, in so far as my amendment makes some little contribution in that respect, I would urge the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to say that Section 2 does not alter the basis of taxation and for that reason the amendment would not have the effect desired by the Deputy.  In other words, the amendment is really ineffective. However, that is only a drafting point and we do not want to take advantage of it.  I want to deal with the Deputy's intention, because if I merely said it is ineffective he could put down an amendment for the Report Stage and it would be as well to deal with the idea now.  His object is to get some benefit for market gardening, which includes tomato growing, in the Gaeltacht, which is not available elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to oppose the amendment because, if we gave a concession of that kind, that would not be the end of it. There is no doubt whatever that it would be followed by a request for relief from income-tax by other industries in the Gaeltacht.  There might be a lot <Col N="228" /> to be said for that but that question would arise.  Then we have the congested districts, which to a great extent surround the Gaeltacht.  They might make as good a case, from the economic point of view, as the Gaeltacht areas and the demand for relief would spread to the undeveloped areas.  We do not know where it would end.</P>
    <P>Personally, I am against this principle of giving income-tax reliefs.  My predecessor, Deputy Sweetman, gave these reliefs on exports and I was forced by my colleagues in the Government not only to continue but to extend these reliefs.  Even so, I do not think it is a good thing that we should extend this system of giving reliefs, by way of exemption from income-tax, in cases of this kind.  As Minister for Finance, I must say I would far prefer to give whatever might be the equivalent by way of grants and leave the income-tax code as it is.  For that reason, I have to oppose the amendment, As it happens it is ineffective, but I would have to oppose it even if it were effective.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Frequently we hear exhortations by Ministers, and by one in particular, that we have got a wonderful potentiality here in relation to our market gardening export market.  It is true we are very near the areas with high density populations in Northern England.  If the market gardening tax legislation is to be amended at all, is it not desirable that something should be done towards encouraging people into market gardening for the purpose of tapping and supplying that valuable market, or else the Minister's colleague in the Government might keep quiet about this line?  There is no use one Minister taking one line and another taking a different line.  I do not mind, for the purpose of discussion on the Finance Bill, which Minister is to speak on Government policy, but at any rate if the Government policy is to be, as the Minister has just indicated, that there should not be tax concessions of that sort, would he try <Col N="229" /> and ensure that his colleague, the Minister for Lands, will talk the same language?

      <P>On the Section, there are two points I should like to raise. One is that the exclusion of hops is continued as it was in the original Rule 8.  I should like to know what is the position in regard to hop growing, or why this specific exclusion is there. Secondly, I am not quite clear as to the meaning of sub-section (3) (a).  The sub-section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...the annual value of the market garden land, for the purposes of Rule 5 of the Rules applicable to Cases I and II of Schedule D, shall be arrived at by apportionment of the rateable valuation of the property.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does that mean that the deduction allowable will be five-fourths of the rateable valuation, or a proportionate amount of the rateable valuation only?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in any of the provisions of the Income Tax Acts any society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1936, whose objects include that of working for the economic, cultural and social development of the Gaeltacht and whose funds are, in the main, applied for that purpose, shall be entitled to exemption from income-tax under Schedules C and D, and from corporation profits tax, on the profits or gains of any trade, business or occupation carried on by it in the areas specified in the Schedule to Ordú na Limistéirí Gaeltachta, 1956 (I.R. Uimh. 245 de 1956).</P>
    <P>As I have already said, many Deputies are aware that a very desirable project is about to be initiated in connection with the Gaeltacht areas.  Great hopes are being placed on this project.  Many people hope it will mean the beginning of a new era of development and employment in the Gaeltacht areas.  Part of that project involved the formation of an industrial and provident society whose function will be to engage in various forms of economic activity and whose funds will be devoted solely and exclusively to the development of the Gaeltacht.  My amendment aims at having such an industrial and provident society exempted from income-tax under Schedules C and D, not A or B. In other words, in so far as this society would hold land, house property or buildings, it would pay under Schedule A or B in the normal way.  My amendment seeks to have such a society exempted from Schedule C or D.</P>
    <P>I have put down the amendment particularly for the reason that this proposed society would engage to a considerable extent in market gardening activities and here there is a very curious position in relation to the industrial and provident society carrying on market gardening activities. As I said earlier, market gardening activities, up to this, were taxed under Rule 8, Schedule B.  The section of the 1918 Income Tax Act which exempts industrial and provident societies generally from paying tax on their profits refers only to tax <Col N="231" /> under Schedules C and D.  Therefore, the peculiar anomaly prevails at the moment that if an industrial and provident society carries on any function or activity and complies with certain specifications, it is exempt from tax on profits except in regard to market gardening.  It pays tax on the profits of market gardening activities and not, as a general rule, on any other form of economic activity.</P>
    <P>I am trying to remove that anomaly. I want to have an industrial and provident society, in so far as it complies with the terms of my amendment, exempted from tax under C and D no matter what form of activity it carries on.  Therefore, it would be in the same position in relation to market gardening as any other activity.  I want it put, into the position of paying tax under A and B on any of its lands or buildings only.</P>
    <P>The arguments which I put forward in relation to my first amendment apply even more forcibly here.  This society, or any similar society which may be formed, will be doing work of national importance.  In the case of a society such as that, there is no case for taxing its profits.  The code we have up to the present recognises that industrial and provident societies are in a certain position and are more or less exempt from taxation.  I want to make that definite and conclusive in the case of the type of society I have in mind, which will do this work of national importance in the Gaeltacht areas.  I would appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment and leave the profits of such societies, if they make any, untouched, and leave it free to devote itself exclusively to this good work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is not interpreting this section correctly.  I understand he has in mind the formation of a provident society in the Gaeltacht areas to purchase market garden produce from the growers.  If that is the case, it is all right.  If I am right in assuming that this society would purchase the produce of market gardeners and sell it on the market here or elsewhere, that would then be <Col N="232" /> regarded as carrying on a trade which, in the ordinary way, would be subject to tax under Schedule D.  Sub-section (6) of Section 2 seeks to leave things as they are.  In other words, a provident society is left as it was before.  When we are changing over market gardening profits from B to D, sub-section (6) has the effect of exempting the provident society from income-tax on its profits.  It would be, of course, subject to tax under Schedule B, but I believe that is of very small account.  As far as I can understand, the position of provident societies between B and D is very involved. But that is what is to be achieved by the section.  Therefore, the Deputy has nothing to fear.  As I understand, the activity it is intended to pursue in the Gaeltacht areas&mdash;to set up a provident society to purchase the produce of market gardening and fruit growers&mdash;would be exempt from income-tax under Schedule D also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite clear on what sub-section (6) does.  I have no doubt in my mind.  It continues the position whereby an industrial and provident society carrying on market gardening activities is not exempt from tax on its profits.  Under sub-section (6) the position will be that an industrial and provident society carrying on market gardening will be taxed on the basis of profits and not on the basis of valuation of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that such a society would not itself be carrying on market gardening activity but would be purchasing and selling the produce. That is not so.  It will itself carry on such market gardening activities.  I want to have it exempt from taxation on its profits.  I do not mind its being taxed under Schedule B.  When the Minister says that sub-section (39) of the Income Tax Act of 1918 will exempt it, he must bear in mind that that section lays down two conditions, one of which is that the provident society, in order to avail of the exemption, must not sell to members, &ldquo;who are not members thereof.&rdquo;  That being so, the society I have in mind could not avail of the exemption in so far as it would be purchasing market garden produce and selling it&mdash;the idea is that it would export.  It would be ridiculous <Col N="233" /> to think that it could make every customer in the export market a member.</P>
    <P>My amendment is designed to clear up the whole position and remove the existing anomaly in which this one activity of industrial and provident societies is singled out and taxed on the basis of profits.  As far as the Gaeltacht areas are concerned, I want to do two things: to make sure that market gardening activity, so far as it is carried on, will be exempt from Schedule D income-tax; and, secondly, in so far as any other trade or industry is carried on, it will be exempt from taxation on profits apart from Section 39 of the Act.  Do I make myself clear?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need not worry about the fact that they will not sell the produce to members.  Section 39 (4) lays down that a society &ldquo;shall be entitled to exemption from taxation under Schedules C and D unless it sells to persons not members thereof or unless the number of shares is limited by its rules or practice.&rdquo;  You must offend in both cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You must sell to people outside the society and must limit your shares.  I know it would be impossible to sell to members, but if you do not limit your shares you are all right.</P>
      <P>As regards trading as a grower of vegetables, I am not clear about that. As things stand, I think you would be liable to taxation.  I took it for granted all the time that the intention was to buy the produce from the growers and sell it.  I said to myself, &ldquo;That is all right&rdquo;.  It never struck me that the society were going to grow the vegetables themselves.  I had not considered that point.  When I do come to examine it, it may be a principle we could not deal with.  Under the circumstances, all I can say is that we can look into it before the next stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Where the Revenue Commissioners propose to make an additional assessment under Section 125 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, they <Col N="236" /> shall give notice of such intention to the person to be assessed indicating the details of the discovery.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person receiving a notice in accordance with sub-section (1) of this section may, within 21 days from the receipt of such notice, appeal to the Special Commissioners on the grounds that the details set out in the notice do not constitute a discovery for the purposes of Section 125 of the Income Tax Act, 1918.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Special Commissioners shall hear and determine an appeal to them under sub-section (2) of this section as if it were an appeal to them against an assessment to income-tax and the provisions of the Income Tax Acts relating to the rehearing of an appeal or the statement of a case for the opinion of the High Court on a point of law, shall, with the necessary modifications, apply accordingly.</P>
    <P>My amendment follows more or less on the lines of what the Minister himself is trying to do in Section 4.  He is trying to improve the position with regard to appeals.  Everybody will agree with him in that, and we are in fact very grateful to him.  My amendment is designed to bring about an improvement in the existing position. It deals with the question of discoveries under Section 125 of the Income Tax Act of 1918.  That section is the section where the inspector, if he claims to discover something which was not put before him properly in the normal way, can raise additional assessments at a later date.</P>
    <P>The present position is that an inspector can regard anything as a discovery and the taxpayer has no voice or say, until such time as he receives an assessment.  He can then, of course, appeal the assessment.  My argument is that that is too late and there should be provision whereby, when an inspector claims to have made a discovery, he should notify the taxpayer, in which instance the taxpayer can appeal against it on the grounds that it is not a discovery, and the entire issue can can be resolved at that stage.  It puts the taxpayer in an unfair position to present him with a <i>fait accompli</i> assessment and make <Col N="237" /> him go before the Special Commissioners to argue that that assessment is excessive.</P>
    <P>The argument should properly be based on whether or not there has been a discovery.  My amendment is designed to secure that.  If it is accepted, the position would be that the inspector would claim to have made a discovery; he would notify the taxpayer; the taxpayer could appeal to the commissioners on the basis that the claim did not constitute discovery at all and the issue could be argued out on that basis.  The inspector could then, if the appellant failed, go ahead and make the assessment.  I think that would be a more logical way of dealing with the position.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  I do not see that there can be any serious objection to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the section deals with a case where the inspector discovers additional evidence and where he believes that the taxpayer was wrongly assessed&mdash;usually, of course, too lowly assessed&mdash;and makes an additional assessment.  The Deputy believes that the taxpayer should, first of all, have an appeal on the question of discovery.  If there is no discovery, he has no legal right to make an assessment.  The Deputy's amendment would, I think, make things a bit more complicated.  If the taxpayer is appealing under the Bill as it stands, he can have the question of discovery tried first.  He can put it to the Special Commissioners that there was no discovery and, if they agree, the case is thrown out.  Is it not better that at the same sitting the further point is tried, namely, whether the discovery is in order?  Then it is argued, if there is discovery, as to whether or not the amount assessed is correct.  If the section is left as it is, both matters can be tried at the one sitting.  If I accept the Deputy's amendment, however, there will have to be two sittings. If the taxpayer loses on the discovery point, then there will have to be another sitting to argue the assessment. If the taxpayer is beaten on the discovery point, I think it is just as well that the other case should follow immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>But the fact that an assessment has been made tends to prejudice the situation to some extent. The taxpayer is no longer arguing that there was or was not a discovery.  He is arguing against the amount, or correctness, of the assessment.  I do not think the Minister quite conveys to the House the procedure that would take place in a case like that.  If what he says is true, he has a point; but, as far as I know, what actually occurs is that the taxpayer goes in on appeal against an assessment and he must lead the argument.  He must advance the reasons why the assessment is excessive, or should not be made, before the inspector says anything at all about discovery.  I do not care how the position is achieved so long as the first argument is based on whether or not there is discovery, the details of which are fully known to the taxpayer before ever he is asked to argue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support from a slightly different angle the view Deputy Haughey has put forward. There might be a case in which the inspector was wrong, to the knowledge of the taxpayers' advisers, in thinking there was a discovery of something that had been hidden.  If the matter was dealt with in the way Deputy Haughey suggests, it could be dealt with much more expeditiously and at much less cost than if the taxpayer had to go to the hearing of the Special Commissioners fully able to meet the actual figure assessment, so to speak, if the discovery point went against him.  It would inevitably throw further expense on the taxpayer by not permitting some method by which the discovery issue could be tried in advance and, if desired by the party concerned, what I would call the assessment figure issue postponed to another sitting.  I do not know whether it could be done.  I gather from Deputy Haughey it could not.  It is not an aspect of which I would have personal knowledge, but there should be some method by which the discovery issue could be tried first, so that the taxpayer would know that he had not to go to all the expense of making up a case in respect of the assessment issue <Col N="239" /> until he knew how he stood on the first issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the burden of proof rests on the taxpayer, whereas it should be the reverse? Under the existing provision, the taxpayer is being asked to appeal against the sentence.  If the Minister were to accept Deputy Haughey's amendment the tax collector would first have to prove the guilt, if you like, of the taxpayer in not disclosing what has now been discovered.  It is a typical Revenue provision that the taxpayer is guilty until he proves himself innocent; the taxpayer is liable until he proves himself not liable.  I regard that as sinister.  It should be up to the Revenue Commissioners to prove liability and if they established a case, then the taxpayer should have his first opportunity to meet that case.  The position is that the discovery is alleged to have been made, the assessment is raised and the taxpayer is put to the proof to try to beat that assessment. I strongly support Deputy Haughey in his amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see the point being made by the Deputies who have spoken.  Is it not much more convenient for the person concerned, if he is beaten on the discovery issue, to have his case heard and have done with it?  If the person concerned is absolutely certain he will win on the discovery case, well and good.  He has no trouble except to go and make his point and have the case decided in his favour.</P>

      <P>It is often the case with the Revenue Commissioners.

I do not see how he could deal convincingly with the point of having made the discovery, without arguing at least part of the way, and probably the whole way, on the assessment.</P>

    <P>I want to ensure that the statements and documents used are those of which the taxpayer has personal knowledge. My amendment is not full enough on its own.  If the inspector of taxes wishes to rely on any documents for the purpose of an assessment, it is quite easy to provide that it must have been seen by the taxpayer before being sent in.  Documents that are sent in without its being clear on their face that the taxpayer knows about them should not be utilised, and so far as statements are concerned they should be utilised only if they are made in the presence of the taxpayer.  If they are made in the absence of the taxpayer, it is unfair that he should be bound by them afterwards.  The inspector is in the position to know what statements are likely to be material and it is easy to provide that an oral statement should be made in the presence of the taxpayer and that a document should be signed by him.  I do not like what is tantamount to a criminal admission being produced unless, in the first instance, it is well known to the person concerned so that there can be no possible suggestion <Col N="241" /> that it is something done behind his back or without authority.</P>

      <P>All that is provided here is that these documents will be admissible by way of evidence.  The court will have to decide what weight should be given to them and I should imagine that if there was any suspicion that the man himself had not instructed the solicitor or the agent, as the case might be, they would not admit those documents by way of evidence.  It is not an easy case to deal with.  As far as I am personally concerned, another person looks after my income-tax.  I do not think the Revenue Commissioners were ever told he had any authority to do it.  He does it, anyway. Of course, I have to pay; he does not pay.  There is a practice there which has been accepted for a long time and it would be difficult to go back on it and make a new rule that documents signed by an agent or solicitor would not be admissible.  It might be a very big step to take.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 7, line 11, before &ldquo;post&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;registered&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="242" /> In various places throughout the Income Tax Acts and in this Bill, there is mention of notice to be given by the Revenue Commissioners.  We all know that ordinary letters&mdash;particularly if they are sent to people down the country&mdash;do not get the attention they deserve.  Statutory notices as provided in this Bill should, therefore, be sent by registered post, so that everyone may know they are important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of serving notices by post is rather a difficult matter, I believe.  There is not much substance in it.  There is the difficulty that the existing provision in this regard is incomplete and it is thought well to make it general.  Secondly, in the income-tax law as it stands, some officer or assistant secretary had to sign practically all documents and that, of course, in the growing business of the Revenue Commissioners, would be nearly impossible.  It is proposed to allow authorised officers to sign notices and certain letters.  These two matters are being made right.  There is no change in the existing practice, and these things have been more or less going on in that way.  I should say that there has been no complaint about the way things have been going on.  I think those are the two points which really arise in this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>In sub-section (5), page 7, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;but&rdquo; in line 31 down to the end of the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see the purpose of sub-section (5) unless the Minister is entirely wrong in the explanation he has just given.  It seems to me that what has happened is that people have been illegally signing notices in the Revenue Commissioners' offices up to this and that the Minister now wants to validate it in this way.  Furthermore, it seems that, as provided by <Col N="243" /> sub-section (1), notice is being given by post of certain matters and that it was invalid and illegal to give these notices by post and we have here another retroactive sub-section in sub-section (5).</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes to delete the provision that notices, before the passing of this Act, would now be validated even though they were invalid.  I do not know what the Minister is getting at, but on the face of it it would appear that somebody has had tax collected from him without the appropriate formalities having been gone through and that it is proposed now to slide in a little sub-section, sub-section (5), to make sure that everybody is protected, even though the tax was collected illegally. There must be some purpose behind it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is directed to (1) and to (2).  Sub-section (1) is the method of serving by post and this seems to indicate that that was illegal or else sub-section (5) would not be needed.  Apparently someone was signing documents he should not have signed or else sub-section (5) would not be needed in this form.  So far as sub-section (3) is concerned, it may or may not have already been in operation; but there is not any meaning for sub-section (5), unless reliance is being placed on a method of service that was bad.  There is no meaning in sub-section (5) unless someone signed documents he had no business to sign up to this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>Certain documents have been signed by the assistant secretary or some high officer, but I think there was a certain doubt about other documents. Whether or not documents went out illegally signed is doubtful. I cannot say more than that.  As the Deputy is aware, when a section like this is brought in, it sometimes encourages people to look up to see the meaning of it and it may be that they discover a weakness in the law. It is to cover such a case that this is <Col N="244" /> put in.  No case has ever arisen so far, no one has ever questioned it, but this is to make assurance doubly sure.  As a result of this section being introduced, a weakness may be discovered in the law up to this and this is designed to prevent any action being taken&mdash;retrospectively, if you like&mdash;for that reason.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider the provisions of sub-section (3).  I am not a lawyer, but I formed the impression that this is a very radical departure from existing practice and that it is a very undesirable departure which, in fact, offends against the most elementary principles of justice as between plaintiff and defendant.  Its effect apparently will be that, after it is passed, an officer of the Revenue Commissioners can stand up in court, wave any document and say it is such and such. There is no necessity for him to prove it: the onus of disproving the document is put on the defendant, the taxpayer.  That is an extraordinary state of affairs and if it is to be allowed to prevail, it is blatantly unfair to the taxpayer.  I think it is an infringement of the function of the courts because it does away with ordinary rules of evidence and, generally speaking, is most undesirable. I may be wrong in my interpretation of it, but it seems to me to be something completely new and fundamental and very undesirable, and if I am right, I would ask the Minister to reconsider the whole sub-section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (1) (a), page 7, line <Col N="246" /> 38, to delete &ldquo;1957&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1958&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, this is another case of retrospective taxation.  An employee who was paid certain sums in the year commencing 5th April, 1957, knowing that he received a certain amount for his salary and knowing that he was paid certain sums for his expenses, made his family budget on the basis of taxation on his salary.  Now, as I understand the position arising out of Section 6, that is all gone, dead and done with, and we can now require the person for whom that employee is working to go back to 5th April, 1957, and give a return of that employee's expenses since that date.</P>
    <P>There is no sense in going back for the expenses, unless tax is to be levied, if the Revenue Commissioners and the company concerned disagree in relation to the expenses.  Therefore, as far as I can see, the whole point in this section is to raise tax in respect of the current year on a figure different from that on which the taxpayer was genuinely entitled to believe he would be assessed.  As far as I can see, this will lead only to Schedule E assessments. There may be some other explanation of it, but I do not understand what is at the back of it, unless it means going back over the last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 seeks information for the returns from employers with regard to payments to employees. It asks that the returns specified under Section 105 of the Income Tax Act of 1918 will be made from 5th April, 1957. The amendment suggested by the Deputy is &ldquo;5th April, 1958&rdquo;, but the inspectors of taxes would be dealing with tax due since 5th April, 1957.  If the Deputy's amendment were agreed to, it would mean the inspectors could not start operating under this section until next year.  It is the salary or emoluments or pay received from 5th April, 1957 to 1958, that will be coming under review now.  It is not seeking information that is necessary for the money that is now payable.  That is the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But is this information not for the purpose of taxing the <Col N="247" /> employee on a sum received by him in 1957-58 different from what would be chargeable if this section were not there?  If the Minister is trying to defend this purely on the basis that we assess this year on what was received last year, then I know where I am.  We do assess this year on what was received last year without any question, but people make their budgets knowing that they will be assessed on what they received and many people put aside, out of income as received, sufficient to meet the tax. This is now increasing the amount&mdash; this is not the charging section which will increase the amount, but the section which seeks information to increase it.</P>
      <P>What should be done, it seems to me, is that the charging sections should be put in this year&mdash;and I shall argue about that from another point of view.  But if one accepts that there should be charging sections, they should be put in this year and come in course of payment during the following year.  It does not seem right to alter the basis on which a man is assessed for tax after the year has closed.  We know that during a particular year, in common with other people, we may have to pay more or less tax according as the rate of taxation varies, but this is the first step in making one type of person amenable to an increase in tax in respect of something he has already received.  I shall deal with this more fully on the charity section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) Sub-section (1) of this section shall have effect only if the employment is an employment to which Part IV of this Act applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment should be pretty clear.  Section 6 is designed to facilitate the operation of Part IV of the Bill, and particularly Section 21 which brings in new provisions as to <Col N="248" /> taxation of expenses and, I suppose, in order to give effect to Section 21, it is necessary that the Revenue Commissioners should have the type of information they seek under Section 6. We shall deal with Part IV later on and I do not want to say anything about its provisions at this stage, but, even for the purposes of Section 21 or Section 22, as they stand, I think Section 6 is too embracing.  It seeks all information, every possible facet of information; it excludes nothing.  I think it is just unworkable and my amendment is designed to ensure that the information looked for in Section 6 shall be given only in relation to employments which are governed by Part IV. In brief, of course, it refers to persons earning over £1,500 a year because Sections 21 and 22, and the rest of them, apply only to persons in receipt of incomes over £1,500 a year. Therefore, the information which it is sought to get by this section should I think also be restricted to that type of employment and that is what my amendment seeks to do.</P>
    <P>The existing provisions of the Income Tax Acts make it obligatory on an employer to complete the returns of employees and submit them to the revenue authorities.  In any size of trading corporation employing any fair amount of persons that task is onerous enough as it stands.  It involves a considerable amount of clerical work and office administration to prepare the existing returns.  By this section, the returns will be expanded out of all proportion, as far as I can see.  Consider an office boy in a factory who is sent on an errand and is given his bus fare. Section 6 covers that type of payment; nothing whatever is excluded.  There is no indication that the size of the expense payment or the size of the salary of the person to whom the expenses are paid will enable an employer to exclude any particular information from the return.</P>
    <P>I think this provision will lead to chaos, if it stands.  It will involve the trading corporation in keeping all sorts of detailed records which they do not have to keep at the moment and which it will tax them very severely to keep in the future.  Further, the information <Col N="249" /> which will come as a result of this section will be an embarrassment to the Revenue Commissioners.  The flood of irrelevant and unnecessary information which will come in as a result of this Section 6, as it stands, will overwhelm the Revenue Commissioners and be a complete embarrassment.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to cut out all the irrelevant and unnecessary returns and just to put an obligation on an employer to give the expenses information about an employee to whom Part IV applies, that is, an employee in receipt of £1,500 a year or more.  I am confirmed in my opinion because, in relation to benefits in kind which are covered by Section 22, the farmers of the Bill themselves only look for returns about benefits in kind in the case of persons over £1,500 a year.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (1) (b) of Section 22 reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subject to the following provisions of this part of this Act, where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b) apart from this section, the expense would not be chargeable to income-tax as income of the director or employee,</P>
    <P>Rules 1 and 9 of the Rules applicable to Schedule E and Section 105 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, shall have effect in relation to so much of the expense as is not made good to the body corporate by the director or employee as if the expense had been incurred by the director or employee and the amount thereof had been refunded to him by the body corporate by means of a payment in respect of expenses, and income-tax (including surtax) shall be chargeable accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, in so far as benefits in kind are concerned, the framers clearly see it is necessary only to get information on benefits in kind in relation to people earning more than £1,500 a year.  But, in this case, where expenses are concerned, they seem to look for the information about everybody.  As it stands, it will place a tremendous burden of administration, recording, and analysing <Col N="250" /> on employers.  The duty of keeping the records to enable them to complete the existing return is onerous enough.  If it has to be extended, at least limit the information in relation to persons to whom it will be applicable, namely, to persons in receipt of £1,500 a year or more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be possible to limit the returns here to cases that might crop up under Part IV.  I am told this information would be necessary if there were no Part IV at all.  I do not know why Deputy Haughey should think there will be such a great deal of extra work in the ordinary firm.  Comparatively few employees get expenses of any kind.  So far as I know, the ordinary worker does not get expenses.  In that case, no return is to be made. Commercial travellers, for example, get their expenses.</P>

For various reasons, I think the power is necessary and that it will not create any trouble.</P>

      <P>I strongly support Deputy Haughey.  As I understand the position, I have got to put a separate new column in my petty cash books. Whenever I send the clerk or an office boy from my office in Baggot Street to the Four Courts and he takes a bus then, in the ordinary course of events at present, when he comes back he gets a refund of his bus fare.  I must now have a separate column for that. After every week, I must extend it in respect of the office boy, clerk, court clerk, and so on, and that has to be summarised as at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a rather trifling office such as mine, that would mean quite a substantial <Col N="251" /> amount of work.  I do not mind doing it if there is any point in doing it but there is no point in doing it.  The Minister and I may have difference of opinion in relation to certain other parts of Part IV. However, where expenses are paid by a person or by a big company&mdash;and there is no connection that could possibly lead to connivance between one and the other&mdash;what is the sense in the Revenue Commissioners' trying to set themselves up to determine whether it costs 3d. or 4d. for a bus fare from Baggot Street to the Four Courts?  That, as far as I can see, is what I shall have to do under this section.</P>
    <P>Every week, I shall have to take out, not my global figures&mdash;I would not mind doing that in the slightest-but the different bus fares charged up by each employee of mine who has to go from Baggot Street to the Four Courts. It is farcical.  There must be a method of framing the section in such a way that information that will be of some use in relation to revenue returns will be made available; that unnecessary time, annoyance and bad humour will not be spent by those in business collating information that is useless to everybody and&mdash;and this should appeal to the Minister&mdash;that he will not have to provide additional revenue officials to sort out the wheat from the chaff. As I understand the section, that is what I shall have to do.  I cannot see any sense in my having to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is under a misconception on this question of expenses because it is in the interest of an employer to make sure that any money he gives to an employee for expenses is so spent.  Consequently, the Minister, the employer and the Revenue Commissioners are all on the same side.  An employer is always very careful to check expense accounts of any sort, but for anyone who is engaged in a wholesale business where travellers are employed, It would be a very big job indeed to decide on the amount of money paid for petrol, for hotels for each individual, the amount spent on running repairs of a car, or <Col N="252" /> other expenses that travellers might incur from time to time, quite apart from entertainment.  What alarms me is the provision in sub-section (2) where it refers to payments made in respect of expenses and &ldquo;includes a reference to sums put at the disposal of an employed person and paid away by him.&rdquo; That covers absolutely everything.</P>
      <P>It covers not only the expenses of an office boy going down to the post office to buy stamps, but it covers the money given to him with which to buy the stamps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It covers 10/- given to the office boy with which to buy stamps, and his expenses are tangled up with ordinary office overheads.  The whole thing is quite laughably wide. Anybody who touches any money under any circumstances, even for the purpose of taking it from the cash office to the sales office, might have to be returned. I know that is a foolish thing, but, at the same time, there is no reason why the Revenue Commissioners should not say it should be done.</P>
      <P>There is a wonderful illusion that the Revenue Commissioners always get to the bottom of everything, given time. They cannot.  When they say they must be told about everything by everybody at once, it just produces chaos and confusion.  I hope the Minister will look into this matter realistically, because once it is ordered that a sum of money, paid to anybody for any purpose at all, must be returned against that person's account for the year, and then be justified, the Revenue Commissioners will not collect any taxes at all and everybody will go &ldquo;crackers&rdquo; in a very short time.</P>

      <P>The reference that puzzles me is that made &ldquo;to any payments... for services rendered in connection with the trade or business, whether the services were rendered in the course of their employment or not.&rdquo; What exactly does that mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Russell's question on the reference &ldquo;were rendered in the course of their employment or not&rdquo;, it might be held <Col N="253" /> by some clever lawyer, if we did not put in &ldquo;or not&rdquo;, that these were not expenses, that they were not used at all in the business.  I do not mind the employer giving the employee money to spend, but we do not want the employer to get away with it tax free in that case and, of course, the employee, too.</P>
      <P>However, I think the point raised by Deputy Booth is wrong with regard to the man who goes to buy the stamps. The Deputy may not have studied the Bill carefully because the last sub-section of Section 6 refers to paragraph (a) in sub-section (1) of the section and includes &ldquo;a reference to sums put at the disposal of an employed person&rdquo; and so on.  Paragraph (a) refers &ldquo;to any payments made after the 31st day of April, 1957, to employed persons in respect of expenses&rdquo;, so that sub-section (2) only qualifies paragraph (a) in so far as the money is used by the person as expenses.  The money the office boy&mdash;who has been referred to so often&mdash;gets to buy stamps is in respect of stamps and is not in respect of expenses and, therefore, sub-section (2) would not apply.  Anyway, if the office boy were paid less than £3 a week, he would not be returned under Section 105 of the Income Tax Act of 1918.</P>
      <P>Deputies are inclined to raise rather finicky points to give examples of the terrible things the Revenue Commissioners may do.  We should come down to the more serious part of this section and deal with it as a genuine attempt by the Revenue Commissioners to get returns with regard to expenses of employees where there might be cases in which money was being paid out by them as expenses but was really paid out in order to save them from paying income-tax.  It is quite true, as Deputy Booth says, that an employer will make very sure he gets a return of expenses from a person to whom he gives money for expenses.  In genuine cases, he will, but we are not dealing here with genuine cases, as such.  We are dealing with cases where the money purports to be for expenses but is not really for expenses at all, but paid out with the object of evading income-tax.  That is one case, but there may be other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say finally on this amendment that I instanced the case of the office boy only to show how all embracing the section is.  Apart altogether from finicky little points like that, there is no doubt that the section, as it is framed, will lead to a tremendous amount of additional administrative office work for any people who employ a substantial amount of labour.  It will mean that all sums of money not recorded in detail up to now will have to be compiled under various headings, segregated, analysed and submitted to the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not see the necessity for it.</P>
      <P>There is this procedure already in force in respect of returns under Section 105 of the 1918 Act.  The return required to be made under that section is a fairly comprehensive one and provides the Revenue Commissioners with a great deal of the information they require.  Furthermore, when an inspector comes along to deal with the accounts of a trading corporation, he goes through them with a fine comb. He analyses every suspicious figure that he finds, and can align himself directly on his target without going through the massive machinery involved in Section 6.  One would imagine that there was no other way but that laid down in Section 6 by which the Revenue Commissioners would get this information.</P>
      <P>Though the Minister might not be prepared to accept my argument that this information would be returned only in the case of persons earning £1,500 a year and more, I think he should accept the idea that the section, as it stands at the moment, is too wide and will result in chaos, if it is to be effectively enforced.  If it is not to be effectively enforced, it would be far better to leave it out altogether.  The Minister might consider between now and Report Stage putting some form of limit within the section, confining it in some way to more direct alignment on the type of information he wants, and the type of person he wants to get after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress yesterday evening, I was addressing my remarks to tourism. Many Deputies who have spoken on this Estimate have expressed the opinion that there should be a vast expansion of the tourist trade.  There can be no dispute on that point.  One of the limiting factors to the extension of tourism in Ireland is that practically all our outside advertising and all the energies of Bord Fáilte, those who conduct tourism here, are directed towards bringing people into the City of Dublin.  If one travels about the world and visits the capital cities of other countries, one finds that there is not a great deal of difference between one capital city and another, apart from the difference in language and the customs and habits of the people.  If we are to build up an extensive tourist trade, we must cater for people <Col N="256" /> who will return year after year.  The difficulty is that people who come to Dublin are the type of people who pay us one visit and go elsewhere the following year.  We should base tourism on the idea of having families coming here.  That can be done only by encouraging people to visit parts of Ireland outside the city.  That state of affairs will not obtain if all our advertising is directed towards bringing people into Dublin.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that in our advertising in Britain and other places, we should indicate an area south of a certain line and encourage people to come to that area through the southern ports, such as Cork, Waterford and Rosslare Harbour.  People can bring their own cars through those ports.  The main ferry into Ireland at the moment is through Rosslare Harbour.  When they bring their cars, people can travel to various parts of the country and will be encouraged to come back again.  The wealthier classes, who spend a short time in Dublin, are birds of passage and not potential future visitors.  There should be more advertising of places outside Dublin and outside, perhaps, Donegal and Kerry, which seem to get the most prominence on the posters that one sees outside this country in British railway stations and other places.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to employment and trade here is somewhat peculiar as compared with other countries. The majority of other countries are short of manpower and direct their energies to encouraging manpower to produce more and to get more out of their factories and industries generally. Our difficulty is the opposite.  Here there is an excess of manpower which we seem to be unable to absorb and which we lose annually by emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our external trade returns for 1956 with countries concerned with O.E.E.C. show somewhat alarming figures.  If the figures at my disposal are correct, they show an adverse balance of payments with all European countries, with the exception of France.  The only reason we had an export trade with France in 1956 was the fact that we exported large quantities of live stock to that country.  There is a moral <Col N="257" /> behind that.  That was the first year in which we exported cattle to France. The credit for securing that market must go to the previous Government, whether Deputies opposite like that or not.  That was the first time that first-class meat was exported to France, and when the French people tasted that meat they realised what fine stuff we had to export and they bought more of it.  It was the balance of payments that put them into difficulties so that they could not continue to buy our meat.</P>
    <P>The Federal Republic of Germany is one of the most prosperous States in Europe.  It has been built up in an almost phenomenal way since the disaster of World War II.  In 1956, our adverse balance of payments with the Federal Republic of Germany was in the neighbourhood of £5,000,000.  In the streets of Dublin and in practically every part of Ireland, one can see innumerable Volkswagen cars and Mercedes-Benz cars.  In fact, even Ministers are driving about in Mercedes-Benz cars now.  One can also see numerous German harvesting machines, combine harvesters, and so on, in every part of Ireland.  That is because the Germans had something to sell and went out and sold it by good salesmanship.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, the Federal Republic of Germany is a big and powerful nation, financially strong and in a position to advertise its wares, whereas we are a small nation whose expenditure on advertising abroad is necessarily restricted.</P>
    <P>That brings us to two schools of thought.  Are we going to try to get European, British or American industrialists to come in and start industries?  We have done everything possible to encourage such people to come here.  In fact, we have almost begged them to come.  We have offered them magnificent terms, freedom from income-tax if they manufacture for export and even special concessions, such as building factories for them. We have the manpower available.  We have the advantage of Imperial preference and we are closer to that great market, the United States of America, than any other country in Europe.  Yet, the results appear to be negative.  It <Col N="258" /> is very difficult to analyse the reason for that.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has been associated as I have been, with the Industrial Association or any of these organisations will know the extraordinary frustration that exists in trying to get those people to come here.  Apparently they are all keyed up and ready to come, but for some reason or other they fail to come.  I have had that experience with two foreign industrialists. Could it be that we are offering them too much, that we are more or less saying they can have everything they want, so long as they come in here and start a factory, that we will be only too glad to have them?</P>
    <P>That brings us to the other school of thought.  We are a small country with a limited amount of capital at our disposal. At the same time, I am sure that there is within the confines of the country sufficient money to establish industries of our own, provided we had the know-how.  That seems to be one of our great difficulties.  First of all, there is the difficulty of inducing those who have money to invest it in an Irish industry with the assurance that they will get a good return.  Another great difficulty is that, on account of our political history, and so on, we lack people who have a knowledge of industry and who can give us the technical know-how required to establish industries and put them into production.  In addition, there is the outstanding difficulty of marketing.</P>
    <P>The Government have at their disposal the sum of £250,000 which has been lying idle since the 1957 Budget, of which, as far as our researches in this House show, they have spent only £80 so far.  I suggest to the Minister that that sum could be directed towards encouraging and creating a co-operative system in this country; a co-operative system, to begin with, to set up industries and a co-operative system to assist in marketing.  I do not suggest for one moment that a sum of £250,000 would be sufficient to set up these industries themselves, or even to assist financially in the marketing of their products, but it does seem to me that, as we are a small country, if we have something to sell, quite obviously <Col N="259" /> one firm&mdash;its capital might be £20,000 or £60,000&mdash;cannot compete with American, continental or British industries. Surely we could form a co-operative system amongst such firms.  Somehow or other, one can never get anything going in this country, unless you have some sort of quasi-State body behind it.</P>
    <P>What the people want to-day is something specialised, something attractive, and things which were attractive 20 years ago are no longer so.  People are looking for something which strikes the eye and the Minister could direct his energies in that direction. There is already in existence in this country a small body from which could be built up the co-operative system, that is the Plunket House organisation.  In effect, you get, say, the textile group to come together and to advertise outside extensively.  If they advertised extensively in Britain, where we have a huge Irish population living, the people could be encouraged to buy Irish goods.  The same applies in America and other places, and it would have a snowball effect and we would be able to put our things before the world.</P>
    <P>The same probably applies to the whiskey industry.  We have some six or seven distilleries, and I believe if they came together as one group they could create considerable sales in the United States, for instance.  I am told that there is quite a demand for Irish whiskey in the United States.  I am also told that firms over there, who would stock Irish whiskey, do not like to do so because they feel that if they wanted large supplies&mdash;after all, Irish whiskey is an acquired taste, over and above the Scotch whisky, and it is quite a different thing&mdash;they would not be able to get those supplies because Irish whiskey has to be matured for seven years, or ten, if possible.  I am given to understand that apparently, by some chemical process in recent years, it is possible to put out Scotch whisky in a very short time.  It is somewhat on the lines of what they have been doing to wines in France.  Therefore we are, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Scotch distillers, at a disadvantage.  Were we to <Col N="260" /> get a large order from the United States, we could not supply it all. These are things which ought to be gone into.  If any country is going to buy, and buy extensively, they want to make sure that they will be able to get the goods.  I do not think the Minister can gainsay that.</P>
    <P>The same applies to tweeds.  I have often heard very high tributes being paid to Irish tweed by Americans and Europeans, but again, if they want to get large supplies of such materials, they are not available.  Two courses lie open to us.  The first is that we invite the foreigner in here, and is that going to be a success?  I thought so at one time, but I am rather inclined to change my views now.  We have Canadians in the mines at Avoca carrying on the work done by the State.  When they have been there for a year or so, they come back to the Government and the State has again to find the money.  It again poses the question: would it not be better to have an Irish company, with Canadian know-how behind it, running it?  We need to have more confidence in ourselves. The Government can do a lot, but the people should not expect the Government to do everything.  They should be given the confidence to do it.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister standing up here, and, in his opening statement, telling us that Ireland is brimming with confidence in the Government, that confidence has reestablished itself, and so forth.  The sorry picture is just the same and the flower of our country are still going away.  There is no other country in Europe in which that is happening, and surely it behoves us to try to do in bulk, and in the co-operative system, what individually we have failed to do. There is no reason why we should not, within our own limitations, be able to concentrate on industries, based, if possible, on our major raw material, agricultural produce.  We should have confidence in ourselves and not wait for the Government to do it, but the Government should direct all its energies to helping in every way any scheme which will encourage people to come together and fend for themselves.</P>
    <P>That is what we lack to-day, that <Col N="261" /> confidence which is so necessary.  We should concentrate as far as possible on specialised things and on those things which we have been able to produce at all times as good as anybody else.  If we concentrate on those things, our future will be good.  If we try to base our industries on letting anybody in here who is prepared to put up a bit of capital and start a chancy sort of venture, we will only create a position of instability which we do not want.  We want to try and stabilise our country as much as possible.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister should, as far as it is possible, direct his energies towards procuring whatever markets are possible in Europe.  Whether we like it or not, and particularly now with the possibility of stability in France, it seems likely that the Free Trade Area will soon be coming into being.  It is repeatedly stated by the O.E.E.C.&mdash;a body to which we belong and which was set up to advise us on our affairs&mdash;that we have all our eggs in one basket and that it is not a good thing.  It should be a warning to us to look for markets in other countries.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, negotiations are going on at the moment&mdash;I do not know whether or not they have been finalised yet&mdash;between the Federal Republic of Germany and this country.  In view of the facilities and heavy trade which they are getting from us, there should be reciprocity and they should buy far more from us than they do.  The Germans were always people who could strike a hard bargain and you got nothing by being weak.  I would advise the Government that it is in the interests of this State to see that Germany gives us a fair return for what we buy from her.  A £5,000,000 trade deficit is not encouraging, and if we stand firm and negotiate through our embassies and consuls abroad, we should be able to build up a nucleus of trade abroad which may be invaluable to us when we have to go into the Free Trade Area.  Then at least we will have a certain standing in those countries and will not be in the position of being just another island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>We have got a rather lopsided economy in which the major part of our unemployment is in the western countries and from there also the major part of our emigration takes place.  While all Government Departments should concentrate on providing the remedy for these twin evils, the Minister's Department is one that can help the small industries in the western areas.  The Undeveloped Areas Act went a certain distance, but I am afraid the results from that Act are not what we expected.  The enticements in the Act are not sufficient to outweigh the other advantages which industrialists have when setting up somewhere in the eastern counties.  In view of the heavy unemployment in counties like Dohegal, further action should be taken.</P>
      <P>We have provided facilities for people outside the country to come in and in vest here.  If special enticements were given to our own people who have emigrated and made money to come back and invest their money in their native country, we would have very good results. It is different when foreigners come in.  They come with the express purpose of getting all they can.  We cannot blame them for that.  When they provide employment here and help our exports, it is good to get them in.  But we have a large body of Irish people in England, Scotland and America, and we should, first of all, make available facilities for those people to come here and invest their money in their native country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that the unemployment problem is not as bad as last year, but it still exists in my county and other counties.  Lack of work and emigration is causing depression in those areas.  We must also bear in mind that should there be a slump in Britain similar to what has happened in America, we would be faced with a yet bigger problem.  It is well recognised that if unemployment develops across the water, the Irish people over there <Col N="263" /> will be the first to suffer.  We should make sure that we will be prepared for that influx of returned emigrants, if such a slump takes place.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to transport. Donegal will have a very serious transport problem very soon.  At present, the country is served by three transport concerns: the Lough Swilly Railway Company, the County Donegal Railways and the G.N.R.&mdash;all catering for the transport of passengers by road and rail within the county.  Under the proposed legislation, part of the transport system of the county will be handed over to C.I.E.  I take it that the remaining part of the internal transport of the county will be left as it is? It is very unsatisfactory to break up the transport of a county such as ours. It is an isolated county, an entity in itself and special methods will be required to deal with the transport problem arising there.  I would prefer either of two things: all the transport handed over to C.I.E. or, alternatively &mdash;and I would prefer this&mdash;a separate transport organisation for Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir.  We have this variety of transport organisations in the county at the moment.  I think the solution proposed is not the ideal one, and I hope the Minister will bear that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a further problem.  It is agreed, I think, that there will be a close down of the Portadown-Derry line.  There has been talk of it for some time.  That part of the G.N.R. line has got a second life.  Its life has been extended for two years.  But the <Col N="264" /> position will eventually be that it will close.  If that happens it means that there will be no railway service from Dublin and the rest of the country to most parts of Donegal.  It will cause very serious problems for traders and everyone in the county.</P>
    <P>There is one final point I would ask the Minister to consider and I would ask him, too, to make representations in relation to it to the Minister concerned. I refer to the 2/- which has to be paid on cars and other vehicles crossing the Border before 8 o'clock in the morning and after 9 o'clock at night.  That charge is seriously affecting the industrial and commercial life of the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that it is not the Minister's responsibility, but I am pointing out to him that it is seriously affecting the industrial and commercial life of the county.  Its abolition by the Minister responsible would make travel to the North, from the North to Dublin, and from one part of the county to another much easier.  For example, a business man travelling from the eastern part of the county, from Lifford or Ballybofey, to Carndonagh or Moville must pay 4/-, 2/- each time he passes in and out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>In this vast field of industry and commerce, one must approach the difficulties which beast those responsible for the administration of the Department, the formulation of policy and its implementation, with sympathy and understanding.  It is on that basis I propose to address myself to this Vote.  In the realms of industry and commerce, as has often been stated by the Minister himself, and it is a view with which I agree, success or failure in industrial projects depends in the ultimate on the enthusiasm and initiative of our people through the medium of private enter- <Col N="265" /> prise.  It is true that private enterprise, through the various legislative channels available to it, can be helped and, to some degree, sustained in its efforts by the Department of Industry and Commerce and the various advisory bodies subject to it; but not all of that help, advice or sustenance is of avail if the measure of initiative and the degree of home investment is not up to the standard required for the continued success of any project.</P>
      <P>It is from that viewpoint that I deplore from time to time, not alone in industry and commerce but in other matters of national import, the undue stress laid on the fact that a certain industry was either mooted, started or brought to completion during the reign of one Government or another, when, in fact, any project can be successful only because of the private enterprise initiative to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>The Minister is familiar with the old example in my constituency.  It was only to-day that I was looking at a yellow printed pamphlet published by the Minister's Party on the occasion of a by-election in North Mayo: &ldquo;Good news for the workers of Ballina.  Two hundred extra people will be brought into employment.&rdquo;  That project failed through no fault of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, through no fault of any Department of State, through no fault of any Government, but it had the effect of bringing into disrepute the word and the promise of public men.  That effect, to my mind&mdash; I am sure there are many who will agree with me&mdash;is one of the most damaging from the point of view of people interested in the speculative nature of industry and in giving their support by way of financial contribution or assistance to any project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this vast field to which I have referred, there are very important national projects, such as C.I.E., the E.S.B., Irish Shipping and Bord na Móna.  During recent weeks, there has been prolonged discussion here on C.I.E.  It is rather a pity that circumstances arise year after year&mdash;they are now guaranted for the next five years &mdash;in which the running of C.I.E. becomes a burden on the Exchequer to a very considerable extent.  It is <Col N="266" /> true that transport is meeting with difficulty in all countries, particularly nationalised subsidised transport. While I recognise the Minister's reluctance&mdash;possibly his lack of power &mdash;to interfere in the general or particular policies of a transport board such as C.I.E., nevertheless duplication in the transport system is responsible to-day for a great deal of unnecessary expenditure.  I cannot see the point in having duplication of rail and road passenger services, not once a day but in some instances twice and three times a day.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping is something of which we should all be proud.  Its advance and continued success is something of which we should not alone be proud, but for which we should all earnestly work.  It is a concern now of such magnitude and of such stability in the world of shipping that it should be of the status to command credit from sources other than that of the taxpayer's pocket.  That aspect of relieving taxation should very soon be a matter for consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable discussion here about the procuring of alternative markets.  Such markets are very desirable, provided there is some measure of security in newly acquired markets, not for one year but for a period of years, and for a guaranteed measured amount of products.  Our principal market is still Great Britain. While that is the position, I find myself in complete agreement with Deputy Booth who advocated, I think, support for the products of the market in which we sell most of our products.  There cannot be anything wrong with an attitude of that kind.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments trend over the last five months shows, I would say, if not a red certainly an amber light, and the position requires careful watching.  In the event of its continuing, I do not know what will happen to rectify it, now that the temporary instruments which were being used to keep matters in their correst spheres have become a permanent feature within our economic structure.  If it means that even further temporary hardships will be inflicted on our people, great vigilance is called for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="267" /> It is clear, even the Deputy Cunningham, that the questions of unemployment and emigration are still burning questions, particularly in constituencies such as his which resembles in many respects the constituency I represent, North Mayo.  It was interesting also to hear him anticipate a slump in Great Britain resulting in our people there having to come home and becoming a further burden here.  If that happened, it would cause untold hardship and all we can do is hope and pray that such an eventuality will not take place.</P>
    <P>Unemployment stands at a very high level.  The reduction between the figures of this year and last year is, in my opinion, explained by emigration. The Government, in spite of all its promises to relieve unemployment, has not contributed anything.  It is hard to blame the Minister for coming in here and saying in his opening statement that the country is absolutely teeming with confidence, that we are on the way back, that prosperity is around the corner, and other such phrases.  However, the Minister has an answer of considerable importance to give to the people for leading them into the belief shortly before the change of Government, there would be, as adumbrated by him, £100,000,000 invested in the creation of a considerable number of jobs.</P>
    <P>That statement had a bad effect.  It had the effect of bringing into disrepute public men and their utterances. When the people of any country come to lose faith in their public men&mdash;it does not matter what Party they belong to&mdash;and in their public institutions, it is then and only then the way is made clear for people less scrupulous in the means they use to achieve power.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister&mdash;it is a purely local matter&mdash;as to what is happening with regard to an advisory committee of some sort which was set up in relation to the possible continuation of a grassmeal project in my constituency, either at Glenamoy or elsewhere.  I did hear some time ago there was a likelihood of such a project starting in the neighbourhood of <Col N="268" /> Tourmakeady, in South Mayo.  Whatever happens in relation to that committee and its findings and recommendations, I do hope there will be no interference one way or another with the excellent work being done on that site, which was originally the site of the grassmeal project at Glenamoy, by the new organisation known as Peatlands, Limited.</P>
    <P>In the placing of factories and the provision of other means of giving employment, one cannot lose sight of the difficulties facing investors when they are asked to choose a long-distance site such as any place in the West of Ireland, Donegal, Clare or Kerry, as opposed to a more convenient site nearer to Dublin, Cork or the larger shipping bases.  Some advantages, probably greater than those in the Undeveloped Areas Act, should be placed at the disposal of people willing to go the long distances into such areas.  You will always have that difficulty of placing the necessary against the expedient.</P>
    <P>When it comes to a question of that kind, again you are confronted with private enterprise, local initiative and investment.  It is always a source of amusement to me to hear people not alone in this House but outside, advocating investment at home, control of our banks, control of our insurance corporations, when an examination of their own personal accounts would reveal a geographical investment wholly inconsistent with their pious utterances here.  There is sufficient control of the banks and of insurance corporations. The banks and the insurance corporations which have money to invest are doing their fair share towards the sustaining of the national economy when the time and occasion arise.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Department for the excellent meteorological station they erected near Belmullet in my constituency, and, at the same time, to tell them that when discussing it a short time ago with a local man, he said that since it was put up, we had not had a day's fine weather.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a very important question in relation to the whole of the western seaboard.  I would urge the Minister to use his good offices in Government <Col N="269" /> to increase the grants for tourist roads.</P>
    <P>On the question of hotels, I am inclined to the view that we have enough hotels, having regard to the length of our season.  Their improvement is something to be commended over the years.  I would ask the Minister to direct the attention of An Bord Fáilte to an aspect of tourism which is very highly developed in Scotland, certainly, to my own knowledge, and probably in other countries also, but not here&mdash;that is the smaller guest house or even the private house offering accommodation and meals.  It is only in these out-of-the-way places where the bigger hotels, or even hotels of any kind, are lacking, that the real scenery exists.  It is also by the tourist visiting our homes as they stand that they get to know the real Ireland and the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Permit me to return to the E.S.B. for a moment.  Rural electrification is going on very well within the limits of the board's power to provide capital for it.  However, the extra service charge for outlying houses is still far too high.  I do not think anyone would seriously disagree if it were suggested that even the existing charges for people in the ordinary way could bear some small increase, in order to bring power and light to those remote places which the present service charge makes it impossible to reach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking briefly on this Vote, I should like to quote some figures given by the Minister in his opening statement.  They give a guide to the present position and an indication as to whether the present Government's efforts are showing any results. I refer to the figures given in the <Col N="270" /> Official Report for the 11th June, 1958, columns 1517-8, where the Minister is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the December quarter of 1957 the volume of production index (to base 1953=100) of transportable goods industries was 108.8 as compared with 100.1 in the December quarter of 1956; and the number of persons engaged in these industries in December, 1957 was 151,200 as compared with 150,600 in December, 1956.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that when the Minister introduced his Estimate in 1957 people throughout the country thought that remarkable things would occur in the immediate future.  The Minister's figures show that in December, 1957 as against December, 1956, there were 600 more people in employment.  The Minister also said he felt we had reached the turning point, that we had reached stability and that things would improve very considerably.  It is difficult to accept that any real factual progress has been made, in the light of the figures he has given.  The pattern of drift of the rural population to the urban areas has continued and emigration has continued at even a higher rate than in previous years.  During the last 12 months and more, our people, especially those engaged in the production of transportable goods and in agriculture, were advised that the problem facing the country was one of greater production, and greater efficiency, in regard to their work in those fields.  Productivity has, in fact, gone up, but I would ask the Minister to tell the House in regard to the appeals of himself and his colleagues and the appeals of other public representatives to our citizens to give a greater return, play a greater part in the affairs of the nation and to produce a greater amount of goods, that if this effort is needed and if it is desirable to harness the man-power and the brain-power of our people, some positive steps will be taken to ensure that such efforts will not lead to continued high unemployment and high emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known to those engaged in industry&mdash;and even better known, I <Col N="271" /> think, to those engaged in agriculture &mdash;that greater efficiency, unless accompanied by expanding consumer demand at home and in the countries to which we export goods, inevitably leads to reduced employment.  Surely this is one of the lessons learned by the rural community over many years.  There has been very little net increase in production on the land, and yet there has been, and there is, a continuing loss of labour, loss of young men and of wives and children from the land and the country.  The same factor can operate in industry.  We have few large-scale industries, and yet I am sure it is known to the Minister that in some of those firms, employing reasonably large numbers of workers, greater production and efficiency and the adoption of new techniques have the effect of reducing employment.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to indicate what steps, if any, are visualised to deal with this problem which is a growing one to-day.  In the past 12 months, efforts have been made to encourage industrial development here by interests outside the country.  I think efforts to get industry going and so provide employment for our people at home have been generally welcomed, but there may be aspects of this encouragement that will give cause for concern in the future.  We might return to the position we had here not many years ago, when we had a large number of concerns in the same industry and because there was not sufficient demand for their output, either at home or abroad, the workers in the industry were, for considerable periods, on short time.</P>
    <P>I notice that efforts are being made to continue on a larger scale exploration for minerals and that it is hoped to continue exploration with a view to developing further coal seams, particularly in Leinster.  I wonder if hand-in-hand with this attempted development of mineral resources some attempt could be made to encourage our industries to use such native fuel as is available.  The workers in at least one Irish coal mine have been on short time because the mine has not been able to sell its coal.  One wonders <Col N="272" /> whether, in all circumstances, industries that from time to time seek protection from the Government in order that they may compete not only in our own market but outside the country at all times make the utmost efforts to avail of sources of power that are available here at home.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a very substantial increase in the use of imported fuel in operating heating plants for industries throughout the country.  I wonder whether the Minister could indicate that it would surely be more desirable for such industries to obtain their heating requirements from the E.S.B., the Irish coal mines and Bord na Móna before considering bringing in the fuel oil for these purposes.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Crotty who was kind enough to refer during the course of this debate to some difficulty that has existed for some little time past in the handling of goods at the Dublin docks.  I trust that one day the Deputy in question will take a little time off from his duty in this House and go down and talk to those men who must rely for the wherewithal to feed, clothe and house their families on casual employment obtained in loading and discharging cargoes at our ports.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into this matter in any detail, but I should like to mention that in the short time I have been a member of this House, I have heard, I suppose, the large majority of Deputies representing the agricultural communities indicate that the farmers are entitled to and should get reasonable prices for the goods they produce.  They indicate that they make a contribution to the community and that they should not be permitted to suffer economic hardship because of their contribution.  Hardly a week goes by without some mention being made in this House by people who represent rural communities of the necessity for guaranteed prices for wheat, oats and other agricultural products.</P>
    <P>For Deputy Crotty's information, the bulk of the Dublin dockers rely for their livelihood on the casual work obtained by them&mdash;work obtained as a result of their reporting at least once, possibly twice, each day and taking <Col N="273" /> the chance of whether, on the particular day, there may or may not be a day's work for them.  All they are concerned with and all they are looking for is the same type of treatment as Deputies want for the farmers, namely, an opportunity to house, feed and clothe their families.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Crotty or any other Deputy says it is unjust of the Minister for Agriculture to fix the price of wheat at a certain level because the Deputy's constituents may decide they will not be able to provide themselves and their families with the ordinary necessaries of life at that price and may decide to concentrate their efforts on some other form of agriculture&mdash;the raising of stock of one kind or another &mdash;I think we in the city are reasonably entitled to say that workers who have no alternative but to obtain their employment and essentials of life by means of casual work are at least entitled to endeavour to ensure that their livelihood will not be taken away from them.</P>
    <P>No interested party, whether in the farming community, who are anxious to ship their goods at a lower cost, the industrial community who also are anxious to do it or the shipping companies, has yet said that the changes they seek to have introduced will not result in early and immediate and large scale unemployment of dockers. If they and their representatives are so seriously concerned in this matter, they might inquire into how the situation was met in Holland some years ago.  They might be prepared, having regard to the danger of unemployment and all its hardships, to take a leaf out of the book of the authorities and industrialists in that country.  I would be very much obliged if Deputy Crotty would accept my invitation.  If he does, I will bring him down where we will discuss in the most friendly way his strictures on the people who have to work hard for their living and who, even when they work hard, get a very miserable living indeed.</P>
    <P>As I said in opening my remarks, I do not propose to speak very long on this Estimate, but I feel that it would be impossible to conclude without referring to one or two items of very <Col N="274" /> great importance.  One of them is the decision by the Minister to end the life of the Prices Advisory Body and to close up this avenue through which public investigations of changes in the price structure of essential commodities might be held.  When it was operating, this body was not free from criticism, but it is impossible for anyone to deny that on an occasion when price increases came into operation, particularly increases in the price of commodities necessary for ordinary citizens and their families, the value of this public tribunal could not be overestimated.</P>
    <P>To-day we have been informed that the cost of living has gone up by two points, the increases being mainly in the cost of foodstuffs, and I should like to express the opinion that the Minister made a very serious mistake when he took action to terminate the existence of the Prices Advisory Body. There is no public organisation of any kind now available by which increases in the price of food, and increases in the price of other commodities, can be examined, and a case made both for and against such increases.  Consequently, there are interests that welcome, and will continue to welcome, any opportunity they possibly can obtain of passing increased prices on to the general body of consumers, and there is no body now available before which they can be asked to explain their actions and justify their decisions.</P>
    <P>This recent increase is one that will affect the ordinary living standards of our whole community, and it is most regrettable, indeed, that at this stage, when it was hoped that prices might have at least become stable, there is an indication again of instability.  I remember only too well discussions and expressions of view which took place last year on the question of whether increases in prices would justify the workers seeking wage increases. I think it would not be unfair to say that during the past 12 or 15 months, as a result of the efforts on both sides of industry, the employers and trade unions, and with the assistance of the Minister himself, large scale dislocation of industry was avoided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> Certainly, the year has been relatively free from industrial disputes arising from claims for increased wage rates, and I do not think anyone can begrudge the Minister taking his meed of praise for the success of his efforts in that matter.  However, I think the Minister will be in a most unhappy position if there is a possibility of a further increase in the cost of living taking place, particularly when it is realised that there are still many thousands of people who have not received any compensation for the last increase in the cost of living, and many of the people concerned should normally be under the protection of this House.</P>
    <P>This year has shown a deplorable development of ineptitude on the part of Bord Fáilte.  An Tóstal was instituted for the purpose of attracting tourists from our neighbouring country, from Europe, from America and from Canada, and I am beginning to wonder whether in fact An Tóstal, as it has been carries out under the almost direct control of Bord Fáilte in the City of Dublin, has served any useful purpose whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual, Sir, I bow to your correction and accept your direction, but I do think the spirit of carelessness as to whether or not tourists come into the country is a matter for this House.  It is a matter of public concern if money provided by this House is spent in such a manner that it results in not only the board responsible <Col N="276" /> but this House and the country being made ridiculous in the eyes of the world.  Approval is given one day to a festival and the following day the body that approved the festival withdraws sanction and approval.  We no longer live in an island surrounded by high walls.  Ideas do percolate into our country occasionally.  What happens in our country can be the subject of praise and can also be the subject of blame and ridicule.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy, particularly a Deputy representing part of the capital city, I am entitled to ask the Minister to bear these matters in mind and to use whatever machinery he has to ensure that if An Tóstal takes place in 1959 there will not be a repetition of what happened in Dublin in 1958.</P>
      <P>I opened my speech by quoting the Minister's figures of employment of workers in transportable goods.  I would ask the Minister to indicate, when replying to the debate, whether he or his Government have any plans to deal with the continuing high level of unemployment and, in particular, to deal, not only with the working population but with the problem of creating the 20,000 new jobs which it was estimated would be necessary each year to absorb the boys and girls coming into industry or agriculture for the first time.  I stress this matter very definitely.  There are many things about which Deputies here will not agree but we will all agree that it is most desirable that in the case of young boys or girls who are not continuing their education in secondary schools or university and who for one reason or another have to go into the labour market no significant period should elapse between the time they finish their studies and the time they take up employment.  Therefore, I would be obliged if the Minister would indicate whether he has any proposals in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While asking the Minister that direct question, I have a suspicion that I may get the same answer as most of us are getting these days when it comes to a question of the continuing problem of unemployment, namely, that it is a matter for private enterprise, for private initiative, a matter mainly <Col N="277" /> for private investment and private finance.  May I put this final question to the Minister: At what stage in a country's development does it become the responsibility of the elected Government to concern themselves in a positive way with the question of unemployment, the question of increasing cost of living and the question of a continued high level of emigration? I do not think that the Government here, represented by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or Deputies, can continue for any great length of time to adopt the attitude that it is the responsibility of somebody else to look after the Irish people, that it is the responsibility of somebody assembling motor cars, running a bakery, raising calves or running the E.S.B. That responsibility is vested in this House and in the Government elected by the House.</P>
    <P>Perhaps too much attention is given on these occasions to remarks like those made recently by Deputy Lindsay, to the effect that those sections of the community who call out to have some control of the credit in the country vested in the elected organs of the people instead of in the self-appointed custodians of the nation's finance are those who invest their savings and the finances at their disposal outside this country.  Deputy Lindsay was ill-informed when he made that statement because the people who are anxious that the elected Government of this country should have at least some say in whether the moneys derived from the efforts of our people are spent outside the country or inside the country in the interest of our people are certainly not those who adopt the line indicated by Deputy Lindsay.</P>
    <P>We have almost reached a point now, particularly in view of the decisions taken in the past 12 months&mdash;the abandonment of the Prices Advisory Body, the throwing overboard of any control of prices, the withdrawal of food subsidies&mdash;at which we might be termed as almost classically <i>laissez faire.</i>  I do not know whether any progress will be made in these conditions, but I certainly suggest to the Minister that neither he nor his Government can escape responsibility simply <Col N="278" /> by saying: &ldquo;Well, now, if there are thousands of unemployed, if there are 40,000 to 50,000 still emigrating, if there is still the very serious problem of the cost of living facing our people, those are matters not for me, or this Government, but for the people outside.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He will not get away with that attitude for very long.  It has not been entirely the Minister's attitude in the past and it certainly will not encourage our Irish people to make the effort which is required of them, if they are told that their future must lie in the hands of those whose interest in industry is mainly to make a profit for themselves.</P>

      <P>The Minister's speech introducing the Estimate afforded great pleasure to my constituents in North Mayo, and on last Sunday the people of the district asked me to convey their gratitude and thanks to the Minister for his promises and for his work in giving us the new generating station at Bellacorick.  We know the Minister started this work some years ago when he knew that the consumption of electricity would necessitate the erection of this station.</P>
      <P>We have had two changes of Government and the people who formed the Government when we were put out of office, deliberately slowed down this work.  The work would have been almost completed to-day, but for the advent of the Coalition Government into Irish politics.  The Minister has justified his forethought when he set out to start this station in North Mayo. He was not pessimistic as his predecessors in the previous Government were, and he knew that the consumption of electricity would justify this step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It means a lot to the people of this area, especially when we consider that in North Mayo there is about one-tenth of the whole area of bogs in the Twenty-Six Counties and an unlimited supply of men.  That is something which the people in North Mayo realise and we are quite happy that this work is going on.  I regret that my colleague from North Mayo who spoke this evening did not seem too pleased.  He did not refer to this scheme with smiles as he generally does.  I wonder <Col N="279" /> would the Minister be able to do something with the large area of bogs which lie in the Ballycroy area?  He might consider starting a briquette factory there, as there is plenty of turf, and, as I said, plenty of men.</P>
    <P>We were also delighted to hear that the subsidy for the supply of electricity to the backward areas has been restored, because in my constituency there are a number of areas which were left out and would not be dealt with unless some subsidy was provided.  This is a great boom to the backward areas and they will now have a service that is considered an essential service.</P>
    <P>I have heard Opposition members speaking about the number of unemployed in the area and they have tried to shift the blame for this unemployment on to Fianna Fáil.  We should remember that a few months prior to the general election there was a meeting of the various Parties in the Coalition Government, across in the Engineers' Hall in Dawson Street. Everything was to be grand after that meeting, but what really happened was that, nice and quietly, the Coalition realised, when they got the Estimates for the coming year, that they could not carry on and they folded up their wings and decided that they would go to the country, not to be returned as a Government but to let Fianna Fáil take over the mess which they had got us into.  That was the position.  Of course, I might as well admit that one good thing happened as a result of that election.  We did get rid of the two splinter Parties and now all we have left really, are the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  We are delighted that this is so because the splinter Parties definitely are no use to the progress of the nation.</P>
    <P>The return of Fianna Fáil as a Government restored the confidence of the people in the country.  It also restored their confidence in our economic and financial situation.  Loans and supplementary grants that were held up two years ago are now being paid regularly.  The building trade is reviving slowly but surely.  Probably it is not reviving as quickly as a lot of us would like, but when we remember the state&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I know that the Minister is doing his best to solve our unemployment problem. He was questioned here to-day about a statement he made.  If Fianna Fáil had not come into power our unemployment position would be very bad to-day.  As a result of the Minister's activities I hope to see at least 300 extra men employed in North Mayo in a short time.  I know the Minister is doing all he can to help us in North Mayo.  I know the help he is giving us to start an industry in Ballina.  If any attempt made to start an industry did not succeed, the Minister cannot be blamed.</P>
      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on his work as far as North Mayo is concerned.  I heard talk of the promises made by Fianna Fáil in the last election.  I spoke in North Mayo and my promises were few.  One was that things would not be as bad as they were, and another was that if Fianna Fáil were returned, we would get cracking on the generating station at Bellacorick.  Fianna Fáil have got cracking on it.  My promises to the electorate have been fulfilled.  The same promises were made by my colleague, Deputy Doherty.  I know the Minister will do all he can to get the country out of the mess it is in. He is doing so at the moment and the country is progressing.  On behalf of the people of North Mayo, I thank the Minister very much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister was particularly pleased with Deputy Calleary's contribution.  There is no use in the Deputy praising his own Minister.  If the Minister did any good, it was his duty to do it.  Deputy Calleary led us to believe that if there had not been a change of Government in 1957, there would be no generating station in North Mayo now.  Of course <Col N="281" /> there would be.  It was in the course of erection.  In fact, the generating station near Caherciveen in South Kerry was actually completed when Fianna Fáil came into office in 1957.</P>
      <P>It was very doubtful if the E.S.B. would agree to erect these stations at all.  It was stated, I think the Minister will agree, that we would have cheaper electricity if they were never erected and would have sufficient supplies. However, they are there now and I am sure every Deputy will wish them success. Perhaps they may help to relieve unemployment and improve the conditions of the people in the areas in which they were erected.  The trouble is that there are not sufficient people in those areas to cut and save the turf supplies.  I understand that each of these stations requires 30,000 tons of turf per annum.  Up to the present, I think, that supply has not been made available.</P>
      <P>Deputy Calleary praised other things the Minister had done in North Mayo. I noticed he did not refer at all to the Ballina biscuit factory.  I wonder has that been erected yet?</P>

So far we have not seen any steps taken to put that scheme into operation. We have heard nothing at all about it. There was nothing about it in the Minister's opening statement.  In fact, anybody reading that statement would say it was all a piece humbug.  We have heard all these statements made down through the years.  It is about time there was stocktaking here in connection with industry and, perhaps, agriculture, too.</P>

    <P>It was rather humiliating for our people to hear the Minister at the meeting dealing with the Free Trade Area say that Ireland must be regarded as an undeveloped country and must be considered so for the next 25 years at least.  We have had a Government of <Col N="282" /> our own since 1922 or 1923.  For about 28 of these years Fianna Fáil have been in power.  The trouble is that when they came into office in 1932&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy calculates it he will find it is practically correct. If the blame lies anywhere, it must lie with the Party that has been in office for that long period.  Agriculture was prosperous when Fianna Fáil came into office in 1932, but they forgot about agriculture and set about destroying it. The Minister, who was Minister for Industry and Commerce during the 28 years Fianna Fáil were in office, set about building up Irish industry.  I hold he went about it the wrong way and that is why we are in the mess we are in to-day.  Deputy Calleary talked about a mess.  Any mess in this country is due to Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;not only from the point of view of agriculture but also from the point of view of industry.  This country is basically agricultural and if you want to build up industry here, such industry must be connected with agriculture in some way.  Purely agricultural countries like Holland, Belgium and Denmark have based their industries on that chief activity.  We have to import all the raw materials required for our industries.  Everything produced in our factories is produced behind a high tariff wall.  If these tariffs were removed, how many of these industries would survive?  Recently the Minister stated that if the Free Trade Area comes into being many of these industries will have to become more efficient and will have to produce better goods if they are to compete in the Free Trade Area.  He stated further that he feared very much that many of them would disappear.  Perhaps it would be just as well if they disappeared now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> With regard to the Free Trade Area, I wonder does anyone know what it means?  I wonder does the Minister himself know what it means, or the Minister for Agriculture, who should have been with him in these negotiations? There is no use in our trying to fool ourselves into the belief that Irish industry can ever prove satisfactory when the raw materials for that industry have to be imported.  If an emergency arises to prevent the importation of these raw materials, what will happen to our factories?  What will become of stability of employment?</P>
    <P>How many factories set up by Fianna Fáil over the years have failed?  I have one example in my own constituency.  I admit the Minister did his best to try to bolster it up.  There is something very wrong.  A great deal of the taxpayer's money has been spent, or rather misspent, on establishing and maintaining industries here.  When a factory established by private enterprise in an undeveloped area fails, the Minister should take some steps to get expert advice as to how to turn that failure into a success.</P>
    <P>Up to 1932 there was really no unemployment. There was no emigration. Official statistics will show that there was actually an influx of something like 11,000 people.  I know Deputy Loughman will not agree with that, but he will find that it is correct. There was no flight from the land.  A Tariff Commission had been set up to examine certain types of industry and to decide whether or not they were deserving of protection.  There was a change of Government in 1932 and a policy of industrialisation was embarked upon.  As a result of that industrialisation, we were to bring back our exiles; there was to be employment for all.  What is the situation to-day?  The people are disillusioned. The only time the people got any little bit of encouragement at all both from an agricultural and an industrial point of view was during the short term of office of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>Those who know the condition of affairs in Irish industry to-day know full well that all is not well.  The Minister knows that.  This is an agricultural <Col N="284" /> country and our industries should be built on the produce from the land.  The high cost of living is due to a large extent to the protective tariff wall built around industrial production here.  It would be a good thing if that wall were removed and industry compelled to stand on its own feet.  The cost of living would come down and we would know where we were.</P>
    <P>I do not like to refer to elections because I know that many candidates foolishly make promises during election times.  The Minister is shameless in that regard.  I can give him credit for being a good Minister, but he can get away with anything for the time being.  Eventually, of course, he is found out, but he has a way of making people believe that what he states at election times is perfectly true.  During the last general election he spoke about an expenditure of £100,000,000 and the 100,000 people to be put into employment.  He asked the housewives to &ldquo;Vote Fianna Fáil&rdquo; and bring back their husbands and their sons.  I wonder how many of them have come back.</P>
    <P>While the inter-Party Government were in office only single men and women were emigrating.  Now whole families are leaving the country.  If this Government continues in office and proceeds in the same way as they have been going down through the years there will be no one left in the country eventually; there will be no 300 to be employed in North Mayo. While there is unemployment there will be emigration.  Up to 1932 there was no flight from the land.  There was a change of Government and steps were taken to destroy agriculture. There was no employment on the land. That was the beginning of our troubles.</P>
    <P>It is a perverted economy to establish industries which depend for their existence on imported raw materials when agriculture is the basic industry. Once the people leave the land it is very difficult to bring them back.  Had these industries and factories not been set up&mdash;principally, of course, in Dublin and the neighbouring towns&mdash; the people would have remained on the land.  But these factories were estab- <Col N="285" /> lished and the people left the land to work in them.  Some of the factories failed and the people were ashamed to go back to the land.  Had the Fianna Fáil Government been wise on first coming into office they would have continued the policy pursued by the Cosgrave Government.  I know the Minister for Industry and Commerce tried to do his best.  Perhaps he thought things would work out differently. I am sure the situation has given him many headaches down through the years.</P>
    <P>I am interested in tourism because I come from an area in which tourism is very important.  One good thing done by the previous inter-Party Government was the amalgamation of these two boards set up by the Minister when he was in office prior to 1954. I understand Bord Fáilte gets £500,000 for the improvement of roads and other works.  Most main roads are now in good condition, but, in various tourist areas, there are roads which we may call secondary county roads requiring improvement.  While I suppose Bord Fáilte has full power to allocate funds for this purpose, it would be no harm for the Minister to ensure that it is done.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte can also give loans for the improvement of hotels, but it is almost impossible for any hotelier to avail of such loans.  The conditions are entirely too strict.  The improvements required are such that they could not be carried out in various hotels because of the expense involved. Therefore many hoteliers, when they wanted to make improvements, extensions, and so forth, preferred, where their credit was high, to go to the bank for a loan, and I believe they were wise in doing so.  It is also to be deplored that when hoteliers spend vast sums of money on the improvement of their premises, the valuation is enormously increased.  I know that is not the responsibility of the Minister's Department, but it is one of the factors preventing hoteliers from improving their premises.</P>
    <P>Deputy Calleary, I think, referred to the restoration of the subsidy to the E.S.B. for the extension of rural electrification.  Seeing that it was his <Col N="286" /> own Party that withdrew it, the least they might do was to restore it. Perhaps they had reason for withdrawing the subsidy; I suppose financial stress and clearing up the so-called mess...</P>

      <P>Rural electrification has been greatly extended and is one of the great amenities for our people, but Deputy Calleary must remember that when the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the first Government since this State was founded, Deputy McGilligan, set out to build the generating station at Ardnacrusha, it was called a white elephant.  It is no harm to remind Deputies of that.  I am sure they realise now the benefits accruing from it.  It would be well if the Minister for Industry and Commerce and other Ministers would realise all the mistakes they have made down the years and try to change their views in many respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All down the years since Fianna Fáil came into office, we have had the problems of unemployment, emigration, the cost of living and high taxation. Every year since they came into office, taxation has gone up and up, and the same applies to unemployment and emigration.  They were also responsible for increasing the cost of living recently by withdrawing the subsidies <Col N="287" /> on essential foodstuffs, causing a great deal of difficulty in connection with requests for increased wages, causing strikes, and so on.  It is a wonder that before doing these things they would not consider the results.</P>
    <P>To revert to tourism, this Government has spent a considerable amount of money in the United States trying to bring Americans to Ireland.  Our best tourists are the people in the neighbouring island and it is a wonder they come at all when one considers all the silly things being done, such as the Bantry Bay incident.  They are the best tourists and the best spenders. Anyone who travels by train or otherwise and hears Americans talking and giving their views on this country, on our hotels and so on, and then hear the English tourists talking, will learn something.  When we Irish people, for instance, pay our bill in a hotel, we never consider it any more but the Americans will go minutely into every item in their bill.  They are justified in doing so and they are always very welcome, but I cannot see why we should spend so much money trying to induce Americans to come here while neglecting the people nearer home.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, it would be wise and necessary for the Minister to act in an independent way because I am sure he has the ability to do so and to take control of his own Department.  When he is speaking on his Estimate or on any other matter, he should speak in a way the people will understand and not try to camouflage the position of Irish industry.  Whether we have a Free Trade Area or not, the people deserve the best that can be produced in our factories at the cheapest price.  There is no reason why we should tax our people in order to maintain an industry which is not carried on efficiently.  It would be better for our people that any industry which has to be bolstered up by subsidies or high tariff walls should not be allowed to exist.  In spite of what I have said, of course, it is necessary, it is essential and it is desirable that, as far as possible, all our requirements should be produced in our own factories in the way I have mentioned. Everyone wishes the Minister well in <Col N="288" /> his efforts to improve Irish industry and to improve everything else that would be for the benefit of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks I have to make are brief, in this annual review on the presentation of the Estimate for Industry and Commerce.  The most outstanding feature of the past year has been the fact that industry was to such a great extent jeopardised by the very many wage increases which naturally resulted from the Government's deliberate action in increasing the cost of living.  That was the predominant feature of the last year and it is reverberating to-day right down through every part of the country and in every item the people have to buy.</P>
      <P>The Minister&mdash;in so far as we can glean what his policy is in relation to the future&mdash;seems to have been the subject of a remarkable conversion.  He seems to have jettisoned the old ideas he held for so long and on which he spent so many millions of the people's money, in his efforts to bolster up Irish industry.  Nowadays, he is apt to deliver strictures to the people he nursed for so long and one notes a certain petulance at the lack of response on their part to live up to the requirements which the country would expect of them in consequence of the protection which they received over such a long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This idea of recruiting foreign capital and foreign know-how, the interest of outsiders, with their advancement in marketing, and so on, was initiated to a great extent by the visit of the last Taoiseach, Deputy J.A. Costello, to America.  That visit was used up and down this country, in the last general election, as having been a visit forced upon the then Taoiseach, when he went, it was said, with cap in hand begging for money to assist the then Government in overcoming any difficulties they had to face.  To-day we see the Tánaiste in this Government pursuing a similar policy and expressing his belief in a policy which we regard as being one which holds out for our people the greatest possibilities in the future.  That is the policy of bringing before the eyes of the world the advantages we have to offer here, in the availability of labour, in the <Col N="289" /> peaceful conditions under which people can embark upon industrialisation, and in the possible advantages which may flow in years to come through Ireland's proximity to the new Free Trade Area of Europe.</P>
    <P>These are matters which seemingly the Government have come to appreciate, in consequence of the action of the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, in giving certain encouragement to industries established in this country with the object and aim of participating in the export market. We had a further extension of this encouragement in the Budget of last year.</P>
    <P>Can we claim that there are immediate results flowing from those concessions? Is it any assistance, when we put a smoke screen of ballyhoo over the efforts of two successive Governments to attract foreign capital and establish such industries?  We find something like this flashed across the page of the <i>Sunday Press</i> on the 16th March, 1958: &ldquo;Many New Industries Start: Tax plan appeals to traders.&rdquo; What are the new industries? &ldquo;Mullingar: a new industry which could be working by Easter&rdquo;&mdash;but was not&mdash;&ldquo;to employ 140 persons, if a suitable site on the old military barracks is secured; no details yet of the type of industry.&rdquo;  Seemingly, the site was procured and now we know the details of the industry.  It is an industry which was dismantled in my constituency and transferred holus bolus to Mullingar. That is presented to the gullible readers of the <i>Sunday Press:</i>&ldquo;Many New Industries&rdquo;&mdash;with emphasis on the &ldquo;New.&rdquo;  New industries, my foot.  A long established industry in Kanturk in my constituency was transferred holus bolus to Mullingar and presented as something flowing directly from the tax concessions of last year's Budget. There is an example of the ballyhoo presented from time to time.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was physically assaulted&mdash;and this is an incident I regret occurred in the town of Portuma recently&mdash;I regret very much, and so does everyone in public life, the successful effort to cloak its occurrence, as it was not alone an assault on the Minister but on everyone in public life. The occurrence&mdash;and the perpetrators <Col N="290" /> got away unpunished&mdash;arose out of the fact that, even though the Minister was not responsible for the closing down of the factory in Portumna, he and his Party claim to be responsible for the establishment of factories in which they possibly had absolutely no hand whatever. When they do that, they must face up to the unfair blame attached to the Minister and his Party on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Further down in this list of &ldquo;new&rdquo; industries we have Bandon: a jewellery industry to be established by a Dublin firm which will employ 50 men and women.  I am very sorry that no Deputy from South Cork is present now, as they are far more familiar with the efforts to establish the industry, which it was claimed would employ 12 people. They are familiar&mdash;and so is the Minister and his Department&mdash;with the background to the whole of that attempt to establish an industry.  We know what occurred.  To present to the people, on the 16th March last, that this was a great industry, which arose directly from the Government's policy in their &ldquo;Tax Plan which appeals to Traders&rdquo; is not the way to assist Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government would do well to desist from that kind of carry-on and to realise there is much required of them and expected of them at the moment.  Any Government or any Party which would go out with the confidence which they showed some 15 months ago, as to their ability &ldquo;to get cracking&rdquo;, which presented, as they did,&ldquo;a £100,000,000 plan&rdquo; to bring an absolutely new face lift to the entire country, must have inspired in many people considerable hope that, flowing from that, there would be the creation of the &ldquo;100,000 jobs&rdquo; which would to some extent alleviate the serious emigration problem.</P>
    <P>Some few minutes ago, Deputy Calleary was congratulating the Minister to a point when it must have been something of an effort to the Minister not to blush, under the wonderful plaudits which emanated from the Deputy for North Mayo, in expressing the heartfelt gratitude of the people of North Mayo that they now have to pay 7/4 a stone for flour, arising out <Col N="291" /> of the Minister's actions in the Budget. It is indeed good to know that 500 will be employed in that constituency directly in consequence of the Minister's efforts, but we shall look to the discussion this time 12 months, if we are here to discuss it, to ascertain how many of those people will be employed in the constituency at that time.</P>
    <P>It was notable that in the Deputy's ramblings over a wide field he deliberately refrained from referring to something very dear to his heart and to the heart of all western Deputies not so very long ago but to which he never made even one single reference this evening&mdash;the question of emigration. It was a strange omission but it possibly flows from the fact that it is a subject that it would be well for those people sitting behind the Minister to avoid at this particular time.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to refer briefly to one or two other matters. One is that one of the actions of this Government on obtaining office was to relax to some extent the import levies imposed by the last Government to do a particular job of work.  Since then the remainder of these levies have been made permanent by legislation which will remain in years to come to show whether dire consequences may not flow from that action.  At any rate, certain people were placated on the advent of the Government by the removal of certain import levies.  In consequence, there was greater activity in these branches of industry and definitely there was a small improvement in employment, but looking back on it now, we may well ask: did the cost of living benefit from these levies? I would say to the Minister that, in these months which are not so encouraging in relation to our trading position, when there is a definite disimprovement in comparison with this time last year, he would do well to look at our imports and see whether he could not curtail many of them.</P>
    <P>To-day there is a rash of petrol stations all over the country and surely the point has been reached when everybody who runs a vehicle can get a petrol supply within a convenient distance.  I think it is unfair to those <Col N="292" /> who are in the trade.  Because of this competition between oil combines we have these stations being set up as they are, stations which must entail enormous items in our imports every year&mdash;the constituent parts of these stations which are not manufactured in this country.  If it is possible for the combines to afford these luxurious stations, would it not be far better if this vast outlay could be passed on to the petrol users rather than have them facing the high cost of motoring as it, is now, while, at the same time, these stations are springing up where there is absolutely no necessity for them?</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Minister made some Order which precludes motorists from trading in their old car batteries. To-day every garage is choc-o-bloc with old car batteries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I made no such Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of that, but at least the Minister could consider the fact that old car batteries cannot be disposed of and that garage-owners say they cannot give the purchasers of new batteries the allowance they were accustomed to get on old batteries.  I was given to understand this was in consequence of an Order, but I accept the Minister's statement that he did not make such an Order.  Yet, there is an obligation on him to look into whatever problem has arisen that precludes people obtaining allowances which they previously received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the only points I have to make on the Estimate, but I should like to join with other Deputies in expressing grave concern at the fact that the Minister in the past 15 months since his reappointment to the Department has seen fit to dispense with whatever price control bodies we had and, in consequence, has given the green light for the abuse of the present situation.  The consumers to-day are extremely perturbed by the way in which the cost of living has risen.  Quite apart from the great contribution the Government made deliberately to increasing that cost of living, the Government is also guilty of neglect in having abandoned the means which was available to ensure that the consumers <Col N="293" /> were not exploited.  That, certainly, has had a very bad effect and it is one reason why many people throughout the country feel that the Government and the Minister have let them down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Deputies who have spoken in this debate referred to our acute unemployment and emigration problem.  That was to be expected because it is accepted that the test of every policy and plan is its effectiveness in increasing the level of employment here.  We are, however, concerned in this debate with only one aspect of the problem, that is, the extent to which it is practicable to increase employment, improve the employment opportunities available in the country, through the development of industry, through the activities for which the Department of Industry and Commerce is responsible.</P>
      <P>We know there are many roads to an improved employment situation.  I accept that the development of industry is the most important, but there are others.  We are not now debating the whole general economic situation, but only that aspect of it which comes within the sphere of operations of my Department.  In May of this year, we had 8.7 per cent. unemployed, that is to say, the number of registered unemployed represented 8.7 per cent. of the total number of insured workers in the country.  A year ago, it was 9.5 per cent., in May of 1957; in March of 1957, when this Government came into office, it was 10.8 per cent.  I am not seeking any consolation from these figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is now 8.7 per cent. Let me be clear about that.  I am not seeking to console anyone by quoting these figures, notwithstanding the trend which they disclose, because 8.7 per cent. is far too high a level of unemployment <Col N="294" /> and the aim of policy must be to get it down.  We shall not get it down, however, by merely passing resolutions deploring it.  We shall get it down only by taking practical measures to expand productive activities, activities which will give work to our people, and the only valuable contributions made in this debate came from those who addressed themselves to that aspect of the matter in a constructive way.</P>
      <P>Reference was made here to statements which I made prior to the election&mdash;two carefully prepared statements which were published as supplements by the <i>Irish Press.</i>  My purpose in making these statements was twofold. First, I wanted to stress the magnitude of the economic problem confronting the country, to make it clear, in so far as I could do it as an individual, to the Government then in office, to the trade unions, to the employers' associations and to the public generally that the position developing was far too serious to be capable of being put right by pettifogging, fiddling methods.  I wanted to emphasise that only a tremendous effort embracing all sections of our people would be adequate to rectify it.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I set out to try to demonstrate that it could be done, to try to deny the pessimism of those who were talking as if the country was finished, to show that by making the effort, given the combination of policies and plans embracing all sections of the people, it could be done.</P>
      <P>Deputies have quoted these statements who obviously have not read them or, if they have, they have certainly forgotten their purport.  My main object was to emphasise my view that the economic situation of the country, our unemployment and emigration problems, could not be put right by Government action alone; that there was no Bill that could be passed, no resolution that could be adopted in this House that would solve these problems; that there was no slick, easy, solution; that it would be a long, tough job to put the economy of the country right and that we could succeed in doing that only if every section of the people was pulling in the same direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> Reference has been made to the estimate of £100,000,000 capital investment required, to 100,000 jobs needed to create full employment.  Does any Deputy think it possible to work in any intelligent way to the solution of these problems without making some estimate of the magnitude of the problem or of the investment expenditure that would be required in order to deal with it?  I was not producing a plan in the sense that some Socialist writers talk of plans.  I was trying to set out for the people of this country economic objectives which I believed to be realisable and then tried to estimate what was involved in their realisation. In so far as I put forward practical proposals, I here, in the debate upon the Budget, dealt with them one by one.  I demonstrated to the House that they had already been applied or were in course of application or, to the extent that they had not been applied, the reasons why they were found to be impracticable and why alternative methods had to be sought.</P>

      <P>The main difficulty in achieving a higher level of public investment up to the present has been financial.  I believe the long term solution of the country's problem depends on our ability to induce and organise a higher level of private investment.  I recognise that it will take some time before the level of private investment has reached the stage where, by itself, it will be adequate to generate enough new activity every year to give us the increase in employment we require and that, in the intermediate period, public investment must carry a large part of the burden.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave said the real barrier to higher external investment in Irish industry is that our taxation is too high.  When Deputy Cosgrave was a member of the Government a committee of inquiry was established into taxation in industry. That committee of inquiry reported in June, 1956, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For many years now the standard rates in Ireland have been consistently lower than in Britain.  Even with improved depreciation allowances obtaining in Britain, the total income taxation burden on manufacturing companies here is still lower than in Britain.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Since then we have found it possible to give further substantial reliefs to industry in respect of taxation&mdash;the remission of tax on export profits, the additional allowance of 20 per cent. on capital expenditure, machinery and plant; allowances of 10 per cent. of capital expenditure on new industrial buildings and an accelerated depreciation allowance on plant and machinery in the form of an increase of 25 per cent. in the rates of depreciation for tax purposes.  It is clear, therefore, that it is undesirable to spread a wrong idea that there is an excessive burden of taxation on industry in this country.  It is not true.</P>
      <P>So far as any individual concern may be interested in the weight of taxation they would have to meet if they established themselves here, it is well for them to know that under our arrangements their tax burden would be less than it would be in any neighbouring country.  I am anxious to get Deputies informed of these facts so that they will talk in a way that will encourage people to participate in Irish industrial development and help towards the realisation of the aims which I will accept we all have in common.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crotty spoke about the failure of the banks to reduce their interest <Col N="298" /> charges.  He said that the banks in England had recently reduced their rates by 1 per cent. whereas the banks here had reduced only by 1/2 per cent. He should have known that when the banks in England increased their rates the banks here did not follow them the whole way.  Before these recent changes in bank rates were made the British bank rate and the discount rate of the Central Bank of Ireland both stood at 5 per cent.  Now the Irish rate is 1/2 per cent. below the British rate.</P>
    <P>As one who has from time to time exhorted the banks to take a larger part in the business of financing Irish industrial development, may I say that the indications now are, from the most recent published Statistical Bulletin of the Central Bank, that they are so doing.  Advances for farming, for mining and for manufacturing were all increased in 1958, up to the end of January which is the date to which the figures relate, as compared with 1957.</P>

      <P>Deputies have also spoken as if there were some reason why we should be concerned about the trend of our visible trade.  Let us be quite clear on what is really important in that respect.  In this country we do not have to secure a balance on visible trade.  We have a substantial invisible income which helps us to balance our external payments even when our visible trade is not in balance.  We do not have either to seek to balance our trade with each individual country.  In so far as it is desirable to reduce the gap in our visible trade statistics, we want to do it by expanding exports wherever export markets are available. But the gap in visible trade is not a matter for concern.  Even the balance of payments, the overall balance of payments, although it is a vital consideration, is not of the supreme importance in all circumstances which it has sometimes been assumed to be.  If we have a considerable import of capital goods, accompanied by the capital to pay for the goods, then the current <Col N="299" /> balance of payments for that period will show a deficit but the overall effect, as far as the country is concerned, will be good.</P>
      <P>The significant figure is that showing the movement of external reserves.  If our external reserves begin to diminish that is a red light.  It is at that stage that notice has to be taken of what is happening with a view to estimating the magnitude of the danger that may be developing.  It may not necessarily be a danger in itself but it could point to the imminence of danger.  If our external reserves increased that might also be another red light because it could tend to show that our internal development activities were not proceeding as they should.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was said by the Deputy that the statistics for this year to date were a cause for concern.  I do not think so.  The May figures in fact show a lower import excess than the figures for May last year and, so far, as there appears to be a slight decline in the volume of capital goods imported, it is explainable by the fact that during the corresponding period last year there was a substantial import of railway equipment.  No conclusions can be drawn as to the trend of trade from figures relating only to a few months of a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to our whole external trading policy we have always tended to get away from bilateral agreements with other countries, and to establish our trade arrangements on a multilateral basis.  In so far as we have been forced into bilateral agreements it has been not our decision but the decision of the other country concerned. I can see no advantage whatever in imposing restrictions on imports from Germany just because Germans will not buy as much as we would like them to buy, or because <Col N="300" /> they do not buy from us as much as we do from them.</P>
    <P>The effect of imposing such restrictions would compel Irish people to import goods and raw materials from other countries on more disadvantageous terms.  We must assume that Irish importers buy from France, Germany, Britain or elsewhere because it is advantageous to them and there is no reason why we should force them to buy at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Our international balance of payments last year produced a small surplus. I do not think there is any prospect of a situation developing this year which would be a cause of alarm or which would justify us in departing from the principle of multilateral trade agreements and resorting to bilateral bargaining nor, from our experience, can we come to the conclusion that a system of bilateral bargaining would be to our long-term advantage.  I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that there is a necessity to give wider publicity to the tax changes introduced in the last Budget and to our policy as represented by the Encouragement of External Investment Bill.</P>
    <P>That Bill has not yet been enacted. It has not yet been passed by the Seanad, and it is possible that, in the Seanad, some further amendments may be effected, and the publicising of our new arrangements relating to external investment in Ireland cannot be begun until the Act becomes law.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about the tariff on agricultural machines, and referred to some undertaking, given by the Government of which he was a member, to the National Farmers' Association that that tariff would be a temporary arrangement and might be withdrawn within a year or so following a review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There was to be a review and a report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A temporary tariff is as useless as a penny balloon with two <Col N="301" /> holes in it.  There is no lunatic in the country who would attempt to put a penny into a new machine on the strength of a tariff he was told was temporary.  There was no sense in that arrangement and, as far as this Government was concerned, we told the National Farmers' Association before the general election that it was our policy to secure the production in this country of all the agricultural equipment and machinery it was possible to produce here on an economic basis.  As far as I have been able to examine the position I find we have engineering factories in this country producing agricultural equipment which is as good as any in the world, and in many cases these factories are able to export their products against competition of much more powerful combines elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crotty said the procedure for procuring trade loans is far too complicated and I accept that.  It is obvious that it is and, because the procedure is so complicated and cannot be made uncomplicated, we decided to get away from the trade loan arrangements and to widen the powers of the Industrial Credit Corporation.  We decided to give to that company the function of guaranteeing loans for industrial developments if that, on examination, proves to be the best way of financing them, or alternatively giving companies the finance they need in some more suitable form.  I wish to make it clear that, in future, when Deputies are approached by firms which need finance for the extension of their activities they should advise them to place their problems before the Industrial Credit Company and to forget about the trade loans.  Indeed, the statutory limit of guarantees under the Trade Loans Acts has almost been reached and unless an exceptional case arises which would justify resort to these Acts, instead of to the Industrial Credit Company.  I do not intend introducing legislation to raise that limit. The intention is to transfer to the Industrial Credit Company the task of assisting industry to find capital and money for development purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies spoke about the Undeveloped Areas Act and I do not intend to refer to it at length.  These <Col N="302" /> Deputies, however, seem to be under a misunderstanding about this Act when they ask that An Foras Tionscal should be more active in securing the establishment of industries in the undeveloped areas.  That is not the function of An Foras Tionscal; they have not got a promotional function at all. Their task is to allocate from funds available to them grants for particular projects placed before them by groups in undeveloped areas, or for projects otherwise brought to their attention. In our present organisational arrangements, the task of industrial promotion, the organisation of new industries conceived to be possible of economic establishment here, has been delegated to the Industrial Development Authority.  While obviously there is a very close link between the Industrial Development Authority and an Foras Tionscal nevertheless their separate functions are clearly defined in that regard.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies appear to be under the impression that the tax concessions which have been arranged in the Budget, and the grants available through An Foras Tionscal and the Industrial Development Authority, or the financial assistance which can be given for industrial enterprises by the Industrial Credit Company, are confined to external concerns.  That is a complete misconception.  It is true that the main publicity effort has been directed towards publicising these advantages and arrangements abroad and that may have led to the misconception.</P>
    <P>We assumed, perhaps too readily, that knowledge of all these arrangements was widespread at home and it may be necessary to do some publicity here also.  But, specifically, I want to make it clear that there is no facility, no advantage, no grant, aid or tax relief available for an externally-owned concern which is not equally available to Irish-owned concerns.  Indeed, I have always held the view that, in the main, our industrial development is far more likely to come through the initiative and enterprise of Irish citizens rather than by the fortuitous advent of industrialists from abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> The effective publicity which has been given to the changes which have been recently introduced, the tax changes and other advantages that have been brought about, has undoubtedly aroused interest in America, Britain, Germany, Belgium and Holland and there have been many discussions with representatives of firms there who are talking about industrial enterprises in this country. I shall not put it any farther.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here to the Ballina biscuit factory.  For that project all the necessary formalities had been completed; a grant had been decided upon by An Foras Tionscal; the necessary licence under the Control of Manufactures Act has been issued; the site had been acquired.  Yet, the project did not proceed because the foreign promoting company withdrew. Now I am criticised by Deputy Barry because, in relation to a rumour he has heard about an important project in County Cork, I will not tell him about it and he says that there is bungling. I have no intention of mentioning a word about that project or any other project until I see the buildings rising from the ground or the private interests themselves decide to publicise their intentions.</P>
    <P>I am a politician.  I would like to get all the favourable publicity that politicians want.  I would love to be able to go out and say that this is happening and that that is going to happen.  Even though I am sure that it is going to be so, nevertheless, rather than take the risk that by an incautious word I could deprive the country of some worth-while industry, I shall not do it.  Deputies may take it as a decided policy that there will be no publicity given to new industrial enterprises promoted by private interests until the private interests themselves decide to release the news. I am fortified in that decision, not merely by the realisation that advance publicity here before the interest concerned had finalised their plans might cause them to withdraw, but also by the knowledge that private industrial undertakings which get a political label attached to them are <Col N="304" /> often handicapped in their development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if the Deputy would chew some gum now, I would be able to finish my speech. Deputy Kyne asked if local development associations could ascertain what industries might be suitable for various districts through the services of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The services of the Department are available to these local development committees to give them all the advice that can be given but it must be understood that we just cannot designate particular industries suitable for particular localities much less give a particular industrial development committee an option on any new industry.  Indeed, during the course of the past year I had to change the regulations of the Department in one respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan read from some <i>Irish Press</i> article a reference to a new industry that was to be established somewhere.  The <i>Irish Press</i> was no more misled than any other newspaper. That particular industry was one which was hawked around the country by a promoting group.  They were able to do so because, having approached the Department and asked for a list of the local industrial development committees whom they wanted to contact in connection with a new industry, they were handed the roneod list in the ordinary way.  They then proceeded to offer this industry all round the place and I think may have succeeded in collecting some money by that method in some districts, despite my efforts, as soon as I saw the first report in the newspapers, to contact the people concerned and warn them to be careful.  I followed up immediately with a circular to all these local development councils warning them that, while we would put in touch with them anyone who approached the Department who wanted to make the contact, we were not necessarily vouching for their <i>bona fides</i> much less for the soundness of the project which they were likely to submit to them and <Col N="305" /> that the soundness of the project could not be judged until it had been fully examined in the Department.</P>
    <P>There were many references to prices.  I do not want to enter into a protracted debate upon the action taken last year.  Deputy Larkin was critical of the abolition of the Prices Advisory Council.  He is the first person I have heard say a word in sorrow at its demise but, so far as I am concerned, I want my position to be quite clear.  I believe that, in circumstances of full supply, and subject to the elimination of restrictive trade practices, the most effective price regulator which human wit has devised is free competition and my concern is to promote that freedom of competition in the sale of all goods and to minimise official regulation of prices.  Our experience has been that price control kept prices up and there is ample evidence that since price control has been withdrawn the margin between the production cost and the retail price of many goods, has tended to contract rather than to expand.</P>
    <P>There was an increase in prices, according to the general price index number, between May of last year and May of this year, of slightly less than 6 per cent.  There was an increase in two points in the index between May and February.  That was explained by the Statistics Office as due in the main to three causes&mdash;a seasonal rise in the price of potatoes and rises in the prices of milk and meat, attributable, I think, almost entirely to increased wages paid to milk roundsmen and to the butchers. Against that 6 per cent. increase in the cost of living, the index of industrial earnings shows that between March last year and March this year industrial earnings on the average increased by slightly over 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in my introductory speech on the Estimate, there was an increase in productivity in industry which had the effect of offsetting completely the effect upon the labour costs of production in Irish factories of the increase in wages that were negotiated and brought into operation under the national wage agreement.  I think, therefore, that we can say that, taking into account the increase in the <Col N="306" /> cost of living which followed upon the withdrawal of subsidies, the increase in wages which has, for industrial workers at least, fully compensated for that increase in prices, and the successful efforts of employers and trade unions in combination to prevent that increase in wages pushing up the cost of industrial production in this country, we have got out of a difficult period of adjustment in a very satisfactory manner indeed.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have referred to their interest in the tourist trade and I am particularly interested personally because I have always believed and have advocated that it could be a source of income to this country of very great importance.  Indeed, I was, I think, a voice crying in the wilderness at one time in support of that viewpoint.  Our tourist trade is developing but there is still a great deal we can do to expand it further.  There have been criticisms of An Tóstal.  I am prepared to join in that criticism.  The Tóstal was an effort to do something which, if it could be done, would be of tremendous advantage, namely to lengthen our tourist season, to develop a series of attractions in the form of sporting and other events in this country in the month of May, which would bring visitors to our country in the month of May who might normally not come until June, July or August.  As Deputies know, the bottleneck limiting our tourist development is the amount of hotel accommodation and if we could make greater use of hotel accommodation by spreading out the season, by some such activity as the Tóstal at the beginning of it or by the development of the fishing rivers and lakes at the other end or throughout the year as a whole, then we would be getting a very considerable expansion of tourist income without any corresponding investment of new capital in hotel accommodation.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that An Tóstal has tended to become a rather piecemeal operation.  It was, so far as I can see, enormously successful in places like Cork City, where there was an energetic organiser with an enthusiastic committee behind him and indeed, Cork Deputies who spoke here deplored the idea that any change should be made in regard to either the time of it or <Col N="307" /> its main features.  Other Deputies, like Deputy Russell of Limerick, said it was no good and certainly it never was taken up in Limerick with the same enthusiasm as in Cork.  In some places, it was not taken up at all after the first year.</P>
    <P>There have emerged, however, from the original idea, some very useful projects which have developed from local initiative and been supported by local enterprise.  My aim is to try to get all those who participate in the Tóstal, hotel proprietors, transport service operators or anybody else associated with it, to come together to reexamine the whole position and see what is best to do, to salvage what is good and to discard what is useless and to achieve the aim which we had when we started, of expanding the tourist income by spreading out the tourist season.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies appear to be under some misapprehension regarding the extent of the facilities which we are giving for the hotel development, and I should like to remove any misunderstanding in that regard.  I think it was Deputy Sweetman who said that we often take it for granted that people know the facilities available to them when that is not so and, from speeches made here, it would seem that some Deputies do not quite know the magnitude of the aids available to hotel proprietors and resort development companies to expand their facilities.</P>
    <P>In the case of hotels, there can be long-term State-guaranteed loans for hotel improvement, and Bord Fáilte can make grants in respect of interest charges on these loans for the first five years.  Some Deputies said that it is as hard to get a Bord Fáilte loan as it is to get a trade loan.  That is undoubtedly true because where the State is guaranteeing money, there are bound to be unavoidable delays, but I have tried to cut through these as much as possible.  I have organised a system by which inter-departmental communications are cut down.  Nevertheless, there are delays in examinations of the security and other formalities of that kind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> One Deputy said that hotel proprietors would sooner go to a bank to get a loan.  We encourage them to do that, and, if they get a loan from a bank, Bord Failte will pay the interest on that loan free for the first five years, so that facility means that hotel proprietors who want to expand their premises have every encouragement and aid.  Over and above these loans and grants for the payment of interest on loans, there is this new scheme of grants for additional hotel bedroom accommodation.  Any proprietor who wants to add to the bedroom accommodation in an hotel, in a unit of not less than five bedrooms, can get quite a substantial grant towards the cost.  In addition, 10 per cent. of the capital expenditure incurred by hotel proprietors in any year is allowed as a deduction when computing profits for the purpose of income-tax.  There is also an initial allowance of 20 per cent. on hotel equipment of a permanent and durable nature.  The annual depreciation allowance has been increased by 25 per cent. and there is also the remission of rates in respect of an hotel building erected, or reconstructed, before 31st March 1960.</P>
    <P>So Deputies can advise their hotel proprietor friends to get cracking before that date, if they want to avail of these facilities.  I am most anxious to see them going ahead.  Not merely will it give a fillip to the tourist trade, but it is work which must necessarily be done in the off-season, when tourists are not normally coming to the country, and in a period when building activity normally tends to decline, so that a considerable extension of hotel building then would make it doubly valuable by giving a great deal of employment to building workers throughout the whole country during the period when building work usually tends to taper off.</P>

      <P>I think it is seven years. I agree fully with Deputies who say we should take note of the fact that the most satisfactory and profitable tourist who comes here in the British workingman on his annual holiday.  Indeed, all the time I have preached this to our <Col N="309" /> hotel interests and tourist promoting businesses and underlined the importance of catering for that trade.  It was with that in mind that we gave permission to British coach tour companies to organise tours in Ireland, which had previously been prohibited. Most of them are organised by workingmen's clubs and trade unions.  Indeed, the restrictions imposed confine them to persons of that class because we still keep the more expensive tours for C.I.E. operation.  I hope to see the scale of these tours extended in future years.</P>
      <P>I have been asked to make it clear that the facilities given this year will be continued next year.  I want to make it quite clear that the facilities available next year for external coach tours will be no less than those operating this year, so that hotel proprietors, the tour organising companies and all others concerned, can make their plans now in the certainty that the facilities available to them will be no less than those available this year and may, perhaps, be greater, when we get the opportunity of reviewing the situation at the end of the season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry referred to the harbour facilities in Cobh.  I am not interested in his main idea because I do not think there is the slightest prospect of getting companies operating transatlantic liner services to berth their ships at Cobh.  Their desire is to drop anchor within the harbour and have their passengers taken to and from their liners by tender.  I am most concerned, however, to see the passenger handling facilities there improved. Everybody knows that the harbour authorities have to get a new tender and negotiations are proceeding to help them in that regard.  Over and above the improvement of the tender service, there is need to look at all the facilities available for the handling of passengers and I have asked An Bord Fáilte to arrange a conference with the local urban council, the harbour authorities, C.I.E. and the shipping companies, with a view to seeing what improvements can be effected.  An Bord Fáilte with its resources, cannot give a great deal of money towards the substantial improvement of the facilities there. They can give some money and perhaps <Col N="310" /> they may be able to get contributions from other interested parties as well. I certainly would like it to be understood that we attach as much interest to the tourist who comes in by ship at Cobh as to the tourist who comes by aeroplane into Shannon, and that our aim is to ensure there will be no deficiency in the facilities at Cobh of which the incoming tourist might complain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Griffin spoke about resort development, and, while he referred particularly to the seaside areas of County Meath, there are in that county other tourist attractions besides the magnificent beaches at Laytown and Bettystown.  Indeed, as Deputies know, it is one of the most popular areas for the touring bus, particularly the Boyne Valley tour, one of the most popular tours run by C.I.E.</P>
    <P>This matter of resort development has been giving me concern for a long time.  I want to see our holiday resorts improved in every way with better accommodation and better facilities for the entertainment of those who come of them.  To that end we considered the idea of encouraging the establishment of local resort development companies in every district.  Bord Fáilte will pay the legal and other expenses associated with the establishment of these companies and can guarantee loans raised by them for the improvement of the resorts.  The trouble has been that, since the finance is provided by way of loan, the particular scheme of development which the company prepares must itself be profit-earning. There must be a prospect of their being able to repay the loan by the revenue earned from the facilities provided.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte cannot give very substantial grants in addition to loans, although they have done so in some instances. However, if there is a local resort development company established in any district which can work out schemes for the improvement of the resort which have some revenue-earning aspect, they can hope to get, through the local authority, for instance, the road works to open up the resort; and from Bord Fáilte not merely technical advice but some little financial aid as well.  The only really <Col N="311" /> successful undertaking of that kind yet attempted was at Arklow and I think I am entitled to invite the members of the House to attend the official opening there next Sunday week.</P>

      <P>Deputy Coogan quite incorrectly said that nothing had been done to improve cross-Channel shipping services during the holiday period.  Everybody in the House knows that the provision of adequate travelling facilities for cross-Channel passengers is a matter for the shipping companies, but we have been pressing them for a long time for the improvement of these facilities.  Bord Fáilte has been very active in that regard.  I have been assured that this year the sailings of boats on cross-Channel services will be augmented in sufficient degree to cater for the extra traffic anticipated. Indications are that there will be quite a substantial increase in the tourist traffic from Britain this year.</P>
      <P>It is true, however, that a very large number of the passengers who come from Britain to spend their holidays here want to come on the same day and go back on the same night.  That is an impossible problem for any shipping organisation.  In order to minimise the difficulties associated with these occasional periods of peak congestion very considerable improvements and extensions have been carried out at Dún Laoghaire and further works are now in progress.  I invite Deputy Coogan on some evening he has off to go out and look at what is being done in Dún Laoghaire to facilitate the prompt clearance of passengers during rush periods and to provide for their comfort while they are there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say one brief word about this project for a free port at Shannon.  I have no desire to discourage people considering any proposal or development, no matter how novel it may be or no matter what <Col N="312" /> difficulties I see associated with it. Any project that is likely to be beneficial for any area will, I assure those connected with it, receive my very sympathetic consideration.</P>
      <P>The people talking about a free port should, however, make up their minds what exactly they are aiming to achieve.  If they are thinking of establishing factories, into which materials can come free of duty and from which they can be freely re-exported after processing, they should remember that in that sense the whole country is a free port area.  That facility is available to any factory in Ireland.  Any raw materials they want to import for processing can be imported free of duty, subject to the manufactured goods being re-exported.  If they are thinking of a bonded warehouse into which goods can be brought in large vessels and from which they can be taken out for coastwise distribution in smaller vessels, that facility also exists in every port in which there is a bonded warehouse. If they are thinking of merely creating trade by providing modern port facilities, then I do not know of any place in the world where it can be said that the mere establishment of a port created trade.  Indeed, in every place where there is a port free or otherwise, it was brought into being to meet a trade need that already existed in the locality.</P>
      <P>I should like also to add that I had many discussions with Major Waller, the engineer who has been associated with this matter.  He had a plan whereby he thought it might be practicable to get these very large oil tankers into Shannon where their cargoes could be distributed into smaller tankers and brought to refineries throughout Europe.  I offered to organise a special flight by Aer Lingus from London to Shannon to bring over the people interested, with accommodation at Shannon and every opportunity of inspecting the estuary. I asked him to contact the principal people concerned in the big oil companies who might be interested.  I am sorry to say his efforts did not succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had discussions myself with some of the principal people concerned in the oil companies.  They did not see <Col N="313" /> how it could be a practical proposition unless there was a very large refinery in the area.  The companies establishing very large refineries and building 100,000 ton tankers are being financed by their Governments, and the prospects of getting them to transfer operations to locations in this country are, in my view, not very bright.  If anybody can produce in relation to this free port idea a single commercial enterprise that will be interested enough in the undertaking to ensure that some use will be made of the port after it is created, then I am prepared to give the matter further consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman made reference to a speech made by the chairman of Aer Linte on the occasion of the inaugural flight.  He described it as a political speech.  I do not accept that.  I believe it was only childish petulance that prompted the Deputy to make his remarks.  He raised what he regarded as a point of principle.  He said that an ex-civil servant was in some way bound not to make political references. We know that some ex-civil servants have gone up for and secured election to the Dáil and have been very active in politics.</P>
    <P>As reference was made to the obligations of a chairman of a State company let me say this.  I invited Mr. Leydon to act as Chairman of Aer Linte because of his previous association with air line development in this country.  I was tremendously relieved when he agreed to do so.  Nobody else could have brought to the problems involved the experience and knowledge he has.  He agreed to act without remuneration and is acting without remuneration.  As far as I am concerned I am not going to impose any restrictions whatever on him.  I do not think one could make a general rule in regard to the chairmen of State companies which would be applicable to the circumstances in his case.  Mr. Leydon agreed to act for a temporary period.  As Deputies know, he has a number of other duties and responsibilities. Some other arrangement will have to be made when he elects to withdraw.</P>

      <P>I disagree entirely with the Deputy.  I think the Deputy's references were scandalous.  I should conclude at this stage but I had intended to make some reference to the container traffic at Dublin Port. Deputy Cosgrave detailed the advantages which this country has for industrial development purposes.  We have a number of advantages but we have one disadvantage in that we are an island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Raw materials must be imported by sea and the finished products exported by sea.  That disadvantage is there.  It is obviously good national policy that we should seek to minimise it and we can only do that provided we have the highest achievable standards of efficiency, both in our internal transport organisation and in our port handling facilities.  I know that the trade unions accept that principle and that they realise the problem in Dublin is a practical one capable of being solved by practical arrangement.  But the aim of everybody, particularly those who are dependent for their livelihood on port employment, must be to assist the development of the country by ensuring that our ports are operating with the maximum efficiency, and at the minimum cost so that the disadvantage of our island location will be overcome.</P>
      <P>I was pleased at the tribute paid by a number of employers recently to the Dublin dockers and the statement that the productivity of the Dublin dockers was considerably higher than the dockers in some British ports.  It indicates that the right spirit exists amongst them which limits the problem to how best to overcome the practical difficulties affecting the position there at present.</P>
