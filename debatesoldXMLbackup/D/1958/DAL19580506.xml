    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the hardship which will be caused by the proposed abolition of school children's fares by C.I.E., he will request the company to reconsider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of implementing the recent wage increases recommended by the Labour Court and the Joint Industrial Council is estimated by C.I.E. at £583,000 per annum. Under the Transport Act, 1950, C.I.E. are empowered to fix such charges as they think necessary for the services provided by them and they are charged with the statutory duty to try to balance their budget.  Having regard to their financial position, there is no course open to C.I.E. other than to increase their charges to recover the cost of the increased wages, although I understand that the increase in fares which they are now introducing will not be adequate for this purpose.  The details of the increased charges are the sole concern of the board, to whom any representations which the Deputy may wish to make in the matter should be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how much of the proposed increase is represented by the abolition of school children's fares?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister put this consideration to C.I.E.?  Notwithstanding that they have statutory <Col N="1268" /> obligation to balance their budget, in view of the fact that they are making a substantial profit on the Dublin bus services and on the provincial bus services, it is unfair to load these services up with increased charges which will impact heavily on the parents of school-going children.  These are already remunerative services for C.I.E. and C.I.E. ought, therefore, to look for their money in some other direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of additional revenue which C.I.E. anticipate to get from the increased charges in Dublin will be less than the increase in wages they will be paying in Dublin. It is obvious that it would be a poor joke upon the employees of C.I.E. for the board to agree to pay them increased wages without making some effort to get the money to pay the increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not questioning the right of C.I.E. to get the money. What I am questioning is why C.I.E. should endeavour to get the money by imposing this burden on families with school-going children who travel over a transport system&mdash;namely, the Dublin buses&mdash;from which C.I.E. is already making a very substantial profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained, C.I.E. are by statute in sole charge of their rating system.  I have no knowledge, other than the statements they publish in the papers, of the reasons why they chose the particular increases they are now bringing into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister is aware that the company are making a substantial profit on the Dublin bus services.  It is a well-known fact.  Is it not unfair that they should impose this additional burden on the parents of school-going children in Dublin, in view of that fact?  While C.I.E. have a statutory obligation to balance their budget, they have no statutory immunity from doing some fresh and original thinking.</P>

      <P>This memorandum was submitted in January, 1955.  As stated by the former Taoiseach in reply to a parliamentary question on 17th July, 1956, it was of a confidential nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> I do not propose to have it made available generally.  Action has already been taken or is in course of being taken on the main recommendations.  These were: (1) the provision of additional capital for industrial finance through the Industrial Credit Company, Limited.  Arrangements to this end are being made following on the enactment of the Industrial Credit (Amendment) Act, 1958; (2) the extension of the tax concession given under Section 7 of the Finance Acts 1932 and 1935.  Section 4 of the Finance Act, 1957 dealt with this matter; (3) the easing of the restrictions imposed by the Control of Manufactures Acts.  An Amending Bill is at present before the House; (4) the simplification of the statutory provisions governing the giving of trade <Col N="1274" /> loan guarantees.  This is being dealt with by the provision of alternative facilities through the Industrial Credit Company, Limited, as announced in the course of the debate on the Industrial Credit (Amendment) Act, 1958.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>Schemes under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, have been completed in respect of the Brosna catchment area, Counties Laois, Offaly and Westmeath, and the Glyde and Dee catchment area, Counties Cavan, Louth, Meath and Monaghan.</P>
      <P>The total area of the Brosna catchment is about 312,000 acres.  An area of approximately 50,000 acres of land was drained or otherwise improved and, in addition, outfalls were provided for the development of some 36,000 acres of virgin bog.  The area of the Glyde and Dee catchment is about 180,000 acres, of which 26,000 acres of land were drained or otherwise improved.</P>
      <P>The increase in the annual value of agricultural lands improved by the Brosna catchment scheme was estimated at 7/8 per acre based on land values prevailing in 1939.  The increase in the case of the Glyde and Dee scheme, based on 1949 values, was estimated at 15/- per acre.  It is not feasible to distinguish between &ldquo;flooded land&rdquo; and &ldquo;damaged land&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In the case of the circuit judges there has been an increase amounting at the maximum to 10/- and 11/6 a night respectively in the two principal rates of subsistence allowance with a corresponding adjustment of the minor rates. Commuted allowances have been adjusted on this basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated during the debate here last week that the National Farmers' Association and the Minister for Finance had been informed that the country could be saved £3,000,000 by the consumption here of an all-Irish loaf.  To substantiate the case for an all-Irish loaf, they forwarded by post to me and, I am sure, to all other Deputies, a sample of the product of all-Irish wheat.  Having tasted the all-Irish loaf, I am convinced that it is far superior to any loaf I have eaten in my time and I can see no justification for importing wheat to blend with native wheat to make bread for our people from now on.  The people are not being asked to make any sacrifice whatsoever by eating bread made from all-Irish wheat. That is my opinion and I will be quite pleased to hear the opinion of other Deputies.  The use of all-Irish wheat would help the balance of payments to the extent of £3,000,000, and if the same extraction flour is used as was used to make the sample bread, there will be a big supply of pollard and bran of the very best quality, instead of our having to import from all the countries of Europe inferior offals at over £1 a cwt.</P>
      <P>If the scheme for producing an all-Irish loaf is put into operation forthwith, it will ease the minds of many wheat growers.  I do not come from a wheat growing area, but I know that it will ease the minds of wheat growers.  It will certainly ease the mind of my colleague, Deputy Corry, who speaks so ably on this subject on every possible occasion.  It will help to give the farmers the price which is their due for the extra wheat for which there is a ready market in the production of an all-Irish loaf.</P>
      <P>In his financial statement, the Minister for Finance said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Every year about this time the Minister for Finance is faced with the rather distressing duty of having to listen to the many groups and <Col N="1283" /> organisations who feel that they have a good case for some form of relief under the Budget.  Many of them have impressed me with their arguments, supported by figures.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;First, I feel obliged to do something to help to preserve both the revenue from cinemas and theatres and the employment which they can afford.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that anyone from the rural area from which I come would put cinemas and film renters first, when it is a question of giving some form of relief.  When I see queues hundreds of yards long outside cinemas in Dublin and Cork on a fine summer evening, I feel what a great waste of time and money it is.  We have entirely too much of that form of entertainment. While long queues are waiting outside cinemas in Cork and Dublin, the hard-working industrious people of the country are out in the fields producing the wealth of the country.  I was very disappointed that the first big slice of the national cake, about which the Taoiseach spoke, which has been enlarged over the past 12 months as a result of the farmers' activity, should go to film renters, cinema owners, civil servants, Garda, teachers and various other sections and that only the crumbs, if there are any crumbs left, should go to the people responsible for producing that enlarged cake.</P>
    <P>The amount of money, £50,000, which went to the film renters and cinema owners is exactly the sum asked for by a deputation from Cork Country Council to the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Local Government for the improvement of by-roads which were deemed to be of general public utility in County Cork.  If we could get that £50,000, I can assure the Minister and the House that a far greater number of people would benefit from it than are benefiting from the £50,000 which has been given to the cinemas and film renters.</P>
    <P>I am not at all surprised at the decline in rural areas.  I explained on Thursday last how the population of <Col N="1284" /> the diocese of Ross had declined from 32,000 to 20,000.  That has happened because the people follow the money and follow work.  Instead of staying in rural Ireland, they flock into the cities and then the demand for housing, hospitalisation, cinema entertainment and amusement of every kind increases. Who is to produce the wealth of the country to keep the cities and towns going, to build hospitals, to clean the cinemas and to maintain the big industrial populations in the cities and towns, if rural Ireland is depopulated and if the people of rural Ireland do not get a reasonable and due share of the money from the public purse?</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, 1957 was a better year than 1956.  Nevertheless, the trend of emigration increased and continued. The outlook for this year is not good. In 1957, exports of cattle and the prices of cattle increased, but large numbers of the cattle then exported were held over from 1956 and some of the cattle which should be sold in 1958 were disposed of in 1957.  I want to warn the Minister that the exports of cattle may not be as great this year as they were in 1957 and he will have to be very wary lest the balance of payments be upset again.  He should avail of the scheme to produce an all-Irish loaf as soon as possible so as to save £3,000,000 on wheat.</P>
    <P>I was quite pleased that Deputy Haughey spoke of tourism in this debate last Thursday.  He referred to the lack of hotel accommodation in this country.  He just beat Dr. Lucey, the Bishop of Cork, on that subject. Dr. Lucey mentioned it in Bantry last Sunday, when he criticised the action of Governments here in razing to the ground the finest hotel in Ireland some years ago and failing to replace it. That was done in Glengarriff, the most picturesque spot in Europe, a delightful tourist resort.  The ruins of that hotel are still there, an eyesore in that beautiful scenic spot.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey recommended the provision of more hotel accommodation for tourists.  I am wholeheartedly behind the tourist industry. It is of great importance to the country.  Tourists can enjoy the hospitality <Col N="1285" /> of this country, the food and, in future, the all-Irish loaf.  They come here to enjoy the fresh air, the healthy food, the bread, butter, beef and bacon which they can get fresh from the farms of Ireland.  I agree with Deputy Haughey and I hope that the case he has made will bear fruit.  I hope the hotel in Glengarriff will be replaced in the very near future by An Bord Fáilte and the Government.</P>
    <P>In reading the Minister's Budget speech, I noticed that we have joined the World Bank, and that there are representatives from that bank coming to this country next June.  I do not know who will make recommendations to these representatives.  If we are to have capital development in its true and proper sense, there should be some representative of the farming community meeting these people.  I know that when the Capital Investment Committee issued their last report, it was not too welcome to some of the farmers down the country, and it was not so highly appreciated by the Government because they did not carry out all the recommendations.  I do not know who are the members of that committee, but I should be very nervous of whatever they may recommend to the representatives of the World Bank next June.  Instead of recommending something sound and practical for the development of this country, they may recommend the establishment of more cinemas, of a television service, or something nonsensical like that.  That is what I am very nervous about.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, farmers do not have proper representation on such committees, with the result that their views are not heard, the agricultural industry is neglected and the country suffers as a consequence.  The agricultural industry has suffered sufficiently already.  It always suffered for lack of capital.  If more money had been diverted to agriculture 20 years ago, this would be one of the greatest agricultural producing nations in the world.  Our young men, our young farmers, are as good as any that can be found in any other country.  They are not shy of work.  They are not lazy but, unfortunately, when they <Col N="1286" /> produce so much of the nation's wealth, oftentimes they are the very last to get any of it back in return.</P>
    <P>Agricultural credit is one of the most vital factors for the development of this country.  It is especially necessary for young farmers endeavouring to build up their own homes.  Any young farmer who wants to buy land, stock it, furnish his house, marry and bring up a family, should be encouraged in every way to do so.  He should get cheap credit facilities and, when I say &ldquo;cheap,&rdquo; I do not mean money at 5 and 6 per cent.  I mean money at as cheap a rate as it possibly can be given by the Government&mdash;say, at 2 per cent.  It would be money well spent because such a farmer would produce the wealth of this nation, instead of emigrating to a foreign land to produce wealth for another country.  If the decline of the rural population should continue, I have no doubt that the wealth of this country will decline also.  Productive capital expenditure is the cure for all our ills, not social capital expenditure to give more amusement to those who are unemployed.  It would not be good for the Capital Investment Committee to advise those representatives who are coming from America that we wish to have a television service to occupy the time of the unemployed in their spare moments.  We have too much of this nonsensical type of thing at the moment.</P>
    <P>We must get down to the hard bedrock of common sense, producing enough for our own requirements. Surely, what we produce in Ireland is sufficiently good for the Irish people, whether it be bread, butter, or fish.  I spoke on that subject of fish last year because I was shocked to see we were importing large quantities of fish, from other countries, for which we had to pay dearly.  Our own goods are sufficiently good in every respect for our Irish people and for the visitors and tourists who come into the country. There is no necessity for importing so much.  If we go abroad as tourists or on business, we have to be quite content with the food and wine of the countries to which we go.  We cannot get Paddy whiskey or Irish bacon and <Col N="1287" /> bread in those countries.  We have to climb down and be content with their native foods and drinks.</P>
    <P>We should develop our own tastes for our food and, if we did so, there would be less necessity for importing the wine and foods of other countries to feed ourselves or the tourists who visit us, tourists who would much prefer to eat our native foods.  They cannot be induced to appreciate our native food and drink if it is a fact that we do not consider them good enough for ourselves.  If we do not consider them good enough for ourselves, how can we expect tourists to appreciate them?  It is high time we changed our tune in that regard and depended more on what we produce at home.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to say except to express the hope that the Minister will take cognisance of what I have said in this regard.  Reduce imports, increase exports, and our balance of payments will be all right.  By doing that, we will set out on the high road to recovery as a nation.  I am afraid I must say we have yet to prove ourselves capable of ruling ourselves in a proper manner to save this country for future generations.</P>

      <P>The debate on the Budget this year, particularly in so far as the Government are concerned, is something that may be described as very mournful.  If one compares the speeches from the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to this Budget, with the speeches from that Party in relation to the Budgets introduced by the inter-Party Government, one must ask oneself what extraordinary spell of silence, what extraordinary form of somersault has taken place in so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned?  The Deputies who spoke on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party spoke of every single Budget introduced since 1947. Not alone did they make reference to every Budget since 1947, but they spoke on the topic of every Budget, except the Budget under debate.  Why did they single out as, for example, did the Minister for Health, the Budgets of the former Minister, make long speeches in relation to them and <Col N="1288" /> make no reference whatever to the Budget under discussion?</P>
      <P>More extraordinary still, apart entirely from the silence of the Fianna Fáil Party, is the fact that there is no relationship whatever between the policy put into operation by the Government and the promises and undertakings they gave the electorate a little over 12 months ago.  It would be wrong for any Deputy to say that the general public did not expect a general reduction in taxation.  They did.  Not alone did they expect a general reduction in taxation but they expected a considerable reduction in the prices of essential foodstuffs.  They expected a considerable reduction in the heavy burden of taxation deliberately placed on their shoulders by the Budget of 12 months ago.  They were the more convinced that there was to be a substantial relief in taxation because they were told by the last Government that the special import levies were designed purely for one purpose alone and that was for putting right the balance of payments problem.</P>
      <P>The balance of payments problem is now practically righted and it was the belief and hope of the taxpayers, and of everyone concerned with the special import levies, since these levies were only a temporary measure designed for one purpose alone, that when that purpose was achieved the levies would be immediately relaxed, reviewed and withdrawn.  Now, to the great amazement of every taxpayer, and of every concern associated with this additional and extra burden of taxation, it looks as if it is to be permanent.  There was keen disappointment expressed with the Budget and also a feeling that there was failure on the part of the Government, firstly, to keep their promises, secondly, to honour the undertakings given by their predecessors regarding the special import levies and thirdly, to be at least honest with the people.  The public expected them to be honest because they expected that the levies would have been removed.  They considered that the most opportune time for their removal was the occasion of the Budget now under debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> Those levies were imposed at a critical time and every citizen, from the lowest to the highest, people in every walk of life, farmers, businessmen, capitalists, industrialists, labouring men and farm labourers, knew quite well that there was a national problem to be faced.  They knew that that national problem called for stern and unpopular measures but they were given to understand, as has been pointed out on this side of the House on more than one occasion, that these stern and unpopular measures, in the form of levies, were only of a temporary character.  I venture to say that if the inter-Party Government were in office they would have honoured their undertakings and relieved the taxpayers at least of the burden of the special import levies, because of the fact that they have achieved their aims.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear what the Minister for Finance has to say with regard to the removal of those special import levies and whether he is quite satisfied that this country should be asked to carry permanently those additional levies designed to be only of a temporary character.  For the information of the ordinary taxpayer, he has not made himself clear to any great extent on that issue.  Not alone has he not made himself clear but some of us gather from his speech that there will be no question of relief from those levies and that we may now look upon them as part of our permanent taxation, that they are here to stay.  They are not to be removed; they are there for all time.</P>
    <P>I want to ask what is the attitude on this matter of the Fianna Fáil Party, and particularly of the Minister for Finance himself, who on more than one occasion expressed the opinion that the inter-Party Government were too severe and too strenuous?  Many of the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party looked upon the special import levies as a savage and bitter attack on the taxpayer and upon everybody directly or indirectly affected by those levies. At any rate it is only right that the people should realise even now the seriousness to be attached to the speeches made during the last general election.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> The level of taxation has now gone beyond the capacity of the people. One would imagine, if we are to consider the promises and undertakings given by the present Government, that some serious effort would be made to reduce taxation, if it were only to put a face on the manner in which the people were cheated of their votes in the last election.  However, brazenly enough, no effort whatever has been made by the Government even to give an appearance of an attempt to reduce taxation.  The taxation problem affects all citizens because it cannot be stated that only a limited few are obliged to pay taxes.  Every single human being is obliged to pay his share of the national taxation.  It is all the same whether it comes from him in the form of income-tax, tax on his food, tax on his machinery or his radio, or even in the form of his dog licence&mdash;every section of the people is obliged to contribute to the pool of taxation.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine for taxpayers to be obliged to pay this very heavy burden but at some stage they expect not alone to get value for their money but that the money extracted from them will be spent wisely, cautiously and well.  The Government, I suggest, can legitimately be accused of not spending the taxpayers' money wisely.  Not alone are they not spending the taxpayers' money wisely but the money is being put to bad use.</P>
    <P>We were told at one stage by the Government that their energies would be devoted towards relieving unemployment and reducing the ever-increasing number of unemployed.  Without the least fear of contradiction by any member of Fianna Fáil, I deliberately accuse the Government of failing in their duty to provide work for the people.  It is their bounden duty to provide work for the people.  It is not for the Government to criticise to any great extent what their predecessors did or did not.  They should face the problems of the present and should be prepared to tackle them courageously.</P>
    <P>Apart from placing a growing burden of heavy taxation upon the shoulders of our people, the Government have failed completely to provide work for them.  The fact that the Government <Col N="1291" /> are deliberately closing their eyes to unemployment shows their complete disregard for family life.  It shows their complete disregard of a duty which is the duty of every Government, that is, to see that the fathers of families are provided with work so that they will have a decent standard of living in their own country and be able to bring up their families in Christian decency.</P>
    <P>From my own experience in rural Ireland, never before has there been such distress, such want and such dire poverty in the homes of our working-class people.  Local authorities are employing fewer; Bord na Móna are employing fewer on bog development schemes; and there is a complete reduction in the numbers employed on rural electrification.  Factories and mills are on short time.  For example, the Irish Worsted Mills at Portlaoise, which, during the term of office of the inter-Party Government, were working to the fullest possible extent, and even working overtime, are now forced to go on four days per week, which will mean a considerable loss of income to the workers employed in those mills and a considerable loss of income to the traders and shopkeepers of Portlaoise and other towns similarly affected.</P>
    <P>The farmers were asked to work harder and produce more but the more they produced, the more was taken from them and the less they were paid. Apart entirely from the savage attack which was made on the farmers, there was nobody who had to carry the burden of distress, torment and trouble to the extent to which the working man and the low wage-earner have had to carry these burdens during the past 12 or 14 months.  Unfortunate citizens were faced with having to join the long queues outside the labour exchanges. It was stated in this House that no Irish worker wants deliberately to be in a queue outside a labour exchange. No Irish worker wants to extend his hand either for unemployment benefit, doles, reliefs&mdash;whatever you call them &mdash;or for sums from charitable organisations.</P>
    <P>The evidence in the annual reports <Col N="1292" /> of all charitable organisations submitted at the end of December shows clearly that there never was such a drain upon some of these societies by decent hard-working people who have been deprived of work and who, because of necessity, were forced to apply to such organisations for funds to keep body and soul together.</P>
    <P>When we are faced, as we are, with a discontented people, there can be little hope or prospect for the future. Every time conditions become really bad, there is an increase in crime.  If the statistics in the form of charges at the local courts for theft and larceny are made available, it will be found that there are a greater number of charges in respect of larceny and theft and a greater degree of disrespect for the law than there are when people are contented and in full time employment.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough that our people should be faced with unemployment, but the position is still worse in regard to those members of the younger generation who leave school each year.  I want to ask the Government and, indeed, the House what future faces the young people of 14, 15 and 16 years of age to-day?  What future faces those who are leaving the secondary schools, the national schools and the universities? Young people with degrees leaving the universities cannot find work as engineers, agricultural instructors and doctors.  Is it not coming home forcibly to the mind of the Government that there are extremely well educated people in the country, people who leave our universities with honours degrees, qualified doctors, engineers and accountants, who, every single week, leave for Great Britain, the United States, Canada and New Zealand?</P>
    <P>Every Deputy who is a member of a county committee of agriculture knows that for every vacancy for an agricultural instructor, there are from one to 12 applicants.  The statistics are available in the offices of the Local Appointments Commission as to the numbers of applicants for every dispensary district which becomes vacant. Yet you have large numbers of professional <Col N="1293" /> people, on whose education their parents have spent sums running into four figures, who have to be exported, because they have no hope of any kind of a job, unless they have some political pull.  Then it is all the same whether they are educated or not, because, if they have that pull, they will get the job.  That is the unfortunate position in this country.</P>

      <P>The Government have a definite responsibility to provide work.  Very little of the Minister's Budget speech was devoted either to the problem of unemployment or what he proposes to do to remedy it.  Surely it must be clear at this stage&mdash;after 14 months of the Government's existence&mdash;that they have done practically nothing towards solving that problem.  To the knowledge of every Government Deputy, it has been stated that the volume of emigration in the past 12 or 18 months could not be equalled during the period of office of any Government previous to this.  The silence of the Minister and the silence of the Head of the Government and of the other members of the Government on such important matters as unemployment and emigration, shows disregard for the future of the country and certainly shows disregard for the unfortunate people who are put to the pin of their collar to get an existence.</P>

The one thing I am afraid of is, instead of this country thriving and making headway, that by 1960, as a result of the re-entry of a Fianna Fáil Government, we shall be back again where we were in 1947.</P>

      <P>In relation to the present Budget, there does not seem to be any hope of giving substantial relief to the farmers or in regard to the cost of living.  Let us take the cost of living.  Does the present Government feel that the electors tore the paving stones up getting to the polling booths 14 months ago so that that Government could present us with a Budget such as this?  The results of that election would have been different if the Fianna Fáil Party had gone to the people and said: &ldquo;If we are elected as the Government of this country, we shall take no hand, act or part in reducing taxation nor shall we give any relief whatever to the old age pensioners, widow pensioners, orphans, and so on.&rdquo; Those and other needy sections of the community who are feeling the effects of the increased cost of living as a result of this Budget, and who should have been given substantial increases by way of compensation, are omitted deliberately from this Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to criticise the Budget for failing to provide for these people.  I <Col N="1295" /> want to criticise the Budget for not providing for the old age pensioners. Without any great difficulty arrangements could have been made to increase old age pensions by at least 5/- a week.  Widows' and orphans' pensions could have been substantially increased. Unemployment assistance and other social services and benefits could have been increased because there is justification for such increases.  There is a justification for an increase in the old age pensions and the widows' and orphans' pensions because of the increased price of foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House who disagree with Fianna Fáil on their policy of savagely attacking the price of essential foodstuffs, do not sufficiently harp upon the cost of living. It was the cost of living which was the chief subject of every speech made by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I should like to ask the Minister for Finance what he has done in this Budget about the cost of living.  What single item of foodstuffs will be cheaper?  What essential commodity will be cheaper? Is there to be no relief in regard to the price of bread, flour, butter, cigarettes, stout, sugar, tobacco, and so on?  It was the deliberate policy of the present Government that made the price of these commodities excessive.  The people expected that at least the Government would have been honest in regard to those prices.  Although the price of bread, flour and butter, three essential items, has increased substantially, there has not been a corresponding increase in the rates of blind pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and old age pensions.</P>
    <P>An arrangement has been made between the trade unions and the Minister for Industry and Commerce that certain sections of the people are to be given an increase in pay to the extent of 10/- per week.  It must be borne in mind that there are tens of thousands of people who are in no way affiliated to a trade union and who will receive no such increase.  Yet these people are obliged to exist on the sum they were receiving before the price of those foodstuffs was increased.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> I expected to hear some form of explanation, when the Minister was dealing with unemployment, as to why more money was not provided for rural electrification.  The inter-Party Government, from 1948 to date, were mainly responsible for spending something like £50,000,000 on rural electrification. We have been told in the Dáil by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the estimated number of new rural areas which will be completed in 1958-59 will be approximately 60.  No information was given as to the reason for the slowing down of rural electrification.  During the last three years, particularly the years in which the inter-Party Government were in office, the figures provide an illuminating comparison.  In 1954-55, 75 areas were completed.  In 1955-56, 99 areas were completed and in 1956-57, 80 areas were completed.</P>
    <P>I accuse the Minister for Finance of slowing down rural electrification and, simply and solely because of his policy, this is causing unemployment.  It is remarkable that when Fianna Fáil were in office in 1951-52 only 49 areas were completed; in 1952-53, 49 areas again was the figure, and in 1953-54, 60 areas were completed.  This must show that Fianna Fáil policy with regard to rural electrification is to cut it out completely, slow it down, and have a fewer number of men employed on it.  They have taken no action to see that more areas are completed and given the benefit of rural electrification. It is no wonder that the figures for unemployment are so high because of the slow down in rural electrification.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance must know that there are parish councils, local authorities and development associations set up in the most mountainous and most remote parts of the country seeking rural electrification.  On the one hand the E.S.B. are saying they are producing too much electricity and, on the other hand, there are people demanding electricity and cannot get it.</P>

      <P>I shall obey your ruling, but I was just endeavouring to show that the Government could provide more employment by concentrating on schemes such as rural electrification.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance must take responsibility for the slowing down of the activities of Bord na Móna.  I do not propose to go into the administration of the Department of Industry and Commerce, the E.S.B. or Bord na Móna, but I do want to press home the fact that there are fewer people employed on bog development schemes than there were.  I respectfully submit it is due to the fact that sufficient provision has not been made for bog development purposes.  That is one of the reasons why I accuse this Budget of being a failure, of holding out no hope for the future of bog development schemes, for the future of rural schemes, and, as Deputy Wycherley pointed out, for the future development that should take place in the fishing industry if sufficient capital were made available for that industry.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Government always seem to look upon the farmer as a chief target for attack any time they feel like it.  I feel there is no other section of the community carrying greater taxation to-day than the farming community.  I expected that in this Budget some provision would have been made to relieve the farmer of some of his burden.  I expected there would be some relief of taxation on agricultural machinery.  I expected that the levies would have been removed on all imports required for agricultural purposes.  We have asked the farmers to become mechanised, we have asked them to become more efficient, to purchase machinery, and the result has been that the horse is a thing of the past on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The horse has had his day on the land and the change has made for greater efficiency, greater speed and greater production.  It is necessary in the age in which we are living.  It is necessary that tractors and other modern machinery be at the disposal of the farmer in his efforts to increase production but, in regard to tractors, <Col N="1298" /> the taxation on them in the Twenty-Six Counties is £14 8s. 9d. while in Northern Ireland it is only £4 15s., if the tractor is to be used for hire.  While we urge the farmer to become modernised we place a special tax on his machinery and implements.  I should like to know why there should be this extraordinary difference in the rate between the Twenty-Six Counties and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The farmer who uses a tractor in Armagh and Tyrone to plough and sow, and who uses it for hire, can do so at a rate of £4 15s. a year but, in the Twenty-Six Counties, he is obliged to pay £14 8s. 9d.  The amount collected on tractors is roughly £120,000 a year and we must bear in mind that while we collect in taxation on tractors alone £120,000 a year, there is nothing collected in Denmark, nothing collected in the Netherlands, nothing collected in Germany, nothing in Sweden, and nothing in New Zealand.  Yet, we ask: &ldquo;Why is the Irish farmer not like the New Zealand farmer, why is he not like the Danish farmer?  Why are our farmers not able to take their place side by side with the farmers of the Netherlands?&rdquo; We see the Governments of Germany, Sweden, New Zealand, Denmark and the Netherlands giving special tax reliefs to those on the land; here, not alone have the farmers the heavy burden of local taxation in the form of rates, but everything they have to buy&mdash;spades, forks, shovels, implements, barbed wire, netting wire and all other wire they use&mdash;is taxed.  On top of that, the most essential piece of machinery, the tractor, is taxed.  The tractor has come to stay because the people, particularly the younger element in agriculture, believe that the day of ploughing and sowing by following horses from sunrise to nightfall has gone; they will never go back to it, never want to go back, and never should go back, if they are to keep up production.  With a tractor and modern machinery, one can do more work in less time than can possibly be done otherwise.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Finance why some relief was not given in taxation on agricultural machinery <Col N="1299" /> and what are the prospects of such relief in the future?  I ask the Minister to take special notice of the tax on tractors here compared with the similar tax in Northern Ireland.  How does it happen that there should be this extraordinary drain on the owner's pocket through taxation here as compared with Northern Ireland in view of the fact that in most European agricultural countries the tractor is free of tax?</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister's attention was directed to a memorandum from the National Farmers' Association in regard to tractor taxation and machinery tariffs when he was framing his Budget.  That memorandum was submitted for the consideration of the Government by the Secretary of the National Farmers' Association on 22nd February, 1958. Was that circular considered by the Government in connection with the talks between the Minister for Agriculture and the National Farmers' Association relating to taxation on the agricultural community?  What, if any, consideration has been given to it?  If consideration was given to it, why was no favourable decision reached?  I feel there is a case here for granting considerable reliefs.</P>
    <P>The House is entitled to some information from the Minister as to why the land rehabilitation scheme has been slowed down or practically cut out, why further funds have not been made available for that scheme to proceed at a greater rate and why provision was not made in the Budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Having regard to the heavy burden of taxation and unemployment, I want to refer to a speech by the Minister for Lands in Kilbeggan last June, because I feel this is an opportune time to ascertain whether the Minister for Lands was speaking with the approval of his colleagues in the Government, or whether he was taking it on himself to say that millions had been wasted in the vain hope that building houses and hospitals would keep our people at home&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not expect the Minister for Finance to answer to this House for everything the Minister for Lands might say, but I want to know if it is the opinion of the Minister for Finance, or is it Government policy, that money spent, as it was spent, by the inter-Party Government, in building houses and hospitals, has been wasted?  That was the text of the speech of the Minister for Lands and of most of the speeches made by the Fianna Fáil Party.  The building of houses and hospitals is essential: that is why the inter-Party Government devoted so much time and energy to that task.  It was regarded as of the greatest importance because, not alone did it provide work but it also provided homes for people who had none and hospitals for the aged and infirm.  Yet advantage was taken of that, and speeches were made by members of the present Government condemning the inter-Party Government's policy of building houses and hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wycherley said that production could be increased, if sufficient capital were made available for the agricultural community.  He was quite right in that.  If we want more produced in this country, those who are to produce it must be facilitated by having capital made available for them. It has been said here that all our energies should be devoted to increasing production and exports.  A great <Col N="1301" /> deal has been done to increase exports. A vast amount was done during the years in which the inter-Party Government were in office to increase our exports.  In 1947, out total exports were £39,000,000.  To-day they are £131,000,000.  The Fianna Fáil Party cannot take the credit for that since they were not in office consistently from 1947 to the present day.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of pride and gratification for the inter-Party Government that that increase has taken place. They can look upon their years of office as years which yielded great and beneficial fruits for the country.  The increase in exports from £39,000,000 in 1947 to £131,000,000 to-day shows that attention was directed towards increasing production for export, particularly increasing production for live-stock export.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we must increase production still more.  If that is so, then, as Deputy Wycherley has so rightly pointed out, we must devote all our energies towards providing capital for those on the land.  All of us who are intimately connected with the people in rural Ireland know quite well that the people in the Midlands failed to sow their lands, set their lands or asked neighbours to take their lands under the conacre system simply because they had not got the capital with which to stock the lands.  They regarded the time as too dear to purchase live stock.  They suffered from a shortage of capital.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation has played an important rôle in assisting some farmers, but the Minister must be aware that it is not always the most needy or most deserving farmer who will be sympathetically considered for a substantial loan by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>

      <P>I merely wanted to point out to the Minister the importance and urgency of providing capital to enable farmers to increase production on the land.  Until such time as those on the land are provided <Col N="1302" /> with sufficient capital to increase production, there is little use in asking them to do that in relation to which they are handicapped at the present time because of lack of capital.</P>
      <P>The Budget is a disappointing Budget.  It has given nothing to the people.  It has given no relief to the taxpayer.  It is a Budget which carries disappointment for the housewife.  It is a Budget which has brought no relief whatsoever to the poorer and weaker sections of the community, the old, the sick and the infirm.  It is a Budget that holds out no hope for the unemployed. It is a Budget that holds out no hope in respect of the heavy burden of taxation placed on the shoulders of the agricultural community.  It is a Budget that holds out no hope for Fianna Fáil. It is a Budget that will help to hasten the day when Fianna Fáil will be removed from office.  Fianna Fáil has always talked about balanced Budgets. This Budget has brought nothing but disappointment to every section of the community, and the most keenly disappointed of all are the back benchers in the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly when they are questioned as to their general election promises to provide more work, cheaper food and lower taxation.  Where is all that to-day? What about all those promises?  The day of reckoning is approaching and the people will be alive to the manner in which they have been cheated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say this is a good thing because the people have at last had the opportunity of seeing for themselves the deceit and dishonesty of Fianna Fáil policy all down through the years, from 1932 to the present day.  The last election was just one further demonstration of the manner in which Fianna Fáil gained votes by means of trickery. They have shown a complete disregard for the entire economy of the country. They have turned a deaf ear and a blind eye to unemployment and emigration and to the heavy burden of taxation.  All sections of the community have but one song to sing to-day, namely, that the promises made by Fianna Fáil have not been honoured and that they have been deceived. This Budget discloses the hypocrisy and deceit of the Fianna Fáil Party, <Col N="1303" /> hypocrisy and deceit which will be remembered by the electorate and particularly by those who put that Party into office, in the sincere belief that, when in office, they would fulfil the promises they made.  To-day, they are keenly disappointed and, for that, we have some cause for gratitude.  We must, I suppose, accept evil, if, out of that evil, we may eventually be able to do good.  This Budget has served its purpose in proving to the people the dishonesty of the Government, their total disregard for the country and their complete bankruptcy of policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the debate on the Budget over the past few weeks and I have noticed the Opposition using the old Coalition formula which stood them in such good stead even though on a short term basis, namely, Fine Gael looking for a reduction in taxation and Labour looking for an increase in social welfare benefits.  But nobody has told us how these can be achieved and when the Coalition Government was in office its members did not seem to be as interested in these things as they were during elections.</P>
      <P>I can appreciate that the Opposition are worried about this Budget, not merely because there is no increase in taxation but because our economic position is such that no further taxation is necessary.  This is a good Budget.  To appreciate the achievement in holding the line of taxation at the level at which it was last year one must not look upon the Budget as a self-contained unit.  One must examine it against the background of the financial chaos we inherited in March, 1957.  Partly because of the indiscriminate imposition of levies, particularly on the raw materials of industries whose goods would ultimately be exported, we had a very high jump in unemployment, with consequent emigration.  Thousands of Government grants all over the country were unpaid. Local authority cheques were refused by the banks.</P>

      <P>The Opposition have described the Budget as unimaginative. Various speakers from this side of the House have said that if what they mean by &ldquo;imaginative&rdquo; is something like the Budgets brought in by the Coalition Government, then it is time we had a change.</P>
      <P>It is worthy of note that in the document issued by the Central Statistics Office we find that, for the week ending 26th April, 1958, there was a reduction of nearly 2,500 in the unemployment figure; in 1957, the reduction was less than 200 and in 1956, it was 1,000.</P>

      <P>Who can deny that this Budget was responsible for that <Col N="1305" /> reduction in unemployment?  People in a position to give employment felt secure and were able to give employment. That is obvious from the figures I have quoted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon commented on our remarks in respect of the unsuccessful Coalition Government loans and inferred that we had taken from the credit-worthiness of the country by our remarks.  That is not true.  We felt that, because of the vacillating policy of the Coalition Government, the people had lost faith in them and for that reason, would not give money in loans.  It did not mean that the money was not available.  One might as well say that if an uncredit-worthy person went to a bank for a loan and the bank refused him, it meant that the bank had no money.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable discussion on the balance of payments.  I listened to what the members of the various Opposition Parties had to say on the subject.  I find it difficult to understand their exact attitude towards the question.  Sometimes they clap themselves on the back because they made the necessary changes to rectify the balance of payments, while at other times they allege that we are correcting the balance of payments but are not doing anything for employment. We feel that the correction of the balance of payments is necessary to enable us to have credit in other countries with which we can purchase the raw materials essential to our industries.  It is obvious that if we have a debit balance in other countries we shall eventually be refused the raw materials which are so necessary to our economy.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Fanning's remarks about introducing the P.A.Y.E. system in relation to income-tax. I am sure his remarks can be applied to most constituencies.  Working-men who get bills for large amounts in respect of income-tax are not able to pay those bills in one lump sum.  The P.A.Y.E. system would be helpful, inasmuch as they could pay so much income-tax per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to unemployment, while the figure are being reduced, there is certainly no room for complacency.  I feel that this Budget has laid the <Col N="1306" /> foundation for a future policy on which we can build and from that foundation go forward towards the ending of unemployment and emigration which are causing so much damage to our people and our country.</P>

      <P>I do not blame Deputy Faulkner for repeating untrue statements such as the one on which I interrupted him a few minutes ago. He has heard that pitter-patter from his leaders.  I do not blame him, a comparative neophyte, for accepting what they have told him as true.  However, we had that untruth in relation to local authorities in the past 12 months from Deputy Allen.  If Deputy Faulkner cares to look at the reply given by his Minister for Local Government, he will find that the statement he has just made is untrue.  The repetition of that type of statement&mdash;that cheques presented by local authorities were refused by the banks&mdash;does not do the credit of the country any good, no matter at what time it is alleged the cheques were repudiated.  It is obvious that if any such cases occurred during the time when I was Minister for Finance, they would have come to my notice.  No such case came before me.</P>
      <P>The only case in which there was any difficulty whatsoever was where the local official concerned neglected to take the normal course of ensuring that they would get the appropriate sanction and permission from the elected county council.  Where the officials concerned had endeavoured to get capital accommodation in excess of that which their county council had sanctioned, it was unquestionably a mistake by the officials concerned.  As soon as that mistake was rectified, the matter was cleared up without any delay.  I am sure every member of this House, as well as every member of a local authority, is aware that permission for overdraft accommodation must be given not by the county manager but by the elected representatives of the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Budget debate is a debate in which we should have a serious consideration of the economic and financial conditions of the country and of the economic and financial prognostications of the Minister in <Col N="1307" /> relation to the time ahead.  Above all else, this is a time in which we should not indulge in amusement of scurrility. Therefore, it is a tragic thing that a former Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, the present Minister for Health, should have taken advantage of the Budget debate last Wednesday to indulge in a type of dishonest scurrility which has seldom met its equal from any responsible Deputy here.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee, above all else as an ex-Minister for Finance, should have been one of those who would have set a tone in a debate such as this.  Instead of that he chooses to indulge in certain personal abuse and in pseudo arguments, based on figures that, if he had taken the slightest trouble, he could have found were not correct, and in general to deal with it as a joke rather than as a matter for serious debate.  Let me assure the Minister for Finance that I do not propose under any circumstances to make any references to his Budget, no matter what I may think of it, in the personal terms of &ldquo;Philip drunk and Philip sober&rdquo; to which Deputy MacEntee referred.  To do so would be the reverse of anything that any constructive criticism should be.</P>
    <P>As I say, Deputy MacEntee is not a neophyte.  He is not a back bencher in Fianna Fáil who has little experience. He is a former Minister for Finance.  He is in a position more accurately to determine for himself than are most Deputies the true facts in relation to any matters of financial policy about which he wishes to speak. I do not mind Deputy Davern saying that this was the first Budget in ten years that had not increased taxation. Of course, that is not true.  I imagine some of the members of his own Front Bench will rap him on the knuckles for that.  I will make you a present of this.  During the past ten years, certain Budgets introduced by Fianna Fáil did not increase taxation, just as certain Budgets introduced by us did not increase taxation.  I do not mind that from Deputy Davern.  He is merely repeating something he has <Col N="1308" /> heard dishonestly stated by somebody else.</P>
    <P>Nor do I mind somebody like Deputy Doherty from North Mayo getting up and repeating falsehoods he has heard in other circumstances. Perhaps he is not able to analyse himself the falsity of what he has spoken. As I have mentioned his name, I do object to the insolence he displayed, not towards me, but towards the members of the Capital Investment Committee when he suggested that they were just &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men for my successor or for myself.  I do not think that is a way in which people serving on a voluntary committee such as this should be described, by implication or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee challenged the remarks I made in reference to my charge that Fianna Fáil had put their Party before country.  I want to repeat that charge in the most specific terms. I did not make that charge, as he suggested, on the Budgets of 1952 and 1957.  I made it on an entirely different basis.  I shall repeat that basis and that charge now.  In 1951 Deputy MacEntee was Minister for Finance. On the 19th July, 1951, he came into this House and deliberately for Party purpose made a speech as Minister for Finance crying havoc, a speech that undermined public confidence very substantially at that time and, by such undermining, considerably injured the national economy and the whole financial structure of 1951.</P>
    <P>In 1957 we had emerged, as I shall show at a later stage, from the difficulties of the end of 1955 and the first six to eight months of 1956.  What the country needed more than anything else at that time was an expression of confidence in that we had been able to surmount those difficulties or an expression of confidence that the measures that had been introduced for their surmounting had been successful. If they had got that expression the people would have felt that, if unfortunately for other reasons other difficulties had arisen, it would have been possible to surmount them again.  But, because it did not suit the Party book of Fianna Fáil, they did not give the <Col N="1309" /> country in 1957 that expression of confidence it should have been given.</P>
    <P>Let me in fairness say to my successor, the Minister for Finance, that he did endeavour to start on the correct line in his Budget speech this time last year.  But it was a line that was quickly forgotten and deliberately contradicted by his own colleagues afterwards for purely political party purposes. It did considerable damage to our economic structure and delayed the resurgence that was beginning to come and would have come following the necessity of having to take certain steps in 1956.  I am quite positive that the reason the members of the present Government took that line in the country of talking all the time about how bad things were, instead of saying that the corner had been turned this time last year, was purely for the purposes of their own Party, ignoring the effect it would have on our national economy.  In so doing, I repeat, they were putting their Party before their country.</P>
    <P>In his speech Deputy MacEntee made an attempted analysis of everything that happened since 1948.  I do not propose in any way to follow him into the detail in which he went except to say this: that he was grossly inaccurate and in many respects quite untrue.  He started off by telling us that everything was lovely in the garden in 1948, that when Fianna Fáil went out of office everything was absolutely beautiful and that there would be no difficulties whatever for the inter-Party Government. It is rather peculiar, if that was the position, that Deputy Lemass had been speaking a couple of months before in entirely different terms.  Deputy Lemass went up to Letterkenny, County Donegal, and is reported on 15th September, 1947, in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  In case Deputy Burke should think I am misquoting or taking it from a paper unfavourable to Deputy Lemass, I invite Deputy Burke to inspect the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I always read it.  I like reading what <i>Pravda</i> says so that <Col N="1310" /> I can contradict it.  Here is what Deputy Lemass said in Letterkenny:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are entering four years of most acute difficulty in which economic disaster will threaten on every side and our only weapon of defence is our capacity to work hard.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There should be no doubt about the reality of our danger.  Our agricultural output has fallen.  We must get it up again.  This year's fall may be attributed partly to the abnormal spring and winter but our figures for years past are disturbing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If, as Deputy MacEntee tried to suggest to this House, everything was beautiful when the inter-Party Government took over in the beginning of 1948, why did his senior, the Tánaiste, express the views he expressed in Letterkenny?</P>
      <P>We have heard from time to time Fianna Fáil complaining that we were taking 1947 as a year of comparison. Is not it rather significant in that respect that the Tánaiste himself then said in relation to agricultural prices that the figures for years past were disturbing?</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee passed from that to Marshall Aid.  As I am referring to different Ministers for Finance, the Chair will not think that I am being in any way discourteous to the Minister by referring to him as Deputy MacEntee.  He then passed to Marshall Aid.  Of all the subjects upon which he should not speak in this House, I suggest that that is <i>par excellence</i> the one.  When Deputy MacEntee, as Minister for Finance, took over the reins of the Department of Finance, in June, 1951, he had there to his hand more than 50 per cent. of the Marshall Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to that, Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, had been utilising Marshall Aid as it should have been utilised, for the purpose of supplementing year by year the ordinary facilities available for the capital expenditure necessary to make up the backlog of the war and scarcity years. We all know that the position was that there was a backlog that had to be <Col N="1311" /> made up.  Goods were not available, particularly capital goods, during the war and it was desirable that, when these goods became available, they should be obtained as soon as was possible.</P>
    <P>Up to June, 1951, the Marshall Aid moneys were utilised for the purpose of supplementing the ordinary savings that were available.  From June, 1951, to December, 1951, however, the pattern was entirely changed under the aegis of Deputy MacEntee in the Department of Finance.  Between June, 1951, and December, 1951, £24,000,000 of that Marshall Aid money was scuttled out of the central Exchequer as quickly as Deputy MacEntee could shovel it out, a procedure which added in an appalling way to the inflationary symptoms and inflationary pressures then operating following the outbreak of the Korean war.  As I say, more than half the Marshall Aid was paid out by Deputy MacEntee in that short space of six months and it is pretty breathtaking that his audacity should enable him to come in here and speak about inflation and Marshall Aid in the same breath when that is his record in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health then proceeded to discuss the 1955 Budget.  In column 1044, Volume 167, of the Official Report he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Budget for 1955 was not an honest Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He makes no effort whatsoever to prove that statement.  He could not because it is an untrue statement and very little research by a person of his experience would have shown categorically and clearly how untrue was the statement.  Unfortunately, he went further than that; he proceeded to make statements that were of themselves untrue, an attempt, by the implication of those statements, to bolster up the charge that he had made.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the Budget for 1955, despite the fact that they had the advantage of the proceeds of the first special import levy&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Minister must have forgotten that <Col N="1312" /> the special import levy in that year yielded £54,000 and that that £54,000 was put, not to current account, but to capital account, to reduce the amount that otherwise would have to be raised by the creation of debt&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and that there was an increase of £860,000 in the amount of current expenditure which he defrayed from borrowing, Deputy Sweetman was forced in respect of that Budget to disclose a deficit of £312,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let me say categorically that there was no £860,000 increase in current expenditure defrayed from borrowing.  On the contrary, there was less current expenditure in that year defrayed from borrowing than there had been in Deputy MacEntee's Budgets of 1953 or of 1954.  There was a deficit of £312,000, which is the equivalent of about one-third of 1 per cent. on the total current revenue and let me make this present to my successor as Minister for Finance, that if he can get any Budget that he introduces within one-third of 1 per cent. of the amount at which he strove in his Budget statement to balance his accounts, then he is doing a good job. It is utterly absurd for anyone to suggest that any Minister for Finance can get his Budget Estimates nearer than the figure I have said of one-third of 1 per cent. and nobody knows that better than the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The Minister then came on to discuss the Budget of 1956, about which I will have something to say at a later stage. At column 1044, Volume 167, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So we have this position: that £5,725,000 of additional taxes yielded a deficit of £5,946,000 or a short-fall on Estimates of over £11,500,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee, of all people, should be able to make computations without having double counting in them, particularly when he had before him, or when he should have had before him when he made that speech, the speech made by my successor last year, when he said there was a short-fall on revenue of £4,500,000.  The method in which the Minister for Health attempted to blackguard the Budgets of 1955 and 1956, introduced by me, by dishonest and untrue statements of <Col N="1313" /> that sort, should be beneath the dignity of a former Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>He followed that by suggesting that the General Election of 1957 took place because we did not wish to introduce a Budget.  Surely he does not expect that the people of the country have forgotten the manner in which the Fianna Fáil Party campaigned up and down the country that they wanted a general election at once?  We had the Taoiseach, then Deputy de Valera, the Leader of the Opposition, rampaging through the country with his dictionary talking about how he would define a limpet and how he would examine all the attributes of that animal.  Everybody knows that the General Election of 1957 took place because of the withdrawal by the Clann na Poblachta Deputies of their support for the Government.  Everybody knows also that the reason for that withdrawal had in reality nothing whatever to do with economic factors but was because the Government were determined to govern and to preserve democratic rights in this country.  Is it not, there, fore, dishonest for the Minister for Health to come into the House now and suggest that the reasons for the general election were that we were not prepared to make a Budget and that we had not in any way disclosed what the position was?</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a speech I made at a time when I knew that a general election was to take place, a speech made on the 6th February, 1957, at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis.  That speech made it clear beyond question that I appreciated there would be difficulties ahead, difficulties in relation to the budgetary position for 1957-58.  If I wished to hide from the country that these difficulties were going to arise it would have been a simple matter and, perhaps, do as Fianna Fáil did to get votes on the head of that deception. Quite deliberately I chose to say truthfully what I knew was the position.  There cannot be any suggestion by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party particularly, that they were unaware of that position because <i>Pravda</i>, the <i>Irish Press</i>, made a point of featuring my speech the next morning in their issue of the 7th February.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> They made a point of featuring it in an effort to pretend that while I saw difficulties ahead they, and the people they represented, the Fianna Fáil Party, saw no such difficulties.  I am quite aware myself that the fact that I did disclose those difficulties to the people may have cost the Fine Gael Party votes, and even seats in the general election.  I did it quite deliberately and I am glad that I did it, even if it did mean that.  We did not wish to hoodwink the electorate in any way. Indeed, it would be impossible for us to compete in hoodwinking with the boys over there&mdash;they are such past-masters in that, that anything we would do would be only just trotting down the river.</P>
    <P>Anybody interested in that can see that issue of the <i>Irish Press</i> and they will see that I disclosed the true facts. They will also see another thing, if they wish to make the analysis.  They will see, in relation to the weekly returns published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> that, while I was Minister for Finance, we were disclosing the true position week by week in that return.  I assume there is a statutory obligation on the Minister for Finance to publish that weekly return in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  I have not been able to check the exact statute that deals with it, but it is being done year after year and, I presume, in pursuance of a statutory duty.  When I was Minister for Finance that published return was a true return.  This last year I am afraid it was not a true return.</P>
    <P>In 1955, the March expenditure was £17.9 million.  In 1956 the March expenditure was £18.3 million.  In 1957 the March expenditure was £18.2 million but in 1958 the March expenditure was £25.9 million.  Deputy Cunningham suggested on Thursday last, when I criticised the March expenditure of that year, that I criticised it because I wished it had not been paid.  I did not.  I criticised this from the aspect that a large succession of payments must have been quite deliberately held up over earlier months of that year and thrown into the expenditure for March, 1958, so that expenditure for March, 1958, was approximately £8,000,000 more than the March expenditure of either of the three previous <Col N="1315" /> financial years.  I am not suggesting that the Minister for Finance had not got to pay that money but I am suggesting that the manner in which they were all held up to the end of the financial year shows the returns made of expenditure throughout the rest of that year had not got that genuineness, that forthrightness, which would be desirable when it is a statutory duty to publish such a return.</P>
    <P>The point of such a return is that everybody may see how the receipts and expenditures for the Government are going ahead.  Let me, however, return to the 1955-56 Budget on which Deputy MacEntee, the Minister for Health, was so voluble.  He said that the 1955 Budget was not an honest Budget.  Certainly, the Budget of 1955, which he said so much about being dishonest, had a deficit of £312,000.  His Budget of 1952 had a deficit of £2,480,000 and the Budget of 1953 a deficit of £702,000.  Those figures would seem to imply that he would have been wiser and more prudent in not throwing stones, considering the glasshouse in which he was himself situated.</P>
    <P>To go back to the 1956-57 Budget one of the things which must be considered in relation to any Budget is not merely its balancing its books but its effect from an inflationary and deflationary point of view.  This year the Minister has taken into normal current account the proceeds of the special import levies, partly by changing them to protective customs duties and partly by taking the levies as they are.  If he does that this year, is it not fair enough to compare the 1956-57 and 1957-58 Budgets as they would have been, if he had done in those years as he has done this year?  Then it would mean that the Budget introduced by the Minister in 1957 was, from an inflationary point of view, unbalanced to the extent of £3,329 million, while for 1956-57 it was unbalanced only to the extent of £1.67 million.  In other words, on the current account, the Budget of my successor last year was twice as wrong as mine of 1956, to which the Minister for Health referred in such scathing terms the other day.</P>
    <P>It was perfectly obvious in the <Col N="1316" /> autumn of 1956, immediately the necessity arose for the second import levies, that their restrictive effect would, to some degree, affect the current Budget out-turn for that year, but no matter how much it might affect that unbalance, it was bound to have a very substantial dis-inflationary effect &mdash;not a deflationary effect&mdash;and bound again to have an unbalance.  It became quite clear towards the late autumn of 1956 that our trade position was improving very substantially and that we were surmounting the difficulties that had shown themselves in the earlier parts of the year.  If the restrictions and cuts in capital expenditure which had been visualised in July were not eased to some extent, then their deflationary effect would have been more than was necessary and the economy would have gone from dis-inflation to deflation.</P>
    <P>It was because of that that the Government at that time released £1,000,000 for the relief of unemployment so as to avoid an unnecessary deflationary effect.  We then had, on top of the situation at home, the effects of the Suez crisis.  Nobody need suggest that it did not have a severe effect on this country.  Indeed, the Minister in his Budget speech the other day acknowledged that when he instanced the effects of the Suez crisis on the Road Fund.  There is no doubt whatever that the effect of the measures taken at that time proved adequate without the necessity of the further deflation that would then be required if one were to have brought&mdash;after the second import levies and after Suez&mdash; the current Budget into balance, in 1956-57.  However, I think if I were to deal only, in discussing this Budget Resolution, with the outrageous and audacious impudence of the Minister for Health, that I would not be fulfilling the duty which I have and which we all have.</P>
    <P>This Budget about which the Minister for Health said hardly a word, if indeed he said a word at all, is built on four foundations.  First of all, it consolidates and continues everything in the 1957 Budget&mdash;of which I will have something more to say later on. Secondly, in order to make it balance, <Col N="1317" /> it transfers to capital account items which previously were dealt with on current account.  In other words, it adds these items to the public debt about which the Deputies opposite are so very found of talking.  Items which before were dealt with on current account are, in this Budget, included in capital account.</P>
    <P>The third basis upon which it is built is the transfer of the levies and the switch to revenue duties.  There is no difference whatsoever between that switch and the Minister standing up here and saying: &ldquo;Whereas previously we paid these moneys as we went, now we are going to borrow for capital expenditure&rdquo;&mdash;because that is exactly what the Minister is doing.  Fourthly, the Minister has arrived at this balance in his Budget by, in the words of his colleague, the Minister for Health, purloining the petty cash.</P>
    <P>Let me go over the details of those points.  Perhaps I might take the last one first&mdash;transfers from the balances in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners. Of the amount of £323,000, £165,000 is a balance in excess of £2,000,000 left over when the 1956-57 financial year concluded, the year in which there was a deficit without any question.  The sum of £158,000, the balance of the £323,000, represents an increase in that £165,000, an increased balance in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners, an increase the Revenue Commissioners obtained between 1st April, 1957, and 31st March, 1958.</P>
    <P>Surely it is utterly dishonest for the Minister for Finance to come in here and to say that last year in his Budget he had a deficit of £5,800,000 and that he had unfortunately to borrow for that deficit when he could have reduced the deficit by £158,000 revenue that came to him during the year, which he did not use for the purpose of reducing the deficit, but held over to this year so that he would be able to utilise it for the current Budget.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the Minister did that deliberately in relation to the increase of £158,000.  I do not think he deliberately gave instructions to the Revenue Commissioners that that excess was to be there.  In fact, I think the reverse, but no matter what <Col N="1318" /> directions are given by the Revenue Commissioners, inevitably there are moneys that flow in after the decisions have been taken in relation to that balance and show up in this way.  But when that balance was there now after a year in which there had been a deficit in particular of the size revealed by the outcome of the Minister's 1957 Budget, the proper way of using that balance would have been to retire some of the debt created by the Minister to meet his deficit of last year.  It is quite dishonest to use it for the purpose of balancing this year's Budget.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there is any particular significance in another aspect of this.  I have not got all the material yet on which I can express an opinion, but if one looks at the last available <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in respect of 29th April and examines in that the expenditure from the Exchequer this year and last year, one will find that the expenditure this year is £2.9 million and the expenditure last year was £4.763 million&mdash;a difference of just under £2,000,000 in the same period.  It occurs to me that one possible explanation of that decrease in expenditure this year would be that the Minister had brought forward, so to speak, payments last year and paid things before 31st March so that they would not be coming in charge against him during this year.  We have no way of telling whether he did so or not.  If he did, I would suggest that just as his endeavour to balance his Budget on the transfer of moneys that were not brought to credit last year is a dishonest method of balancing his Budget, so the other would be equally so.</P>
    <P>The third point to which I refer is the levies.  In April, 1957, the Government made an Order, presumably at the instance of the Minister for Finance, by virtue of which certain levies were switched into permanent revenue duties&mdash;not protective duties for the purpose of protecting industries but revenue duties as such.  I asked a question recently and I was told that the proceeds of these duties were £692,000 in the year up to 31st March last.  It was not a full year and it is fair enough, therefore, to take about £750,000 as being the revenue from <Col N="1319" /> these duties in the current full year. Revenue duties, for example, duties on newsprint which I had given a most specific assurance would be a temporary levy became a permanent revenue duty as a result of the action taken by the Government in April, 1957, and brought in £750,000 in a full year.  In April this year, the Minister did a further switch on other levies&mdash; transferring those levies from that temporary purpose into permanent revenue duties&mdash;permanent blisters on the backs of the people to the tune of no less than £600,000.</P>
    <P>Finally, in this Budget he has transferred £1,750,000.  He still calls them levies, but instead of using them for the purpose of financing capital expenditure, he switched them into current expenditure.  He will now have to borrow in all £3,000,000 which those levies would have paid for&mdash;out of the levy procedure&mdash;but for the manner in which he has introduced them into the current Budget.</P>
    <P>I referred also to the items that had been switched into capital account for the first time.  There is the bovine tuberculosis grant of £884,000, the net amount.  Let me say without any question that the more we can spend on ridding the country of bovine tuberculosis, the better, if it is achieving its purpose.  The only test we should have in relation to that is the test of efficiency in the expenditure and that it is doing the job.  If we do not succeed in that eradication scheme at an early date, we will find ourselves in a very serious difficulty in relation to the whole store cattle trade. When I say that is one of the methods by which the Minister for Finance has balanced his Budget by switching that into capital account, I want to be perfectly clear that, in so doing, I am not making any criticism of expenditure as expenditure.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there was a grant counterpart receipt for that in earlier years.  A former Minister for Finance, Deputy Aiken, when I brought that grant counterpart receipt in as an Appropriation-in-Aid or as an extra Exchequer receipt&mdash;I forget which&mdash; waxed most frightfully eloquent.  He said it was the wrong way of dealing <Col N="1320" /> with the situation, that it should not have been included in that way at all. Yet now the Minister has switched that item.  He also switched the item for industrial grants which I carried previously out of current account into capital account.  He has switched industrial grants in that way to the extent of £200,000 and the allocation for Foras Tionscal to the extent of £450,000 from current to capital account.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the Minister would have said in criticism of this Budget from this side of the House if I had introduced these three changes.  Would he and all the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party not have got up and, with one universal wail, said that we were putting the country in pawn; that we were putting off the evil day; that we were putting these items on the never-never system; that we were raising the public debt instead of dealing with them out of current revenue as we should have dealt with them and as they were dealt with before?  I know very well we would have had that wail raised from one end of the road to the other.  Deputy Burke would not have been able to restrain himself from getting to his feet and Deputy Davern could not have refrained from making interruptions. They would have taken the view that that was dishonest public accounting.</P>
    <P>Yet that is what their own Minister has done in this Budget.  It is one of the ways in which he has in this Budget arrived in the end at a balance.  Let me say also in relation to the levies that I have tried and found it utterly impossible to distinguish and determine what levies are still in existence and in what way they are still operated. Some of them have been amended and some of them have been switched into public revenue taxes and, as I have said, others are still in existence.  I did receive an amended print from the Revenue Commissioners of these levies, but I am afraid that I found it difficult to follow.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he should now, regardless of whether he was right or wrong, publish a new clean copy, so to speak, of the existing levies which are there, so that it may be possible for traders, Deputies and <Col N="1321" /> public men of all sorts to see exactly where they are.  I do not know whether the Minister intends to do that or not. I might give him an opportunity of expressing his view on this between now and the Second Reading of the Finance Bill, because I assume we shall have to have a special section in the Finance Bill to repeal the section which I put in the Central Fund Act of 1956, under which moneys raised from levy had to be used for the purpose of decreasing the public debt by financing capital expenditure.  Now the levies will be used for current purposes and, as I have said, that is the same as increasing the public debt.  I should like also to see if there is still included the levy on rubber toys about which I remember Deputy Davern making an awful hullabaloo on this side of the House.  To the best of my recollection, it is still there and, therefore, Deputy Davern cannot have very much influence with the Minister for Finance.</P>

I must confess that is not quite accurate.  He made more of a saving on the food subsidies than he intended, but all his other alleged saving were under-realised.  The savings on Land Commission, on Defence and, I think, in relation to the Civil Service, failed to come up to his expectations or to his announced realisation.</P>

      <P>That is what I am coming to.  You must get the number going out as well, and one of the numbers going out that has been taken by the Minister is 157 civil servants who have gone to Gaeltacht Industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I went to the trouble of going through the whole Volume of Estimates and counting the number of civil servants that are provided for this year.  If the Minister takes the tot and excludes Garda, Army and Post Office, he will see that there is even an increase in the number of civil servants this years, if he cuts out the Gaeltacht Company.  Taking in Post Office, there is a decrease, but the decrease is significant in the terms the Minister mentioned, because 157 of them have gone from the numbers in the Book of Estimates, from &ldquo;civil servants&rdquo;, so to speak, to be State company officials and that payment is now, of course, made by the Minister not by paying personnel, but by a grant, and the Minister's own Table I to which he was kind enough to refer me shows that he failed to the extent of £50,000 in relation to civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad indeed to see that, but if that is so, then the Land Commission, Defence and general over-estimation was very much worse.  I will confess quite frankly that I read the bracket figure as being the actual figure and the figure outside the bracket as being the Estimate.  Apparently I read it the wrong way round.  Well, even Homer can nod.  I think there is a grant-in-aid of £120,000 for the new Gaeltacht <Col N="1323" /> company.  Has credit been taken for that as part of the saving not for last year&mdash;it did not arise last year&mdash;but for the coming year, when the Minister thinks that the Civil Service machine will be costing less?  I wanted to deal with a few matters of a general nature like that before coming down to discussing our economic position and the general outcome.</P>
      <P>The figures produced by the Minister to us in these financial tables show in certain respects a most unsatisfactory trend.  Incidentally, may I say that I welcome very much the innovation that was made last year by the Minister in putting the economic statistics into Table XII?  It was a good innovation but I suggest that it would be a better innovation if it were added as an annex of a different sort to the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure that come out on the Saturday before the Budget.</P>
      <P>Last year, not knowing that the Minister was going to publish Table XII, I put down certain questions to him to elicit that information before Budget day.  This year, having regard to the fact that they were included in the Tables, I did not put down the questions and made a mistake in so doing, as the Tables are not issued until the Minister has concluded his Budget speech.  Those economic statistics are not in any way secret and I suggest that it would enable people who are anxious to give full consideration to what the Budget should be to have an opportunity of considering those figures beforehand.  It is a point which perhaps did not occur to the Minister.  I wish to give him full credit for the innovation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to get statistics up to a certain date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many of these which could be produced beforehand. Without in any way gainsaying the most valuable work done by the Central Statistics Office, if one says one must have certain figures for a certain date one gets them and it does not matter that one may pitch the day <Col N="1324" /> three days before or not.  This means that there will have to be a considerable number of questions to elicit that information, so that proper consideration can be given before Budget day, if they are not included in some way in one of the publications before that.</P>
      <P>One of the things which arise in relation to the Budget this year is consideration of the position of the Capital Budget.  I said to the Minister when I was speaking before that I thought it was a mistake that he had not continued with the innovation I announced, of having the Capital Budget at a different time to the current Budget.  It is inevitable at present that attention should all be focussed on the current Budget, but it is desirable that attention should be focussed on the Capital Budget, particularly this year.</P>
      <P>As I told the Minister last year his 1957 Budget was bound to inflate current costs, and was bound to give us an all-round higher cost economy, quite apart from the individual hardship we can see being done now.  The manner in which the Minister has met the higher cost economy is to deflate violently on the capital side.  Perhaps it was because the Minister was about to deflate so violently on the capital side that he wished to hide it and bury it so that it would not get the attention it deserved.</P>
      <P>One of the items which will be part of the Capital Budget of this year is the fact that the Minister will have to repay, if he has not already had to repay, the loan made to the Exchequer by Aer Línte.  I want to make just a passing reference to the Trans-Atlantic Air Service.  I did not think&mdash;and we did not think on this side of the House &mdash;that it was a sound method of investing the already too small resources of our country.  Once the Government had decided that they were implementing it&mdash;they are the Government and they are entitled to take decisions&mdash;and once they had taken that decision we felt on our part that, once it became an accomplished fact, it was a national undertaking and should be treated as such. For that reason, we did not take action we might have taken otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to decry in the strongest <Col N="1325" /> possible terms the manner in which the present Government, from the Taoiseach down, deliberately made the Trans-Atlantic Service inauguration into a political holiday for Fianna Fáil. I want to decry in the strongest possible terms the manner in which that opening was abused for political Party purposes.  I think it was disgraceful that no people of public stature in the country outside the Government were asked to take part in those inauguration ceremonies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only dealing with it in a very passing way, Sir.  It would have contributed far more to the general confidence we need for our financial structure if, for example, presidents of chambers of commerce were brought into the picture, if for example, the former Minister for Industry and Commerce were invited. Nobody will outdo me in my praise of the Civil Service and of the public service, but I think it was quite uncalled for that the inaugural flight should be made into the Civil Service holiday that it appears from the newspapers to have been.  I feel that that must have been done by direction of the Government, as I cannot conceive it being done otherwise.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the company concerned was appointed by me to be the chairman of the Capital Investment Committee and by that appointment I showed I had complete confidence in his political integrity.  I am afraid that confidence has been very badly shaken, though he is a personal friend of mine and I am glad to acknowledge him as a personal friend.  It has been very badly shaken by the manner in which he utilised the opening ceremony for political Party purposes.  I hope the reaction there has been in the country to a national objective being used for that purpose will&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the things I found great difficulty in understanding from the Minister for Finance was whether he felt we were in an inflationary or deflationary situation.  I am sure the Minister has seen the speech made by his colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, and publicised in the External Affairs <i>Bulletin</i> on the 23rd March last, the speech made by Deputy Aiken in Cork.  I do not know whether the Minister for Finance believes that the time has come when we must not save and must plan to spend.  The whole tenor, the whole purport of the speech by the Minister for External Affairs&mdash;which was given State recognition by being published in the External Affairs <i>Bulletin</i>&mdash;was that, as there would be, he hoped, spending in America to avoid a slump there, a similar line would be desirable here.</P>
      <P>I thought the Minister for Finance took the view that that was not what we ought to do, that we ought to conserve our resources as far as possible for productive capital expenditure and that spending, such as appeared to be advocated by the Minister for External Affairs, was not in accord with the policy of the Minister for Finance. May I say, as he has now come in, that I hope the Minister for Health will pay me at least the compliment of reading what I have to say about him, when the Dáil Debates are published?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather difficult in a debate on an Estimate which covers such wide ground and upon which so many matters of detail have been raised to make what would be described, perhaps, as a composed and shapely reply.  So I can only take the principal points <i>seriatim</i> giving, as I think I should, precedence to the points raised by my predecessor, Deputy Tom O'Higgins.  I should like to say here that I found his speech very helpful and gratifying because, quite clearly, he appreciates the difficulties under which a Minister for Health has to labour in present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his speech Deputy O'Higgins inquired what progress had been made in the provision of a rehabilitation service.  The position is that an interim report has been received from the National Organisation for Rehabilitation which Deputy O'Higgins, as Minister for Health, set up in November, 1955.  This report contained a considerable number of recommendations in relation to various aspects of a rehabilitation service.  The recommendations, which affect a number of Government Departments, have <Col N="1328" /> been circulated to those concerned and at the same time they are being examined in the Department of Health.  We hope that a submission&mdash; which is in preparation&mdash;on the report will be available for my consideration within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to another matter and perhaps I should quote, or at least paraphrase, his remarks.  He said it had come to his notice that in some cases doctors on the staff of voluntary hospitals are seeking to charge fees in respect of the treatment of patients in the public wards of their hospitals and in that connection he said this was a practice which he completely condemned.  He said: &ldquo;I should like to express my complete condemnation of any person who seeks to impose any such charge&rdquo;. Of course, the Deputy has expressed my attitude towards that practice.  It is perhaps difficult to see what we can do to curb it but, if necessary, legislation will not be ruled out because it would be quite wrong to permit the clear intention of the Legislature to be defected by those who have entered into an agreement with the State to provide these medical services free of charge in public wards.  I do not want to say any more than that, but I certainly do not wish any of those who may be engaging in this practice to feel that they are likely to get away with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins also raised the question of providing for those who were in the lower income group a choice of doctor.  The matter was mentioned also, I think, by Deputy Coburn, by Deputy Loughman and others.  I suppose it would be a desirable thing, if it could be done without any undue administrative difficulty or greatly increased expense, to provide those who are in the lower income group with the same choice in regard to their general practitioner as is provided for them under the maternity scheme.  But examinations which have been made in the Department&mdash; a preliminary examination under Dr. Ryan and further examinations when Deputy O'Higgins was Minister for Health&mdash;have indicated that there are many difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> The first difficulty is that it is highly doubtful whether it would be possible to provide this choice of doctor for the lower income group outside the larger centres of population so that we should be put&mdash;not that I would regard it as being of any very great moment&mdash;in a position in which we would have, perhaps, some very eminent people coming along and telling us how the Government were discriminating between town and country.  If it were possible to provide a general practitioner panel service for the larger centres of population and if we found ourselves unable to do that in the rural areas we would probably be charged by some people in high places with discriminating between town and country.  Enough attempts have been made to create&mdash;so to speak&mdash;bad blood between the inhabitants of urban and rural districts for me, at any rate, not to give further cause for complaint in that respect.</P>
    <P>Apart from this there would be the question of expense, and this, in regard to the schemes which were examined when Deputy O'Higgins was Minister, would be quite considerable. I am informed that a modified proposal, which he suggested should be examined, would not be so expensive but it is doubtful whether, in our present circumstances, we could undertake to provide this additional right for those in the lower income group. However, I shall ask that the matter be examined further and it may, perhaps, be possible to do something. Candidly, I do not think it will.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins also urged that there should not be undue caution&mdash; that is not precisely what he said: he put it rather the other way and urged that there was a danger that there might be undue caution in curtailing hospital building&mdash;because of the condition of the Hospitals Trust Fund.  I do not think any Minister for Health, continually bombarded as he is with requests for money to finance the continuance of hospital programmes, would be permitted to be unduly cautious, but I am concerned, and it is my first concern, to see that the Hospitals Trust Fund is put on a fairly substantial basis again, because I do not <Col N="1330" /> think that we can, in the circumstances of the world around us, afford to build up heavy, uncovered commitments in respect of building contracts.  I would certainly like to be sure that if any project is started it will have a reasonable chance of being carried through to completion even if the worst should happen and we found ourselves in such a position that the income which the Hospitals Trust Fund derives from sweepstakes was suddenly reduced or perhaps cut off entirely.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne criticised me very severely for the policy which I have adopted in regard to vaccination against poliomyelitis.  He held that it was a retrograde step to expect parents &mdash;this was the burden of his criticism&mdash; to pay for the vaccinating of their children against poliomyelitis, even if they could afford to do so.  I do not think there is anything retrograde in asking a parent to shoulder his parental responsibilities, when he is in a financial position to undertake that obligation.  On the contrary, it would be, in my view, a grave and indeed unjustifiable retrogression to permit a parent who can well afford to look after the health of his children to unload his obligations and impose them on his neighbours.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne painted a harrowing picture of the distressing condition of children who have been stricken by this terrible disease.  None of us who has any knowledge of the disease will attempt to minimise the suffering of the afflicted or the anguish of their parents; but we are not arguing about the nature of the disease or about its terrible characteristics. There is no controversy about that. We are in agreement about it and it is not an issue.  What is in issue is whether it is just and equitable to use the limited resources at our disposal to help those who are in the greatest need of assistance and to expect of others, whose circumstances enable them to do so, that they should look after themselves.  That, I think, is the issue, and the only issue, between Deputy Dr. Browne and myself.</P>
    <P>The weakness of the case he has made is proven by the devices to which he has resorted in order to support it. <Col N="1331" /> First, we had this high-pitched appeal to the emotions.  Then we were told that we were condemning children to death, or at least to be maimed and crippled for life&mdash;thousands and thousands of them, until hyperbole could soar no further.  Then, the case was cited of a white-collar worker in the middle income group with a family of 12 children.  A graphic picture was painted of his struggle to determine whether he would have only six of them, or none of them, vaccinated.  I should like very much to have further particulars of this white-collar worker whose marriage has been so fruitful and so blest.  One would like to know, for instance, the ages of his eldest and his youngest child.  It would be interesting to know also what his occupation is, and whether he is insured.  All this would be helpful and I should be glad to have the information and other specific particulars of the financial and general circumstances of the gentleman whom Deputy Dr. Browne has in mind.  We can then see if there is any need in the particular circumstances to make special provision to meet his, and similar cases.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we are providing vaccination against poliomyelitis free for the children over six months and under ten years in the lower income group.  If our means permitted it, I should prefer to enlarge the group not by relating its range to the economic circumstances, but by relating it to the ages of the children concerned.  In any event, most parents outside the lower income group should be able to carry and should, in my view, carry, their parental responsibilities.  God forbid that any act of mine should result in any child being stricken with the disease.  I would not carry such a responsibility lightly; but I do not think that we should carry paternalism so far as to relieve parents, who can carry their responsibilities, of the obligations which God and nature have imposed upon them in relation to their children.</P>
    <P>The children belong to them.  They are theirs to nurse and care for and, so far as the care of the children is concerned, if they are not in a position <Col N="1332" /> to provide it, if they cannot afford to look after their children, then the community comes generously to their aid. But if the parents are in a position to provide for the physical care of their children, why should the community be asked to provide it?  Even if it does involve the parents in some little self-deprivation for the sake of the children why should they not accept it as duty?  It is a very easy declension from providing services for others, and caring and rearing for others, to arrogating to oneself a proprietary right in regard to those for whom we care.  And that is where, I think, unnecessary and intrusive eleemosynary action on the part of the State would eventually lead us.</P>
    <P>I have never accepted the position in relation to those things which, as I have said, parents or other people are bound in their natural duty to do, that they are entitled as of right, even if their circumstances do not justify it, to demand that others should carry the burden for them.  If we were to enlarge this scheme in the way Deputy Dr. Browne suggested, and if everybody covered by it were to take advantage of it, it would cost the State the better part of £500,000&mdash;that is, if everybody were to take advantage of it&mdash;and that £500,000 could be found, in general, only by imposing additional burdens upon the lower income group and the middle income group for whom Deputy Dr. Browne is so concerned.  The burden would be passed on to these groups in order to relieve those who should rightfully carry it of the obligation of doing so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne also criticised the voluntary health insurance scheme. There may be aspects of that scheme which may perhaps be criticised; I do not know.  I am only assuming that, like every other thing of man's devisiting, it has its imperfections.  However, there is no substance in a criticism which takes the worst possible case, enlarges on it and then says: &ldquo;That is the sort of thing you are doing by providing this voluntary health insurance scheme!&rdquo; The main criticism by Deputy Dr. Browne of the scheme were (1) that the scheme is expensive; (2) that it is not sufficiently <Col N="1333" /> comprehensive and is unlikely ever to cover more than 20 per cent. of all those not eligible for free or subsidised health services and (3) that the correct basic fundamental principle upon which a health service should be based is that there should be a comprehensive no-means-test scheme financed by taxation.  I have already stated my position in regard to the last point and perhaps I should go on to consider the others.</P>
    <P>We have to remember that, as conceived, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and the schemes it operates are expected to be self-supporting and self financed.  The State has provided the board with certain money to enable it to commence its operations. I think the general theory behind it is that the scheme will be operated for the mutual benefit of those who are organised within it and that they, themselves, will provide the income to finance the operation of the board and to finance the benefits which the members are expected to derive from it. Outside that, the Voluntary Health insurance Board conducts schemes which are non-profit making.  Any surplus which may accrue from year to year or from time to time as a result of the board's operations will be given back to the policy holders, the subscribers to the scheme, in the form of enhanced and improved benefits.</P>
    <P>In the example which he cited, in criticism of the operations of the board, Deputy Dr. Browne quoted the highest possible rates chargeable, that is, the rates chargeable to a married couple with four or more children joining the scheme as individual subscribers. First of all, let me say that rather lower rates are chargeable to people with fewer children.  Secondly, even still lower rates are chargeable to those who join the scheme not as individual subscribers but as members of a group.</P>
    <P>The examples mentioned by Deputy Dr. Browne are to be found on page 7 of the board's brochure.  There, it will be found that a married couple with four or more children can participate in scheme &ldquo;A&rdquo; for an annual premium of £13 10s. 0d., in scheme &ldquo;B&rdquo; for an annual premium of £17 <Col N="1334" /> 10s. 0d. and in scheme &ldquo;C&rdquo; for an annual premium of £23 10s. 0d.  Therefore in that particular group, at least six individuals are covered by the premium paid.  On that basis, if we divide the £13 10s. 0d. payable under scheme &ldquo;A&rdquo; by six we shall see that it comes to a payment of £2 5s. 0d. in respect of each person in that family.  If we divide the £17 10s. 0d. payable under scheme &ldquo;B&rdquo; by six we shall see that it comes to a payment of £2 18s. 4d. per person in that family.  In the case of the six persons covered by scheme &ldquo;C&rdquo;, in respect of whom a total payment of £23 10s. 0d. would be asked, the payment amounts to £3 18s. 4d. per person.  Contrast those figures with the £5 10s. 0d. per person which Deputy Dr. Browne mentioned in his criticism.  I think it will be found that, on the whole&mdash;and taking into consideration the benefits given under the voluntary health insurance scheme&mdash;members of the scheme are getting what is reasonably fair value.  I have not mentioned anything about the reduction of about 10 per cent., on the premiums which would be secured by a member of a group insuring his family under the scheme or anything about the rebate in income-tax which is obtainable on the premiums, because the amount of the rebate would vary with the circumstances of the subscriber.</P>
    <P>The second criticism which Deputy Dr. Browne launched against the scheme is that subscribers are not covered for appliances, dental treatment, maternity and general practitioner care.  The fact is that cover is given for appliances in respect of two-thirds of the cost over £2 10s. 0d. up to a maximum of £50 under scheme &ldquo;A&rdquo;, £60 under scheme &ldquo;B&rdquo; and £75 under scheme &ldquo;C&rdquo;.  I think that that is quite substantial cover having regard, again, to the circumstances of the individuals who are expected to avail of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne also criticised the scheme because there is no provision in it for dental benefits.  No recommendation to include dental benefits in their schemes was received from the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. The arguments against including <Col N="1335" /> dental benefits in a scheme of this sort are set out in the report of the advisory body which considered the practicability of setting up a scheme of voluntary health insurance.  Briefly they are: firstly, that the cost of dental treatment is not normally excessive.  Secondly, since such treatment as a general rule can be postponed, any scheme of dental insurance would be presented with many claims arising out of postponed treatment. Therefore, such an insurance is not a practicable proposition.</P>
    <P>As regards the insurance against maternity costs, the board made no recommendation for the inclusion of cover under this head.  Of course, the question was considered at lenght, and it is true that the advisory body did consider and recommend, even though the costs of confinement were predictable as to time and amount, the inclusion of some provision to meet such costs in the scheme of voluntary insurance.  As I have said, however, the board did not accept this.  Any person joining the voluntary insurance scheme, who is eligible for institutional and specialist services under Section 15 of the Health Act, 1953, is entitled to all the benefits of the maternity services, if the person so desires, which are provided under the Health Acts.</P>
    <P>As to the other point of criticism that the scheme does not provide for general practitioner care, as a rule, this is, and generally should be, met out of income.</P>
    <P>The next type of criticism Deputy Dr. Browne made was this.  He suggested that in time the number of people who would be covered by the scheme would settle down at from 80,000 to 100,000, and that against this there are 300,000 or 400,000 people who would be eligible to join the scheme, to whom it might be advantageous to join the scheme but who would remain outside it.  How many of the people who are not covered by the present health services will eventually join the scheme is anybody's guess.  So far, 50,000 persons have joined it within the short period the scheme has been in operation.  Scarcely a day passes but I receive one or two letters from people <Col N="1336" /> down the country asking me how they may join the scheme.  So that, as the knowledge of it is becoming more widespread, people are becoming more anxious to know what it is all about; and presumably when they are told what it is all about, they will become, in due time, subscribers.  The main justification for the scheme is that it provides a service which can be availed of by those who are in a position to take it, and who are not covered in any other way.  They are free to join or not to join, as they so desire, provided, of course, that their general physical condition and health is not such as would impose an undue burden upon the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne raised a great number of points.  Many of them were referred to by other Deputies.  If I fail to mention by name any of the Deputies who brought these matters to my attention, I can assure them I listened to what they had to say, even though I shall just have to deal with the points as they were mentioned by the speakers who raised them in the first instance.  Deputy Kyne suggested that appeal machinery should be provided under the Health Acts.  That has been considered from time to time in the Department.  Indeed, the Health Act of 1947 did grant a right of appeal to the Minister by persons aggrieved by decisions of health authorities in relation to the granting of infectious diseases maintenance allowances.</P>
    <P>That right subsisted for a period of six years.  During that period, about 1,700 appeals were considered.  The vast majority of them, however, were refused.  They were not sustainable appeals.  In view of that, the 1953 Act abolished that right of appeal.  I do not see that, so far, a substantial case has been made for setting up an appeal board to consider cases where persons have been refused the grant of a medical card.  I fear, having regard to the great number of persons involved, that the difficulty of assessing the means and general circumstances in every case would make the work of an appeal board exceedingly onerous, exceedingly difficult and exceedingly expensive.</P>

      <P>In fact, he is the appeal tribunal in relation to most of the administration of the Health Acts in his local authority area.  In most cases, the home assistance officer makes the original assessment of means.  It then goes to the manager, who considers it.  It may be that, if persons are turned down, they can have an appeal made to the manager on their behalf and he will reconsider it.  There is already in fact a sort of appeal tribunal in existence in every local authority area.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  If the manager feels he has not done justice in the first instance, I should be very surprised to learn that he would be reluctant to reverse his decision. After all, there is no guarantee that an appeal officer, who would have to consider three parties&mdash;the State, the local authority and the applicant&mdash; might not have to look at it very much more objectively than a county manager might feel himself able to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kyne also raised&mdash;and so did Deputy O'Higgins&mdash;the question of providing dental services for the middle income group and their children. As the House knows, dental services are being provided at present under the Health Act of 1953, but these are limited to the lower income group, school children and children attending child welfare clinics.  Section 21, dealing with dental services for the middle income group, was brought into force in January, 1955, but regulations to give effect to the provisions were not made.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, the cost is one of the reasons&mdash;a major reason&mdash;why we are not in a position to expand the existing dental services.  In addition <Col N="1338" /> to that, it is doubtful whether the requisite personnel would be available to man the services, even if we were in a position to pay for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne, Deputy Brennan, Deputy Loughman, Deputy Healy and a number of others referred to the position of old people in district mental hospitals.  It is true that there is a great number of senile, old people in these hospitals and we would very much like to see them provided for elsewhere.  In fact, in 1956, my predecessor directed a circular to issue recommending the establishment of psychiatric consultation services which would be made available to authorised medical officers in the case of old people who might be recommended for admission to a mental hospital.  In this circular, it was strongly recommended that old people should not be brought to a district mental hospital without having first been seen in consultation by the hospital psychiatrist.  In certain areas we have already been able to take steps to discharge or to transfer from mental hospital to alternative accommodation suitable people who no longer need constant psychiatric attention.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne also mentioned the question of the revision of the dispensary districts in the Waterford Board of Public Assistance area.  I am glad to say that the Order revising the present Waterford City area dispensary districts to form three dispensary districts, Waterford No. 1, Waterford No. 2 and Waterford No. 3, has been signed and has been sent to the local authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne also pressed that accommodation should be made available for low-grade mental defectives and suggested that this accommodation might be provided in mental hospitals, if possible.  It is rather unusual to have a plea made to provide low-grade mental defectives with accommodation in mental hospitals.  Persons in that class require even greater attention and a different type of care from that which is usually provided in mental hospitals and, indeed, most mental hospitals are not in a position to give the particular specialised care which low-grade defectives require. <Col N="1339" /> Deputy Kyne, Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Brennan, Deputy Faulkner and Deputy Desmond all pressed that accommodation for mentally handicapped children should be increased.  I can say that the needs of these patients are constantly before the Department and I think it can be said that a great deal has been done for them in recent years.  Since 1948, in fact, the accommodation has been almost doubled.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I should say it has been found that accommodation provided for other purpose which becomes redundant has not in general been suitable for these patients, especially for the low-grades for whom, again, as I have said, the need for more accommodation is particularly pressing.  Another difficulty is that there is a lack of properly trained staff to look after these children.  We have, however, within the last 12 months or so, given some encouragement to one or two of the religious orders who undertake this charitable work to go ahead with their plans even in a rather restricted way.  The difficulty is, of course, that we simply have not got the money to enable them to complete the proposals as they were originally envisaged.</P>
    <P>With regard to hospitals in County Waterford, Deputy Kyne suggested that there should be a conference between the county manager, the board of assistance and the medical officers in Waterford at the instance of the Department to try to get agreement upon a hospital programme for Waterford in the next 20 years.  Our experience since 1933 has shown us that, in many instances at any rate, attempts like this at long-term planning do not eventuate in anything tangible except, possibly, an unwise expenditure of money.</P>
    <P>We have already suggested to the three interested local authorities in the Waterford area, the corporation, the county council and the board of assistance, that the 300 bed hospital at Ardkeen should be taken over and used as a county hospital in lieu of the old former workhouse.  That proposal has been before these authorities for well <Col N="1340" /> over a year, but it has been held up by some difference of opinion between them as to the method of allocating cost.  When we see that such an important project as this has been held up on that ground, it is difficult to see what advance could be made at a conference such as Deputy Kyne suggested. If the proposals which have been made to the health authorities in Waterford were to be approved, then I think the needs of the Waterford area for general hospital accommodation could certainly be adequately provided for over the next 20 years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that we should permit the Waterford Corporation to pay a larger contribution to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, all I can say there is that the work which that society undertakes is, perhaps, more properly related to the Department of Justice than it is to that of Health and my Vote is already sufficiently large and I think the local authorities feel that the burdens of the health services are already sufficiently great to make me very circumspect, very reluctant to agree to local authorities accepting any responsibilities which are not clearly within their ambit. If the society in Waterford wishes to secure any further moneys or there is any question of an increased subvention from State funds, I think it will have to address its request to the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne also raised the question of the charges made for persons availing of institutional services.  He said that where a person in the middle income group visits a hospital there are very few instances in which the charge made by the health authorities is less than 10/- a day and that what was originally intended as a maximum charge has become a minimum charge. He also argued that the charge in the case of children should be less than for adults.  As to the statement that the 10/- has become a minimum and not a maximum as originally provided, I have made very exhaustive inquiries and I am quite satisfied there is no foundation in the ultimate for it.</P>
    <P>Different health authorities have different ways of approaching this <Col N="1341" /> problem.  Some have the practice of billing the person with the maximum charge of 10/- a day and leave it to him to prove that that should be considerably reduced.  Others have adopted a different procedure.  It is a matter of local administrative convenience which does not prejudice any person in the end.  It certainly does not mean that anyone is called upon to pay more than he properly should. Every local authority has been questioned, even those who administer this scheme on a most conservative basis and in every case the majority&mdash;and in some cases the vast majority&mdash;of the persons concerned pay very much less than 10/- a day.</P>
    <P>I dealt with some of the points made by Deputy Brennan, in the course of my comments on the points raised by Deputy Kyne.  One point to which I referred, and which I might amplify a little, was the plea that we should provide more beds for mental defectives. The number of beds available in prewar days was about 1,150 and the number provided since the war totals about 1,320.  Some schemes which will provide another 240 beds are nearing completion.  One of the major schemes to be approved, even since the period of financial stringency came to a head, is stage two of the scheme at Cregg House, Sligo, which is administered by La Sagesse Order.  Details of this scheme are not offically settled.  The costs will be considerable and the number of beds will exceed 100.</P>
    <P>It is also possible that a further section of the scheme for a mental defective institution at Delvin, County Westmeath, will be allowed to commence. The problem here, as in the case of all other building projects we have in view, is that we have not got the money.  In the case of La Sagesse Order, there are very special circumstances.  The Order was invited here on a very definite undertaking.  I agreed to allow the building to proceed because I felt that we could not any longer fail to fulfil, even partially, our commitments in that regard.  Apart from this, there is always the primary factor that we need the additional beds for mentally defective children.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan also suggested, dealing <Col N="1342" /> with the general position in mental hospitals, that there should be facilities for segregating volunatry patients from chronic cases.  There is no doubt that there ought to be facilities for segregation in our district mental hospitals, not so much on the basis suggested by Deputy Brennan as on the basis of degree and classification of mental illnesses or disorder.  Unfortunately, a great number of our mental hospitals lack proper facilities for segregating their patients in this manner, due to overcrowding, inadequate planning, inadequate and unsuitable buildings and, most important of all, the lack of a proper admission unit where patients can be examined, treated and classified following reception.</P>
    <P>We have made some progress in that matter recently.  Monaghan County Council have at long last accepted the proposal regarding what was originally built as a treatment unit for the mental hospital, which was then converted into a tuberculosis institution, and which has now become redundant.  At last they have agreed &mdash;and I am grateful to them for it&mdash;to allow this building to revert to the purpose for which it was constructed originally, so that, in the case of the mental hospital administered by the Joint Board for Monaghan and Cavan, they will at last have their admission unit.</P>
    <P>I wish we could do that for the other mental hospitals in the country and it will be one of my aims to do so wherever buildings become redundant and are suitable and are not required for other pressing purposes. It is difficult to say which purposes are the more pressing, where there are so many unfulfilled demands and crying needs to be met.  Wherever a suitable building becomes redundant, I should certainly like, if it could conveniently be adapted, to utilise it as an admission and observation unit in association with the mental hospital.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan also advocated greater subventions to private mental institutions.  All private mental institutions approved under the Health Act of 1953 are eligible to participate in subventions for patients suffering from mental diseases.  Health authorities may send patients to <Col N="1343" /> those institutions and pay the approved capitation rate, six guineas a week, which, except for the absence of the doctor's supplement, is the same as for the voluntary general hospitals. This capitation rate is payable by the health authorities only for the first three months of each eligible patient's stay in the hospital; thereafter, the rate is three guineas a week, which approximates to the national average cost of maintaining and treating a patient in a district mental hospital.</P>
    <P>The health authorities are obliged to make a contribution to eligible persons entering those private institutions on their own arrangements under Section 25 of the Health Act, in additions to those who enter in the ordinary way as Section 15 ceases. The contribution in those cases, as perhaps the House will recollect, is arrived at by deducting 10/- a day from the full appropriate rates.  The contribution payable in the Section 25 cases is £2 16s. for the first three months and then it ceases.</P>
    <P>The difficulty about all these private mental homes and institutions for long-stay patients is that, of course, the local authority could not continue to pay indefinitely a capitation rate which is greater than the actual cost which a local authority would have to bear if the patient were in its own institution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan, I think Deputy Esmonde, and other Deputies, raised the question of dispensary midwives. Undoubtedly a review did take place in 1955 and it disclosed the fact that no fewer than half of the permanent dispensary midwives were dealing with only ten eligible cases a year or less.  In fact, the average fee payable to half of the permanent midwives was £40 per case.  I think it will be seen that we could not allow the position to continue and that it will have to be resolved in a way that will ensure that the local authorities, and the State, get an adequate return for the money paid out by them.  No midwife will be harshly treated.  No definite decision has been taken to dispense <Col N="1344" /> with the services of any permament midwife yet, but undoubtedly some will be compelled to retire although we shall do everything possible, and the local authorities will be asked to do everything possible, to place those who are suitable in other posts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan also raised the question of tubercular patients in the Civil Service.  It is not correct to say that if a condidate puts on his form that he is a discharged tubercular patient he will find himself debarred from a post although he has a clean bill of health.  The position is that the candidate undergoes a medical examination and if the examining doctor is satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect that the candidate will be able to render regular and efficient service in the future he will be certified as medically fit.  Naturally when the candidate has been in a sanatorium recently, say within a period of six to 12 months previously, the certifying doctor would in most cases be reluctant to give a qualifying certificate.  In such cases, however, the candidate may appeal and he is re-examined by a board of three specialists in tuberculosis, and if the board passes him as fit he is certified for the position.  May I say that a number of persons who have suffered from tuberculosis have secured admission to the Civil Service under the procedure which I have outlined? The position with regard to candidates for admission to the Garda Síochána, however, is slightly different because the Garda authorities must bear in mind that the ordinary duties of a Civic Guard call for a better health history than in the case of those admitted to the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan also raised the very vexed question of the site for the new hospital in County Donegal.  That is a very tangled skein and there has been a great deal of chopping and changing. The position is that a hospital is now being built at Dungloe.  After opening the Dungloe Hospital, we shall try if we can find a suitable use for the old district hospital, but it cannot be run as a general hospital and it cannot be run as a maternity hospital in association with the tuberculosis unit.</P>

      <P>As I say, it is a very tangled skein and I do not think the years have made it any easier.  The Dungloe hospital is a new, modern hospital built at considerable expense. The Glenties hospital has been there for quite a while, but we cannot have the two running together.  We should like to find a use for the Glenties hospital but it will have to be a use which will be economically justifiable.  It all depends on the extent to which the Glenties people are prepared to modify their ideas of what they think they should have.  We could use the existing building in Glenties as a tuberculosis unit and I think perhaps that would be the best and most suitable use to which to put it and one which would be most advantageous to the hospital services in the county as a whole.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moher, in the course of his speech, referred to something which I myself noted with a great deal of concern&mdash;an article which appeared in the journal of the Irish Medical Association last month, headed &ldquo;Ten Fruitful Years&rdquo;.  It has really put me in a quandary.  In dealing with the Irish Medical Association I do not know whether I am dealing with a professional organisation or a political organisation.  I trust I shall be able to feel that this body is concerned purely with the professional side of medicine and not with the political aspects of the health controversy which, I hope, are dead and buried.  It does not help a Minister, who has had some responsibility for the promotion of health legislation in this country since 1941, to find that he is accused of having tried to socialise medicine, when the Government and the Oireachtas enacted the Health Act of 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, having regards to the fact that the Health Act of 1953 is now accepted as the basis of our health services, has been worked by all Parties in the House and has been approved by the votes of the people in the last <Col N="1346" /> general election, it is about time that statements like this ceased to appear in a journal which professes to be concerned with the lofter professional issues.</P>
    <P>This is the statement to which Deputy Moher referred and to which I take the greatest exception:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The history of the past five years is fresh within the memories of all, and needs no recapitulation here. But that the influence of the association which helped to bring down a Government determined to &lsquo;socialise&rsquo; the practice of medicine in odedience to its ukase in 1953 was the outcome of the five preceding years of building is a fair and just conclusion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If I were to approach the problems of the medical profession in this country in that frame of mind, I might say: &ldquo;Well, all right; you did bring us down in 1953 but we are back.  How do you expect us to deal with you now?&rdquo; I do not propose to do that, but that is the sort of natural reaction which statements of that description&mdash; quite unjustified statements&mdash;evoke. The Irish Medical Association had as much to do with the defeat of the Government in 1954 as a cuckoo's spit might have had.  Rather was it the price of the pint and not the fact that we were proposing to provide better medical services for the people which defeated the Fianna Fáil Government in 1954.</P>
    <P>However, it is up to those who control this association and those who are on the councils of the association to bear in mind that they are not in any position to dominate the political life of this country.  If they wish to regard their professional organisation as a political weapon to be used against any Government of which I am a member in relation to any of the matters which may come to issue between us, it will be so much the worse for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I am now going to defer to the Deputy's prudent concern.  I was very annoyed.  I am perfectly certain that if these statements were written when the Deputy was in office, he would have taken the same view.  I know that when Deputy O'Higgins was in office as Minister for Health, he had to deal with many of these matters.  All of us in that Department have to keep in mind the rightful desires of the professional class, on the one hand, and the needs of the people who are our primary concern on the other.  Having said so much, I will take the Deputy's advice and move on.</P>
      <P>There were many other matters referred to.  Deputy Carty mentioned the overcrowding in the Galway Regional Hospital.  Overcrowding is, of course, a relative term.  There was genuine overcrowding in the old Central Hospital which was a former workhouse.  I do not think that there need be any overcrowding in the Galway Regional Hospital now.  We are naturally endeavouring to make the most economic use we possibly can of the space available and we are not in a position to build.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must provide for those patients who are in the need of hospital accommodation, hospital beds and treatment. We just simply cannot allow ourselves in this matter to be thwarted by an over-liberal and uneconomic use of space.  As the matter has been raised in connection with this particular institution I must say that in my opinion there can be a much more rapid turnover of beds there.  A survey of the position was made recently.  The duration of bed occupancy in some cases was really startling.  There were, for instance, last February 106 patients in <Col N="1348" /> the hospital who had been there for two months or more.  One Patient has been there for six years; another for three and a half years; five for about two years; nine for 18 months; 17 for nine months and the remainder for varying periods up to six months. Twenty-two of these patients were 70 years and over and there were 12 between the ages of 60 and 70 years. That is one of the reasons why there is a shortage of beds in this magnificient hospital in Galway which was erected at considerable expense in order to ensure that the needs of those who genuinely required treatment in an acute hospital should be catered for.</P>
    <P>We just cannot allow that position to continue.  While there may be some degree of inconvenience imposed upon certain persons, nevertheless, we have to consider the fact that additional beds can be installed in the hospital without any great detriment to the comfort and convenience of the patients.  It is the comfort and convenience of the hospital patients which have to be my first concern.  I will do nothing, of course, which would make it difficult for members of the staff there to discharges their duties properly and effectively, but we have to have a degree of understanding and a degree of co-operation in these matters which I hope will be forthcoming.  There are many other matters which Deputy Carty raised which I will not deal with now but about which I shall write to him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan referred to the demolition of the central block of the Galway hospital and wished to know why it was that tenders had not been advertised for it.  When a contractor is on the site and if there is something which might be described as ancillary to the works upon which he is engaged but which is not covered by the original contract, it is quite a usual thing that he be requested to undertake this extra work and to give him the contract, provided his price is reasonable.  In this case, the old block was demolished at a cost of £5,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan asked what would have been the result if the building had been offered for sale and went on to suggest that, instead of the local <Col N="1349" /> authority losing £5,000, they would have gained £5,000.  That is a very doubtful proposition.</P>

      <P>Tairgim:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Go ndeonfar suim nach mó ná £292,500 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfas chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31ú lá de Márta, 1959, le haghaidh Tuarastal agus Costas Roinn na Gaeltachta maille le Deontais le haghaidh Tithe agus Ildeontais-i-gCabhair.</P>
      <P>Taispeánann an meastachán don bhliain seo breis de £51,560 glan thar an soláthar a rinneadh don bhliain seo caite.  Chífear gur méadú sa tsoláthar do na Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin is mó faoi ndear an méadú sin ach taobh amuigh de sin tá athrú bunúsach sa Mheastachán seo de bharr Bord neamhspleách a bheith bunaithe do na tionscail tuaithe&mdash;sé sin, in ionad soláthar sonrach a dhéanamh do chuspóirí éagsúla na dtionscal mar a deintí roimhe seo tá soláthar do Dheontas-igCabhair don Bhord.  Tiocfaidh mé ar ais chuige seo níos déanaí ach ba mahaith liom a mhíniú don Dáil conas mar d'athraigh bunú an Bhoird foirm an Mheastacháin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le Fo-mhírchinn A, B Agus C, chífrar nach bhfuil soláthar dá dhéanamh i mbliana Íaoi Fho-mhírcheann A do phostanna éagsúla cléireachais agus teichiúla a bhíodh ann do na tionscail tuaithe.  Tá formhór <Col N="1353" /> na nOifigeach a bhí fostaithe sna postanna sin tugtha ar iasacht sealadach don Bhord.  Tá soláthar i gcnapshuimeanna faoi Fho-mhírcheann A do thuarastail na nOifigeach sin agus tá soláthar faoi Fho-mhírechinn B agus C dá gcostais taistil agus costais teagmhasacha a bhaineann leo, ach chífear go bhfuil soláthar freisin faoi Fho-mhírecheann R. 5 chun a geaithfear ar na hOifigigh sin atá ar iasacht d'aisghnóthú ón mBord.  Mar sin, ní bheidh de mhuirear glan ar Vóta na Roinne ach tuarastaií agus costais na nOifigeach atá fostaithe ar obair na Roinne féin.</P>
    <P>Maindir leis na tionscail tuaithe, a bhíodh faoi stiúrú mo Roinne-se roimhe seo, mar is eol do na Teachtaí eitheadh an tAcht Um Thionscail na Gaeltachta anuraidh.  I bhfeidhmiú na gcumhacht a tugadh dom faoi Alt 2 den Acht sin, tá an chéad lá d'Aibreán, 1958, ceaptha agam mar an lá bunaithe, agus dá réir sin tá rialú agus bainistíocht na dTionscal aistrithe anois chuig Bord ar a nglaoítear Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin, ní déantar siláthar i meastachán mo Roinne do na tionscail tuaithe amhail a rinneadh sna blianta roimhe seo.  Ina ionad, tá soláthar á dhéanamh fé Fho-mhírcheann D sa mheastachán seo le haghaidh deontas-i-gcabhair de mhéid £220,000 chun a chur ar chumas an Bhoird a chuid dualgas a chomhlíonadh.  Tuigfear, ar nodóigh, gur breis an deontas-i-gcabhair ar aon teacht-isteach is féidir a bheas ar fáil don Bhord ó dhíol déantúisí na dtionscal tuaithe.  Roimhe seo taispeántaí an teacht-isteach sin i meastachán mo Roinne mar leithreasaí-i-gcabhair&mdash;Fomhírcheann R.</P>
    <P>Fé mar a socraítear faion Acht, cuirfidh an Bord at fáil dom in am tráth cuntais bhliantúla iniúchtha maraon le tuarascáil ar a n-imeachta i geaitheamh na bliana, agus leagfar cóipeanna de na cuntais agus den tuarascáil bhliantúil faoi bhtáid gach Tí den Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Le linn na bliana atá thart bhí méadú i ndíol earraí de gach tionscal. Mhéadaigh díolacháin bréidín de níos mó ná triocha-sé míle punt.  Mhéadaigh díolacháin earraí maisín-chniotála de níos mó ná fiche-seacht míle punt. <Col N="1354" /> Mhéadaigh díolacháin earraí na dtionscal láimhe&mdash;sé sin láimh-chniotáil, cróise agus bróidnéireacht&mdash;de níos mó ná trí mhíle déag punt, agus, i gcás ná mBréagán, bhí méadú de níos mó ná hocht míle punt ann.</P>
    <P>Mar sin bhí méadú iomlán de níos mó ná ochtó-sé míle punt sna díolacháin, uile, sa bhliain seo caite.  Chuir an méadú sin na díolacháin suag go dtí £580,000 i gcomparáid le tuairim £494,000 don bhliain roimhe sin.  Tríd síos bhí cúrsaí trádála na dtionscal tuaithe go sásúil i rith na bliana.  Maidir leis an scéal amach anseo, is deacair é a mheas go cruinn ag an am seo.  Bhí deacrachtaí ar leith i gcúrsaí díolacháin an bhréidín sna Stáit Aontaithe toisc an dleacht ar éadach olla agus uarstaid a bheith ardaithe ó 25% go dtí 45% ó mhí Iúil seo caite.  Tá áthas orm a rá, áfach, gur éirigh linn an dleacht ardaithe sin d'fháil maolaithe go dtí 30% i gcás an bhréidín láimh-fhite tré bhithin ionadaí a cuireadh go Washington chun cás an tionscail bhréidín láimh-fhite a phléadáil i Mí Nollag seo caite.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na tionscail torthaí mara déantar soláthar dóibh fé Fho-mhírcheann E, agus tá an soláthar beagnach mar an gcéanna agus a bhí sé anuraidh.  Clúdaítear ann ceannach agus seachadadh slata mara agus carraigín a díoltar le Arramara Teoranta, gnólucht ar leis an Stát formhór na scaireanna ann.  Tá monarcha ag an ngnólucht seo i gCill Chiaráin, Conamara, ina ndéantar na slata mara a thriomú agus a mheilt.  Déanann an gnólucht an mbin d'onnmhuiriú dá éis sin faoi chonradh atá acu le gnólucht iasachta.  Déantar an carraignín d'ullmhú do mhargaí éagsúla sa Bhreatain agus ar an Mór-Roinn.  Tá breis agus fiche duine ar fostú lán-aimseartha ag an ngnólucht seo.</P>
    <P>Fé mar is eol don Tigh cheana, leagtar cuntais an ghnóluchta, maille le tuarascáil bhliantúil ar a chuid oibre, ar Bhord na Dála gach bliain.</P>
    <P>Faoi Fho-Mhírcheann F, déantar soláthar le haghaidh deontas faoi Achta na dTithe (Gaeltacht).  Sa bhliain 1957-58, tháinig laghdú, a raibh coinne leis, ar an méid oibre a rinneadh faoi na hAchta.  I dtús na bliana sin, <Col N="1355" /> hí ceist ann faoi na deontais forlíontacha ó na húdaráis áitiúla a bheith ar fáil agus, mar gheall air sin, bhí o leor deontaithe nár thosnaigh ar an bair go dtí go raibh sé ró-dhéanach le go bhféadfaí íocaíocht a dhéanamh leo sa bhliain airgeadais sin.  Ar an ábhar sin, meastar gur mó an caiteachas a heas ann i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Is féidir nach mbeidh na deontais rlíontacha ar fáil ó na húdaráis áitiúla uile, ach ní braithfear a thoradh sin go hiomlán sa bhliain airgeadais seo ach amháin i gcás líon na n-iarratas úr&mdash;is dóigh go mbeidh laghdú mór orthu sin.  On méid cásanna atá ceadaithe cheana féin, ní dealraitheach go mbeidh aon laghdú ar an obair a déanfar.  Sna cúrsaí uile, ceaptar gur leor an £90,000 atá á sholáthar i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Sa bhliain airgeadais seo caite, críochnaíodh ós cionn 200 tithe nua, feabhsaíodh beagán níos mó ná sin, cuireadh saoráidí séarachais agus soláthar uisce príobháideach ar fáil i gceithre fichid sean-tithe agus rinneadh leathnúchán speisialta le haghaidh cuairteoirí ar chúig cinn déag de thithe.</P>
    <P>Tugadh sonraí áirithe, i ndáil le Meastachán na bliana seo caite, i dtaobh na scéimeanna éagsúla a bhfuil soláthar á dhéanamh dóibh faoi Fho-Mhírcheann G. Ní raibh ach scéim amháin díobh siúd .i.  Scéim na mBóthar Gaeltachta, a bhféadfaí bheith ag súil leis go gcuirfí i gcrích go tapaidh í.  Maidir leis na scéimeanna eile, ba éigin do na húdaráis áitiúla nó do na dreamanna eile a bhí i gceist roinnt mhaith ullmhúcháin a dhéanamh roimh ré ina leith sa chuid is mó de na cásanna. Ar an ábhar sin, cé gur tharla i gcás cuid mhaith tograí go raibh an pointe sroiste acu, roimh dheireadh na bliana airgeadais seo caite, ina bhféadfaí iad a cheadú go sonrach, ní raibh ach fíor-bheagán tograí ann inar ghá aon íocaíocht a dhéanamh ina leith.  D'fhág san gurbh í an tsuim £45,000 a híocadh i leith Scéim na mBóthar Gaeltachta an príomh-chaiteachas as an bhfo-mhírcheann seo sa bhliain 1957-58. Maidir leis na scéimeanna eile a ndéantar soláthar dóibh faoin bhfo-mhírcheann is léir, ar na cúinsí a <Col N="1356" /> luadh cheana, gur sa bhaliain airgeadais reatha a braithfear muirear na scéimeanna sin don chéad uair.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú £48,000 déanta ó anuraidh ar an soláthar faoi Fho-Mhírcheann G sa bhliain airgeadais reatha, sé sin, £125,000 i gcomparáid le £77,000.  Tá gá leis an méadú sin chun go bhféadfar cuid de na scéimeanna a tugadh isteach cheana a leathnú agus chun go mbeidh airgead ar fáil le haghaidh roinnt scéimeanna nua nach ndearnadh aon tsocrú cinnte ina dtaobh faoi mheastachán na bliana seo caite.</P>
    <P>Seacht gcinn de scéimeanna Íeabhsúcháin atá i gceist i bhFo-Mhírcheann G anois.  Is iad seo a leanas na scéimeanna:&mdash; (1)  Scéim trínar féidir do Roinn na Gaeltachta deontas 100% den chostas a thabhairt do na hUdaráis Aitiúla d'fhonn feabhas a chur ar mhion-bhóithre contae sa Ghaeltacht, a cheapas an Roinn chuige sin tar éis comhairle a ghlacadh leis na húdaráis áitiúla sin agus leis an Roinn Rialtais Aitiúil.</P>
    <P>Táthar ar intinn feidhm na scéime sin a leathnú sa bhliain airgeadais reatha le go bhféadfar soláthar den tsórt céanna a dhéanamh i leith an chineál bóthair ar a dtugtar bóthar áise .i. bóithre nach mbíonn aon bhaint ag na húdaráis áitiúla leo.  Maidir leis na bóithre áirithe sin, is í an Roinn a thoghfas iad i gcomhairle le hOifig na Scéimeanna Fostaíochta Speisialta agus is ar an Oifig sin a bheas an cúram i dtaobh na hoibreacha a chur i gcrích tar éis a gceaduithe.</P>
    <P>(2)  Scéim trína gcuírtear ar chumas na Roinne deontaisí a thabhairt d'údaráis áitiúla mar chabhair chun mion-scéimeanna uisce-sholáthair a chur i gcrích sa Ghaeltacht.  Is í an Roinn a thoghann na tograí, tar éis dí comhairle a ghlacadh leis na húdaráis áitiúla agus leis an Roinn Rialtais Aitiúil.</P>
    <P>Ó tugadh Meastachán na bliana seo caite isteach táthar tar éis feidhm na scéime sin a leathnú le go bhféadfaidh an Roinn deontaisí 25% den chostas measta a thabhairt freisin i gcás mórscéimeanna, mó scéimeanna réigiúnacha, uisce-sholáthair agus séarachais sa <Col N="1357" /> Ghaeltacht.  Tugtar an deontas sin 25% i dteannta an ghnáth-chúnaimh airgid a chuireann an Roinn Rialtais Aitiúil ar fáil i gcásanna den tsórt sin, agus toghtar na tograí ar an mbealach céanna ina dtoghtar na mionscéimeanna uisce-sholáthair a luadh cheana.</P>
    <P>(3)  Scéim trína gcuirtear ar chumas na Roinne deontaisí 100% den chostas a chur ar fáil i leith muir-oibreacha áirithe sa Ghaeltacht ar choinníoll go mbeidh na húdaráis áitiúla iomchuí sásta cothabháil na n-oibreacha sin a ghlacadh mar chúram orthu féin tar éis a ndéanta.  Fágtar faoi Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí, de ghnáth, tograí den tsórt sin a chur i gcrích.</P>
    <P>(4) Scéim trína gcuirtear ar chumas na Roinne deontaisí, nach mó ná 80% den choctas de ghbáth, a thabhairt d'údaráis áitiúla, nó do chomhluchtaí nó coistí iontaofa eile, mar chabhair chun áiseanna éagsúla, mar shampla, páirceanna imeartha, cúirteanna liathróide láimhe agus a leithéid, a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Ní mór na heagrais sin a bheith sásta cothabháil na saoráidí sin a ghlacadh orthu féin tar éis iad a bheith ar fáil.</P>
    <P>(5)  Scéim trína geuirtear cúnamh airgid agus cúnamh eile ar fáil d'iarratasóirí oiriúnacha sa Ghaeltacht mar chabhair chun cránacha a cheannach agus a bheathú.  Tugadh sonraí na scéime don Dáil cheana agus táim sásta go bhfuil ag éirí go maith leis. Dá chomhartha sin, tá an Coimisiún Muc agus Bagúin tar éis níos mó ná céad go leith cránacha a dháiliú ar iarratasóirí faoin scéim.  Tugtar síolta agus ábhair leasuithe ar théarmaí speisialta do na hiarratasóirí a ceadaítear faoin scéim.</P>
    <P>(6)  Scéim trína bhféadfaidh an Roinn airgead a chur ar fáil d'fhonn Scéim na dTithe Gloine sa Ghaeltacht a leathnú. Tá ar intinn ag an Roinn, i gcomhar leis an Roinn Talmhaíochta, suas le £50,000 a chur ar fáil chun tuilleadh tithe a mbeidh gléasanna téimh ionta a thógáil agus chun gléasanna téimh a chur i roinnt eile tithe atá ann cheana.</P>
    <P>(7)  Scéim chun cabhrú le meánscolaíocht sa Ghaeltacht.  Mar gheall ar an easpa meánscolaíochta sa Ghaeltacht, is beag an bhreith a bhíos ag <Col N="1358" /> buachaillí agus cailíní óga sa Ghaeltachta ar an oideachas a bhéarfadh postanna rathúla dhóibh sa tseirbhís phoibilí, sna gairmeacha ná, i gcoitinne, i saol tráchatála na tíre.  Agus ar an taobh eile, is cailliúint don Stát gan cainteoirí dúchais oilte a bheith i roinnt postanna den tsórt sin.  Chun an scéal sin a leigheas, tá scéim ceadaithe anois trína bhféadfaidh Roinn na Gaeltachta deontaisí airgid a thabhairt, ar choinníollacha áirithe, chun cóiríocht meánscolaíochta a sholáthar, a fheabhsú nó a leathnú sa Ghaeltacht.  Fé mar is eol don Dáil, ní thugann an Stát cabhair den tsórt sin le haghaidh meánscolaíochta i gcoitinne, agus is eisceacht ar fad cás na Gaeltachta sa tslí sin.</P>
    <P>I dteannta na scéimeanna atá luaite agam, tá tograí éagsúla eile ullamh nó á n-ullmhú ag an Roinn i gcomhairle leis an Roinn Talmhaíochta agus leis na coistí talmhaíochta contae.  Mar shampla, tá scéim trialach ceadaithe chun subhanna talún d'fhás i leith-inis an Daingin i gCo.  Chiarraighe agus tá Coiste Talmhaíochta Chontae Chiarraighe ag féachaint i ndiaidh na hoibre. Tá scéim trialach eile ar siúl faoi choimirce na Roinne Talmhaíochta in Árainn féachaint an fúidir fásóga inniúin a thairgeadh ann.  Má éiríonn go maith leis na scéimeanna trialacha sin, leathnófar go dtí áiteanna oiriúnacha eile iad ar fud na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá míle tunt á sholáthar arís i mbliana chun deontais bheaga a thabhairt le haghaidh imeachtaí cultúrtha agus sóisialacha sa Ghaeltacht. Níor baineadh mórán feidhme as an gcúnamh seo anuraidh, ach is cosúil go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta ag cur tuilleadh suime anois ann agus go mbeidh éileamh ar an soláthar iomlán i mbliana.  Cheana féin tá roinnt tograí a bhaineas le fearaistí stáitse, oirnéisí ceoil, feiseanna agus a leithéid faoi bhreithniú ag an Roinn.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol do na Teachtaí, do haistríodh roinnt seirbhísí chun mo Roinnse ón Roinn Oideachais.  Is é an ceann is tábhachtaí orthu sin ná an bónas £5 a tugtar faoi scéim a bunaíodh i 1934, do thuismitheoirí nó caomhnóirí sa Ghaeltacht nó sa Bhreac-Ghaeltacht, i leith páistí scoile leo idir 7-17 mbliana d'aois, arb í an Ghaeilge teanga a <Col N="1359" /> dteaghlaigh agus a labhrann í go líofa nádúrtha.  Is é cuspóir na scéime seo an Ghaeilge a chothú agus a choinneáil mar theanga teaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht agus níl aon amhras ach go bhfuil an-leas á dhéanamh ag an scéim chuige sin.  Faoi láthair, tá tuairim 4,600 teaghlach ag fáil an deontais i leith tuairim 10,000 páiste ar fad.</P>
    <P>Faoi Fho-mhírcheann O den Mheastachán, tugtar cúnamb airgid do choistí áitiúla, faoi scéim a bunaíodh i 1936 chun scoláireachtaí saoire sa Ghaeltacht a thabhairt do pháistí ó áiteanna taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Sa bhliain 1957, cuireadh os cionn trí chéad páistí chun na Gaeltachta faoin scéim.  I moliana, méadófar an deontas ó £3 10s. go £4 10s. in aghaidh gach scoláireachta, i gcás coistí i gCathair nó i gContae Bhaile Atha Cliath, agus ó £3 go £4, i gcás coistí eile, ar an gcoinníoll&mdash;a bhí ann cheana&mdash;nach mbeidh an deontas, in aon chás, níos mó ná leath an chostais a bhainfeas leis an scoláireacht.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar faoi Fho-mhírcheann P. do Cúnamh Teicniúil agus mar a chífear ó Fho-mhírcheann R. 6 beido an t-airgead a caithfear ar an gCúnamh Teicniúil seo le fáil ar ais ón gcuntas speisialta den deontas Mheiriceánach. Sé an cúnamh teicniúil atá i gceist ná comhairleoirí bainistíochta d'fhostú chun eagraíocht na dtionscal tuaithe a scrúdú go hiomlán agus chun scéim ath-eagraíochta iomláine a chur le chéile d'thonn riaradh na dtionscal a chóiriú do réir cleachta bainistíochta éifeachtúla nua-aimseartha, agus tá san áireamh ann freisin soláthar do chúrsaí tréineála, sa bhaile agus thar lear, don bhfoirinn teicniúil agus oibrithe nua-thagtha a fostaítear sna Tionscail Tuaithe.</P>
    <P>Ar an 14 Meitheamh seo caite shínigh an tAire Gnóthaí Eachtracha agus an tAmbasadóir Meiriceánach Comh-Aontú leis na Stáit Aontaithe um Chúnamh Teicniúil agus chlúdaigh an Comh-Aontú sin an cúnamh teicniúil seo.</P>
    <P>Fé mar a cuireadh in iúl don Dáil aimsir na Meastachán anuraidh tá airgead eile ar fáil don Roinn seachas <Col N="1360" /> an t-airgead a luaitear go sonrach i meastachán na Roinne, is é sin an t-airgead a cuireadh ar fáil as Cionroinnt na Gaeltachta den Chiste Forbartha Náisiúnta.  Fé mar adúradh anuraidh cuireadh suim £30,000 i leataoibh as an gCiste sin le go bhféadfaí deontaisí 25% den chostas measta a thairiscint do na húdaráis áitiúla i leith scéimcanna uisce-sholáthair agus séarachais sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht.  Táthar tar éis an t-airgead sin uile a dháileadh na Gaeltachta.  Maidir le scéim na mbád iascaigh ar cuireadh airgead ar fáil di freisin as an gCiste céanna, táthar tar éis cúig dáid mhóra, ar £12,000 an ceann tuairim, a chur ar fáil faoin scéim.  Ina theannta sin, tá tosnaithe anois ar scéim chun báid bheaga inneall-chumhachta&mdash;ó naoi dtroigh déag go dtí sé troigh ar fhichid &mdash;a chur ar fáil agus tá suim £10,000 curtha i leataoibh chun na críche sin. Tá socrú ginearálta déanta cheana fein chun ocht gcinn de na báid sin a chur ar fáil ar chostas £3,500,tuairim, agus tá ceithre cinn de na dáid sin á dtógáil i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>Tuigfear ón méid atá ráite agam go dtí seo, sílim, go bhfuil bonn leaghta anois ar a bhféadfar obair na Roinne a bhunú as seo amach.  Chífear go bhfuil socruithe déanta cheana féin trínar féidir don Roinn cúnaimh airgid a chur ar fáil do thrí cinn de na heagrais is tábhachtaí ó thaobh fostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht, is é sin, na comhairlí contae, Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí agus Oifig na Scéimeanna Fostaíochta Speisialta. De dhroim na socruithe sin, féadfar an caighdéan maireachtála d'árdú, do réir a chéile, trí Íheabhas a churar mhion-bhóithre contae, bóithre áise, saoráidí uisce-sholáthair agus séarachais, muir-oibreacha agus taitneamhachtaí i gcoitinne.  Tá buíochas ag dul do na hudaráis áitiúla, do na hOifigí Stáit atá luaite agam agus don Roinn Rialtais Aitiúil as ucht na cabhrach a Íuarthas go fial uathu ag ullmhú scéimeanna fiúntacha don Ghaeltacht. Ba mhaith lion, chomh maith, buíochas a ghabháil leis an Roinn Talmhaíochta agus leis na coistí contae talmhaíochta agus leis na gCoimisiún Muc agus Bbágún as ucht <Col N="1361" /> na cabhrach a fuarthas uathu san freisin, go háirithe i ndáil le Scéim na Muc.  Is mór agam, treisin, an comhoibriú atá áfháil ag ionadaithe áitiúla na Roinne ar fud na Gaeltachta. Bhéarfaidh na hIonadaithe sin gach cúnamh do na heagrais áitiúla chun moltaí fiúntacha d'ullmhú agus dúanfar gach iarracht sa Roinn chun moltaí den tsórt sin a bhreithniún go báigiúil chomh fada agus is acmhainn don Roinn é.</P>

      <P>Is gairid an scéal seo.  Níl mórán sa Meastachán ar fíu trácht air.  Níl aon rud nua ann ach amháin an méid atá curtha síos faoi uimhir a seacht, leathanach a 4.  Is rud nua é sin. Molaim an méid sin ach ní féidir liom dul níos faide.  Thuigeamar &mdash;thuig mise, ar chuma ar bith, agus thuig go leor daoine eile&mdash;go raibh rudaí móra ag teacht, ag éisteacht linn le oráid an Taoisigh i Roscomáin le linn an olltoghcháin.  Bhí sé i m'áit féin an oíche roimhe sin ach is beag baol go ndéarfadh sé na rudaí céanna sa cheantar sin a dúirt sé le haghaidh Roscomáin.</P>
      <P>Tá Aire nua againn anois agus conas atá an scéal?  An bhfuil sé comh maith agus a cheapamar ó oráid an Taoisigh i Roscomáin?  An bhfuil aon rud mór á dhéanamh?  Tada&mdash;díreach mar atá an scéal 'sa Roinn Tailte agus eile. Níl aon rud nua i Scéim na Muc ach amháin an abairt íontach atá ar an bhfoirm iarratais &ldquo;Slán folláin, aon chráin amháin.&rdquo; An bhfuil an Ghaeltacht slán folláin?  Níl.  An bhfuil Roinn na Gaeltachta Slán folláin?  Níl.</P>
      <P>Conas atá ceist na Gaeilge i Roinn na Gaeltachta?  Tá scéal greannmhar ag dul thart i gcuid den Ghaeltacht ar thug an tAire cuairt uirthi.  Tar éis do na leanaí bheith ag éisteacht leis an Aire ag caint ina dteanga dhúchais thosnaigh siad ag imirt cluiche áirithe a bhíos á imirt acu anois i gelós na scoile, cluiche mar &ldquo;Ring a Ring a Rosy,&rdquo; mar adéarfá.

        <i>Ban on Irish</i>
      </P>
      <P>&ldquo;Top officials in the Gaeltacht Department in Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin, are faced with a big problem. Most of the junior officers, including typists, young clerks and messengers, have refused to speak Irish.</P>
      <P>Even though they work in a Department that does all its work through Irish, there is no way of forcing them to use the language.</P>
      <P>The trouble started when a high official of the Department got himself a new secretary who has no knowledge of Irish.</P>
      <P>The juniors claim that her pay is much higher than that earned by them, and that it is unfair to expect them to use a language which they speak with difficulty, when she is allowed to use English only.</P>
      <P>Threats have been made by Gaeltacht Department bosses but so far no disciplinary measures have been taken.</P>
      <P>Said one official &lsquo;I cannot condone this protest publicly but I sympathise with the juniors.  They are certainly not being given a good example&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An bhfuil aon fhírinne sa scéal sin? Cé hé an duine a thóg isteach an Béarlóir in ionad Gaeilgeora sa phost sin?  An Stát-sheirbhíseach é, nó an é an tAire féin é.  Ba mhaith liomsa é sin a fháil amach agus ba mhaith leis an Teach seo agus leis an tír go léir an t-eolas sin a fnáil amach.  Tá dualga <Col N="1363" /> ar an Aire a insint don Teach seo cé thóg isteach an duine seo, cé hé, nó cé hí, an duine a tógadh isteach agus, ina theanta sin, tá dualgas air a insint dúinn an raibh sé, nó sí, ag obair roimhe sin.  An bhfuil sé, nó sí, ina rúnaí pearsanta?  Cad é an saghas oibre a bhíonn ar siúil aige nó aici?  An féidir leis nó leí obair rúnaí phríobháidigh a dhéanamh?  Cad na thaobh go raibh sé riachtanach rúnaí pearsanta a bheith ag an Aire nuair a bhí rúnaí príobháideach agus clóscríbhneoir príobháideach aige cheana féin&mdash;agus sin sa Roinn is lua dá raibh riamh sa Stát?</P>
    <P>Tuigim ó chaint an Aire go bhfuil laghdú £28,000 ar an méid atá le caitheamh ar Oifig na Gaeltachta.  Ní hé sin an taon drochscéal amháin, agus ní aontaím leis an méid a dúirt an tAire le linn a chuid óráide.  Is náire é agus is mór an náire é.  Tá fhios ag gach aon duine a bhfuil eolas aige ar an nGaeltacht go bhfuil na mílte rudaí le déanamh ann.  Tá mórán daoine ag tógáil tithe go fóill inti, ach mar sin féin tá laghdú de £28,000 sa Meastachán seo.</P>
    <P>Bórd atá i nGaeltarra Éireann anois. Níraibh focal le rá ag an Aire mar gheall ar an mbórd seo.  Cén saghas bóird é? Cén saghas daoine atá ar an mbórd sin? Cad na thaobh gur toghadh iad, sa chéad dul síos?  Cé tá i gceannas ar an mBórd?  An fear éifeachtach é?  Níl fhios agam, níl fhios ag an Teach, agus níl fhios ag muintir na tíre.  Cad na thaobh?</P>
    <P>Ag labhairt dom anois ar nithe a bhaineas le Gaeltarra Éireann, is gá dhom leanúint i mBéarla ós rud é nach dtuigeann go leor daoine an méid atá á dhéanamh sa Roinn seo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I now resume in English, because I have things to tell this country in which, in spite of the impression people try to give by sniggering and sneering, in spite of the hypocritical efforts to prove otherwise, there are still people who would not understand Irish and to whom the intermation could not be conveyed through the medium of Irish.</P>
      <P>I want to know from the Minister what this board is like.  Who are the personnel?  What are their special qualifications, political and geographical, not to mention their business qualifications?  I want to know what sort of direction has been given to them by the Minister and his officials and in what manner they are expected to tackle this job.  I want to know also how far the affairs of Gaeltarra Eireann have been cleaned up before anybody was asked to take it over.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that there is a matter in relation to Gaeltarra Eireann which is being investigated by the police.  I had better make a clear what that matter is.  It relates simply and solely to charges made by me in this House in February last in relation to fraud in wool sales by description and by weights.  All consideration of that matter and all reference to it I shall leave in abeyance, the matter being not <i>sub judice</i>, but the subject matter of police investigation.  I shall accordingly leave it, lest it might be prejudiced in any way by what I might say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to warn the Minister and the House that this is an investigation which can have only one result&mdash;a successful conclusion in the eradication of fraud.  When I examine matters that have taken place in the last few months, I want to warn the public what they are likely to expect from a Government&mdash;directed investigation and a Government&mdash;directed inquiry.  It will be recalled that, in the course of my allegations last June on this Estimate and in the course of subsequent allegations, similar and new, repeated by me here, the Minister for <Col N="1365" /> Education, when acting Minister for the Gaeltacht, said he had investigated fully and found there was nothing wrong.  The present Minister, leaping to the defence and following in the footsteps of his predecessor, declared&mdash; and it was a banner headline in a daily paper&mdash;&ldquo;There are no scandals in the Department of the Gaeltacht.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but the Minister asked that this motion be adjourned in order that charges of a criminal nature made by me be investigated. I made a charge against an agent who put linen into Gaeltarra Eireann of a type and quality never used by Gaeltarra Eireann, got a credit note for tweed but had to take it back. That is fraud.  That is not being investigated. So that every charge made by me is not being investigated by the police.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I can pursue a matter that was investigated and is finished.  I want the House and the country to listen to this tale.  Over the period of the last year, during the Minister's term, a gentleman in the public service, in the Department for which the Minister is responsible and in the Gaeltarra Eireann section of it, took the nearest cut.  He did not bother converting tweed or knitwear, by percentage or otherwise, into money.  He took the money.  He was suspended, very properly, by his superior officers. He confessed to the police to having embezzled a sum approaching £300.  He was brought before the District Court in this city by summons on ten counts. That happened in December last.</P>
      <P>The matter was adjourned&mdash;very properly, in my view&mdash;in order to give him an opportunity of paying back the money.  In fairness to him, it must be placed on record that he did pay back every penny of it.  He lost his job.  In my view, that was sufficient punishment. The matter was in the hands of the police and in January, when the whole case had to be dealt with by the district justice either summarily or that he be returned for trial, we had the extraordinary spectacle of police officers standing mute in the District Court in this city and, by the direction of somebody, tendering no evidence. The order on the books is: &ldquo;No evidence; dismissed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why was that done?  I should venture one explanation.  Here you have evidence which includes a confession from the culprit.  I would be satisfied if this case were dealt with properly in due process of law and, having been so dealt with, if the justice thought fit &mdash;and I would also agree with it if he thought fit&mdash;to apply the Probation <Col N="1367" /> Act, then the case would be dealt with after evidence duly sworn and taken. But, no evidence&mdash;dismissed.  That was in January, 1958.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell and I had a motion on the Order Paper of this House asking for an inquiry into the affairs of Gaeltarra Eireann.  We were resisted right down along the line. We were resisted even to the point that the Minister spoke to it on the last occasion this motion was before the House alleging that there was nothing wrong, thinking, naïvely, that it would never come to the light of day that something very wrong had not alone been suppressed in the courts, but that no evidence was tendered on behalf of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I know nothing about this matter.  I am not responsible for it.  If there is anything in the Deputy's allegations, it is a matter for the Department of Justice, not for my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, who is responsible for the case being brought to its final conclusion, the Attorney-General who directed the prosecution, in the first instance, and then suffered this miserable state of affairs&mdash;no evidence; case dismissed&mdash; all have a case to answer to the people of this country.  They have a case to answer to the vast majority, the great majority, the almost 100 per cent. majority of our civil servants who are doing their work in an excellent manner.  That was suppressed and that course was taken in order to prevent the public from having, on the one hand, information in relation to anything being wrong in the Department and to prevent the publication of any such thing buttressing the case Deputy O'Donnell and I were making and, it will now be conceded, are making with some force and with no small degree of truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> I propose in relation to this matter to write a letter to the Taoiseach, who is the nominal head of all Departments, asking him whether the Attorney-General took this course in consultation with the Minister for the Gaeltacht or the Minister for Justice, or whether it was a Government direction that the thing should be let lie so as to give no support to the rumours abroad and the charge made here that all was not well in the Department of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying, I think the House and the country should be informed as to why that course was taken and, if the Minister is as ignorant as he says he is of the details of this case, I will give him the name of the person and the amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>He can find it on the record of the District Court.  Thanks be to God, there are some records that are available to members of the public who wish to inspect them and that are not faked.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is nothing wrong in the Department of the Gaeltacht,&rdquo; said the Minister on various occasions.  &ldquo;There is not a scintilla of evidence or scintilla of truth in the allegations Deputy Lindsay is making,&rdquo; said Mr. Lynch, the Minister for Education, on a former occasion.  &ldquo;These are wild and baseless allegations.&rdquo; Fortunately&mdash;fortunately for me and for my political reputation and for the belief which I hold in the integrity of public men and the necessity for it&mdash;the Public Accounts Committee came to my assistance, and the Public Accounts Committee, as everybody knows, is an all-Party Committee.  The Report of the Committee of Public Accounts for 1955-56, page xiii, under the heading Gaeltacht Services, paragraph 23, says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Committee had under consideration the question of the safe custody and accounting for stocks of finished goods, including tweed and knitwear, at the Dublin depot of the Gaeltacht industries.  The Committee was informed that the value of finished goods held at the various centres had increased from <Col N="1369" /> £14,000 in 1940 to £213,000 in 1956; that book records of the stocks of knitwear had been kept until 1956, when they were allowed to lapse; and that no store accounts were kept for tweed.  In the absence of proper store accounts for tweed it was not possible to measure the accuracy of the stocks as ascertained at stocktaking.  The evidence indicated that when an attempt was made to assess what tweed should be in store at 31st March, 1956&mdash;by aggregating receipt vouchers and issue vouchers&mdash;a surplus of 30,000 yards emerged.  Questioned regarding this discrepancy, the Accounting Officer advanced the view that the stocktaking must have been incorrect, as the 1957 stocktaking on the same basis revealed a surplus of only 8,000 yards.  The Committee feels that little reliance can be placed on these figures.  In its view, while the discrepancies might have been due to faulty stocktaking, they might equally be attributable to other causes.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Committee fails to understand how a business of this magnitude could be efficiently carried on without proper records of the movement of stocks.  It feels compelled to record grave dissatisfaction with the methods of control as being entirely inadequate for the proper safeguarding of stores.  It has been informed that a system of store accounting was installed in October, 1957, and it desires to be informed regarding the efficiency of its operation,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is nothing wrong in the Department of the Gaeltacht,&rdquo; says the Minister.  Does the Minister challenge, even at this stage, the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely pointing out, Sir, in respect of these 30,000 yards referred to in the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts that, on a re-check on the stocktaking on 31st March, 1955, it has been discovered that the figure given then was wrong and that there was no such thing as 30,000 yards in fact missing.  That is what I am telling the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion is that there are 22,000 yards of tweed missing, and in the absence of an authoritative statement and evidence brought before the Committee of Public Accounts, as far as I am concerned and as far as the country is concerned, I still say there are 22,000 yards of tweed missing for that year.</P>
      <P>Let us now take the Appropriation Accounts for 1956-57.  In spite of the discovery that everything is all well now, according to the Minister, listen to what the Comptroller and Auditor-General has to say on page 17 of the Report under the heading Vote 49:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" />&ldquo;An examination of records of knitwear yarn held in Dublin disclosed that stock was taken at intervals and the records adjusted by the storekeeper to agree with the physical stock.  No evidence was available that discrepancies were investigated and they were not included in the list of discrepancies revealed at the independent annual stocktaking.  I have communicated with the Accounting Officer on this matter, and also regarding defective control over these stocks which are held at three separate stores.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Minister dispute the truth of the comment of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in the Appropriation Accounts 1956-57?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  The whole system has been changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the system that has been changed.  I am talking about the system that was in operation before it became necessary to change it, before it became a public scandal, which it now is, a scandal of such magnitude that I regret the Minister sees his way to defend it on all occasions before this House.</P>
      <P>When the Report of the Public Accounts Committee was made known, that the results were, according to them, attributable to other causes, I shall not put a tooth on what those causes were.  They were larceny, fraud and conversion of some sort.  Those are the only other causes because, when goods leave without permission and in accordance with the regular system of a business house, the cause can be only one kind of cause.</P>
      <P>I wish to place on record to this House a tribute to one provincial paper that took this matter up.  I mean the <i>Kerryman</i> of the 28th April, 1958.  In a column entitled &ldquo;Comment&rdquo; it stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;There are no scandals in Gaeltacht Department,&rsquo; ran a daring headline in an Irish newspaper last November when the fusillade between Messrs. Lindsay and Lynch, with Mr. <Col N="1372" /> Moran holding a watching brief, was at its height.</P>
    <P>Mr. Moran, of course, was leaping to the defence of his Department in the approved tradition of not letting the side down.</P>
    <P>Unhappily, time has not vindicated his assertion.  The Report of the Committee of Public Accounts has a sad tale to unfold about the Gaeltacht Services and the very perfunctory way their records of stock have been kept.</P>
    <P>In 1956, book records of stocks of knitwear were allowed to lapse.  No store accounts were kept for tweed; an attempt was made to assess the tweeds in March, 1956, by aggregating receipts and vouchers&mdash;and some genius came up with a surplus of 30,000 yards.  The same genius could not have been in operation in March, 1957, as using the same method of checking stocks, only a surplus of 8,000 yards could be found this time.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Little reliance,&rsquo; says the report heavily (and no wonder), &lsquo;can be placed on these figures.&rsquo; It also added a thought that a great many people must be thinking: &lsquo;That it failed to understand how a business of this magnitude could be efficiently carried on without proper records of movements of stocks.&rsquo; The Committee records &lsquo;grave dissatisfaction&rsquo; with the methods of control.</P>
    <P>There are a great many things the average person does not understand about the Gaeltacht activities.  Why do they issue no statement of accounts?  They are in the position of a public profit-making organisation. Even if they regard themselves as a charitable organisation, they must know it is customary for all reputable charitable organisations to issue public accounts.  Their system of selling also has come under fire; they pay low wages to the workers, have no selling set-up themselves, and hand over the work of selling to agents who draw extraordinary commissions.</P>
    <P>But one would hardly have suspected that a Government offshoot would be so notoriously lacking in <Col N="1373" /> the elementals of accounting for stock.  In a bureaucratic world where everything is tied and knotted with red tape, we find a Gaeltacht Department counting their stock like the old Rochroe farmer counting his sheep, &lsquo;Well, you're there, and you're there...and you're all there.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>The new Gaeltacht Board should remember the cardinal principle&mdash; business is business.  The Gaeltacht industries are business; they should be efficiently managed as a business and not as a means to giving charity to Gaeltacht workers; they should make a profit; and all their trading activities should be clearly shown in a balance sheet and a profit and loss account.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that the Government, who insist on these conditions for ordinary public companies, should be able to ignore them when it sets up in business itself.  The taxpayer is a shareholder in Government business; what's the objection to treating him as one?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One could go on.  One could pursue this litany but is there any point?  Is there any point in trying to pursue the honest course, to pursue the path of integrity in public life, when one is thwarted and impeded as I have been in this House ever since I introduced this matter to it?  Even this evening you had the spectacle of two Parliamentary Secretaries trying to cover up fraud by an effort to sort of ridicule my continuing, or by making my case in English.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in order to assert that Parliamentary Secretaries are endeavouring to cover up a fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any other less innocuous phrase I am willing to use it.  Is there any point in trying to keep the standard of public life as high as we all, I am sure, agree in our hearts it should be, when we are thwarted and impeded in the manner in which I have been impeded in relation to this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of what the Comptroller and Auditor-General has to say in the <Col N="1374" /> Appropriation Accounts, of what the Committee of Public Accounts have to say in their report, in view of my disclosure this evening about the queer and curious ending to a straight case, it is small wonder that there is so much contempt for politicians and public men throughout this country.  Will somebody in the Fianna Fáil Party try to impress on the Minister for the Gaeltacht that it is not his function to defend this kind of thing, to make excuses for it, and try to persuade him further that his real function in the Department of the Gaeltacht, as indeed it is the function of any Minister in any Department, is to be a representative of the public and a protector of the public interest?  The <i>Kerryman</i> said on 28th April, 1958, that &ldquo;time unhappily, was not on the side of Mr. Moran&rdquo;.  I confidently assert here this evening that, in spite of any efforts to the contrary, however long they may be pursued and with what methods they may be pursued, time will be on the side of right.  Time will be on the side of truth and, when right and truth shall have prevailed, maybe conscience might smite the Minister for the Gaeltacht, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Justice, and they might then have the grace, after all their thwarting, all their denials, all the impeding of the machinery of justice, to approach the Taoiseach and tender their resignations.</P>

Sé mo thuairim féin gurab é rud is fearr don tír, don teanga agus do mhuintir na Fíor-Ghaeltachta Bord Speisialta don Ghaeltacht a bheith ann.</P>
      <P>Dúirt mé freisin go rabhamar ag iarraidh an teanga a choinneáil beo sa tír; an Ghaeltacht a chaomhnadh agus na daoine a choimeád sa Ghaeltacht. Ach, faraoir, tá go leor daoine ag imeacht as an Ghaeltacht.  Ní mór dúinn ceist a chur orainn féin istigh anso agus taobh amuigh den Teach cén fáth a bhruil an scéal amhlaidh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1375" /> Tá mé ag ceapadh gur ceart don Aire féachaint le scéimeanna, ar nós scéim na dtithe gloine, a chur ar bun sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht.  Ba cheart dó scéim mhór eile ar nós scéim na dtithe gloine a chur ar siúl sa bhFíorGhaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá tithe gloine im cheantar féin agus táid ag déanamh go maith.  Tá na daoine ag déanamh airgid as na tithe seo.  Tá scéimeanna uisce curtha ar bun agus tá na scéimeanna sin ag déanamh go maith freisin.</P>
    <P>Níor mhiste don Aire monarchana beaga a chur ar bun sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht i dtreo is go mbeadh obair le fáil ag daoine óga na Gaeltachta a choiméadfadh sa mbaile iad.  B'fhearr le muintir na Fíor-Ghaeltachta fanacht sa mbaile ná imeacht thar sáile.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an Teachta Mac Loingsigh ag caint trasna an Tí. Bhí sé ag cur a lán ceisteanna ar an Aire.  Tá mé ag ceapadh nach raibh na ceisteanna sin ceart.  Bhí an Teachta Mac Loingsigh tráth san Oifig seo agus cad a tharla nuair a bhí sé bliain ann?</P>
    <P>Cén fáth nár fhéach seisean isteach sna ceisteanna úd ar labhair sé orthu nuair a bhí sé féin san Oifig sin? Níor chaith sé aon duine amach as an Oifig sin go dtí an lá deireanach, gur imigh sé féin amach as.  D'fhag sé an gnó go dtí an lá deireanach a raibh sé fein ag imeacht as an Oifig.  Tá mé ag ceapadh nach raibh sin ceart.</P>
    <P>Connachtach is ea an tAire.  Is fear maith é.  Tuigeann sé a ghnó agus tuigeann sé cad tá ag teastáil ó na daoine i gContae Mhuigheo thiar agus thuaidh, i gContae Chiarraí, Thír Chonaill agus Ghaillimh Thiar.  Tá mé bródúil as.  Má fhaghann sé an seans tá mé cinnte go gcuirfidh sé rudaí ar bun a raghaidh chun leas mhuintir na Fíor-Ghaeltachta, Rinne sé go rí-mhaith ó chuaigh sé isteach san oifig.</P>

      <P>Is áit dheas é freisin. We have here an Estimate asking up to £250,000&mdash;an increase on last year of £50,000.  This Department was set up for the building up of the economy of the Gaeltacht, the preservation of the Irish language and the stemming of emigration.  I should like to know how much of this money will ever reach the Gaeltacht; and how much of it will ever leave Dublin.  The need for stopping emigration is in the Gaeltacht. It is not by hand-outs or doles it will be done but by something definite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister think that by handing out a few lorry loads of sows around the country and calling it &ldquo;Scéim na Muc,&rdquo; he will save the Gaeltacht?  The Irish language can only be preserved by preserving the Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht.  Girls come into Galway City, which I represent, merely in order to obtain a working knowledge of the English language for the purpose of fitting themselves out <Col N="1377" /> for England, the United States and other places.  If we had less lip-service about the Irish language and more action, we might have more results. This Vote will not stop one emigrant from leaving although it is expected to cost £250,000.  I would suggest that the Minister should hand the whole thing over to <i>Gael Linn.</i>  They are making a fine effort at present and they are to be complimented.  They have stolen a march on the Department for the Gaeltacht and have shown what can be done.  I hope they will get the full co-operation of the Department.</P>
    <P>This Vote, as far as I can see, is only a bit off this Department and a bit off that Department in order to create a Ministry.  There is nothing new to add.  Even Scéim na Muc is in the Department of Agriculture under a different name.  &ldquo;A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.&rdquo; While I admit this Department is a new one and that by trial and error it may arrive at something, it will have to do something very quickly to justify its existence.  Let us hope that, through the action of the Department, we will see less emigration and that moneys will be more wisely spent than they have been spent in the past.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cómhgáirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Aire nua i ngeall ar an obair a rinne sé i gcaiteamh na bliana seo caite ar son na Gaeltachta.  Thaispeáin sé go gcuireann sé suim thar an gcoitceann in imeachtaí na Gaeltachta agus ins na daoine atá ina gcónaí annsin. Molaim an Bord a chuir sé ar bun agus molaim na daoine a cheap sé don bhord sin.  Thogh sé go cúramach iad agus is dóigh liom go gcruthócha siad go raibh an cheart ag an Aire nuair a chuir sé an bhord sin ar bun agus go mbeidh toradh dá réir as a cuid oibre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sa ráiteas a thug an tAire uaidh nuair a thug sé an Meastachán isteach, chuir sé síos ar a lán scéimeanna atá beartuithe aige.  Tuigim go rí-mhaith go mbrathann cuid mhór de na scéimeanna sin ar na húdaráis áitiúla, na comhairlí conndae.  Maidir leis an gcéad scéim, bronnann sé sin deontaisí ar na húdaráis le bóithre a dhéanamh. Ní dóigh liom go dtuigeann na húdaráis <Col N="1378" /> áitiúla maitheas na scéimeanna sin agus ba cheart don Aire litir a chur amach chuig na comhairlí conndae ag míniú dóibh cé na cumhachtaí atá acab leis na scéimeanna sin a chur chun cinn ar mhaitheas leis an nGaeltacht.  Bóithre beaga atá luaite, sé sin, &ldquo;minor roads&rdquo; agus ní go ró mhaith a thuigim céard tá i gceist murab iad bóithre nach mbaincann scéim ar bith cile leo.  Sa leagan Béarla, séard tá curtha síos dóibh &ldquo;accomodation roads.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Tá scéim eile ann cun uisce do sholáthar agus tá sé sin an-thábhachtach ar fad.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil na deontaisí fán scéim sin sáthach árd agus mholfainn go gcuirfí ar a laghad leath den chostas ar fáil in ionad an ceathrú cuid.  Tá oibreacha mara luaite comh maith.  Sin ceist a gcuireann comhairle Chonndae na Gaillimhe suim mhór inti, ach aon uair a theastuigh uainn dul ar aghaidh le scéim den tsórt sin ní raibh an tairgead ar fáil. Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé ar fáil anois fán scéim seo.</P>
    <P>Molaim go hárd scéim 4 atá luaite annseo fá'n a mbeidh sé ar cumas an Aire agus na Roinne deontaisí a chur ar fáil le pinniúr agus páirceanna imeartha a chur ar fáil do mhuinntir na Gaeltachta.  Maidir leis na páirceanna imeartha, sé an deachracht atá ansin teacht ar áit mhion réidh chuige sin sa nGaeltacht, ach maidir leis na pinniúr agus a léithéidí tá géar-ghá leob i gConnamara go háithrid.</P>
    <P>Ní bhacfaidh mé le scéim na muc. Tuigeann muintir na Gaeltachta buntáistí na scéime sin agus is cuma cén droch-mheas a chaitheas an dream thall air.  Scéim isea í go bhfuil meas ag muintir na Gaeltachta uirthi agus scéim a rachas chun cinn i gConnamara go háithrid.</P>
    <P>I dtaobh na scéimeanna a luaitear fá uimhir a 6, sé sin, tithe trátaí nó na tithe gloinne, is mór an trua nach féidir leis an Roinn dul ar aghaidh níos tapúla len a dtógáil.  Thug Fianna Fáil an scéim sin isteach don chéad uair agus dá bhféadfaidís dul ar aghaidh níos tapúla leo agus a dhá oiread den na tithe sin a thógáil, is amhlaidh is mó a bheadh meas ar an scéim i gConnamara.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> Maidir le hUimhir a seacht, ba mhaith liom dá míníodh an tAire dúinn céard tá i gceist aige ansin agus cén chaoi a gcabhródh sé leis an gcóras meán-oideachais a chur chun cinn.  An geabhródh sé leis na clochair agus leis na Bráithre?  An bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Roinn coláistí agus a léithéidí a chur chun chinn dóibh?</P>
    <P>Chuir mé ceist i rith na bliana faoi mheán-scoil nua atá bunaithe sa Spidéal agus ní dóigh liom go raibh sé ar chumas an Aire an uair sin aon deontas a thabhairt dóibh cé go raibh dea-obair dá dhéanamh ag na mná rialta sa Spidéal.  Má tá sé in ndon cabhrú leo anois is maith an gar dóibh é agus is mór an gar don Ghaeltacht é.

Ba mhaith liom fosta a iarraidh ar an Aire níos mó a dhéanamh fá dtaoibh de scéimeanna uisce sa Ghaeltacht go mór mhór sna háiteacha ina bhfuil na coláistí Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Téann scaifte mór páistí ansin achan bhliain agus tá siad sin cleachta le rudaí ar leith, le uisce a bheith acu sna tithe sa bhaile.  Sé mo bharúil féin nach leanfadh siad ag dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht mura bhfaighe siad an saghas céanna tí ansin agus atá acu sa bhaile.  Ar feadh blianta fada bhí daoine sasta dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht ar cuma leo na háiseanna a bhí le fáil; ach anois tá athrú ann.  In áiteacha tá go leor uisce reatha le fáil; in áiteacha eile, níl.  Dá smaointeoch an tAire air sin, ba mhaith an rud é, mar tá géar-ghá leis in áiteacha.</P>

Ba mhaith liom an tAire a mholadh fosta <Col N="1381" /> fán dóigh a rinne sé athrú ar scéim Choiste na bPáistí.  Bhí géar-ghá le sin. Ní raibh go leor airgead le fáil.

      <P>Ba mhaith liom labhairt ar an Vóta seo. Tá brón orm nach bhfuil go leor Gaeilge agam le caint a dhéanamh ar an Mheastachán i nGaeilge.  Mar sin caithfidh mé Bearla a labhairt.  I represent a constituency in the Gaeltacht, North Kerry, and I am anxious to say a few words on this Vote in connection with the various matters which have been raised here by the Minister to-night and by other Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I feel I ought to thank the Minister for having succeeded, after some months of initial work, in bringing some of the schemes of his Department into operation, in so far as our part of the Gaeltacht is concerned. The lot of the people living in the Kerry Gaeltacht is, I am sure, no different from that of those living in Gaeltacht areas in other parts of the country.  Nothwithstanding anything said to the contrary, I feel it was a step in the right direction, for the previous Government actually to have set up a separate Gaeltacht Department to deal with the problems <Col N="1382" /> of the people in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker said here that the schemes in general being administered now by the Department of the Gaeltacht were heretofore given to the people under the auspices of other Departments.  I cannot entirely agree with that statement.  If those schemes were available already, I submit that the various Departments which happened to be administering them failed to get them over to the advantage of the people and certainly failed to get them over to the extent that they have been got over under the separate Department at the moment.</P>
    <P>I feel that while the various Departments of State which handled those schemes in the past were, no doubt, anxious to administer them to the benefit of the people of the Gaeltacht, they had not the necessary machinery or the type of organisation suitable for the implementation of such schemes.  The Department of the Gaeltacht, a comparatively new Department, can rightly claim to serve this purpose best and it has succeeded, in the short time it has been in existence, in initiating and putting into operation, to the benefit of the people of the Gaeltacht, schemes which are appreciated by the people.</P>
    <P>I was glad to find in the Estimate which the Minister introduced to-night that an additional financial provision of £51,000 is being made and I am quite certain that in order to get that extra money the Minister had to make a very strong case to the Government. I must congratulate the Minister, in the first instance, on being able to get that money and on formulating schemes during the short time he has been in office, schemes very much needed in the Gaeltacht areas and which appear very practicable.</P>
    <P>In his statement, the Minister mentioned a number of schemes that his Department is now administering on a more or less independent basis.  The first scheme dealt with is the scheme for the repair or general improvement of minor county roads in the Gaeltacht. In the past these roads were neglected. I would say that up to 1952, when special grants were made available by the Fianna Fáil Government for the <Col N="1383" /> reconstruction of certain important roads, it could be truthfully said that the position of the Gaeltacht roads generally was deplorable.  Considerable improvement was made at that time and has been maintained since, but in the allocation of grants by local authorities, it often happened that Gaeltacht areas were not lucky enough to get the allocations that certain other parts of the country outside the Gaeltacht were able to obtain.</P>
    <P>Probably a very good case was made for the system of allocation which at that time unfortunately deprived Gaeltacht areas of the grants which other parts of the country got.  It may have been due to the fact that population and traffic considerations were more favourable in non-Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>I am sure it was in an effort to make good that deficiency that the Minister has re-introduced the 100 per cent. grant for the steamrolling and general reconstruction of county and main roads in Gaeltacht areas.  I am glad to see that such work is being carried out under the auspices of the local authorities who are, no doubt, the most competent people to undertake that kind of job.  In my constituency some thousands of pounds were spent on schemes of that kind during the past year but I feel that the Minister should try to step up the amount of grants made available for roads, generally, in Gaeltacht areas, particularly for roads that have a tourist importance.  I know some very important roads in the Dingle, Corea Duibhne, Gaeltacht which are in a very bad state of repair and generally cannot be used to the advantage of the district because funds have not been available in the past to have them reconstructed or steamrolled.  In the allocation of funds this year I hope the Minister will consult, as I am sure his officials always do, with the local authority with a view to bringing those roads into the list for improvement.</P>
    <P>I regard the Minister's provision for the repair and improvement of accomodation roads as very important. I am particularly glad that such work will be carried out and <Col N="1384" /> administered by the Employment Schemes Office in co-operation, of course, with the Minister's Department. It would be a very unsatisfactory state of affairs if these roads were neglected because, while we might all wish the main road arteries in the Gaeltacht to be in very good condition, we must accept the fact that there are many remote villages in all Gaeltacht areas off the main roads that must have some form of highway to serve the people living in those villages.</P>
    <P>It was very thoughtful of the Minister and his Department to make provision for these accomodation roads. Undoubtedly, provision was made for them in the past through the Special Employment Schemes Office but I would submit that very often some of those roads did not seem to qualify because of various circumstances outside the control of the Department of Education or whatever Government Department was then handling Gaeltacht problems.  The conditions applicable to the Employment Schemes Grants were somewhat unfavourable to the circumstances governing roads in these areas and it is very satisfactory to know that the Minister's Department will now have applications for grants for these roads dealt with on a more practicable basis.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister's representative in the Gaeltacht areas, the director he has appointed to administer the various schemes, will pay special attention to this problem because there has been&mdash;and, I would say, rightly&mdash; a good deal of complaint and a great volume of dissatisfaction in past years because of the very few accommodation roads dealt with under the Employment Schemes Grants.  I sincerely hope that we have seen the end of that unsatisfactory situation now and that roads of any real importance, even though they are accommodation roads, will get the advantage of any grants that may be going.</P>
    <P>The most important scheme yet introduced I think is that for minor water supply and sewerage schemes. In most Gaeltacht areas there is a very good possibility of building up a tourist trade of a kind, but, in the past, conditions, particularly sanitary conditions, apart from roads, militated <Col N="1385" /> very much against any possibility that might exist in that direction.  The local authorities during those years were examining this question of a water supply.  The county medical officers of health, whose job it was to select the most appropriate areas for the schemes in the different counties, no doubt gave due attention to the matter, but it was found in every local authority that the farthest they got was to prepare a list and to have these water supply schemes scheduled in order of priority. Due to lack of funds, and particularly since the recent credit squeeze came along, the schemes never got anywhere.</P>
    <P>In our local authority, we had 20 of those schemes listed for many years in the Dingle Gaeltacht and various attempts were made to provide a number of pumps at that time to supply water to some of these villages.  We only succeeded in a period of about ten years in supplying three or four pumps to the whole area.  We were still left with a list of 20 important and very necessary water supply schemes of which we could not possibly take care.</P>
    <P>Some months ago, the Minister made an offer to the local authority and suggested that, if they were prepared to carry through the schemes in accordance with his requirements, his Department would make a grant available to the extent, I think, of 50 per cent.  I am very happy to be able to say that the local authority gladly accepted the offer and instructed the county engineer to prepare the necessary plans and specifications for submission to the Minister's Department. No doubt these plans and specifications were examined by the Minister and, with some modifications, were, I understand, readily sanctioned and passed on to the local authority, with a request that the work in question should be undertaken and carried through as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The local authority&mdash;Kerry County Council&mdash;was very glad to make provision in its rates estimate for the current year to provide the necessary local contribution to enable these schemes to be carried out and I am very happy to say that work on most of the schemes has now commenced. <Col N="1386" /> I think the Minister did specify to the county engineer that he would expect that, as far as possible, the water schemes should be worked on a gravitation basis.  That was very wise on the Minister's part, because experience has shown that the provision of water supplies by pumps is not usually satisfactory.  I should like to inform the Minister now that the people of the Gaeltacht in my constituency are very satisfied with the steps the Minister proposes to take.  All they ask is that the schemes be carried through with the least possible delay, so that the water they have been waiting for for generations will be available to them in adequate supplies and in satisfactory condition in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in the course of his speech to some experiment or scheme that his Department has in connection with the strawberry industry. I am glad to say that the Minister did offer the advantages of that scheme to Kerry Gaeltacht through the county committee of agriculture and, due to the very close degree of co-operation that has existed between the county committee of agriculture there and the Minister's Department, it has now been made possible to start ten pilot schemes in the county.  I understand that the Minister's Department laid down a target of ten plots in each of the two Kerry Gaeltacht areas.  In fact, the ten plots in North Kerry and, as far as I know, in South Kerry, for which South Kerry Deputies are more competent to speak than I am, have been achieved.</P>
    <P>I think there is now justification to consider this scheme on a more extensive scale and I would suggest to the Minister that he should, at this stage, plan ahead for next year and go all out to have many more; I should say nearer 100 rather than ten of these plots should be established and worked in the area.  I believe that the results from the growing of strawberries can be very satisfactory and very remunerative, and I am quite sure, once the people of the Gaeltacht are satisfied on that score, the Minister will have very little difficulty in getting that part of the scheme worked to his satisfaction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> There is one important matter I am anxious to bring to the Minister's notice in connection with rural electrification in the Kerry Gaeltacht.  The E.S.B. carried through the necessary canvass with a view to connecting up the Gaeltacht to the rural electrification scheme a couple of years ago, but, due to the poor result of the canvass at that time, the area was not listed in sufficiently high priority to have it connected up.  The E.S.B. are being approached in the matter, but they are unable to help very much.  The E.S.B. take the attitude that the area cannot, as far as they are concerned, be treated on any priority basis.  It has to take its place in the queue with all the other areas.  I think that the factors which are militating against the area in this case will not be overcome for many years, unless the Minister comes to the assistance of the matter.</P>
    <P>The first difficulty is the flat rate of charges in the scale operated by the E.S.B.  It is considered too high, due to the fact that most of the houses in the area are big houses.  They have a large floor area, and I am inclined to suggest to the Minister that he might consider devising some scheme whereby he could help either by way of cash contribution or by persuading the E.S.B. to give special exemption for part of the floor space in these houses. Now, with the water and sewerage facilities which the new scheme will bring to the area, it would be a pity if the current could not be supplied into all these areas without undue delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking only for my own area.  The Dingle Gaeltacht, the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and the Gaeltacht proper for the purpose of the Minister's Department, is, in my opinion, far too small.  I am not saying it is too small because it contains only a certain area.  I cannot understand why, originally, when these areas were defined, only a certain number of electoral divisions in the particular district were treated as Fíor-Gaeltacht and other areas with equally strong claims were not included.  I refer to areas such as Brandon which is at the north-eastern side of Mount Brandon, right across the mountain from the Cúis area on the other side, Cloghane and Annascaul.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of those areas are mostly Irish speakers&mdash;as much, I would say, as they are in the Western area.  They are competent to speak through the medium of Irish and they have kept the Irish traditions all down through the years.  These people certainly have a grievance nowadays, with the Department of the Gaeltacht functioning so efficiently, that they are not included in the Gaeltacht area.  I do <Col N="1389" /> not know if it is possible to do so under existing legislation but I assume it is as otherwise I would not be in order in making the point that the Minister might consider including those areas in the Gaeltacht and thus make it more compact and workable.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has selected a local director for the Kerry Gaeltacht and that he is resident and available there to give the people any service they require.  I should like the Minister to go a little more frequently amongst the people of the Gaeltacht. He cannot be expected to live a week in this part of the Gaeltacht and the next week in some other part of it. He has certain administrative duties to perform in Dublin and he must be in his office quite a lot.</P>

      <P>For the past seven or eight months the Minister has been doing a very important job of work in trying to organise his office and to put various schemes into operation.  I think there are sufficient schemes at the moment and the people of the Gaeltacht appreciate that they have been put into operation with the minimum of delay.  There are, however, many problems which they would like to discuss with the Minister and it would give more satisfaction if he would go among the people collectively and from time to time take the opportunity of discussing their local problems with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>On account of the new set up in relation to this Department this year, I should like a statement from the Minister as to how the position will actually operate.  I find it difficult for this House to follow the workings of the Department in its various branches.  It seems to be much <Col N="1390" /> too loosely constructed and to contain too many sections.  Apparently the Gaeltacht Commission will deal with tweeds, knitted goods, sprigging and so on.  Is that the sole function of that branch of the Department of the Gaeltacht?  If that is so, seeing the amount of money turned over by savings in relation to items over which the commission have control, I am curious as to why a Grant-in-Aid of £220,000 is being given to it.  Surely the proper thing to do was to have audited accounts which apparently they must have by statute, and which the Minister will place on the Table of the House so that we can see how they stand.  It is very dangerous, where a board is handling some £300,000 worth of goods each year, to hand over to them a Grant-in-Aid of £220,000.  It is dangerous to have so much wealth knocking about.  The people concerned might get quite loose about it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister was then a member of the House but the late Deputy Dockrell in his own way and with his extensive business knowledge took an interest in this Vote and used to speak on it each year.  He always asked for a detailed audited account for presentation to this House so that we should know how the work was being carried out and whether or not any profits were being made.  The answer always was: &ldquo;This is not a profit-making institution.&rdquo; That is a very bad thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a social service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very bad principle in any line of business that &ldquo;there you are, off you go and it does not matter about profits or losses, and so forth.&rdquo; It is very dangerous and a bad system.  For that reason, I should like the Minister to tell the House why a Grant-in-Aid of £220,000 was being given to a board that was handling roughly some £200,000 or £300,000 annually.  It is an unfortunate thing. I hope it works out well.  I am very doubtful about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this commission was set up, my idea about it was that it would be in the form of the old Congested <Col N="1391" /> Districts Board and that it would embrace all the activities of those areas.  Now it is subdivided into various sections.  Aranmara, Teoranta, apparently, will deal with sea rods and carrageen.  Why was that not handed over to the commission?  Is it that the men in the commission were not suitably qualified in respect of this particular work?  Was it not one of the related things and should it not have been handed over them?  Why was a separate board set up to deal with that work?  Apparently it has entered into contracts with somebody else to send these rods to the Continent.  The carrageen, also, is to be dealt with by them.</P>
    <P>I am saying all I have to say on this Vote in a perfectly friendy spirit to the Minister.  I am deeply concerned about the matter.  Then we have the pickles, strawberries and onion seeds. It is not stated who will deal with them but apparently the Gaeltacht Commission will not deal with them.  Why all this segregation into water-tight compartments and then again trying to get them as a unified whole and get control of it?  It seems to me a ridiculous set-up without any good business, top, bottom or middle, in it.  I have read the report of the Public Accounts Committee in relation to the Appropriation Accounts.  One can well understand how certain things can happen.  I am giving the Minister the benefit of my experience and I hope he will accept my advice.  I fear he is in a dangerous position with all these sectional set-ups.  Who invented the system, I do not know, but certainly it is beyond my comprehension as an efficient instrument to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Are all these people to be independent or are they to be part of the set-up of Gaeltarra Éireann?  They should be all under the board.  Either that, or not at all.  I regret to have to say it, but in my opinion this set-up is utterly unworkable and will fail.  These areas will not reap the benefit this House intended they should reap when it passed this Act and made financial provision for it.  Perhaps it sounds hostile.  I am not concerned, about that.  All I am concerned with is the <Col N="1392" /> efficiency and success of this.  What I say may be critical, but it is friendly.</P>
    <P>The Minister was highly unfortunate in the advice he got not to take possession of the whole area and put it under one commission.  Even if worth-while salaries had to be paid to the members of that commission, it would be money well spent provided the right men were got.  Surely they are available?  I have long experience now both under the Congested Districts Board and under native Governments. I am disposed to pit civil servants against the new administration, this mixum-gatherum of commissions and companies dealing with these things. Is it not obviously a matter for one body to deal with a particular areas requiring specialised treatment?  That was always admitted.  Even the British Government, about whom we said so much in this country, had the &ldquo;savvy&rdquo; and the skill of organisation to place this whole area under one board. Considering the amount of the money available to it, it did a very good job. There were some distinguished and brilliant men on that commission. Surely this country has not degenerated so far that equally able and brilliant men could not be got to do the job the Minister has divided now into separate enclaves?</P>
    <P>We are all worrying about tweeds, crochet and sprigging.  We go some place else and look for sea rods and carrageen.  Then we go some place else and look for onion seed and strawberries. You will have to get a helicopter to get around all this show. Does the Minister or anyone who knows anything about business organisation, think that this will succeed?  I think it will not.  We are doing the job, but we are doing it badly although we had the opportunity of doing it well.</P>
    <P>I do not know anything about the difficulties that have arisen and that have been referred to here to-night and on other occassions.  In my opinion they are inevitable from the nature of the institution and the way it is being dealt with&mdash;I should not say &ldquo;institution&rdquo; but a whole series of separate institutions.  The whole thing is a joke. A full-blown commission, which the public thought would deal with this <Col N="1393" /> whole problem in the same way as the Congested Districts Board, will only deal with, the industrial side of it. They will have charge of £200,000 or £300,000.  Yet we are making available to them a Grant-in-Aid of £220,000 to keep them in pocket money until they get into funds.  Would the Minister put that up to any board of businessmen? He is putting it up to the House and asking Deputies to vote for it.  If he put it up to a board of competent businessmen they would jeer at him and tell him to get out, that it was a joke.</P>
    <P>I think it is inviting trouble.  If the Minister escapes he will be a lucky man.  I can tell him that from my long experience.  Who will deal with the onion seed and the strawberries?  Will you have another board to deal with them?  Who will deal with the pigs? Is that not a function of the Department of Agriculture?  Why are we so fond of splitting up things in this country?  Is the Gaeltacht Department just supposed to deal with industries and with giving work in that area? What are we to do with the pigs and the onion seed?  Surely some of these questions are matters for the horticultural side of the Department of Agriculture?</P>
    <P>I regret to say it but I do not see any hope for the success of this scheme.  Why could this new board not pay the salaries out of its turn-over? We had to give them £220,000 to pay the officers.  Of course they will pay it back.  But could they not pay it out of their ordinary income from normal sales?  I shall be very glad if the Minister comes successfully out of this.  I wish him good luck in the task before him.  But let him keep his boots laced.  Apparently, there has been some &ldquo;trip-me up&rdquo; already.  Let him watch he does not trip over his head and perhaps break his political neck in the journey.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa cúpla focail a rá ar an Meastachán seo, Meastachán a bhfuil baint mhór aige leis an nGaeltacht, an ceantar ina bhfuil an teanga beo.  Tá muid ag caint ar an nGaeltacht anseo <Col N="1394" /> anois le huair go leith agus ní leanfaidh an díospóireacht seo i bhfad.  Sílimse dá geuirfeadh an Teach so suim mar is ceart i gceist na Gaeltachta go mbeadh an Dáil ag díospóireacht beagnach go lá ag scagadh ceist na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Tá buíochas mór tuilte ag muintir na Gaeltachta as an seasamh atá déanta acu le cúpla céad blian. Choimeád siad an Ghaeilge beo, rud nár dhein na ceantar eile.  Má thug ár Rialtais náisiúnta cuidiú fé leith don Ghaeltacht, ba cheart é. Tá an Ghaeltacht ghá bhánú bliain i ndiaidh bliana.  Tá an t-aos óg ag imeacht agus muna mbunaítear tionscail maithe in aithghiorracht ní mhairfidh an Ghaeilge i bhfad.  I gceann roinnt blian ní bheidh Gaeltacht ar bith ann agus ní bheidh fáth ar bith le &ldquo;Aire na Gaeltachta meastachán a thabhairt isteach le cuidiú a thabhairt don chuid sin den tír.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Admhaimíd go dtug na Rialtais uile cuidiú don Ghaeltacht ó fuaireamar an chéad Rialtas.  Tá, cuid mhór déanta ach féadfar i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh.  Caithfimíd bheith buíoch, agus támaid buíoch faoin méid oibre atá déanta.  Chuidigh scéim tithe na Gaeltachta go mór le tithe bréatha slachtmhara a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht in ionad na mbothán a bhí ann le na céadta blian.  Tá siad le feiceáil san Ghaeltacht anois, go speisialta i dTír Chonaill.  Ní dóigh liom gur bhain ceantar ar bith eile úsáid as an scéim sin oiread agus a rinneadh i dTír Chonaill.  Tá na tithe le feiceáil ag na cuairteoirí a théann go dtí an pháirt sin den tír.  Cuidigh na tithe go mór le muintir na Gaeltachta agus le scéim na gcuairteóirí agus tá na cuairteóiri ag teacht go Tír Chonaill níos líonmhaire bliain i ndiaidh bliana.</P>
      <P>Tá lúthgháir orm a chloisteáil ón Aire go bhfuil sé ag tabhairt deontas fé leith le scéimeanna uisce a chur ar bun, scéimeanna a cuidaíos go mór le saol agus beatha na ndaoine d'fheabhsú, maraon leis an tionscail sin atá ag dul ar aghaidh cho mór&mdash;tionscail na gcuairteóirí.  Má bhíonn tithe maithe ag na daoine agus scéim uisce ag teacht isteach i gcuid mhaith de na bailtí, beidh daoine i n-ann i bhfad níos mo cuairteóiri a choinneáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>D'iarrfainn ar an Aire deontas a <Col N="1395" /> chur ar fáil leis an scéim a leathnú chun na gcoláistí Gaeilge, go speisialta i dTír Chonaill agus go háirithe i Rann na Feirste and Gaoith Dobhair.  Tá sé fíor a rá go bhfuil scéim uisce i Rann na Feirste ach tá an chuid is mó den cheantar gan uisce ar bith go fóill.  Tá daoine i gCarraig an Choill, Doire na mBráthar agus Gaoith Dobhair, bailtí a thógas cuid mhór de na daoine na thagann go dtí Coláiste Bhride i Rann na Feirste, agus dá mbeadh scéim uisce ar fáil dóibh thiocfadh leo i bhfad níos mó daoine a choinneáil agus an coláiste a dhéanamh i bhfad níos mó ná mar atá sé.</P>
    <P>Tá sár-obair déanta ag an gColáiste sin agus má tá an Roinn ionraic fé cheist na Gaeilge, seo dóigh a dtig leo cuidiu leis an Ghaeilge a spreagadh ar fúd na tíre.  Go Coláistí Rann na Feirste agus Gaoith Dobhair tig, go céadta as gach aon pháirt den tír, go speisialta ó na Sé Contáethe.  Bliain i ndiaidh bliana tig na páistí, na gasúra agus na girrseacha go Tír Chonaill as na Sé Contaethe íe eolas fháil ar an nGaeilge.  Dá mbéadh an spiorad céanna anseo ins na 26 Contaethe ó fuaireamar ár saoirse bheadh Gaeilge i ngach áit inniu.  Tá súil agam go dtuigeann na daoine ins na 26 Contaethe an obair atá déanta ag muintir na Sé Contaethe, agus atá á dhéanamh, leis an Ghaeilge d'aithbheochaint.</P>
    <P>I bparóiste Ghaoith Dobhair tá aisteoirí a bhfuil cáil mhór tuilte acu. Os rud é go bhfuil an tAire ag tabhairt deontasaí d'amharelanna, ba mhaith liom ceist a chur air an mbeidh an deontas seo a bhí le fáil ag aisteoirí Ghaoith Dobhair le mórán blianta le fáil feasta.  Nuair bhí an Rialtas deireannach istigh thug siad geallúntas go bhfaighdis deontas leis an amharclann a thógaint.  Ni bhfuair.  D'iarrfainn ar an Aire cuidiú a thabhairt do na h-aisteoirí seo atá ag déanamh obair mhór ins na Ghaeltacht.  Dá mbeadh amharclann aca bheidis i n-ann an obair sin do mhéadú.</P>
    <P>Bhí lúthgháir orainn go léir gur cuireadh Bord Ghaeltarra Eireann ar bun agus bheireann an Bord sin dóchas dúinn go bhfuil an Rialtas ag dul ag déanamh rud éigin a chuideos go mór leis an nGaeltacht ins na <Col N="1396" /> blianta atá romhainn.  Támuid sásta go bhfuair duine as Tír Chonaill áit ar an mBord sin, fear a bhfuil eolas maith aige ar an gContae, fear atá eolach ar chursaí tionscail a chur ar bun, fear atá eolach ar gach aon tsórt a bhéarfadh cuidiú do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Tá muid buíoch den Aire gur chuir sé a leithéid de dhuine ar an mBord.  Tá fhios agam go ndéanfaidh sé a dhicheall ar son Tír Chonaill agus ar son na gcontaethe eile go léir.</P>
    <P>Bhí lúthgháir orainn fosta a chloisint ón Aire go bhfuil siad ag scrúdú scéim na dtithe gloine a mhéadú.  Sin scéim a chuidigh go mór leis na daoine agus dá mbeadh an scéim fairsing déarfainn go mbéadh sé chomh maith le tionscail ar bith a d'fhéadfaidh an tAire a chur ar bun.  Tá fhios againn an cuidiú atá sa scéim sin le daoine a choinneáil sa bhaile.  Déarfainn féin dá ndéanfadh sé méadú ar an scéim sin go gcuideodh sé go mór le saol na ndaoine a dhéanamh níos fear sa pháirt sin den tír.</P>
    <P>Deirtear go minic go bhfuil na Gaeltachtaí marbh, ach sílimse gur chuidigh na scéimeanna atá ar bun le mórán blianta go mór leis an Ghaeltacht a shábháil.</P>
    <P>Tá scéimeanna iascaireachta ag dul ar aghaidh go maith agus tá ag éirí le scéimeanna na gColáistí do na páistí.</P>
    <P>Tá na tionscail a chuir an Rialtas agus Roinn na Gaeltachta ar bun ag dul ar aghaidh go maith.  I gcás tionscail na mbréagán, tá an ceann i gCruadhlaoich ag dul ar aghaidh go maith ó bhliain go bliain.  Cuidíonn an scéim sin go speisialta le cuid mhór de na cailíní a choinneáil sa bhaile. Bá mhaith liomsa dá mbeadh an Bord seo ag breathnú ar scéim eile a chuideodh le na buachaillí a choinneáil sa bhaile.  Feicim fhéin obair le déanamh sa Ghaeltacht; agus dá mbeadh siad ag obair sa Ghaeltacht tá seans níos fearr go bpósfadh siad ann agus go dtógfadh siad a gcuid páistí ann.  Faoi láthair, tá an taos óg ag dul go hAlbain agus go Sasana agus ag pósadh i nGlascú, i mBirmingham, i gCoventry agus i Lonndain, agus ag tógáil a ndaltaí thall ansin.  Cuidigh an scéim aibhléise fosta le saol na ndaoine a dhéanamh níos fearr.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1397" /> Indiaidh na sceimeanna uilig, tim go bhfuil níos mó daoine ag fáganít na tíre anios ná 50 blian ó shoin.  An t-am sin, ní raibh scéim na dtithe, scéim na gCúig Punt, Scéim na mbailtí mora agus an scéim leithreas acu, ní raibh scéim ar bith; agus ina dhiadh sin is uile ní raibh níos mór daoine ag fágáil an t-am sin ná mar atá anois. Tá an t-aos óg ag imeacht anois as tithe maithe, i bhfad níos fearr ná mar a bhí ag na daoine rompu, agus tá siad ag dul go Sasana agus go hAlbain.  Is doilligh sin a thuigbháil. Sílim fhein dá mbeadh seans oibre ag na buachaillí óga nach rachadh an oireadh acu, ar scor ar bith.</P>
    <P>Tá buiochas ag dul do na Rialtais agus do Roinn na Gaeltachta mar gheall-ar na rudai atá deanta le 20 blian agus níos mó.  Rinne siad tionscail a bhunú i dTir Chonaill agus tá siad sin ag dul ar aghaidh go maith. Tá súil agam go mbeidh siad dá méadú ins na blianta atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>D'fheadfaimís tri lá a chaitheamh ar an abhar seo in ionad trí huaire nó mar sin.  Ba cheart go mbeadh níos mó suime againn ins an gcuid sin den tir a d'fhan dílis don teanga agus don náisiúntacht leis na céata blian.  Choinneáil muintir na Gaeltachta ag Ghaeilge beo nuair nach raibh mórán le fáil as.  Mar sin, tá sé beag go leor a iarraidh ar Rialtas náisiunta cuidiú fá leith a thabhairt dóibh.</P>

      <P>Tá ceist na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta dá phlé go láidir i mease an phobail fá láthair. Tá díospóireacht ar siúl agus daoine ag rá nach bhfuil an dul chun cinn a mbeadh daoine ag súil leis déanta i gceist na Gaeilge, agus ag rá go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag dul i luighead, agus go bhfuil labhairt na Gaeilge ins an Ghaeltacht ag dul ar gcúl.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní aontaoím fhein leis na tuairmí sin.  Rinneadh a lán ar son na Gaeltachta ó cuireadh tús leis an Stát. Roimhe sin, bhí daoine a raibh spiorad an naisíúntachais iontu ag obair go cruaidh sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh di ar son na teangan.  I dtosach, chomh fada is a bhaineann sé leis an Ghaeltacht, bhí an bhéim ar fhóirthint ar chultúr na Gaeltachta, an cultúr Gaelach, a choinneál beo ins an <Col N="1398" /> chuid sin den tír ar imeallbhord an iarthair.  Bhí béim fosta ar chluichí Gaelacha, ar dhamhsaí Gaelacha agus mar sin de.  Bhí sár-iarracht á dhéanamh chun daoine óga a thabairt ón Ghalltacht go dtí na Colaistí agus na scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht, go dtí na ceantracha i a bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt iontu.  Sílim féin gurb é an dearmad is mó a rinneadh ansin, go ndearnadh faillí i saol eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta.  Anois tá an baol ann go ndeanfar dearmad ar fad ar an saol culturtha, ar labhairt na teangan, na cluichí Gaeltcha agus mar sin de, agus go mbeidh barríocht béime ar thionscail agus sceimeanna mar seo agus mar siud.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart an dá rud&mdash;fóirthint ar shaol eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta agus gan dearmad den saol culturtha chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Is gá, maradúirt an Teachta Ó Breisleáin, obair a chur ar siúl do na fir óga agus do na cailíní óga ann.  Is fíor gur caitheadh a lán airgid ar scéimeanna éagsúla chun socair na Gaeltachta.  Cuireadh mór-chuid de na buntáisti a ba cheart teacht as na scéimeanna sin ar neamh-ni de dheascaibh na heisimirce as an Ghaeltacht go dtí ní hamháin an choigeríoch, Sasain agus Alba ach go dtí na cathracha móra sa tír seo.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh scéimeanna ar bun a thug roint oibre do na fir sa Ghaeltacht ar feadh cúpla mí nó cúpla seachtain agus tréimhsí mar sin anois is arís ach níl mórán maithis san obair sin mar, nuair a bhíonn an obair críochnaithe, imeoidh na daoine chun obair d'fháil in áitheacha eile.  Is é an aidhm a ba chóir a bheith ag an Rialtas, Roinn na Gaeltachta, agus Bord na Gaeltachta obair leanúnach a chur ar siúl i dtreo go mbeidh na daoine ógra&mdash;go mór mhór na fir óga&mdash;sa Ghaeltacht ábalta obair d'fhail ó thús go deireadh na bliana nó, pé, scéal é, ar feadh mór-chuid den bhliain.  Is féidir sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Sa Ghaeltacht, tá go leor talaimh nach bhfuil dá úsáid fé láthair&mdash; talamh nach bhfuil ag tabhairt buntáiste ar bith do na daoine.  Is féidir an talamh sin a úsáid agus scéimeanna foraoiseachta a chur ar siúl agus in áit mór-chuid den phlanndáil atá ar <Col N="1399" /> siúl a bheith in oirthear na tíre ba cheart níos mó a thabhairt don iarthar.  In áiteachta ar nós Cill Manntáin táthar a rá go bhfuiltear ag dul ró-fhada leis an bhforaoiseacht agus go bhfuiltear ag úsáid talaimh atá oiriúnach i gcóir talamhaíochta agus mar sin de.  Dá gcuirfí scéimeanna forleithne foraoiseachta ar siúl i ngach Gaeltacht bheadh dhá bhuntáiste acu. Ar an gcéad dul síos thabharfadh sé obair leanúnach do na fir ansin agus ina dhiaidh sin thabharfadh sé buntaiste don tír ar fad.</P>
    <P>Rud eile, dá ndéanfaí na scéimeanna a leathnú ar fuaid imeallbhoird an iarthair, tar éis roinnt bliain thiocfadh as go gcuirfí feabhas ar aeráid na tíre.  Tagann an ghaoth ar feadh an chuid is mó den bhliain ón iarthar. Thiocfadh le crios foraoiseachta maolú a chur ar an bhfliuchra agus an stoirm, agus bheadh buntáiste na haeráide le fáil ní hamháin sa Ghaeltacht ach ar fud imeallbhoird na tíre ar fad san iarthar.</P>
    <P>Ag tagairt do cheist na hoibre leanúnaí arís, is féidir an iascaireacht fheabhsú ó Thir Chonaill do dtí Corcaigh.  Dúradh nach bhfuilimid ach ag baint greama anso agus ansúd as tionscal na hiascaireachta ar fuaid na tíre go léir.  Cén fáth nach gcuirfí tosach le scéim fiúntach chun tionscal na hiascaireachta a chur ar a chosa mar atá sé i dtíortha eile agus go gcuirfí tús leis an dtionscal sin sa Ghaeltacht?</P>
    <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos ba cheart báid a chur ar fáil do na hiascairí atá ina gcónaí na Ghaeltacht.  Tá taithí acu ar na báid beaga ó 30 troigh go dtí 40 troigh.  Níl taithí acu ar na báid atá níos mó ná sin.  Tá eagla orthu báid den tsaghas sin a fháil mar tá baol ann nach mbeadh siad ábalta íoc as na báid sin.  Ba cheart don Roinn deimhin a dhéanamh de go dtabharfaí eolas dóibh ar conas na báid so a láimhseáil agus na gléasraí nua-aoise, cosúil leis an radar, a láimhseáil.</P>
    <P>Má deintear sin, sílim féin go dtiocfaidh feabhas ar an iascaireacht san iarthar agus ní bheidh an baol céanna ann go bhfágfaidh na hiascairí a gcuid bád ar an gcladach agus go raghaidh <Col N="1400" /> siad go hAlbain nó go Sasain.  Sin mar atá an scéal fé láthair.  Tá iascairí maithe ann ach níl na gléasraí acu.</P>
    <P>In áiteacha, chuir na daoine suas lena lán cruatain agus a lán contúirt ar an aigéan Atlantach ach níl aos og an lae inniú sásta an cruatan céanna d'fhulang.  Aontaím leo.  Ní cheart go mbeadh orthu an cruatan céanna d'fhulang.  Le 15 bliana anuas tá gléasraí ann a chuidíonn leis na hiascairí chun níos mó iasc d'fháil agus a ghníonn an obair níos réidhe agus níos furasta dhóibh.</P>
    <P>Fosta, cé go bhfuil an talamh atá acu sa Ghaeltacht olc&mdash;agus an-olc in áiteacha&mdash;ní cóir dúinn an talamh sin a &ldquo;scríobh amach&rdquo; agus a rá nach féidir son rud a dhéanamh leis.  Is féidir.  Chruthaigh scéim na dtrátaí i gCloch an Fhaoilligh gur féidir tionscal proifitiúil a dhéanamh as an drochthalamh. Cuireadh na tithe gloine sin ar siúl agus tá na feirmeoirí ábalta cuid mhaith airgid a dhéanamh dá bhárr.  Is féidir an rud céanna a dhéanamh i nGaeltachtaí eile agus is féidir dul níos fuide ná trataí.</P>
    <P>Tá foilsiúcháin Ghaeilge a bhfuil díol ortha ins an Ghaeltacht agus mór-chuid aca ag fáil deontaisí ón Roinn Oideachais.  Cuirim ar shúile an Aire gur ceart deontas a thabhairt do cheann acu i dTír Chonaill go bhfuil a lán díol air agus atá ag déanamh obhair an-mhaith, sé sin &ldquo;Amarach&rdquo;. Ní féidir liom a thuiscint cén fáth nach bhfuil deontas le fáil aige nuair atá sí le fáil ag foilsiúcháin eile, cuid acu nach bhfuil comh maith leis.</P>
    <P>Molaim don Aire an obair atá ar siúl aige i dtaobh scéimeanna, agus mar sin de, a choinneál agus a leathnú ach gan dearmad a dhéanamh, san gnó seo faoi'n saol eacnamaíchta, ar shaol cultúrtha na Gaeltachta chomh maith.</P>

Mar sin táim buíoch as na móltaí agus na comhairlí a <Col N="1401" /> tugadh inniu.  Is mór an chabhair na moltaí sin d'fháil agus más féidir aon rud a dhéanamh in a dtaobh ar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta déanfaidh mé é, Níl ach foireann bhéag againn agus ní féidir gach rud a dhéanamh ar an bpointe.

      <P>Deputy Lindsay appears to think that I have some special reason for what he calls covering up as far as Gaeltarra Eireann is concerned.  There is no reason in the world why I should try to cover up anybody or anything in connection with Gaeltarra Eireann.</P>

      <P>The matters to which Deputy Lindsay has been referring have occurred.  The complaints are that they did occur before ever I became Minister for the Gaeltacht.  Some of them occurred, I think, when Deputy Blowick was Minister for the Gaeltacht and the accounting system and the complaints about which Deputy Lindsay is so verbose now were in existence there when he himself was Minister for the Gaeltacht, in respect of which, let me add, there was no change made by Deputy Lindsay when he was Minister.</P>

      <P>I want to refer briefly to the Report of the Committee on Public Accounts which has been quoted here. I want to make it clear that the report of that committee on the facts before them was, in my view, thoroughly justified.  What I did point out to Deputy Lindsay by way of interruption was that these stocktaking figures that were before the committee were wrong and that it has been discovered&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall explain to the <Col N="1402" /> Deputy if he has sufficient patience to listen for a few moments.  I shall quote what the committee said at page xv of their report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...The evidence indicated that when an attempt was made to assess what tweed should be in store at 31st March, 1956&mdash;by aggregating receipt vouchers and issue vouchers &mdash;a surplus of 30,000 yards emerged. Questioned regarding this discrepancy the accounting officer advanced the view that the stocktaking must have been incorrect as the 1957 stocktaking on the same basis revealed a surplus of only 8,000 yards.  The committee feels that the little reliance can be placed on these figures.  In its view while the discrepancies might have been due to faulty stocktaking, they might equally be attributable to other causes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That figure of 30,000 yards was due to faulty stocktaking on the 31st March, 1955.  It has now been discovered that although the physical stock was correctly taken, in making out the summary for the whole Department portions of the stock were omitted.  Whoever was preparing the summary evidently slipped up and portion of the stock that was in fact there was omitted.  At that time, on the 31st March, 1955, had the correct figures been given the physical stock would have tallied quite closely with the notional, stock that should be there on paper.  When I saw this I thought that some mistake must have been made in the stocktaking.  I should point out that this mistake would account for a major proportion of that difference of 30,000 yards of the stock and that the basis on which the Committee on Public Accounts thought that 22,000 yards were missing was erroneous by virtue of the fact that this mistake was made in bringing out the totals of the physical stock after the physical stocktaking.</P>

      <P>It means that that has been accounted for and I am satisfied, in the light of the papers and the accounts that will now be supplied to <Col N="1403" /> the Auditor-General and possibly to the Committee on Public Accounts&mdash;I am not quite sure what the procedure is&mdash;that they will be satisfied that this stock that both the committee and the accounting officer thought was missing when they were dealing with the matter was not in fact missing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that when this matter from the Public Accounts Committee came along in the ordinary way to the Department for the Gaeltacht, a check was made on the figures prepared and submitted to the Public Accounts Committee and that this has now been discovered&mdash; that they did in fact make this omission in compiling the stock lists and these figures.  They have discovered the mistake and these figures are now being submitted to the Auditor-General. I have no doubt that, if the Auditor-General is not satisfied, he will say so; but what I am pointing out is that when the stocktaking&mdash;and I will underline the time it happened; it started on 31st of March, 1955&mdash;was accepted as being wrong, of course the position was that it was wrong since; the position was wrong at the end of the year naturally, and wrong all down the line.  It would now appear that the major portion of that 30,000 yards is accounted for by the fact that part of the summary of the stock was left out in the final summary submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is as far as I want to go in dealing with the report of this committee, except to say, of course, that they were quite right on the information before them, as to their report.  I also want to say that the accounting system followed out over a number of years was not satisfactory.  It was anything but satisfactory from a business point of <Col N="1404" /> view.  That system has been changed and a different type of stock records is now being kept, and the system has been in operation since last October in Gaeltarra Eireann.  The records they had were not at all adequate for the job that has to be done.  Possibly the system of records which they had might have been sufficient years ago when their turn-over was very small and when the business of Gaeltarra Éireann was very small.  That system would be completely inadequate for the business that has been carried on in recent times by Gaeltarra Eireann, a business with a turnover of practically £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>I understand the Auditor-General is to check the new system that has been introduced and he is to say whether he considers it satisfactory or otherwise. I do not think he has done so. Possibly he is waiting for the other figures to go back to him from Gaeltarra Éireann.  In my view, the present system which was introduced in October last is quite a good system and is quite adequate for the purpose it has to serve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>And was necessary and was introduced.  I should also say that the accounting officer who was the accounting officer before the Public Accounts Committee is not now responsible for Gaeltarra Eireann, and the figures relate, in the main, back to the year 1955-56&mdash;I assume from 31st March, 1955.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made by Deputy Lindsay to a case against an official and it is correct&mdash;I have got the latest information about this matter&mdash;that this official did misappropriate funds, I think Deputy Lindsay said £300; in actual fact, it was £219.  The position he held was cashier and I suppose it is not the first time that we have had complaints of this sort.  From my experience in the Cabinet, unfortunately, civil servants from time to time do get into trouble of this kind and not alone are they dismissed, but where money is misappropriated, they are prosecuted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In this instance, this money was misappropriated by this <Col N="1405" /> man and evidently the misappropriation was discovered.  When it was discovered, he confessed to the irregularities and undertook to pay back the amount involved, which he did long before court proceedings were instituted against him.  The money was paid back by this unfortunate man, but in all cases of this kind the Department of Finance, as I understand the procedure, insist on prosecutions being brought, irrespective of what the position may be in regard to repayments. This man was duly prosecuted for misappropriating this money, which, as I say, had been paid back before the prosecution was brought.  He was dismissed before the prosecution and when the case came to court, I am informed that appeals were made by his advisers on compassionate grounds, that he had a young family and that he had succeeded in getting another job and if a conviction was recorded against him, he would lose the employment he had succeeded in getting.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, the Minister for Finance agreed not to press the prosecution&mdash;in view of the fact that the money had been repaid and the fact that he would lose the employment that he now has, if a conviction were recorded against him.  It was for that reason, and solely for that reason, that the Attorney-General did not tender evidence when the case came before the court again, so that he would be enabled to continue in the employment he now has.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In the years gone by when the Estimates for this Department came before the House, the fact that the accounts of Gaeltarra Eireann were not conducted on a satisfactory system evidently was not then adverted to by anybody.  It is true that, from a business point of view, the business carried out by Gaeltarra Eireann was completely, unsuited to the Civil Service system under which it has to work.  The people who were there, and the civil servants in particular, were trying to do the best they could under the system they had.  The system they had, as far as any businessman would look at it, was a complete joke.  That has been put on record by some American consultants who were called in some time ago to look over their operations.  It was for that reason and because the Civil Service system was unsuitable for running, a business of this kind, that the Bill, providing for the new board was brought in here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay asked about the new board.  I did not think there was any necessity for me to give the names of the members of the board to the House; I thought everybody knew all about them&mdash;and possibly Deputy Lindsay does, too.  The four members appointed are experienced businessmen, with one exception; and that individual has a very long connection with the Galway Gaeltacht and has done a tremendous amount of work there.  To my mind, he was a very suitable person to have on that board. I should say, in case there is any misunderstanding, that the Secretary of my Department, Mr. Ó Braonáin, is there only in a temporary capacity.  I made that arrangement for two reasons.  The first reason was that it would be unfair to any board that I should pick their chief executive officer, without the board themselves having a say in the matter and trying to find an individual qualified and satisfactory from their point of view.  Secondly, we are engaged in the change-over period, when it would be useful for me to have the Secretary of my Department there while the board are building up their own organisation and when <Col N="1410" /> we are getting back a number of the civil servants still employed in Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would not like to give a third or more cogent reason?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Secretary of my Department is there in a purely temporary capacity.  Immediately we find a suitably qualified man as managing director for Gaeltarra Eireann, Mr. Ó Braonáin will resign from that board and the new man will come in.  It is not very easy to get the type of man who is qualified and experienced in this work from the business point of view and who also has a thorough knowledge of the Irish language.  However, when they do not get the man and are satisfied that he is suitably qualified, Mr. Ó Braonáin will come off the board and the new managing director will go on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lindsay or some other Deputy raised a question as to the figure of the Grant-in-Aid we have here. That figure is the difference between the expenses of the board and the amount which was estimated will come into the board from sales.  That is the basis on which it is done this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking generally of the board and its functions and powers, it appears to me that Deputy McMenamin did not follow the debate when the Bill was going through the Dáil under which this board is established.  Firstly, the board are charged with the duty of running the existing Gaeltacht industries, with the exception of Arramara, Teoranta. The reason why Arramara, Teoranta, was specifically excluded from the Bill is that it was a company in which the Minister is a shareholder but there is also an outside concern with a shareholding in it; and the outside concern is located the other side of the water and it is through them that the products of Arramara, Teoranta, are sold.  The position is really like that of any private company in which there are other shareholders.  That was why it was not brought under this new board.  This board have the power to extend any of the existing rural Gaeltacht industries, if they can, and to start any new industries which <Col N="1411" /> would appear to them to be feasible in the different Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>As to any directions given, to the board, they were told that they could work in close co-operation with Córas Tráchtála Teoranta andn that their job is to extend, if they can, the existing industries; and if they can get new industries going, all the better.  Their first job is to reorganise the existing industries.  I understand they are now engaged in that task.  So far, at all events, I have received no complaint about the board, whatever Deputy Lindsay may say of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said anything about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, they are a very competent board.  The members were chosen because they were the most suitable I could find and they, are, in the main, all very experienced businessmen.  I have the utmost confidence in them and I believe that, given a chance, they will show results.</P>
      <P>Deputy McMenamin also seems to be under another misapprehension.  In the case of any of these new schemes, particularly Scéim na Muc, An Scéim Súgh Talún or the others, all my Department does is provide the money.  We work through the most suitable organisations we can find who have the necessary technical staff and training to carry out these schemes.  For instance, we are working in close co-operation with the county committees of agriculture in different counties.  I am glad to say I have received tremendous co-operation from them and from the local authorities.  These schemes, such as strawberry growing, onion growing and Scéim na Muc, are administered through the county committees of agriculture, and some road schemes are being administered through the different county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a number of other trial schemes in progress at the moment, in addition to those to which I have referred. In addition, we have Scéim na nlnniún and scéim na Bléibiní, growing Dutch bulbs on the Aran Islands. They have been more than successful <Col N="1412" /> in the Outer Hebrides and I hope, for the sake of the Aran people, that, through their experimental plots, their district will prove suitable for that development. The economy of the Gaeltacht areas varies very much as between different counties and different places, and while it would be very difficult to apply a scheme nationally that would suit every Gaeltacht, in my view and in the view of the Department, it is necessary to have a greater amount of flexibility and to try to encourage what may be the most suitable for people in the different Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest for one moment that any of these schemes is the answer to national emigration.  There is emigration from the Gaeltacht, just as there is from the congested districts. In fact, in one way it is surprising that there is not much more emigration even from the Gaeltacht than from other areas, because in the main the worst of the land slums were in these districts.  The people are not now prepared to put up with the standard of living that their fathers or grandfathers were prepared to endure. While I do not suggest that the schemes I am introducing will solve this problem, I do suggest that the provision of these schemes will bring considerable relief to those areas and enable them to make better use of what is already there.  That is the most I can hope for them.</P>
    <P>I hope that with the co-operation of the county committees of agriculture and the local authorities we will be able, during the coming year, to introduce more of these schemes to the different areas and provide at least that much to help the people living there.  I have taken a note of the points made by the other Deputies. I am very glad for Deputies' co-operation and for any suggestion they made to help me to deal with the task I have in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Vote put and agreed to.</P>
