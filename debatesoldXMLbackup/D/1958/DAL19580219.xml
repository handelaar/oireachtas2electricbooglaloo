      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in view of the fact that the language revival policy has failed to make substantial progress in restoring Irish as the spoken language of the people, has created widespread hostility to the language, and has not taken into account the fact that the language is of no advantage to persons who are now emigrating in large numbers, he will arrange to ascertain the wishes of the people, by referendum or otherwise, on the following: (a) the desirability of teaching Irish in the schools as an alternative voluntary subject, and (b) the elimination of Irish as a desirable or essential prior condition for local government or Civil Service posts, or other posts in State-controlled employments (except for posts in the Gaeltacht).</P>

      <P>I do not accept the assumptions on which the Deputy's question is based, and I do not propose to take the steps which he has suggested.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware, however, that it was announced in the Seanad on the 30th ultimo that an inquiry is to be instituted into the present position in regard to the teaching of the Irish language and as to the further steps that should be taken to ensure more rapid progress towards the effective restoration of the language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the fact that the Taoiseach has accepted the necessity for this inquiry, could he not also accept that the basis of my question is correct, and could he not further agree that the reason for the failure of the language revival movement has been the mixture of blackmail, coercion and bribery which has been the basis of policy of successive Governments over the years?  Has this failure not resulted in widespread disrespect for the language throughout the country?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why there is so much cynicism about the whole matter is that successive Legislatures have insisted that young people, children, and civil servants should speak it and that they do not impose the same duty on county councillors, Senators, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries or even Taoiseachs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of a recent calculation suggesting that emigration in the 12 months ended November last amounted to at least 57,000; and if he will comment on the accuracy of this calculation.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the calculation referred to by the Deputy.  I have on several occasions explained in reply to questions by Deputies that it is not possible to prepare reliable estimates of annual emigration, particularly in advance of inter-censal data, and have stated the reasons why this is so.  In such circumstances I am not prepared to comment on the accuracy of the calculation in question.  It should be noted, however, that the calculation is based on the assumption that the net outward passenger balance by sea and air affords a reliable measure of current net emigration.  It is true that for the period from 1951 to 1956 the inter-censal figure for net emigration was almost identical with the net outward passenger balance by sea and air. In earlier periods, however, there was no such concordance between the two sets of figures and there is, therefore, no assurance that the assumption on which the calculation is based is well founded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the numbers of persons engaged <Col N="330" /> in manufacturing industry as returned in the Census of Industrial Production and in the Census of Population for 1926, 1951, and 1956; and if he will further state the reasons for any discrepancies between the two sets of figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;manufacturing industry&rdquo; was not used either in relation to the Census of Population or the Census of Industrial Production prior to the year 1951 so that some degree of approximation is necessary in re-assigning industries to conform with this heading. The number of persons at work in manufacturing industry as returned at the Census of Population, 1926, was 120,400, while in 1951 the corresponding figure was 184,194.  Statistics relating to industry were not compiled in respect of the Census of Population, 1956, but it is estimated that the total number of persons in manufacturing industry in that year was 187,000.  Persons engaged in manufacturing industries covered by the Census of Production numbered 60,300 in 1926 and 140,800 in 1951, the corresponding estimated figure for 1956 being 142,900. The two sets of figures must be expected to differ for the following reasons:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  While the Census of Population covers the entire working population the Census of Industrial Production extends only to businesses with three or more persons (including working proprietors) engaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  In the case of the Census of Population each person is required to state his principal occupation and the business in which he is engaged.  On the other hand a single Census of Industrial Production return covers a number of workers and relates to average numbers employed in the firm over a period.  It is possible, particularly in the case of casual, part-time or outside piece workers, that although persons are shown as employed in a particular industry at the Census of Production, it is not the business in which they are principally engaged, with the result that they are not classified <Col N="331" /> to that industry for Census of Population purposes.</P>
    <P>(c)  The Census of Population relates to a single date whereas the Census of Industrial Production relates to average employment over a period.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the available information. Quarterly inquiries are not made in respect of the employment in the building industry and in public utilities and the available information is obtained at the annual Census of Industrial Production and covers only the concerns included in that inquiry. For the building and construction industry the latest date available relate to 1955 and for public utilities to 1956.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>TOTAL number of persons engaged in (<i>a</i>) concerns covered by the Census of Industrial Production in the building and construction industry and (<i>b</i>) in public utilities (electricity, gas and waterworks undertakings) in the months of March, June, September and December, 1955 and 1956.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the proportion of estimated State capital expenditure in the current year that can be regarded as productive, taking productive expenditure as meaning expenditure yielding a direct return equivalent to the interest charge on the relevant borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As may be seen from Table IV of the tables issued in connection with the Financial Statement, 1957, the estimated amount of capital to be provided from the Exchequer for the purposes of the public capital programme in the current financial year was £38.57 million.  The productivity of State capital expenditure is, however, a difficult question to decide even in relation to past expenditure.  The determining factor cannot be simply whether or not a direct financial return equivalent to the interest charge on the relevant borrowing is received by the Exchequer.  This in fact applies to about one-third of the current year's outlay.  In some cases, however (e.g., Irish Shipping), the return may be earned by the investment but be applied to other agreed purposes (e.g., the purchase of new ships).  In other cases (e.g., afforestation) the question of the adequacy of the return can only <Col N="342" /> be finally determined many years after the investment is made.  Apart from this, public capital expenditure may properly be described as productive if it yields an adequate return to the national economy as a whole, i.e., if it causes an increase in national income resulting in an increase in revenue equivalent to the interest charge on the relevant borrowing.  On this wider basis, a considerable proportion of public capital expenditure is of a productive character.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy refers to the quantities of green wheat likely to be delivered to the mills from the 1958 crop.</P>
      <P>In the Press Notice issued on the 16th January last it was stated that, if wheat production in 1958 were the same as in 1957, the estimated deduction would be of the order of 6/- a barrel.  The quantity of wheat of the 1957 crop delivered to millers is approximately that referred to at (a) in the Deputy's question.  Accordingly, the deduction under (a) would be about 6/- a barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated deductions appropriate to the delivery figures quoted at (b) and (c) are 8/9 and 11/- a barrel, respectively. These estimates are based on the following assumptions:&mdash; (1) that the home market for animal feed will be able to absorb some 40,000 tons of the surplus at prices comparable <Col N="348" /> with those ruling for alternative feeding grains; and (2) that the prices realised for whatever quantity it may be necessary to export will be in line with those ruling at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to assume that if the excess exported or sold as animal feed on the domestic market should yield a lower price than the price currently obtaining for coarse grains, the basic price payable for the total wheat crop would be further reduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can base his calculations on all kinds of assumptions.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to discover in this House so many advocates for the grain grower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke of the contingency arising.  In the event of surplus wheat not realising on the domestic market the current price of coarse grains, or on the export market not realising the current price for imported coarse grains, some contingency would arise.  Am I to understand that any unanticipated loss in respect of these transactions would be reflected in the price payable for the wheat crop as a whole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>These calculations that I have made are based on the only figures that were fair on which to base a calculation, that is, the figures of the present time.  What next year will be like is a matter that I cannot foretell. However, I can at least say this, even though there must be an element of doubt in such matters, regarding the price at which other coarse grain is available to millers and compounders, it is a safe assumption that the price at which surplus wheat would be sold to compounders would have to have a relation to the price of other coarse grains.  Therefore, if we are to assume that the compounders and feeders here could absorb, say, 40,000 tons of <Col N="349" /> any surplus wheat we might have, which would be in line with the estimate for the present year, then there could not be very much difference between the amount realised in respect of the wheat so disposed of and the amount which will be realised this year.  As to what any wheat would make in the foreign market, if any wheat should have to be sold outside the country, the price now is so low that, though it is not impossible, it does not look very likely that it could be still lower.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 35 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>Because of the magnitude of the task that eradication of bovine tuberculosis presents in County Cork, it has been decided that the organisation of the intensive eradication measures will have to be based on creamery supply areas.  It is also desirable, at this stage, to proceed eastwards from County Kerry which is being dealt with as an intensive area.</P>
      <P>Intensive eradication measures on the creamery area basis have now been introduced in some parts of West Cork, and any remaining creamery in the area prepared to organise and assist in the operation of eradication measures in the whole of its supply area will be welcomed as a participant on that basis.  Simultaneously, the development of individual accredited herds will be encouraged to the maximum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture (1) whether treatment of warble fly infestation by oral administration of drugs has been successful in experiments conducted by his Department; and (2) whether he will have an experiment conducted in a selected area for the eradication of warble flies with a view to preventing their propagation, on lines similar to those employed for eradicating tsetse fly as reported in the annual report of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine for 1956-57.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Two experiments have been conducted by the Veterinary Research Laboratory on the use of an organic phosphorous insecticide administered orally for the destruction of warble fly larvae.  For the first experiment the drug was only obtainable by the month of May, 1957, when the warble fly season was well advanced. This experiment showed that the drug was well tolerated at the recommended dosage and no toxic symptoms were observed in the test animals.  The results of the second experiment which was initiated early in December will not be available until the end of the warble fly season&mdash;approximately July next.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, I would prefer to concentrate for the present on the search for a cheap, reliable and safe insecticide for administration orally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The number of pupils who took the Primary Certificate Examination in 1957 was 37,450; of these 29,237 passed.</P>
      <P>(b)  I have nothing further to add to the information given to the Deputy on 1st May, 1957, when he was informed that it had been estimated that about 60 per cent. of children in the 14-15 age group and about 48 per cent. of those in the 15-16 age group were in whole-time attendance at recognised schools.  It will be appreciated that these percentages take no account of children in attendance at private schools, commercial colleges, etc., in relation to which I have no information.</P>
      <P>(c)  As regards the extension of the school leaving age to 15 this appears to me to be a matter of providing increased educational facilities rather than extending compulsorily the age limit.  The number of pupils in the 14-15 age group in attendance at full time courses of education has been increasing steadily year by year as the facilities have been increased.  The fact that the 60 per cent. attendance to which I have just referred has been achieved is evidence of this.  The facilities are continuing to increase and with them the percentage attendance. Therefore, I do not feel called upon at present to consider the compulsory extension of the school leaving age to 15.</P>
      <P>(d) 14,905 children between 13 and 14 years of age in the school year 1956-57 had not reached the sixth standard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There were, in December, 1957, 821 schools which it was considered were defective in various respects and should be replaced by new schools.  Grants had been sanctioned by my Department for the erection of 136 of the required new buildings.  The cases of those 821 defective schools are of varying degrees of urgency.  Conditions in some of the schools are such that there is pressing need for the erection of new schools. In others the need for replacement is not so urgent.  The number of existing schools which could be considered to be actually unfit for occupation would be very small.</P>
      <P>The total number of new schools completed in the years from 1947 to 1956 was 435.</P>
      <P>If the present rate of school building is maintained, a period of at least 15 years will be required to provide new schools in all the cases where existing schools are regarded as in need of replacement.  As the Deputy was informed in reply to his previous question on 1st May, 1957, there are, however, a number of factors, financial and other, which make it impossible for me to say, with any degree of accuracy, when all the new schools which are required will be provided. The Deputy may rest assured that every effort is being made, and will continue to be made, to achieve that position.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state what steps have been taken regarding the proposed new school to be built at Kilruane, Nenagh, County Tpperary; how long the plans have been before his Department; and the reason for the delay in dealing with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>A suitable site has been offered by the reverend manager for a new national school at Kilruane, County Tipperary, and sketch plans of the building were furnished by the Commissioners of Public Works to my <Col N="375" /> Department in September, 1956.  Following the receipt of the plans it was necessary to make certain arrangements, with which the reverend manager and my Department were concerned, before a grant towards the cost of the school could be sanctioned. These arrangements were completed and the grant was sanctioned by my Department in May, 1957.  There was no avoidable delay on the part of my Department in dealing with the case.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the Commissioners of Public Works to make arrangements to enable tenders for the new school to be invited.  The commissioners will not, however, be in a position to proceed in the matter until the reverend manager has had a well sunk on the site with a view to obtaining a supply of water for the sanitation system at the new school.  I understand that the well sinking is in progress.</P>

      <P>A grant for the erection of a new national school at Cloughbrack, Clonbur, County Galway, has not yet been sanctioned by my Department.</P>

    <P>A site for the proposed new school <Col N="376" /> has been offered by the reverend manager and my Department awaits a report from the Commissioners of Public Works as to its suitability.  If the site is regarded as suitable, certain preliminary arrangements will have to be made before a grant towards the cost of the new school can be sanctioned.  These arrangements will necessarily take a considerable time to complete, but they will be expedited as far as possible.</P>

    <Title>Tea (Purchase and Importation) Bill, 1957&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned on Thursday last, I was dealing with this Bill on the basis that it was one which not alone would create many abuses, but that the real and underlying objection we must have to it is that it is a restrictive trade practice and interferes considerably with the trading habits of individuals. If, indeed, this Bill were being brought before the House to deal with an emergency situation, one could see very little to object to on that basis; but there is not such an emergency as would make it necessary to bring before the House a measure of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know, as I am sure the House wants to know, how the provisions of this Bill will alter the existing practice, and, moreover, what is the necessity for altering the existing practice, if there is not indeed a necessity for removing the existing practice entirely?  As I understand the <Col N="385" /> supply position in regard to tea, four-fifths of the supplies are sold in London where there is the bigger market and consequently the bigger selection. I am not advocating the purchase of tea in Mincing Lane, or Amsterdam, or Calcutta, but I say the traders of this country should be allowed to revert to the position in which they had freedom to purchase tea of the quality needed and at the price they thought would suit the consumers best.</P>
    <P>The Minister, intervening on Thursday last, told me that this Bill was to promote competition.  On the strength of that interjection, I have read the Bill again and I have gone through the Minister's opening speech and nowhere can I find any provision that would promote competition.  In theory, it might be argued that the competitive spirit would be there, but when you look at the practice, it is very hard to visualise a situation where the small or moderate wholesalers would place themselves in the position of asking for shares in this company so that they could enter into the business of tea buying in the East.  In my view, the small or moderate wholesaler cannot buy in the East, for the two simple reasons that the capital requirements are too great and delivery too slow. Accordingly, it is my belief that this Bill will result, possibly, not even in the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i> but in a further reduction in the number of people actively engaged in the tea trade and profiting therefrom.</P>
    <P>I understand the total tea requirements of this country are something like 24,000,000 lbs., and if anybody cares to work out one penny profit per lb. on that, he will find that it amounts to something like £100,000 and a profit of 5d. accordingly, would reach a figure of somewhere near £500,000.  I should like to know what would be the approximate cost over and above the average cost of tea on a free trade basis, through running the business through a company such as that envisaged in this Bill?  I think it will need some explaining to get rid of the coercive nature of this view&mdash;the expenses entailed in the operations of a company such as this will make it necessary to have the price of tea higher; whereas if the company did not <Col N="386" /> exist and if the trade were allowed to be dealt with in the manner in which other commodities that we have to import are dealt with, the price would, of necessity, be lower.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know how the company to be formed under this Bill will alter the existing arrangements? I shall not state as a fact here some information that has been placed at my disposal since Thursday last, but I want to ask a specific question in regard to it, and it is this: under the existing system, are the agents in Calcutta, who now act as brokers for Tea Importers, branches of the London dealers, so that, in effect, this whole business of Tea Importers&mdash;not alone the existing body but the body envisaged in the new Bill&mdash;is mere window-dressing to get rid of the necessity of even the voluntary activity of purchasing in Mincing Lane?</P>
    <P>If it is true that the agents who purchase in Calcutta for Tea Importers Ltd. at the present time are merely branches of the London dealers, will that situation continue under the provisions of this Bill, and if so, why? Would it not be better, if the Minister and the Government are unwilling to go back to what the position was before the present Tea Importers company was set up, if they are unwilling to go back to a free trade situation in regard to tea, as in the case of so many other commodities, to allow an experimental period in which the present Tea Importers company could operate and in which wholesale tea traders could operate also on a free basis, so that we might be able to ascertain whether that experimental period would answer the questions so pertinent at the moment, namely, the possible improvement in the quality of tea and the possible reduction in price, or even maintenance of the present prices with adequate maintenance of the quality of tea.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to take up the time of the House at any greater length, but I would like the questions that have been posed answered, and, above all, that we should be clearly shown without any doubt what advantage will accrue to the tea drinkers and consumers generally of tea in this country from activities arising out of the provisions <Col N="387" /> of a Bill such as this and the activities of people engaged freely in the tea trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggested that the aim of this Bill was to continue the policy which operated in the war years to ensure direct purchase and importation of tea from the countries in which tea is grown. I think that is a most desirable and laudable objective and the advantages are quite evident to any thinking person.</P>
      <P>Most of the ground in connection with the advantages has been covered by other speakers and I do not propose to elaborate very much on that aspect, but it is no harm to emphasise the fact that direct trade relationships between ourselves and other countries are highly desirable.  For too long we have depended on the agent and the middleman with his headquarters in London or elsewhere to supply us with essential material or products, and it is a step in the right direction to have direct contact on a business-like basis between ourselves and the other countries in matters of trade, whether it is a question of imports or exports.</P>
      <P>The important point we should remember is that since the temporary body known as Tea Importers, Limited, was set up to deal with the importation of tea, that direct line has been available; in other words during the emergency period and up to this date Tea Importers, Limited, have supplied this country with its requirements of tea.  Complaints are made from time to time by the public about the quality of the tea.  I am no expert on tea. The older generation in rural areas were tea experts.  The smaller the holder, the poorer the individual in rural Ireland, the dearer the brand of tea that he bought.  Over the past 12 years, the tea expert in rural Ireland has disappeared.  The younger people have no experience of the excellent tea that was available 15 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years, there appears to have been some criticism about the quality of tea.  I suggest that the reason why tea has not been up to its former standard is that conditions have changed in the countries of origin. <Col N="388" /> For instance, in India, which has been our main supplier, the economic conditions of the worker have improved. The wage structure and conditions of employment have changed greatly with the result that prices of tea have rocketed.  When we purchase tea in that market, we have to pay a high price for what some years ago would have been considered inferior tea.  In my opinion, that is the main reason for the fact that the quality is not up to the former standard.  We cannot afford to pay the high price that would be charged now for the better quality tea.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the criticism that has been levelled at Tea Importers, Limited, that, due to their intervention, an inferior quality of tea has been available, is not justified.  The reduction in the quality of tea here is not due to Tea Importers, Limited, but to the fact that the cost of tea in the country of origin has increased in the past 15 or 20 years.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what any Deputy may say, it is my opinion that the quality of tea available here will not be improved, unless we pay exorbitant prices for very high quality tea.  That brings me to the main point to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>If it is admitted&mdash;and I think Deputy Norton was one of those who did admit it&mdash;that the alleged poor quality of tea available here to-day and for years past is not due to the actions of Tea Importers, Limited, but is due to the causes I have mentioned, why is it necessary to set up this new body?  The Minister has put it on record in this House that Tea Importers, Limited, which he set up, did an excellent job. They sought tea from all quarters during a very difficult period of emergency, and succeeded to an admirable extent in meeting our requirements and, since 1947, have carried out an excellent job. They provided this country with tea at reasonable prices, in spite of the fact, which the Minister has himself indicated, that the market at times fluctuated rather widely.  In spite of that, they maintained prices here at a reasonable level.  We should appreciate their work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> It should be remembered that Tea Importers, Limited, was a State concern, a non-profit-making company, whose main object was to provide tea of a type and quality suitable to our people.  In supplying such tea, no profit was to be made by those who organised the importation of tea.  Tea Importers, Limited, worked on bank accommodation sanctioned by the Minister for Finance.  In my opinion, their work cannot be criticised.</P>
    <P>If all that I have said about Tea Importers, Limited, is true&mdash;and I think the Minister agreed with me&mdash;what is the reason for abolishing Tea Importers, Limited, and substituting a new company to be called the Tea Importation Co. 1958?  Why is it necessary to set up a company that will have complete powers with regard to tea imports, the members of which will be entitled to dividends or profits?  Where any group are given by the State full powers in connection with trade and commerce, they should be given those powers only on the basis that they are non-profit-making, or if profits are made, that they will be ploughed back into the business for the benefit of the consumer or user.</P>
    <P>The Bill envisages the establishment of a company which, in my opinion, will be a ring.  All tea must be imported through this ring or combine and the people who run the combine will be entitled to profits like any normal trading company.  There will be no competition of any description and no single importer of tea here at the moment wil be entitled to go outside that company to purchase tea.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand Deputy Norton's approach to this matter.  He suggested that this was in the nature of a cooperative or vocational movement.  It is anything but that.  Tea Importers, Limited, is a State body.  There are no dividends available to shareholders or anybody else and, therefore, the question of a combine, which can charge any price it likes for tea, does not arise.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter and, instead of setting up this new company, to establish Tea Importers, Limited, on a permanent <Col N="390" /> basis.  It has been admitted already that we will not get tea of a much better quality, one way or the other.  If that is the case, what is the necessity for setting up this company or combine which will allow profits to the shareholders and prevent outside interested parties from purchasing tea independently?</P>
    <P>Two points of view have been expressed in this House so far.  The point of view expressed on the Government side is that this is a desirable move because it will ensure direct contact in the importation of tea between the country of origin and the consumer here.  The Opposition take the view that we should go back to the old system that was in operation pre-war, namely, every man for himself&mdash;let our tea importers go to Mincing Lane, or anywhere they like, as individuals.  I do not agree with either viewpoint.  I believe we should maintain the <i>status quo,</i> that is, continue with Tea Importers, Limited, who have done an excellent job up to the present.</P>
    <P>I do not like to be too critical on this issue.  We know that, over the years, Tea Importers, Limited, have dealt in tea in this country to the extent of £5,500,000 per annum.  That is a nice sum of money.  It was dealt with by a State company on a non-profit-making basis.  Now, that very same turnover of £5,500,000 will be dealt with by a combine composed of individuals who will purchase shares at £2,500 per share and who will be entitled to their rake-off out of the £5,500,000.  Is that necessary or desirable?</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back to what Deputy Dillon and other speakers have mentioned&mdash;a free-for-all business. Neither do I accept the Minister's new approach on this Bill.  Consequently, the only thing I can do at this stage&mdash;if it is possible&mdash;is to insert amendments with a view to maintaining the <i>status quo.</i>  On that basis, therefore, I do not propose to vote for the Government or with the Opposition at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>Justifiably complimentary references have been made to Tea Importers (Éire) Limited&mdash;a body set up during the emergency when our tea <Col N="391" /> supplies were threatened with a 75 per cent. cut.  Everybody in this House appreciates the work they did.  However, operating on a non-profit basis, it would be inhuman to expect that, in normal times, they would put the same drive and initiative into their work as an ordinary commercial business firm.</P>
      <P>In my view, the steps envisaged in this Bill are ill-advised.  The Bill is a reflection on the wholesale tea dealers in this country.  It shows the Minister's want of faith in them.  It entirely cuts across private enterprise and free choice.  A reversion to the old system, that has been criticised by Deputy McQuillan, is much preferable now.</P>
      <P>In the light of what has eventuated during the course of this debate, I earnestly appeal to the Minister, in introducing this Bill to extend the period of responsibility of the present company for another three months, to extend it, rather, to 12 months until the wholesale tea dealers can find their feet, come together of their own volition, form a company and import, either collectively or individually.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if there was a very representative consultation among these wholesale tea dealers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have several tea wholesalers in Cork.  I doubt if more than two or three of them were present at the conference.  We are reputed as a nation to be amongst the greatest tea drinkers in the world.  It is obvious to a business man in the tea trade that there is a great market here, if he has the initiative and enterprise to provide for it.  The market is worth from £5,000,000 to £6,000,000 per annum. Any business man in a trade with such a capital value as £5,000,000 to £6,000,000 should be very interested in trying to secure the market here&mdash;trying to provide the commodity at a basic price <Col N="392" /> and trying to provide the best quality tea available in the world's markets for the consumers of that commodity in this country.  Tea is an indispensable part of our diet in the present age and there will always be a demand for it.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of employment. Wherever we get our tea, the same amount of employment will be given.  Is it not imported in large tea chests?  Would it not be better if the employment given in Dublin now were to be decentralised so that part of it would be available at our various ports as well as at Dublin?  Deputy Lindsay mentioned that London handles from three-fourths to four-fifths of the world's tea distribution. At London, they import in colossal bulk.  Because of that bulk importation, they are able to reduce their shipping costs and put tea on the market at a lower price than that at which we can buy it.  Is it not true that at present you can buy a much better quality tea at a cheaper price in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain than in the Twenty-Six Counties? If Great Britain handles four-fifths of the tea distribution of the world&mdash;that of Africa, parts of Europe, the United States and Canada&mdash;I do not see any reason why they should not supply this little island which is so close to them.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that the price of tea is very high in this country and that its quality is very inferior.  We also know, only too well, that the price of tea impacts very heavily on the family budget.  In these days of rising costs, would it not be a great relief if tea of a better quality could be made available at a cheaper rate to our people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill, it is proposed that there will be shareholders in this company. How many shareholders will be prepared to put up the sum of £2,500 in order to be included in the company? I doubt if there are very many people at the moment who can afford to do so.  If persons are forced to go to the bank in order to raise that capital so that they may share in the benefits of the company, it will mean that they will have to get the interest on that capital through the goods which they <Col N="393" /> are selling across the counter in their shops, with the result that the price of tea will be forced even higher than it is to-day.  I am afraid this company will be very exclusive and that it will compel the smaller trader to buy from the larger trader.  I am afraid it will cause a ring because those who will operate and monopolise the company are the wealthy wholesale tea dealers in this State.</P>
    <P>We know very well that there has been a great change in times, circumstances and general conditions the world over since our tea traders operated freely, prior to the last war. Distance has greatly been minimised and it is much easier now to make contacts.  There is greater accessibility to the different world markets. In this country, where we look for the enterprise and free choice which we so badly need, the natural thing would be to let the tea position revert to that which obtained before the setting up of Tea Importers (Éire), Limited, by the Minister during the emergency.</P>
    <P>I think that interference by the State has gone too far.  Sometimes, on reflection, one realises the extraordinary grip which the State now has on several lines of business in this country.  Do we intend to add further to that grip by passing a Bill of this kind?  Do we want to circumvent the liberties, energies and activities of the wholesale tea dealers of this country who, in their own, as well as in the national interest, should be prepared to buy the product in the world's markets and sell it to people ready to buy it?  As long as we have free competition we have nothing to fear, but we will have no free competition under this Bill and, I am afraid, our last state will be far worse than our first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody in the House must be interested in this Bill. The people of Ireland are amongst those with the biggest <i>per capita</i> consumption of tea in the world.  This Bill, under the provisions of which tea will be bought, will affect wholesalers, retailers and, in fact, each and every one of us.  The Minister in introducing it said the time has now come to wind up Tea Importers, Limited, the organisation which was brought into being <Col N="394" /> during the emergency period for the purpose of getting over the difficulties that then faced us.  In its place he proposes to substitute Tea Importers, Limited, 1958, a private company.</P>
      <P>It does seem strange to me that the tea importers of Ireland, engaged in such an extensive trade as we have here, should not be left alone to manage their own affairs.  The Minister, in his opening statement, substantiated his arguments in favour of this company by saying that it would give considerable employment in the packing, handling and distribution of tea.  He also said the organisation was being set up for the purpose of ensuring direct supplies from the countries of origin.  He outlined a scheme for the company whereby it would have a capital of £250,000; there were to be £100 shares and no one was to be allowed to have more than £2,500 invested in it.  I doubt very much if there are 100 people in the country who are in a position to put down £2,500 to join this company.  Whether there are or not, is it seriously suggested that, with the enormous quantity of tea handled in this country, a company with a capital of £250,000 will be in a position to import tea direct?</P>
      <P>By direct importation of tea, I assume it is intended that we shall have direct agents buying that tea in the countries of origin, in India and Ceylon.  Is it suggested that this company will be sufficiently strong to buy a year's supply of tea in the four months of the year during which it is bought, from August on?  I am wondering where they are to get the money and I think Deputy Dillon made this point also.  Unless they go to the banks to look for money, they will not have sufficient capital.  Everybody knows that already there are many people looking for money from the banks.  Credit has been frozen and we are already short of credit for productive schemes in this country.  Now we must have this Bill to impose further credit restriction and a cash charge on the limited amount of capital available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how Tea Importers 1958 is to work nor do I know what <Col N="395" /> was in the Minister's mind in introducing this measure.  I do know that he has decided to set up an organisation or company for the tea traders. He says anyone is free to join the company but the first objection to that is that a person wishing to join it must have £2,500 to enable him to do so. Do the tea wholesalers or retailers want this Bill?  The Minister says &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  We have only his word for it. He says they had an organisation meeting and, as far as I gather, they asked him to bring into effect this system of control.  It is the same old story.  Free trading in tea existed in this country for many years under private enterprise.  This Government is supposed to be dedicated to private enterprise.  We have precedents for private enterprise.  For 100 years or more the tea dealers bought where and whenever they wanted but during the emergency period it was found necessary to create the tea importers' organisation to meet the particular contingencies of the time.  It is now the same old story&mdash;what the State takes hold of it never likes to give up.  The Minister has said that we must not let this thing go free altogether.  He has put forward the argument for keeping the State interested on the grounds that he wants to ensure that we will get a good supply of tea.</P>
    <P>With the demand for tea in this country, the high consumption of tea, the extraordinary amount of tea that comes in annually, 24,000,000 lb.&mdash;with that huge trade running into £5,000,000 or £6,000,000, is it not quite obvious that business interests, live business interests, will be concerned to see that these supplies are maintained?  I am satisfied these business interests are fully competent to do that on their own without a Bill being forced on them by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>We are to have control and regulations. If there is to be a company, it is highly desirable that it should be composed of Irish nationals and people trading in Ireland, but even with those we are to have official controls.  If we are to have departmental filing, we shall have more civil servants, but the Government has said they are dedicated <Col N="396" /> to reducing the overhead costs of the State.  I do not think this Bill is moving in that direction, the right direction.  I call this a piece of futile legislation.  As Deputy McQuillan has said, if you want to maintain control why not leave the existing state of affairs as it is?  I do not feel that we should leave the existing state of affairs as it is; I feel we should go back to private enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Minister has talked about its being necessary to have importation of tea from countries of origin.  It has been stated in this House that four-fifths of the world's tea, which comes from Ceylon and India, goes to London.  Is it seriously suggested that this company will be able to enter the world market against competition such as that, a company with a capital of £250,000, if it will have that capital? Is it seriously suggested it can enter world markets and be able to compete favourably with such big interests?  Is it seriously suggested that under this measure we will get cheaper and better tea in Ireland?</P>
    <P>It is a fact that since this debate started last week two members of the Minister's Party spoke on this Bill and did not support it fully.  One Deputy made a courageous speech about what he believed to be the truth.  He does not believe in this Bill.  Another Fianna Fáil Deputy said that things were so bad under Tea Importers Limited he thought they would not be any worse under this Bill.  The only other support the Minister got came from Deputy Norton who considers that the company to be set up under this Bill will be a vocational organisation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke very wisely on this measure and pointed out that a penny in the lb. on the price of tea would amount to £100,000.  There is not much of a vocational organisation about anything that stands to make £100,000.  The people of Ireland will realise after a bit that they will have another monopolistic, monolithic control under this Bill.  It is high time we got away from that type of control.  The Minister in his day has introduced many of these types of things in which the State has control but have they been a success?  I think not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> The Minister is representing this country in the very important discussions that are taking place in Europe at the moment for the establishment of a Free Trade Area.  In our morning papers to-day, we read that he declared that things have already advanced remarkably and that we are well on the road to the establishment of such an area.  Does he realise&mdash;I am sure he does, because he is an intelligent man who has been attending these discussions in Europe&mdash;that one of the difficulties in the way of a Free Trade Area is restrictive trade practising? What is this but a restrictive trade practice?  In helping to create this restrictive trade practice, the Minister is putting difficulties in the way of the establishment of the Free Trade Area.  Yet he says we have no alternative but to go into the Free Trade Area.</P>
    <P>What then is the point of introducing a Bill which will serve only to embarrass this country in these matters?  When this Bill is passed into law&mdash;I have no doubt that it will be hammered through, as have several other futile measures&mdash;a small group of people will have a right to buy tea abroad and the Irish people will have no choice but to get their tea supplies in that manner.  It is a monopoly, a monolithic control which I, for one, wholeheartedly deplore.  If this Bill were left to a free vote of the House, I have no doubt that it would be thrown out by an overwhelming majority.  Why not withdraw this Bill? With one or two exceptions, the ten Deputies who have spoken so far have declared themselves against it.</P>

Why not restrict every other trade as well as the tea trade? A few people want to control our tea and to make exorbitant profits out of the Irish people.  I earnestly urge the Minister to withdraw the Bill and <Col N="398" /> leave the trade free.  If it does not work out satisfactorily, he can come back to the House in six months with new legislation.  I suggest, therefore, that he should withdraw this futile piece of legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the approach to any piece of legislation should be whether it is likely to promote better conditions, the welfare of the people as a whole or, alternatively, whether it is justified in order to correct some abuses that may exist.  Applying that test, I cannot understand why it is necessary to introduce this Bill in present circumstances.  When I read the Bill and what the Minister said in introducing it, it struck me there might oe a case for this Bill.  If there is, it has not yet been made.</P>
      <P>In examining the Bill and considering a number of other commodities this country has to import, I went on to consider why it is necessary to interfere, by statutory means, with the purchasing arrangements for this commodity, and not for others.  Why was tea selected for this particular treatment? It seems to me, looking at the Bill itself and in the light of what the Minister has said, that the reason for this Bill is entirely a fortuitous circumstance which existed or occurred at the outbreak of the last war.  Even if that were so, there is no evidence from experience either during the war or since the war that the establishment of a body or organisation to import tea directly or, for that matter, with sole rights of importation, could or would succeed in supplying this country with sufficient quantities of tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that we were probably treated severely by the British tea suppliers, but for all we know they were operating at that time under Government direction.  I can agree with the idea of a central purchasing agency during emergency conditions when an essential commodity such as tea is concerned.  In this case, there were obvious reasons why only one purchasing agency should be in existence.  War time and emergency conditions have ended now, however. Long after the war, we purchased tea in a variety of places, and I do not <Col N="399" /> think anybody can say that the quality of the tea has been so uniformly high or good, or the price so cheap, that we might not have done better by giving Tea Importers Ltd. credit for purchasing as advantageously as possible, or recognising that they were just as anxious as anybody else to secure adequate supplies at reasonable prices and of a uniformly good quality.  Is there any reason in private enterprise economy why the State should interfere with a commodity of this sort?</P>
    <P>If there is, why limit that interference to tea alone?  I have thought of other commodities, such as oil, of which we import large quantities. Nobody has suggested that we should buy oil exclusively in the country of origin.  I see no objection to buying tea in the country of origin, if it is to the advantage of the traders and particularly of the public to do so, but again, nobody would suggest that we should exclude other countries, if buying from them was advantageous.</P>
    <P>I have no predisposition in favour of purchasing in London.  I think the aim should be to buy wherever it can be got at the cheapest rates and of best quality, but if we decide it is in the national interest to purchase in the country of origin, I see no reason why that should not be done.  Under this Bill, a register of tea traders will be set up.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce can, under the Bill, object to the registering of a tea trader, if he is not wholly financed within the State and if the company is not wholly controlled within the State.</P>
    <P>On another piece of legislation at present before the Dáil, the question of amending the Control of Manufactures Acts will be discussed.  We are either serious here in saying we are in favour of private enterprise and that we are against State control unless it is absolutely necessary, or we are not. Whether we like it or not, the Americans, to whom we look for external financial assistance in the industrial sense, object strenuously to this type of legislation.  They are against the State intervening in spheres in which the ordinary industrialist, manufacturer or trader regards it as <Col N="400" /> outside the normal province of State activity.</P>
    <P>There are many occasions on which State intervention is justified.  There are many occasions&mdash;and we have had examples of them here&mdash;on which State control or direction is warranted, but why specifically pick one commodity&mdash; because tea is only one essential commodity&mdash;and direct the people concerned in that trade to comply with certain specifications with regard to finance, with regard to the markets from which they will purchase, and tell them that unless they do that they will not be allowed to trade in tea?</P>
    <P>As I say, I have no predisposition one way or another whether we should purchase only in the country of origin, in London or any other market. Traditionally it happened that we imported from London.  If we can still get as good terms there or if they are better than anywhere else, there does not appear to be any good reason why we should not continue to trade there. On the other hand, if we get better terms in Calcutta, Ceylon or any of the other countries of origin, there is no reason why we should not trade there.  However, only in quite recent years we saw that when world supplies of tea became scarce the fact that we had, and still have, very friendly relations with the Indian Government and people did not prevent the Indian Government putting an additional tax on tea.  From their point of view they are quite justified in doing that, but they did not make an exception in our case in order to give us more favourable terms than they were giving to anyone else.  I understand that one State&mdash;I think it is West Bengal&mdash; affords preferential treatment to British purchases, but these are arrangements which Governments or States are entitled to make and if they wish to operate on those lines or give preferential conditions to one customer, that is a matter for them alone.</P>
    <P>I have not heard from the Minister or from any speaker in this debate a justification for this measure.  I am open to conviction if it can be proved that this measure is necessary in peace-time conditions.  There was every justification for a central purchasing agency in war-time or even in the <Col N="401" /> aftermath period when supplies were scarce, when tea was rationed and other difficulties arose.  It is difficult to understand why we should interfere by State control or direction in the selling of one commodity and not in the sale of other comparable commodities such as fruit, coffee or anything else in the foodstuff range or, on the other hand, in the sale of a commodity like oil, large quantities of which come here through vast combines, as the oil companies are and in connection with which it is not possible at a particular time to state what quantities come from the sterling or the dollar area.  At a particular time it was difficult&mdash;I do not know whether the position has changed since&mdash;to ascertain precisely the dollar content in our imports of these commodities. In that case there might have been ample justification for considering an alternative method of importation.</P>
    <P>This is not a Bill in which there is any great political question involved. It is a matter which the Dáil can consider in a dispassionate way, with; I suppose, only one object in view&mdash; to try to get the best possible tea at the lowest possible price and to see that our people in future are not obliged because of any arrangement made either by the State or those engaged in the tea trade, to pay excessive profits or excessive margins. If this Bill can give better tea and cheaper tea we should favour it.  If, on the other hand, these claims cannot be sustained for the Bill, then we ought to consider the matter afresh and see if there is some more satisfactory way of dealing with this question.</P>

      <P>This Bill is based upon three main principles.  The first is that we should continue the policy which has operated since the war of direct purchase and importation of tea from the countries in which it is produced. The second is that we should keep the wholesale trade in tea in the hands of Irish citizens.  The third is that, within the limits of these two policy objectives, we should restore free trading in tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies who spoke about this Bill obviously had not taken the trouble of reading it and I hope that <Col N="402" /> those of them who have expressed views about its contents and then left the House will be told by their colleagues here to have another look at the Bill or at least be informed of the explanation of its provisions which I shall now give.  The validity of all these three objectives has been challenged during the course of this debate.  There are Deputies who said we should not continue the policy of purchasing tea direct in the country of origin.  There are Deputies who said it does not matter if we keep the trade in tea in the hands of Irish citizens, and even Deputies who said it is not desirable to restore free trading in tea. Therefore, all three objectives have to be defended.</P>
    <P>First of all, let me take the question of the direct purchase of tea. It seems to me common sense, on the face of it, that it should be cheaper for this country to buy its tea in countries where it is produced and import it direct from those countries than to obtain our tea through the intervention of external middlemen in external markets.  There seems to be some idea in the minds of Deputies that external middlemen in this commodity are so tremendously more efficient than we are that they can actually carry out this operation for us, make a profit out of it and still deliver the tea to this country cheaper than we can buy it ourselves.  Nobody has attempted to show why that should be the case, but many people have asserted that that is how it would work out.</P>
    <P>May I express the view that Irish tea wholesalers are just as good judges and buyers of tea as anyone either in Mincing Lane or anywhere else? Indeed, the tributes which have been paid to Tea Importers Limited for their work over the past ten years prove that to be so.  Tea Importers Limited is not a State company as some Deputies have assumed.  It is a company which was set up by the wholesale tea traders of this country at my request during the war and which operated in much the same manner as the contemplated new company will operate.  The directors were not appointed by me or by the Government, <Col N="403" /> they were chosen by the tea traders.  They had no capital, however, and their activities were financed by bank credit guaranteed by the Government.</P>
    <P>In so far as they have been able, in difficult times, to buy tea more successfully, in many instances, than the Mincing Lane merchants, they have justified my claims.  Deputy Palmer referred to the coal trade and said that because merchants were free to buy coal in America or Poland, there was keen competition in the sale of coal in this country to the benefit of the consumers of coal.  Would Deputy Palmer or any other Deputy think it a good idea for a coal merchant in Cork to buy a cargo of coal in America, ship it to Cardiff, unload it there, and then at some later date put it back on a ship and convey it to Cork?  Would that appear to be a sensible arrangement? Does he think that if that system were adopted by merchants, it would mean that coal would be cheaper than if it came direct?  If that is not a sensible arrangement for coal why assert it to be a sensible arrangement for tea?  How can any Deputy conceive it to be less costly to have tea intended for this country imported through London, placed in warehouses there and at some later date transported to merchants over here than imported direct?</P>
    <P>Underlying all the arguments that it is unnecessary for us to make arrangements to ensure the direct purchase and importation of tea is that assumption, that by going through that roundabout way tea will reach us at a lower price than it does at the moment.  That is a nonsensical suggestion.  Deputy Dillon said that the arrangement proposed in the Bill would mean poor tea at high prices but, like everything else that he said, he made no attempt to prove it.  Deputies on the opposite side were obviously relying on advice from Deputy Dillon on the techniques of the tea trade and accepted without question his assertion that this arrangement would have that result. It is contrary to common sense that it should have that result.</P>
    <P>There was a substantial reduction in the price of tea last year and Deputies <Col N="404" /> are forgetting that.  No doubt part of that may have been due to the termination of the temporary arrangements regarding the financing of tea sales operated by the previous Government, but it was not due solely to that.  The bulk of the tea supplies of this country for each year have to be purchased over a comparatively short period, in a matter of weeks or months, and when the year's supplies are being purchased it is always a matter of judgment as to whether prices are likely to rise or fall during the succeeding 12 months. On the whole, it is true to say that the judgment of Irish merchants in that regard has proved to be quite as good as that of British merchants, and that this country has benefited, by reason of their good judgment, by lower prices at many periods.</P>
    <P>It is true that at the present time there are complaints about the quality of tea on sale.  I do not know that these complaints are justified when they are based on the assertion that it is in some way attributable to the operations of Tea Importers Limited the existing company which is now going out of existence.  Tea Importers Limited were prepared to buy any tea that merchants wanted.  They imported and offered for sale to merchants a wide variety of teas which were of different qualities and characteristics and which were available at different prices.  The individual merchant purchased from Tea Importers Limited the teas that he wanted in order to make up the blends which he was going to sell to his customers.  He could buy the top grade teas or the cheaper teas. It is probably true that because of the fact that tea is so much dearer now than before the war that merchants are not anxious to push up the prices at which their standard blends sold to their customers, that they tend to buy cheaper grades of tea than those which they purchased before the war and that now they have the excuse that that is due to Tea Importers Limited and not to their own decision or their estimate of their customers' requirements.  That excuse will not hold in future, because, as I have pointed out, we are restoring freedom to trade in tea, subject to the policy conditions I have laid down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> It is true to say that the average price of the teas imported into this country in recent years has been lower than the average price imported into London.  I agree that that fact by itself means little.  It could mean that we were, for some reason, buying lower qualities than those purchased by Britain.  I do not think that that is a likely explanation but it could be the explanation.  It is the only information available by which we can judge whether Tea Importers Limited have been buying better than the tea merchants of Britain...</P>
    <P>It has been said that ld. per lb. on tea costs £100,000.  That is true no matter where we buy it.  If we buy our tea from London, if we get our tea by this process of entry into and exit from Britain and if, as a result, we increase the price even by 1d. per lb., it will mean £100,000 for somebody.  It is not difficult to find out to whom we would be paying it; it would be to the people who own the warehouses, the traders who handle the tea and the workers employed in their warehouses; and we would also have to pay out additional unemployment assistance to the many workers who might lose their employment here and for whom few Deputies on the opposite side have expressed any concern.</P>
    <P>Under this new Bill every wholesaler in the country will have the liberty to buy in India, or in any other country where tea is produced, whatever kind of tea he wants, whatever quality he wants and whatever grade he thinks suitable for his trade.  There is no question of centralised buying of tea. This Bill brings that practice to an end.  The centralised buying of tea is now going to cease.  It was an arrangement necessarily instituted in the scarce time of the war and it has been continued ever since.  I have been anxious to get rid of it and I started discussions with the tea merchants, to this end, five years ago.  Deputy Esmonde wants to give them another year for it.  They have considered it for five years and it was the outcome of that protracted discussion which resulted in the formation and registration of this company which they have <Col N="406" /> set up and which they alone will control and operate in the future.</P>
    <P>No tea merchant has to become a shareholder in the company.  It is open to any tea wholesaler to decide for himself whether or not he wants to become a shareholder in this company. It makes no difference to him as far as treatment by the company is concerned. It may be that there will be some advantages for the larger merchants in participating by their shareholding in the control of the operations of the company, but any tea wholesaler who does not wish to become a shareholder, or the scale of whose operations would not justify that investment in the capital of Tea Importers (1958) Limited, does not have to do so and this company will lend him precisely the same service, if he requires that service, in acting as his agent for the purchase of tea and in financing the purchase of tea as well as arranging for its importation.</P>
    <P>Deputies have spoken as if the shareholding requirement was a heavy burden upon traders which only the strongest could undertake.  It was mentioned that we import 250,000 chests of tea per year.  The total shareholding obligation is equivalent to 100 chests of tea, and any merchant not in a position to finance trade on the scale represented by 100 chests of tea is in business in a very small way. I have no objection to any person getting into this business in a small way.  My whole aim in framing this measure, and in the course of consultations with the tea wholesalers' association, when they were forming the company, was to ensure that the smallest trader would be at no disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> the largest in trading in tea in the future.</P>
    <P>There is no restriction of any kind on new entrants.  There is no monopoly and there is no restrictive trade practice as stated by some Deputy. Everybody can get into the tea trade, whether he has £2,500 to invest in the shares of this company or not.  He can become a shareholder if he wants to, or he need not.  He can still trade. The only condition stipulated in this Bill is that he must be an Irishman or it must be a company which is financed from Irish sources and, of <Col N="407" /> course, that he carries on the business of purchasing tea by going into the markets of the countries where the tea is produced.</P>
    <P>So far as the utilisation of agents in that market is concerned, merchants can, of course, choose whatever agents they like.  It is not true that Tea Importers, Limited, have been utilising only agents who were employees of British wholesalers.  They have been availing of the services of Indian firms as their agents and many, if not most of their agents have been of Indian nationality, but they did not buy all their tea at the auctions in India. They also bought direct from the gardens, as well as bidding at the auctions, for the supplies they require and they have organised the shipping of that tea direct from Indian ports to this country as suited the requirements of this country.</P>
    <P>The control of the shipping of the tea was advantageous to this country.  The insurance of the tea on purchase and in transit was negotiated with an Irish company and all the subsidiary business associated with transactions of that kind came to Irish firms, instead of being available only to British firms as was the case previously.  The freight payable upon tea from an Indian port to an Irish port is no higher than the freight paid to London and the only consequence of shipping the tea through the London market is that it would have to carry the additional freight from a British to an Irish port, which might in some instances be as high as the freight from India, or if not quite as high, certainly high in proportion to the distance involved.</P>
    <P>It seems to me common sense on the face of it that it is to our advantage we should buy the tea where it grows and import it direct.  Is there a case for keeping the tea trade in the hands of Irish merchants?  It is true that before the war the tea trade was very largely dominated by the British primary wholesalers.  There were some firms which bought direct and I tried to encourage that development in prewar years, but the total quantity of tea purchased direct by Irish wholesalers <Col N="408" /> was a very small part of our total supply.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the tea came through Mincing Lane.  The trade was dominated by the London merchants and I want Deputies to understand exactly the position we were in.  Probably this situation never would have changed at all and even the possibility of change would never even have been considered, had it not been for the war.  During the war, these merchants went out of our market.  I am not desirous of raking up any recollection of unpleasant things which happened, but I think the House should understand what did happen and the part which the British tea wholesalers played on that occasion.</P>
    <P>The arrangements we made at the outbreak of the war were made with the British Government.  They were arrangements which involved an understanding about the purchase of available supplies of tea and a willingness on our part to step out of the market so that the available supplies of tea in the world could be purchased advantageously by the British on an agreement under which the allocation of supplies for this country would be equivalent per head of the population to the allocation for Britain.</P>
    <P>That arrangement was broken.  It was broken probably at the instance of some people in the British administration who were hostile to us.  They broke it in a manner which was intended to create the maximum confusion in our administrative arrangements and to impose the maximum hardship on our people.  There are Deputies here who will recall that we had a special meeting of the Dáil summoned in January of 1941 to consider complaints which were coming from the country about the scarcity of tea.</P>
    <P>Before that took place, I sent my officials to the British Ministry concerned to make sure that the agreement which I had made with them was going to be kept.  I got that assurance and I subsequently came to Dáil Éireann and said that whatever temporary dislocation may have occurred in relation to tea, the position was unchanged and supplies would come along.  The day after the Dáil adjourned, I was informed by the same <Col N="409" /> officials of the British Ministry of Food that they were cutting our allocation to a quarter and that would have to do us.</P>
    <P>We should only make a gentleman's agreement with gentlemen.  I have no complaints to make about that now. Feelings were running high at the time and there were a number of bureaucrats temporarily in office in Britain at the time who allowed their feelings to affect the administration of their affairs, but behind them were the British tea wholesalers, and if one of them had at any time shown the slightest interest in our difficulties, they could have rectified that situation.  Not one of them showed the slightest interest in us, although they had made substantial profits out of the tea trade in this country.  Not a single one of them was prepared even to express an opinion which would have helped to relieve our situation.</P>
    <P>We have no obligation to let them back into our tea trade.  I would be prepared to let them back, if it could be shown that it was substantially to our advantage to do so, but no one has shown me that there is any advantage in it.  Deputy Dillon said that these London merchants are prepared to give from £4,000,000 to £6,000,000 free credit in respect of our tea supplies.  Does anybody believe these tea wholesalers have any interest in the Irish market except the profit they can get out of it? The idea that they would give us free credit for tea stocks is, of course, nonsensical.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the employment aspect.  It is an important aspect.  I am not talking now about the employment associated with the retention of the country's stocks of tea in the warehouses of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  The handling of those stocks alone gives an amount of employment. I am thinking of the employment given by the individual wholesaling firms who import the tea, blend it and frequently package it for distribution to the merchants throughout the country.  Why should we allow all that work to be done for us in London?  Surely we can find merchants here just as competent to blend tea as merchants in London? <Col N="410" /> The employment given in the process of blending tea is not inconsiderable. There is a tendency towards more packaging of tea and the employment given in packaging tea is not inconsiderable, either.  Why should we forgo the advantage of retaining that employment for our people merely for the sake of opening up our market again to those who showed very little interest in it when a little interest could have been of some value to us?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke as if, when I was referring to employment, I was thinking of holding in Dublin employment which would be given throughout the country.  That is not the situation at all.  I was thinking of holding employment in Ireland which, if we do not make some arrangement like this, will be given outside Ireland.  The secondary wholesaler&mdash;the man who blends tea obtained from the primary wholesaler&mdash;will continue to operate in the future as in the past, whether the primary wholesaler from whom he buys works from a store in Dublin or from a store in London.</P>
    <P>Let me make it quite clear, however, that when I talk about keeping the trade in tea in Irish control, I am not thinking of keeping it in Government control.  No Government control is contemplated.  Apart from the maintenance of a register and the condition that shareholders in this company must be registered tea traders, there will be no control at all.  The only purpose of the register is to achieve this second aim I was talking about&mdash;of keeping trade in tea in the hands of persons who are Irish nationals and whose activities are financed from Irish sources.  The process of preventing the reappearance of the brass-plate agents of the British wholesalers in the tea trade of Ireland after the war was a slightly painful one.  Some individuals were adversely affected by that policy. But that was seven or eight years ago; it is done now and there is no reason why we should not now fulfil that policy and get all the advantages which it means for this country.</P>
    <P>There are very considerable advantages also in arrangements which ensure that Irish stocks of tea are held in Ireland.  Stocks have to be held somewhere. <Col N="411" /> I mentioned earlier that the bulk of the tea harvest of India comes on the market in the course of a few weeks in the middle of the year.  At that stage somebody has to buy in the tea we will consume in the ensuing 12 months.  It has to be stored somewhere. There are advantages, other than the employment advantage, in stocking it here.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Port and Docks Board built a great big new warehouse to hold these stocks of tea.  It is a very important additional facility at the Port of Dublin.  One does not know what circumstances may arise in the world which may interrupt the flow of tea to this country.  One does not know whether there is any danger of prolonged trade disputes or other circumstances affecting the transportation of tea from abroad and leaving us with a deficiency of supplies. It is clearly a wise insurance policy for our people to have these stocks of tea when purchased held here so that we can count upon their availability irrespective of the possibility of international disturbances.</P>
    <P>I am trying to get the Dáil to understand that what this Bill does is to restore free trade in tea subject only to the two conditions that the trading is done by Irishmen and Irish companies and that these Irishmen and Irish companies buy tea in the country where it is produced.  The Government is getting out of it completely.  The extent to which the Government was in the business may be questioned.  As I explained already, while the existing company was set up at the request of the Government, it was set up by the tea trade which appointed its directors and arranged for its financing.</P>
    <P>In so far as that arrangement involved one buyer of tea, even though that buyer bought all the varieties of tea that individual tea traders wanted, that situation is now coming to an end. In future, any tea trader can buy the teas he wants in the country of origin. He is free to do so and this Bill emphasises the fact.  He does not have to be a shareholder in the company. So long as he is a registered tea trader, he can do that.  Tea Importers (1958), Limited, can import for him.  In <Col N="412" /> the case of merchants who require that facility, Tea Importers will act as agents and, in cases, will arrange to finance purchases for merchants if they need help of that kind.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed to hear a member of my own Party, Deputy Booth, speak with such ignorance of the Bill.  I thought at least that Deputies on this side would have taken the precaution of seeing what the Bill was about and have the common sense not to talk about it until they had done so.  The Bill imposes no restriction of entry into the trade.  Any person can become a tea trader in the future provided he is an Irish national or forms a company which is financed from Irish resources.  There will be no centralised buying of tea.  A person who is registered will be able to buy tea subject only to the condition that he buys it in the country of origin. There will be no monopoly of import in the sense that there will be only one buyer.</P>
    <P>Personally, I cannot understand why in these circumstances we need anticipate any deterioration in the quality of the tea available.  On the contrary, I should expect that the effect of the new freedom given to tea traders in respect of purchasing in the country of origin should tend to improve the quality of tea available in so far as individual traders will be able to exercise, perhaps, a wider discretion in the selection of the qualities and varieties of tea they desire to put into their blends.  I saw many times the list of teas that Tea Importers were offering for sale.  It seemed to me to be a very long list, certainly long enough to give any tea blender a very wide choice of teas to put into his blends.  No doubt, however, there will be a still wider choice available to merchants when they can go directly to the countries where the tea is produced, buy it at the auctions as it is offered, when it is of the quality and at the price they desire, and can go down to the individual producer if necessary and negotiate with him for the purchase of his crop as it stands.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne suggested we should keep the existing arrangement. I have been trying to point out that the existing arrangement does not <Col N="413" /> represent in any way State trading in tea.  Tea Importers Limited is not a State body and it never has been.  It never had any powers given to it by the State except that it was solely licensed to import tea during the period of its operations and had the assistance of a State guarantee for getting the finances it required from its bankers.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the law under which it has been operating&mdash;the law under which it got the exclusive licence&mdash;is due to expire on the 31st March next. Clearly we have to take some decision before then as to what the future arrangement will be.  I am quite satisfied that the new system will be a better system.  The members of the tea trade, whether they are shareholders of the company or not, will be able to widen the varieties of tea which they can purchase and consequently improve the quality and flavour of their blends in that way.</P>
    <P>It is a bit foolish to talk about this new company as a profit-making company. It is true that it may have a capital of £250,000.  That capital will not be sufficient to finance its tea purchases completely.  It is true the company will have to get money from somewhere, but I think the cost of utilising its own capital when reflected in the charges which it makes for its own services, and when allowance is made for the taxation to be paid on any profit earned, will be no greater than the charges they have now to meet on the money obtained on loan. In order to ensure that there is no inducement on the part of the company to so conduct its operations that it will earn an undue profit, arrangements have been made for the limitation of its dividend payments.</P>
    <P>Personally I do not believe, and I would like Deputies to understand this, in State trading in a commodity of this kind.  I do not see any analogy between Tea Importers Limited, in their operations in the purchasing of tea, the Sugar Company, Bord na Móna or any similar organisation. This is a trading concern purely and never can be anything else.  There can never be a question of it doing manufacturing <Col N="414" /> or anything of that sort.  The merchants will do all the processes of blending, packaging and selling.</P>
    <P>There has been some suggestion that there should be a three months' period during which no control upon tea would operate, just for an experiment.  It could be a disastrous experiment.  It is true that we cannot hope to have this new company functioning before the end of June and that the old company's legal foundations will cease to exist from the 31st March.  I am bringing in a Bill, which will be introduced to-morrow, to continue the old Act in operation for another three months.  I think it is essential to do so.  Failure to make provision now for the purchase of the tea which this country will require during the 12 months. from June next could produce chaos. Arrangements must be made for the purchase of the tea when it comes on the market from June onwards.  I think it would be an unjustifiable risk to let that period of three months go without ensuring that ample tea supplies will be available and that whatever tea we need will be purchased.</P>
    <P>I contemplate, and always did contemplate, that the transitional period would be one which would involve some difficulty and, perhaps, some risk as well.  Tea Importers Limited, no matter what time they cease operations, will have some stocks on hands which will have to be taken over by the new organisation.  Normally they would have two or three months' stock on hands to meet the requirements of their customers even at the end of the season, and arrangements must be made to make the advent of the new company coincide with the disappearance of the old, so that these stocks can be transferred smoothly and the liabilities attaching to them.  It is, therefore, very necessary that the old Act that was passed by the former Government in 1956, and which was expressed to last for two years, should remain in operation until the new Act comes into force.  In that way we will not merely solve all the problems arising out of the termination of the old company but we will make sure that there will be no hiatus in the arrangements for the purchasing of tea.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> If we had to face the difficulties, which would certainly arise if this three months' experimental period were adopted, there would be a risk of a deficit in supplies and we might have to arrange to get the supplies we need during the next 12 months at a higher price than Tea Importers Limited can acquire them in the early future.  It seems to me, therefore, that a large part of the objection to this Bill has been based on some misunderstanding of its provisions and some illusions as to where the interests of this country lie.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever, and anybody who has given any thought to this matter can have no doubt whatever, that it must be to the advantage of the Irish tea consumer to buy tea from the countries of origin without the intervention of any external middlemen. The situation has now been created where the trade in tea is in the hands of Irish wholesalers and I see no reason why we should not institute arrangements under which it will so continue. It will mean retaining not unsubstantial employment for Irish workers.  We have not, at the moment, so much employment that we can afford to jeopardise or throw away any that we have.</P>
    <P>The only object of this Bill, apart from preserving those fundamental two requirements, is to leave the tea trade free from Government control and allow anybody who wants to enter it to do so and to buy tea from the country of origin.  It will introduce a wider field of competition in the tea trade which will be of benefit to tea consumers.  Some Deputies seem to think that something to the contrary was intended, but, if they examine the Bill carefully, they will know this was what is intended.  This Bill is designed to remove Government control entirely from the trade in tea and to introduce free trading in tea for the Irish wholesale merchants.</P>

    <Title>Local Government Bill, 1958&mdash;Second Stage</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  In all major branches of the public service, there is a compulsory retiring age.  Power was given to Ministers by Section 23 of the Local Government Act, 1941, in respect of offices for which each such Minister is the appropriate Minister, to declare an age limit for all or any of the various categories of posts in the local government service. The section contemplated that this might be done in a piecemeal way because of the wide variety of jobs, and the differing conditions surrounding <Col N="417" /> them.  As regards offices for which I am responsible, as Minister for Local Government, Orders were made in 1942, 1943, 1946, 1951 and 1957, fixing 65 as the retiring age for holders of local offices who would be entitled to a pension when they retired.</P>
      <P>The 1957 Order is the &ldquo;age limit order&rdquo; referred to in the Bill.  It is a consolidating Order and completes the process of fixing an age limit for all local offices for which the Minister for Local Government is the appropriate Minister.  Only a small number of offices remained to be dealt with: the others had been covered by previous Orders which the comprehensive 1957 Order superseded and revoked.</P>
      <P>Some doubts had been expressed as to the generality of the application of the previous Orders in cases where certain officers had a particular tenure of office under statute, more especially statutes of restricted local application. Section 24 of the Local Government Act, 1955, and the Second Schedule of the Act, which amend Section 23 of the Act of 1941, purported to remove those doubts.  By these provisions a declaration fixing an age limit in respect of an office or offices was to relate to them</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...notwithstanding any other provision made by or under statute in relation to holding such offices ...(including in particular a provision for holding office until death, resignation or removal from office) and in any such case the declaration and this section shall have effect notwithstanding such other provision.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As can be seen from the definition of &ldquo;relevant offices&rdquo; in the Bill and from the repeals in Section 3, the offices with this special statutory tenure are those of county manager and city manager.  No doubt arises about county managers: the 1955 Act effectively equated their tenures with other local officers and they are mentioned in this Bill simply because to leave them out might lead to doubts at a subsequent date as to why they were not dealt with now.  But some doubt remains in relation to the four <Col N="418" /> offices of city manager, because of the fact that each of them gets its tenure from a specific provision of a specific Act.</P>
    <P>To the layman, and indeed to a number of lawyers, the intention and the effect of the Act of 1955 are clear enough; but it appears that the intention and the effect have not been put beyond all doubt.  For that reason the Government decided that the issue should be finally resolved by legislation.</P>
    <P>As can be seen, therefore, the Bill raises no new issue of principle: it merely clarifies something that it was definitely intended to provide for in the Act of 1955.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has just said that this Bill does not really apply to county managers who are just mentioned in it, in case any confusion might arise in the future.  The Bill actually deals with the city managers of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
      <P>I happen to be a member of Waterford Corporation for 17 years and I have some experience of managers&mdash;a commissioner, a manager, a temporary manager, a permanent manager, a temporary manager, and another temporary manager and the present city manager.  All these men were very competent, but I could say that there was a gap in effective administration each time a new man had to come in and feel his way.</P>
      <P>We now have a city manager in Waterford, appointed, we shall say, under the City Management Act of 1939.  This Bill repeals sub-section (3) of Section 13 of the Waterford City Management Act which said that the city manager would be employed until such time as he died or retired.  This Bill is then actually a worsening of the conditions of this man's employment.  I mention the Waterford City Manager particularly because so far as Dublin is concerned the city manager has gone; he is not mentioned here.  The position is not yet filled; it is probably waiting for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit to the Minister and to the House that in the case where a manager <Col N="419" /> has given satisfaction and has proved himself to be an excellent administrator, where he has an excellent record in acquiring land and promoting housebuilding, the people who should be consulted are the councillors concerned.  If the Minister through his Department, would examine the record of the Waterford City Manager and consider then consulting the Mayor and Corporation of Waterford, and if they agreed that the Waterford City Manager should be continued in office, I think he would agree that an exception should be made.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to speak for Limerick or Cork, but I think the same would apply to Limerick and Cork City Managers because these men were employed under the 1939 Act and the passing of this Bill would be, as I have said, a worsening of conditions.</P>
    <P>In this year of 1958, when we are supposed to retrench and save money, and where local authority members of the Dáil are all the time expected to save money wherever they can, I put it to the Minister that this is not the time to allow a competent and active official to go, pay him a good pension, and bring in another man who will take some time to get the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of his job, and pay him a big salary as well.  We are actually spending money we should not be spending, money we could save.</P>
    <P>I will not say any more about this man because he is not the kind of man who would welcome it.  I have had the honour of being a member of the Waterford Corporation for many years since his appointment.  I have worked under other managers.  I have nothing to say about them, but they had not the feel of the place.  The man to whom I refer is a Waterford man and a very competent official.</P>
    <P>I should not like the members of the House to get the idea that I agreed with this man at all times.  I have had definite clashes with him, but I always had to admire his main policies and the manner in which he carried out his duties.  He has given the City of Waterford a great estate in lands that he purchased to greater advantage than any estate agent in the country <Col N="420" /> would have purchased them.  We are in the lucky position in Waterford that at present we are building houses on land in the City of Waterford, within the borough boundary of Waterford, on lands that were purchased by the present city manager for £65 an acre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir, but in view of the fact that a section in this Bill means that this city manager should go, I did not think it would be any harm to tell the House that he was a most competent official and that his record was so excellent that I had hoped the Minister would listen to my plea for him.  I will only say that this man has left the people of Waterford a very great estate in lands which he purchased wisely and well.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Minister that the conditions of employment of city managers were laid down and that this Bill will worsen these conditions. I would point out to him that if the Waterford City Manager were retired, he would have to be paid his pension and the new man would have to be paid full salary.  That will also apply in Cork in a very short time.  I hope the Minister will give that matter fair consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I had thought that this short Bill would be unanimously welcomed in this House and that it would get a very swift passage.  I was surprised to hear the contribution made by Deputy Lynch of Waterford.  As has been pointed out by the Minister, there is no new principle being invoked in this Bill.  It is simply a tightening up of legislation that has been passed already.  It was intended in the 1955 Bill that the city managers referred to in this Bill should be compulsorily retired at the age of 65, and, as the Minister points out, it is only to tighten that matter up and to remove any doubts that may exist in the minds of certain people that this Bill is being introduced.  From the way that Deputy Lynch spoke, one would think that city managers were a <Col N="421" /> special breed as far as intelligence and competence are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

      <P>I am merely giving my own interpretation of Deputy Lynch's contribution to the debate.  I did not hear Deputy Lynch make any such case for other officers and servants of local authorities or, indeed, for officers and servants of State Departments.</P>
      <P>This principle has been long accepted and I see no reason why it should not apply to city managers.  I do not think that Deputy Lynch should endeavour to get us into the position that, by voting for this Bill, we are voicing our opinion as to the competence of any particular city manager.  It is a principle that has been accepted here at all stages.</P>
      <P>Very many people have given as much service to their local authority and to State Departments as the present Waterford City Manager has given to Waterford and I have not heard Deputy Lynch say at any time that these people should be retained beyond the age of 65.  A principle that applies by and large to local government officers and servants and to civil servants should apply also to city managers and I was really surprised to find that there was any opposition at all to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a question. This is a miscellaneous provisions Bill, introduced to deal with certain matters.  The Minister says that none of them gives rise to any new principle. I wonder has the Minister's attention been directed to what appears to me to be an anomaly in the local government code.  I understand the present position is that, under the existing code, if two counties elect to have a common manager and subsequently discover that it would be more economical to revert to the <i>status quo ante</i> and go back to the system of having a manager for each county, it cannot be done unless both local authorities unanimously agree.</P>

However, I submit that on an omnibus Bill of this kind, which the Minister tells us is merely for the purpose of clearing up certain ambiguities in the existing code, it is open to any of us to suggest that other ambiguities be cleared up in the same code, and here is a situation which I think is deserving of attention.  I do not know whether the Minister's attention has been directed to it.  If it has, I suggest to him that he should avail of this or some other Bill to put it right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir, if you say so; I do not mind.  I suppose we can have it again, but I thought that if you had a general Bill of this kind, you could add anything you liked to it affecting the local government code. This Bill is designed to amend the <Col N="423" /> local government code.  I am asking the Minister to amend it in another particular which I think is much more urgently in need of amendment than the amendment here proposed.</P>
      <P>I am amused by the Deputy from Cork, Deputy Casey, at his expression of pain and distress at the very thought that this lofty principle of disposing of public servants at the age of 65 should be even questioned in Oireachtas Éireann.  You would almost imagine that we had questioned the Decalogue.  I do not know why one should choose 65, any more than any other age.  If you applied that rule to Dáil Éireann, there would be a great scattering from these benches.  I am not prepared to attack the existing arrangement that 65 is accepted, on the whole, as a reasonable age at which public servants may qualify for their rights and retire, mainly to make way for the younger men coming up.  However, I do not think there is anything sacrosanct about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little that I wish to say at this stage and, indeed, very little that can be said about this matter.  Deputy T. Lynch suggested that the corporation or council should be consulted in all cases such as this before any member is asked to leave office and that, in such a case, if it is decided that he is the right and the best man to hold the job, it should be so.  We cannot accept that contention at this stage any more than we could do so in respect of any other member or employee of a local authority. While all that has been said about the manager and his good points may be quite true, it does not in any way affect the matter at issue in this particular Bill.</P>
      <P>The argument was also advanced that we should make an attempt at retrenchment and saving by cutting down expenditure and that, by the enactment of this Bill, we are doing the reverse and adding to the cost at a time when we should be cutting down costs.  All of these points can be true in their own particular sphere but they are not just or valid arguments in respect of this matter.</P>
      <P>The main point at issue is merely a matter of tying up a loose end, if a loose end does exist.  A doubt has been expressed in regard to the city manager's tenure of office.  While the 1955 Act was supposed to cover all such eventualities and put all of these people into the same line in regard to retirement at 65 years of age, doubts have been expressed and it is to remove, for once and for all, such a doubt that I bring forward this Bill now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's point about other repeals that might be in order deserves attention.  If we had more time and if it were appropriate to this Bill, I should be very glad to hear Deputy <Col N="425" /> Dillon's suggestions because I am quite sure that there are possibly other little repeals that could be made with benefit to the service as a whole. Later, when I have an opportunity of going through the various Acts, we may possibly find some such cases and at that stage I am sure Deputy Dillon's suggestions will be very useful indeed.</P>
    <P>There is something which I must refer to, lest, from Deputy T. Lynch's speech, it might be thought there was any question of harshness or of taking away from the Waterford City Manager something to which he is entitled. It should be borne in mind that the Waterford City Manager is five or six years over the age limit of 65.  In all fairness, I feel that, no matter what doubts may have existed in the previous legislation, he has had a fairly good run for his money.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with a matter mentioned by Deputy Dillon and mentioned, indeed, also by some of our Press during the week, namely, that if we applied the 65 years' age limit to this House we would not have a very big number left.  It is well worth considering that Deputies of long standing in this House do not get a pension of £1,200 odd a year or a lump sum of £2,500 when leaving this House.  If that were so, there would be quite a scurry to the gates.  They would not have to be sent: they would be gone.</P>
    <P>So far as the Waterford City Manager is concerned&mdash;he is immediately affected&mdash;he has exceeded the age limit and he has been there for some time.  The terms of the 1955 Act were intended to apply to him just as to everybody else.  However, by agreement with the then Minister and Deputy T. Lynch and Deputy Kenneally, it was agreed at that time that the 1955 Act in relation to the Waterford City Manager would not take effect before the 31st December, 1957.  That date has now passed.  The Order bringing that situation into being was made on the 1st July and the Waterford City Manager ceased to be the permanent Manager of Waterford City as and from the end of December.  In order that there should be no complications, he was then reappointed <Col N="426" /> as and from the 1st January, 1958, to be acting city manager.  That was done so as to keep everything in order.  This Bill has been introduced to bring into being the agreement then made, to consolidate it and to ensure that no doubt will be expressed in the future in relation to the Waterford or any other city manager and that, in future, city managers will have the same terms of office in relation to retiring age as county managers and, indeed, every other member of the local government service.  That is all this Bill purports to do and that is all that can be said about it at this stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £224,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in <Col N="427" /> course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958, for Employment and Emergency Schemes (including Relief of Distress).</P>
    <P>As indicated in my Budget Statement of May last, I decided to make an additional £250,000 available for the services provided in the Vote for Employment and Emergency Schemes, so as to allow the Special Employment Schemes Office greater flexibility in arranging for the short-term relief of unemployment in particular areas.  The Supplementary Estimate is necessary to secure formal parliamentary approval for the Vote expenditure arising from this decision.</P>
    <P>The additional £250,000 was allocated as follows:&mdash;Sub-head F: Urban Employment Schemes, £140,000, making the total allocation for the year £280,000.  Sub-head I: Bog Development Schemes, £45,000, making the total allocation for the year £160,000. Sub-head J: Rural Improvements Scheme, £65,000, making the total allocation for the year £215,000.  As regards the Rural Improvements Scheme, it is not anticipated that actual expenditure from the additional allocation of £65,000 up to 31st March next will exceed £50,000, the balance being expendable next year.  On the other hand, expenditure on urban schemes is expected to exceed the total allocations by £7,000.</P>
    <P>The gross amount of the Supplementary Estimate, £242,000, provides for the £235,000 to be expended from the additional allocations, plus the further sum of £7,000 for urban schemes to which I have already referred.  After allowing for increased receipts of £10,000 from beneficiaries under the Rural Improvements Scheme, and savings of £8,000 on other items, mainly administrative charges, the net total to be voted, as shown by the Estimate, is £224,000.</P>

      <P>When I look at this Estimate&mdash;to which we have no objection&mdash;my mind goes back a short period of 12 months, when really a considerable number of the Fianna Fáil Party believed, I think, that the <Col N="428" /> Ministers they were supporting were in a position to wave their hands and effect the disappearance, or virtual disappearance, of unemployment in this country.  I remember the placard which appeared upon the hoardings of this country: &ldquo;Housewives, vote for Fianna Fáil, so that your husbands may get work.&rdquo;  Are the members of the Fianna Fáil Party ashamed of that now?  Are they ashamed at having gone out and plastered this country with unconditional promises to the wives of unemployed men, that if they voted for their Party, the unemployment&mdash;which I assume was then the concern of all&mdash;could be abolished overnight?</P>
      <P>Deputy Booth shakes his head. Deputy Booth is a relatively sophisticated member of society and I know that if he saw that poster&mdash;as he did see it, because he put it up in his own constituency&mdash;he raised an eyebrow and said: &ldquo;It reads well, but it certainly does not mean literally what it says.&rdquo;  I ask him honestly: was it not put up in the hope of persuading a number of simple people, who would believe that it meant literally what it said, to accept it at its face value?</P>
      <P>I think that is a dreadful thing to do.  It is a dreadful thing, when people are suffering as the mother of a family suffers when her husband is unemployed and as her husband suffers under the obligation of coming home day after day to tell her he cannot get work, to trade on that domestic anguish in order to get votes, knowing that you do not mean it.</P>

      <P>I think so, when you can demonstrate that, to the limit of your resources, you have provided them Many people may deride the predecessors of the present Government with imprudence in having appropriated £6,000,000 of the annual revenue to the effort to keep down the prices of bread and butter and may have said: &ldquo;If that is the measure of your charity, more was expected of you.&rdquo; It was not by any means an insignificant performance, was it&mdash;£6,000,000 of the revenue of this country, 6 per cent. of <Col N="429" /> the entire revenue, devoted to no other end than keeping down the prices of what appeared to us to be essentials of the general diet?</P>
      <P>On top of that, there was an heroic effort to keep down the price of tea. It was not attended with the measure of success for which we had hoped&mdash; because of conditions in the world&mdash; but it was an effort.  Some may say it was a misguided effort; some may say it was an effort that failed&mdash;though I do not think it altogether did&mdash;but it was an effort.  I do not believe that our people are unreasonable and I think they would say to their Government: &ldquo;The fact that you failed to do what you promised to attempt does not condemn you; we may make up our minds that you are not the people to choose again, because you should have seen that you would fail, but at least you tried; and we convict you of nothing worse than incompetence.&rdquo; That is a charge in respect of which no public man need hang his head in shame.  He may not have succeeded, but at least he tried.</P>
      <P>However, we all ought to hang our heads in shame if it is possible for vulnerable sections of our community to say to us: &ldquo;You held yourselves out as being able to do something that you knew perfectly well you could not do and if that is the measure of your effort to achieve the undertaking on which you got us to give you our votes, you stand convicted by your own default.&rdquo;</P>

I do not want the Deputy to feel or believe that I want him to say or that I want the public to believe, that Fianna Fáil sits callously indifferent to the fate of the unemployed.  I do not believe they do.  I believe the unemployment figures concern the rank and file of the Fianna Fáil Party just as intimately <Col N="430" /> as they do any Deputy.

      <P>To avoid that catastrophe, very energetic measures had to be taken so that there would be restored to the hands of whatever Government the country had the minimum reserves with which to avert uncontrolled mass unemployment. What was grievously wrong there, and what I think hits at the institutions which we are in this House concerned to maintain, was the fund of promises to the electorate, particularly to the vulnerable elements of the electorate.  They said they knew and undertook to perform the appropriate work for providing a remedy, when they knew it was not within their capacity to perform it.

If it be true that approximately 50,000 people have left in the past 12 months, it is not suprising that the numbers of those enrolled in the employment exchanges have declined. They certainly have not declined by 10,000, 20,000 or 30,000.</P>

I think the Fianna Fáil Party, in the presence of this Supplementary Estimate, ought to examine their consciences and try to resolve that they will not denigrate their supporters and degrade themselves by purchasing votes from their neighbours with such undertakings which they knew they could not perform.  We have no objection to this Supplementary Estimate, and we do not want to rub the nose of Fianna Fáil on its own discreditable performances more than is necessary for their spiritual improvement.

      <P>I did not intend to speak at all, but, when I heard Deputy Dillon preach political honesty and give us a lecture on what we should have done prior to the general election, I thought I should make a short contribution to the debate.  We have been trying to do our best to clean up the mess we inherited from the inter-Party Government last March.  In beginning to face up to that problem, we had no idea things were so bad.  Whether it be made by a business or a Government, an effort cannot succeed inside a few months. We are now ten months in office.  Even in that short time, we have succeeded in clearing up some of the mess left to us.  I am not trying to hide my head in the sand; I do not say that we have not got a serious problem of unemployment. All of us on this side of the House are anxious to see that, wherever possible, every man and woman in the country will be employed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about political honesty.  The greatest blow that struck this country was in 1948 when the inter-Party Government first were elected.  At that time, we were on the threshold of economic prosperity.  Later on in 1951, and again in 1954, we had to listen to the greatest tirades ever delivered.  Last year, we got back to office and, since then, we have taken all steps possible to clear up the mess. We floated a loan successfully and, though it was a small loan, it showed the people had some confidence in the present Government.</P>

I have sufficient confidence in our Government to express the view that that day is not far distant. I do feel, however, that the actions of the inter-Party Government during their term of office have retarded our progress, but I hope to see the day when we have rectified the blunders they made to the detriment of this nation during their six years of very poor government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the only things we seemed to have to discuss in this House were transatlantic aeroplanes and greyhounds.  Therefore, it is about time we had a discussion such as has been initiated here to-day by Deputy Dillon, because one of the most important problems confronting the present Government and which confronted the last Government is growing unemployment and emigration figures.</P>
      <P>I must confess a great deal of disappointment at the introductory speech of the Minister for Finance.  Whether or not he intends to treat of unemployment in a fuller way when he winds up this debate, I do not know, but in view of the fact that unemployment is such a problem I do not think it fair to the House that the Minister should in about 30 seconds introduce an Estimate for practically £250,000 &mdash;that is not so important in itself&mdash; which deals directly with the problem of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to follow the line of the last two speakers and twit any of the Fianna Fáil Deputies or Ministers with the promises, placards and postcards for which they were responsible in the last election.  I appreciate, and everybody in the country appreciates, the tremendous task the relief of unemployment is and has been, but the <Col N="435" /> House and the country should know this.  As far as I know this £250,000 that is referred to in this Estimate has already been spent and I know that to-morrow morning a certain newspaper will have blazoned in some part of it something to the effect that £250,000 is now being given by the Government to relieve unemployment.  Such is not the case at all.  As far as I know, the bulk of it has been spent, so it will not be any relief to unemployment.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is correct, nor do I think Deputy Booth believes, that there is an improvement in the unemployment position.  There is an improvement inasmuch that the figure, when compared to the same time last year, is 8,000 or 9,000 better.  I do not want to say that emigration has increased in the last 12 months, because I do not think any firm figures could be produced, but at least emigration has not abated and all those workers who cannot find employment in this country and who emigrated in the last 12 months or ten months must be added to the figure we now have of 85,000 odd unemployed.</P>
    <P>There has been a remarkable change of front by certain politicians and by certain members of local authorities. We are now told that our prosperity depends on increased production.  With that we would agree but they have, in my opinion, gone a little too far.  Their call seems to be addressed to the workers, but the workers have no means wherewith to increase production. It is true that here and there new methods might be introduced which would increase production but, on the whole, we cannot get increased production unless we put our unemployed to work.</P>
    <P>It should be said that our 85,000 unemployed represent a certain type of worker.  No blame to this Government, to the last Government or any Government for this fact but Deputies must agree that it is a fact, that there was a certain problem to be faced in Ireland in 1922 when the Second Dáil was elected and when the Government was formed.  There was expenditure on houses, roads, hospitals, schools, <Col N="436" /> bridges, Garda barracks, and the type of expenditure that is now regarded as capital expenditure.  There is no doubt in the world that a large number of the workers, because they had engaged in the building of roads, schools, and so on, began to consider themselves as building workers.  They assumed, and we all assumed, that they would be engaged in that type of employment for years and years to come, but that position has now changed and, in my opinion, the change has been brought about too quickly.  It should have been a gradual change.</P>
    <P>There are many people in the country who are fond of saying, and who are trying to press the point, that we could do with less houses, less road works, and that we are building too many hospitals, too many schools and too many Garda barracks, and so on. The unfortunate thing is that we cannot make that change quickly.  These people have to be provided for and we have not provided for them.  Workers from Dublin, Cork, Wexford who got constant employment now find themselves out of work.  I can appreciate that position to some extent, but I do not appreciate the attitude of a Government or a Department of State which is reluctant to build houses under any circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne, my colleague from Wexford, knows that it is very difficult to get sanction from the Department of Local Government to build a cottage which is needed, I will not say badly needed, but needed.  A man must be living on the roadside or in a ragged tent before you can get permission from the Department of Local Government to have a house built for him.  We will have to provide money to keep these people, even on the minimum employment, on the roads, on the building of houses that are still needed, on the building of schools that are still needed, and any of that type of work which is now described as capital work.</P>
    <P>That attitude is quite prevalent amongst some of the local government officials and among some of the county councillors.  I do not think that in the past ten or 15 years employment on the roads was at such a very low <Col N="437" /> ebb, at a time when, I would venture to remark, the Road Fund was at the very highest point ever.  Again, let me say we are going to lose those people who have been engaged in such work as road building, house building, school building and the building of Garda barracks, if we are not prepared to provide other work for them.  Industry cannot do it for them.  It cannot be geared up sufficiently to absorb them. Unfortunately those engaged in capital development work are not equipped to engage in the type of industrial production which the country badly needs at present.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the misconception common to many people that the 85,000 who are registered as unemployed are not genuinely unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare added some strength to that misconception when he made certain statements some weeks ago.  I do not intend going into that now.  As far as my experience goes, there are the people who are not so fond of work and there are those who will register illegally at the employment exchange, but, by and large, and so far as the constituency which I represent is concerned, the vast majority of the registered unemployed are genuinely unemployed.  As I say, something must be done in the meantime to try to keep them at home.  The unfortunate thing is that when they get a taste of England, conditions being relatively so much better there in the matter of wages, they are lost to this country for ever.</P>
    <P>One of the bad things I see about the present situation is this&mdash;and I do not say it is a situation that developed over the past 12 months, it developed over the past ten to 15 years&mdash;we are losing producers and we are also losing consumers.  The fact that these thousands and thousands of workers are going to Great Britain, and some to America and Canada, means, I feel, that the home market for Irish industries is gradually being decreased, or rather depleted.  Something will have to be done about that in conjunction with the provision of employment.</P>
    <P>Again, there is that idea that relief <Col N="438" /> work is no good.  Relief work may not be good in that it does not produce real or direct wealth, but at least by it we are keeping people at home and people who are earning a weekly wage of £5, £6 or £7 are spending it at home.  That money is being circulated and is buying, in the main, Irish manufactured goods.  Over and above all that, we are keeping these Irish workers at home.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by repeating if I may, what I said in the first place, that I was vastly disappointed that the Minister in introducing this Estimate did not elaborate on the statements which the Taoiseach made from time to time on the alleviation of the unemployment situation.  I do believe that all of us&mdash;and the Government, as they must be&mdash;are concerned about the figures of unemployment, but there is no real evidence that any impression is being made on them.  There is no real evidence that the Government is scraping the barrel to provide employment. I do not know what the transatlantic airline is going to cost, or if it will cost anything, but if it will cost anything I think the money should be devoted to this Vote and if any money is to be spent on the Greyhound Industry Bill, it should be devoted to this Vote.  Every single penny that can be got, should, in my opinion, be devoted to the provision of employment and let the Government or their experts work out how that money can best be employed.</P>
    <P>One of the fatal mistakes of the Government in the past ten months&mdash; the reason for which I do not know&mdash; was the abolition of the Local Authorities (Works) Act scheme which was introduced in 1949.  It was admitted by many members of the Fianna Fáil side of the House that this was a good scheme and rural Deputies, in particular, thought that it was a good scheme because it provided a great amount of employment, in conjunction with the agricultural industry, and linked up successfully with the land reclamation scheme introduced at that time and now continuing.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, between now and <Col N="439" /> the final adoption of the Estimate, the reintroduction of that scheme.  So far as some of the urban areas are concerned, and we have been talking about work that is not productive, a lot of the urban areas&mdash;and I am sure many of the members of the local authorities will agree with me&mdash;find it difficult to get schemes in which to engage what are termed relief workers.  I know of examples where they have been trying to see where they can spend money to relieve unemployment and to get money back into the shops.  The Minister should consider seriously reintroducing the Local Authorities (Works) Act scheme which is also very good from the point of view of unemployment, particularly in regard to the agricultural industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to and to quote from the Report of O.E.E.C., <i>Economic Conditions in Ireland</i>, which was published in December last, in view of the criticisms which have been made from the Opposition side of the House.  This publication is an unbiassed account by economic experts who are not, so far as we know, members or supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I quote from page six of the report, paragraph 5, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The decline in industrial output ...began in the second quarter of 1956; by the last quarter of the year production was about 12 per cent. lower than a year earlier.  This decline was the result of the contraction of domestic purchasing power which was reinforced by official measures to restrain internal demand.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That criticism of our situation appears to me to highlight the fact that we were at our lowest ebb during the concluding periods of the last Administration.</P>
      <P>I would quote further from paragraph 6 on page 6:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The effect on unemployment of the contraction in activity in 1956 became particularly marked in the second half of the year and in the early months of 1957.  The decline in industrial employment, which reversed <Col N="440" /> the trend of the previous years, persisted up to March, 1957, but appears to have slowed down considerably by June, 1957.  The peak unemployment level, accounting for 12.1 per cent. of the number of insured persons, was reached in January, 1957; this compared with a level of 8.1 per cent. a year earlier. The rise in unemployment was particularly marked among construction workers.  But by June, 1957, the overall unemployment rate, at 7.9 per cent., was not markedly above the level of June, 1956.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I quote those figures and comments to counter the assertions of Deputy Dillon, earlier in this discussion, wherein he berated the present Government for its inability, and its carelessness, to deal with unemployment. Granted that unemployment has not been abolished, I should like to point out we have made, in Deputy Dillon's own words, &ldquo;an heroic effort&rdquo;, and, just as he claimed the Government of which he was a Minister could be cleared of any criticism simply by claiming to have made an heroic effort, it is not unreasonable that we should be given a certain amount of credit for what we have done also.</P>

      <P>I would quote further from paragraph 11, page 8:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This sharp rise in Government borrowing in the fiscal year 1956-57 was made necessary by the unsatisfactory out-turn of both revenues and expenditures.  The ordinary Budget closed with a deficit of £5.9 million and, including capital expenditure met by the State, the total to be financed amounted to £43.4 million.  Since the State loan of October, 1956 was not fully taken up by public subscription and the level of small savings was not satisfactory, the Government was obliged to <Col N="441" /> realise departmental security holdings to the value of £7.8 million and to call on the banks for accommodation (by way of subscriptions to the national loans and discounting of Exchequer bills) to the extent of £9.3 million.</P>
    <P>It was thus necessary to adopt a much stricter budgetary policy for the 1957-58 fiscal year, and the Government has planned to eliminate a prospective deficit in the ordinary Budget of some £9,000,000 by increases in taxation and reduction in expenditures.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I quote that to show how severe the crisis was in which the Government found itself on the assumption of office. If money had been available for further work schemes, it would obviously have been spent, but here we have an unbiassed, unprejudiced international organisation putting down the facts, cold-bloodedly in black and white, that under the last Government, there was a Budget deficit of £5.9 million.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has widened the debate very considerably by going into the financial side. It may be quite relevant when the main Estimate is being considered, but the only matters that call for consideration here are matters in the White Paper, urban employment schemes, development works in bogs, rural improvement schemes and appropriations-in-aid.  I am sure the Deputy does not wish to widen the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I wished only to meet some of the criticisms made against the Government by Deputy Dillon.  I bow to your ruling on this matter, Sir.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a last quotation from this leaflet under the heading &ldquo;Conclusions&rdquo; on page 11, paragraph 19:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It would not, under existing circumstances in Ireland, seem appropriate to try and take up this slack by expanding State investment. What is needed at present is more activity in the private sector, an objective which may require less <Col N="442" /> pre-emption by the Government of the financial resources available for investment at home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, I submit, precisely what we have been trying to do&mdash;encouraging private employment rather than providing large amounts for Government expenditure.  That is what has been done and that has been recommended by O.E.E.C. as sound, economic planning.  It is a matter of regret for all of us on this side of the House that greater progress has not been made, but I would commend this report to all Deputies for their earnest consideration. It will show we have done possibly all we could have done, and have done considerably better than our predecessors.  To have done better than them is not a guarantee of the highest efficiency, but, at least, we have done our best.  It is a matter of great regret that we had to introduce this Supplementary Estimate at all, but I would ask Deputies on the other side of the House to read and digest this report.  I think it would make their criticisms less copious.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In his introductory remarks, the Minister stated that one of the reasons for the introduction of this Estimate was the relief of distress.  That statement clearly indicates that the Minister is well aware that distress exists among some sections of our people at present.  The Minister did not elaborate to any extent on how this miserable pittance&mdash;most of it expended, as Deputy Corish has said&mdash;will help in any appreciable manner to relieve this distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate has ranged over a reasonably wide field.  References have been made to the activities of the two systems of Government we have had over the past years.  In view of the fact that other Deputies made such references, I will crave your indulgence, Sir, to do likewise, but to a much more limited extent.  I wonder what the composition of this House would be to-day if the Minister had said 12 months ago during the election campaign: &ldquo;If you elect Fianna Fáil as the Government of this country to-day, in 12 months' time, on 19th February, <Col N="443" /> 1958, I will have to move a Supplementary Estimate in the Dáil to relieve distress&rdquo;?  I feel sure that if the Minister made that statement, it would be very easy indeed to count the number of Fianna Fáil Deputies here at present.</P>
    <P>Instead of telling the people that, the Minister told them the opposite. As already pointed out, he told them that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power, this unemployment question would cease to exist.  As one previous speaker mentioned, Fianna Fáil particularly addressed themselves to the wives of workers from one end of the State to the other with the statement: &ldquo;Wives, vote Fianna Fáil into power to provide work for your husbands.&rdquo; What did they get when Fianna Fáil were returned to power with the overall majority they now enjoy and which, it cannot be denied, was got under most false pretences?  What did these people to whom they specifically addressed their remarks succeed in getting from Fianna Fáil?  First and foremost, within a few months of their advent to office, the food subsidies were wiped out, thus relieving the Government of several million pounds.</P>

      <P>Before making these references, I did crave your indulgence, Sir.  These matters have already been discussed.  Without in any way disobeying your ruling, I want to point out that the Minister in his introductory remarks mentioned that one of the reasons for this Estimate was the relief of distress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that money cannot be on the White Paper, unless it is collected from the people. We are making the case that Fianna Fáil withdrew these subsidies and have imposed hardships on the people. Surely the withdrawal should result in much more money being available for productive employment at present? That is the reason I mention the abolition of the food subsidies at all. Everyone knows that in the past 12 months the cost of living has increased very much.  Consequently, greater hardships are imposed on the lower income group and many of them now find it hard to exist.  The Minister appreciates they are living in distress.</P>
      <P>Coming from an area at the very end of this country where comment has been made of late by people in all walks of life regarding the rapid depopulation going on there, I would be failing in my duty if I did not refer to these matters.  In possibly no other constituency have the activities of the Special Employment Schemes Office a greater bearing than in the constituency I represent, West Cork.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the position there was never worse than it is to-day.  The term &ldquo;never worse&rdquo; is not my own phrase; it is a phrase used by one of our senior county council officials at a meeting of that body on Monday last, when he described the employment position, as far as the county council is concerned, as being never worse during his period as engineer with the council.  The manager gave us to understand that the position in the month of March will be much worse than in the months of January and February. We got no supplementary grants, good, bad or indifferent, such as obtained in other years.  That being the position, we expected to get much more reasonable grants from the Special Employment Schemes Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conclusion that has been drawn in my area is that Fianna Fáil are wilfully creating a slump to get rid of some of our people whom they believe to be surplus to our requirements here. I cannot see any other reason for it. <Col N="445" /> People are leaving for England and other countries to earn their livelihood. We had Deputy Booth from Dublin telling us about the reduction in unemployment figures brought about by Fianna Fáil since returning to power, even though he was unable to give us an instance of any extra employment provided by them.</P>
    <P>References I made in the Dáil recently would, to some extent, indicate to Deputy Booth the reason for these reductions in unemployment figures. During the past 12 months, not only have the Government failed to provide money for employment, but they are endeavouring to reduce unemployment figures by other methods.  What are these other methods?  My information is that we have one man, a senior official, down from Store Street, Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I naturally obey the Chair's ruling, as I feel sure that, with the Chair's knowledge and experience of procedure in the House, the Chair is undoubtedly correct.  So far as the minor employment schemes, the bog development schemes and the rural improvements schemes are concerned, much good work has been carried out in West Cork down the years.  I would not agree that the work carried out by the Special Employment Schemes Office could be deemed to be work of a non-productive nature.  With the exception of isolated schemes here and there, most of the work is useful and very helpful to the local people, apart from the fact that it provides necessary employment.</P>
      <P>We in West Cork have always had a great regard for the rural improvement scheme because we have many works of improvement carried out under that scheme and there are many yet to be carried out under it.  The improvement of drainage conditions and the improvement of roadways leading to groups of houses were very essential works, but since the Minister resumed office, subsequent to the election, he has increased the local contribution towards the cost of these works.</P>
      <P>I believe the increase is actually 100 per cent.  I do not know what reasons prompted the Minister to change the contribution rates.  The rates previously extended from 5 per cent. or 6 per cent. to 25 per cent. which, I think, was a reasonable contribution, particularly from farmers of £14, £15 and £16 valuation, and even less, which is the valuation of the majority of the people in the areas affected by these schemes.  The situation now is that the Minister, before making a grant, ensures that a contribution of up to 50 per cent. of the cost of the work must be made by the local beneficiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outcome of that new regulation is bound to be a reduction in the number of schemes carried out and that has been stated by the Minister in his introductory remarks when he <Col N="447" /> said he expects that £15,000 of the rather small sum allocated for rural improvements schemes will not be expended during the year.  I wonder would the Minister give us the reason why that £15,000 will not be expended? I feel it is due to the fact that the contributions demanded from the applicants are altogether too high and beyond the resources of many of them to pay.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go further into these matters.  I feel sure that we will have no change in the position until the main Estimate arrives, but, at the same time, I would not like to let this opportunity pass without again referring to a matter to which I have made special reference on various occasions in this House for some years past.  I feel sure that there could be much more co-ordination between Government Departments.  What I have in mind is that we have one Department of State, the Social Welfare Department, making allowances for people unable to find employment and we have other employing Departments of State, such as the Special Employment Schemes Office in the Minister's own Department, the Forestry Department and the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>I think it is a pity and regrettable that some scheme could not be worked out, whereby, instead of having to pay £3 1s. to an unemployed man with a wife and family, some few pounds more could be provided so that a week's productive work could be got from that man.  At the moment, you are paying to people who would much prefer to work half a week's wages with no return for it.  If the other half of the week's wages could be found, instead of the money going down the drain, so far as the State is concerned, you would provide a full week's work and many useful schemes throughout the country.  In making that statement, I want to make it plain that I believe it is essential and necessary that unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance should be paid to people when there is no work available for them.</P>
    <P>Ninety-nine per cent. of the people <Col N="448" /> in West Cork are anxious to obtain employment, and I fail to see why we have not some co-ordination between the Departments, and thus ensure that some of the money which is paid out in benefits could be handed to some employing Department and so cut out the need for paying unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance in particular districts.  When the State pays out money for productive work you not only get the productive work but, to a very big extent, through direct taxation, the State gets back a big portion of that money again.  The man who takes a drink, buys a packet of cigarettes or buys a pint contributes directly to the State coffers.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go further afield in this debate in case I may find myself in conflict with the rulings of the Chair.  My main reason for intervening was to protest on behalf of the many applicants in West Cork against the increase in the local contributions sought for the rural improvements schemes and to express the indignation of the many unemployed people in my constituency with the attitude of the present Government in dealing with their plight.  If I were allowed, without transgressing the Chair's rulings, to continue regarding the activities of the Department of Social Welfare at the present time, it would be the answer to the question posed by Deputy Booth earlier in this debate.</P>

      <P>The presentation of this Supplementary Estimate by the Minister for Finance is a clear admission that the supposed policy on which he and his Party assumed office has very little to show at the end of 12 months in office, with the substantial majority they obtained.  We can all recall the posters so evident, not alone in the towns and cities but also in rural parts, blatantly conveying the impression that the Party seeking office had a solution for the country's problems at the time.  We know the country had then suffered in consequence of problems arising from the imbalance of payments; we know that the action taken by the Government at that time was necessary and no alternative action was suggested by <Col N="449" /> the then Opposition, but nevertheless it was a useful weapon for them when presented with the opportunity of a general election.  Now, within 12 months, we have the spectacle of the Minister for Finance coming here for £224,000 to relieve distress.  It would not be necessary to introduce this Supplementary Estimate for £224,000 if the Minister had not given away £180,000 to the master bakers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>My submission is that a sum of £44,000 would meet the Minister's needs at the moment if he had not gratuitously presented the master bakers with £180,000.</P>
      <P>This money is to be spent on emergency schemes to relieve distress.  What a profound change in 12 months.  I represent a constituency which has no record in emigration.  The constituency of North Cork, comprised mainly of farming folk, with few industries and only one town of any consequence, the town of Mallow, down through the years had no serious unemployment or emigration as other parts of the country unfortunately had.  But in the course of the last six months we have known enough of these evils, and, for the first time in the history of this State, whole families have emigrated from this constituency.  The town of Mallow, unfortunately, has severe unemployment at this moment.  Twelve months ago a housing scheme was awaiting introduction to provide employment but it is now only surmise whether we are any nearer the date of commencement of that work.</P>
      <P>May I point out that the Minister for Finance wiped out an excellent scheme, having regard to its labour content and the relatively low amount of money required for administration?  I am referring to the Local Authorities (Works) Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it does not come directly within the scope of this Department, but I submit that <Col N="450" /> much of the unemployment this is intended to relieve has been created by the cessation of works under that scheme and that the Act provided an opportunity of maintaining people in employment and providing employment for those needing it.</P>
      <P>We have this inflated Estimate for the relief of distress now before us and surely Deputies who sit behind the Minister and support his Party must feel they have let the people down, the people who, a mere 12 months ago, were attracted by the various promises made on posters throughout the country in front of every polling booth designed to convey to the people that they would fare much better if they had Fianna Fáil in office.  No doubt many wives were influenced by the hope of their husbands getting work, but it did not say where they would work, whether here or in England.  The sad experience in my constituency is that they are now working in England. I am afraid the passing of this Estimate will not do much to reduce the impact of to-day's conditions in the part of the country I represent.</P>

      <P>This simple Estimate has led to a very protracted discussion. Great play has been made of the posters produced by Fianna Fáil in the last general election, but I would say that hell itself must be paved with the posters produced by Fine Gael over the years.  The chief spokesman of the Fine Gael Party has referred to the political dishonesty of Fianna Fáil but he has changed course so often and switched direction on so many occasions that he has earned the title of &ldquo;arch high-priest of political dishonesty&rdquo; in this country.  Fine Gael's record in regard to unemployment is a very sorry one.  Was it not a member of the Fine Gael Party, then a Minister in the Fine Gael Government and now a Deputy of this House, who said that the Government had no responsibility for unemployment?  Housing has been referred to by Deputy Corish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish only to make a passing reference to what Deputy Corish said.  As a member of a public body I can recall that midway in 1956 there was not one penny available from the Coalition Government for housing and we had a circular to the effect that we should close down on all housing. Admittedly unemployment figures are high although they are something like 10,000 below the figures of last year.  It is agreed also that the emigration figure is high but generally I think things have improved in the country.</P>
      <P>The Road Fund was mentioned in regard to its potential employment content.  The Deputy who referred to it should have been very slow to do so as should any member of the Coalition Cabinet.  Was it not that Cabinet that raided the Road Fund to the extent of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing so only in regard to its potential employment content.  When the present Government took over it made a contribution of £900,000 to the Road Fund.  I agree, as every Deputy agrees, that there is a serious unemployment problem and a serious emigration problem; nobody will try to minimise these problems.  It will require the all-out effort of the Government and every Deputy in this House and of our local bodies to deal with these problems but I am sure the Government will deal with them to the best of its ability.</P>
      <P>The Local Authorities (Works) Act was mentioned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

      <P>I agree.  If it were possible to restore the Local Authorities (Works) Act and carry out works under it I think every Deputy would agree to that course, but it is a matter for the taxpayers and the ratepayers concerned and they are important considerations in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of relief grants as they affect urban bodies was also mentioned and one such grant is included in this <Col N="452" /> Estimate.  I am sure the Deputy who spoke on this subject was referring to the emergency schemes when he said that urban bodies were finding it rather difficult to provide schemes under this heading.  I hope when the Minister comes to frame his Budget he will not take his cue from that statement because I can assure him that urban bodies can and will provide sufficient useful schemes to absorb the moneys available under the Emergency Schemes Vote.</P>

      <P>About 12 months ago the then Government and the Parties comprising it were severely criticised throughout the country for the extent of unemployment at that time.  A good deal of blame was thrown upon them, and in particular upon the Labour Party, for their adherence to the Government.  I do not say that we did not deserve some of the blame but so great was the blame thrown upon us that it was used by one Party to force the Government to go out of office.</P>
      <P>Certainly, unemployment was serious then.  Certainly, the Labour Party had to use every effort possible to see how far they could remedy the position.  If they could not provide productive employment it was their job at least to see that some type of relief was provided. We introduced a Supplementary Estimate on lines similar to this Estimate but with this difference, that at least £500,000 was provided in January, 1957, expressly for the relief of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the abuse and criticism levelled at us by the then Opposition Party, Fianna Fáil, for our inadequate efforts, our &ldquo;hopeless bungling&rdquo;, and I remember the screaming headlines in every edition of the <i>Irish Press</i> and <i>Sunday Press,</i> which carried pictures of people lined at the port for the emigrant ship, pictures of people standing outside offices and factories that had discontinued operations and descriptions of more workers going to England, the United States and elsewhere. All these things may have been true then, but they are more true at the present day and, no matter what any member from the other side of the House may say about things improving, <Col N="453" /> I know that he knows very well that he is saying something that is not true.</P>
    <P>Where now is Deputy Lemass's plan for full employment?  Everybody needs time to develop plans, but we suggest that by this time there should have been some indication of that drive for full employment that we were told by the <i>Irish Press</i> was ready and waiting to be put into operation.</P>
    <P>What have we in this Estimate?  A pittance that is practically all spent, with a gloomy two or three months to go before the local authorities will receive any fresh money in the form of grants or local rates.  In County Waterford, in fact, in the whole of the Waterford constituency, there has never been so much emigration as there is now.  Over 60 per cent. of the road workers of County Waterford have been laid off since as early as last September.  These workers in particular depended on special employment grants. They hoped that they would continue them in employment at least up to Christmas or early in the new year. Waterford County Council dropped some £26,000 in grants.  I know that that has nothing to do with this Estimate but the cut last year made a bigger Estimate all the more essential this year.</P>
    <P>In Waterford City the labour exchange is crowded out.  Workers are fleeing twice a week on the Waterford boat, and every other night on the Rosslare boat.  We take all this against the promises made by the Taoiseach even as late as last December on the Adjournment debate.  I wonder what the effect of all this unemployment will be on local ratepayers.  It must be pretty clear to everybody that, to give the unemployed some form of sustenance, local authorities must provide additional home assistance.  They must add to the pittance that the unemployed receive by way of unemployment benefit or, as they are more likely receiving because of the duration of the period of unemployment, unemployment assistance.  All that is thrown upon the local authorities and then the question rings throughout the country: &ldquo;What is happening to the rates?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> It must be clear that because of the inadequacy of this Estimate the position in the country will disimprove.  I am afraid the outlook for the next 12 months is not very good.  The Minister for Lands during the past three or four weeks has endeavoured to prepare the country, not for one, two or three years of hard living but I believe he expressed the view in his latest statement that we might prepare to tighten our belt for the next 20 years.  If that is the position, the workers should have learned their lesson and in future will know whether or not they should believe the promises of Fianna Fáil as they have done in the past.</P>

      <P>One of the most disconcerting things that strike us from day to day is the apparent absence of any positive policy so far as the Government is concerned towards the relief of unemployment.  Before the House adjourned in December last, I endeavoured to get from the Government some indication as to the steps they proposed to take for the purpose of grappling with the very serious unemployment problem which then existed.  When the House adjourned on 5th December last the number of unemployed was 67,300.  The number registered in the last return issued by the Central Statistics Office is 86,000. The figure has risen by almost 19,000 since the Government was asked on 5th December last to indicate what they proposed to do to deal with the serious unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>I rise this evening for the purpose of making another effort to extract from the Government some information as to what positive and concrete steps they intend to take to deal with the serious unemployment problem which surrounds us and the existence of which has to be acknowledged by Deputies from all parts of the House. The present figure of unemployed is returned at 86,000.</P>

      <P>No Government can pretend to be unconcerned with that situation.  I do not expect that the Government can perform miracles but we should at least have some indication of its policy and some evidence that it recognises the seriousness of the whole situation.  These figures would be bad enough if they represented a correct assessment of the economic situation of the country but they do not.  Every Deputy knows that last year there was a flood-tide of emigration.  People who were in jobs this time last year in this country are in England to-day.  A very considerable additional number are contemplating the taking of the emigrant ship at an early date because, particularly in rural areas, the picture is one of unrelieved bleakness.</P>
      <P>Last week I asked a question in order to ascertain the unemployment figures in four employment exchange branch offices in Kildare and the answer indicated that the unemployment figures were higher than they had been for a long number of years. In my view, these high unemployment figures will continue to rise as there is a complete sag in employment in various activities which previously offered employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In examining this serious unemployment problem, as represented by approximately 86,000 unemployed persons, we must view it against the background that, last year and for the portion of this year which has so far run, we have had unprecedented unemployment. Some of the building <Col N="456" /> trade unions in this country will tell you that they now have more members in England than in Ireland because there has been such a fall in possible employment so far as those building trade operatives are concerned.</P>
    <P>Let us bear in mind also that the number of persons employed to-day on forestry operations, on electrical development, on housing and on drainage is substantially lower than it was last year.  Because of that fact, you have&mdash;in rural areas, in particular&mdash; a very serious unemployment problem which is carrying with it&mdash;and this is worse than anything else&mdash;a conviction in the minds of those unfortunate victims of unemployment that there is no hope for them in this country and that to get out of it as soon as possible is the best means of relieving their plight.  The development of that mentality is to be deplored.  You can get people to brace themselves for a short period of unemployment.  You can get people to withstand hardship for a period in the hope that, in the end, they will see a bright horizon before them.  However, when people become convinced that there is nothing here for them, when the picture is one of unrelieved bleakness, they look for the remedy of going to a country where, in the existing organisation of that country, they can get full-time employment.</P>
    <P>I was in a part of my constituency yesterday and I called on a shopkeeper on business.  I asked him how business was going at present.  The shopkeeper in question has been in business for more than 30 years, and he said that business has never been as bad as in the past six months.  He said that, from originally being a shopkeeper, he was now being converted into a moneylender. Because his customers have virtually no source of income, he is being compelled to give them goods on credit in the hope that, later on, they can get some kind of a job.  He added: &ldquo;I am getting into difficulties now with my bank because I am giving too much credit.  What can I do with people I have lived with all my life except to give them the goods they want in the hope that they will be able to pay for them later?&rdquo;  He then <Col N="457" /> made this extraordinary statement: &ldquo;I saw the days when people would come into this shop and pass £1 or £5 notes over the counter to pay for goods and take their change away.  If you will look at my till you will find that the main currency used in this job now is home assistance vouchers and social welfare drafts.&rdquo;  In other words, the community in that particular area were, in the main, living on one or other of two sources of income&mdash;home assistance vouchers or unemployment benefit or sickness benefit, but unemployment benefit in the main.</P>
    <P>In that area there is a vast amount of work which could be done&mdash;afforestation, land division, drainage, turf development, and so on.  All that is work of a national character.  It would be far more beneficial to employ the people on such work than to give 61/- at the employment exchange to a man with a wife and two children.  I make allowances for the Government's difficulties. I do not expect them to perform miracles in our state of economic backwardness but the present situation is extremely serious and immediate steps must be taken to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, the Minister might tell us what the Government proposes to do during the next few months to relieve the chronic unemployment situation.  What ray of hope will be held out to those people who are now unemployed in the rural areas and who see no prospect whatever of getting employment until the local authorities enter on a new financial year and road schemes are prepared to absorb some of them or, on the other hand, until Bord na Móna is in a position to resume its turf-cutting activities in various areas?  Except for these two items of potential employment, the picture in the rural areas is dark and bleak.  As the Minister, in particular, is the Minister for Finance, he ought to give the House some indication of what the Government proposes to do to bring down the unemployment figure.</P>
    <P>The vital seriousness of the present unemployment problem is the fact that the unemployment figure does not represent a complete appraisal of our <Col N="458" /> economic infirmity due to the fact that a large number of people who would otherwise be unemployed have got off the unemployment register by seeking employment in England.  What would we do if these people insisted on staying here and demanded their right to work in their own country?  Let it be said that in the past, all Parties, apparently, felt that so long as the emigrant ship was available the unemployment problem could be kept to manageable proportions.  How long that situation will continue is another matter.</P>
    <P>The number of unemployed is obvious evidence that there is a deep-seated economic malaise and that only the Government can take steps to solve the problem.  Therefore, on this occasion, the Minister might avail of the opportunity to say, at least in broad outline, what the Government propose to do.  We are entitled to ask him this question: does he intend to allow things to drift as they are drifting or does he propose to make any announcement which will hold out for the 86,000 persons now unemployed a prospect that they will soon be absorbed into productive employment if possible but, at all events, into some employment so as to prevent a continuance of the present demoralising atmosphere which surrounds the whole present unemployment problem?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to add to what has been said already, but I should like to indicate the position in Limerick.  We have over 3,000 unemployed there and as far as I know that is the highest number ever reached in unemployment there.  The sum which the Minister proposes to allocate to these schemes amounts to £224,000 in all.  That is less than £3 per head of the number unemployed now.  I am sure the Minister appreciates that unemployment at present is very distressful indeed.  I did not think any Deputy who has spoken here to-day, either on behalf of his own constituents or on behalf of the country as a whole, has exaggerated one iota.  In my experience in public life, I do not remember the unemployment position or the distress due to <Col N="459" /> unemployment in my native city being as bad as it is now.</P>
      <P>Limerick is essentially a distributing area, a seaport town where raw materials are brought in.  Due to the necessity now to restrict imports, largely of wheat and feeding grains, the docks in Limerick are almost shut down.  One of the largest factories there will be going out of production for all time.  By and large, we in Limerick are faced with a critical problem.  Other Deputies have spoken about emigrants going away by sea, but we have the unfortunate experience in Limerick of seeing them go away by sea and by air from Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>I know that the funds at the Minister's disposal are very limited, but I would appeal to him on this occasion to make a greater effort in regard to those who are unemployed&mdash;particularly those who are drawing unemployment assistance of 41/- a week for a man, his wife and five or more children&mdash;in order to give them at least an opportunity to keep themselves in employable condition, so that if and when work is resumed on any scale, particularly in the building and allied trades, these men will have an opportunity to take up employment. We owe it to this section of the community, from whom £6,000,000 was largely taken in the recent withdrawal of the subsidies on bread and other foodstuffs, at least to repay them something more than £3 per head of the unemployed.</P>
      <P>As other Deputies mentioned, every local authority is paying out possibly double last year's figures.  I know the figure in Limerick is double the amount of home assistance paid out last year, and this is largely to assist people to pay their rents on housing schemes.  It does not need any graphic picture to illustrate the desperate condition of a man with a wife and family, living in a corporation house and called on to pay 11/- and upwards in rent, on a meagre income of a little over £2 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to join other Deputies in asking the Minister&mdash;and if he is not the proper Minister, in asking the <Col N="460" /> Government&mdash;to indicate, having regard to the very critical position of the country, what are not alone their long-term plans but&mdash;more important at the moment&mdash;their short-term plans for dealing with the unemployment position throughout the country.</P>

      <P>This Vote ought to be taken in its proper perspective and some effort should be made to get it into the proper setting, in order that the country may see how far the Government is facing up to its responsibility in connection with what they themselves have always described as the test of capacity to govern in this country, namely, the attitude towards unemployment and towards emigration.</P>
      <P>With regard to the adequacy of this amount, or getting it into proper perspective, the sum now requested, £224,000, is less than the money which was given by the Government as a free gift to the bakers&mdash;based as it was, first of all, on a falsehood in the Dáil, and the justification for which has never been admitted since.  We were told it was a guarantee which was given by the predecessor of the present Government. That was immediately denied by Deputy Norton.</P>

      <P>There is the comparison of £250,000 to one group and no case for its justification made in the Dáil; and £224,000 now to some part of the 80,000 people signing on the unemployment register.  With regard to the setting, this is much more important than the other matter.  Deputy Booth, speaking in this debate, accepted a phrase which was used by <Col N="461" /> Deputy Dillon when he talked about the &ldquo;heroic effort&rdquo; of the present Government to meet unemployment and its being relieved by emigration. He quoted from an O.E.E.C., Report based entirely on emigration and unemployment figures and paid no attention whatever to the further drift away from the country by reason of increased emigration.  Calculations were made in one of the papers recently, that speak of a new peak being reached in 1957, that speak of a very big number extra, something in the nature of 9,000 to 10,000 people extra going out of the country, over what went in a previous peak year.  If that be added to those who are unemployed as revealed by the official figures, it will be seen there is no improvement, in what Deputy Booth called the &ldquo;heroic effort&rdquo; to reduce the unemployment figure from 12 per cent. to something approaching 9 per cent.  That boast is shown to be a false and hollow one. Deputy Booth, however, as a business man, has his mind attracted by another phrase in the O.E.E.C. Report and speaks of what he called &ldquo;the stern budgetary policy&rdquo; that the present Government inaugurated.  It is in that field I think this Vote ought to be set.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne said that he understood that the Minister for Lands had explained that the period in which we might suffer by way of lower prices and a lowered standard of living, and so on, was a period of about 20 years. I have not heard it extended as far as that, but the Minister for Lands is certainly on record, speaking at a Fianna Fáil meeting at Castleblakeney in County Westmeath, reported on the 6th of this month, as saying that ten years would be required before this country would be brought to a proper situation.  The Minister for Lands and the Minister for Education are the two people who are sent out as a try-out on the community.  I suppose the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Education have jangled more skeletons of their own imagining than in any dining-out period of the year round about autumn and winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the theme of their address at all these meetings?  &ldquo;This country requires more hard work.&rdquo; The theme <Col N="462" />&ldquo;hard work&rdquo; has been played up and down this country&mdash;as if this community had the reputation for being either idle or lazy.  One of the things certainly attributed to our people, when they leave this country and go to work elsewhere, is their industry, the fact that they work long and laborious hours and the fact that they can bend themselves to all sorts of employment, from even the lowest menial work to the highest skilled work.  One thing never alleged against them is that they have any disaffection against work. We have no reputation of being either idlers or lazy people.  Of course, the phrase &ldquo;work harder&rdquo; does not really mean what these gentlemen mean when they use this phrase.  The phrase &ldquo;work harder&rdquo; means, as it is understood as a result of the stiff budgetary policy of last year, that people must work at least the same hours and give the same products, for less wages; because right through the whole of the Fianna Fáil policy from 1947 there has been the recurring theme of reducing the purchasing power of the community.  It was feared by them&mdash; and that is their economic philosophy &mdash;that a purchasing power left free in the hands of the spenders of the community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I feel I should be allowed to say what that &ldquo;stern budgetary policy&rdquo; is.  All this talk of the Minister for Lands about wages and salaries must mean only one thing.  He talked about reducing costs.  The costs spoken of by the Minister for Lands meant only one thing&mdash;wages and salaries.  At the Wicklow Chamber of Commerce the Minister for Lands told us that for the next 20 years this country would have to accept a more modest standard of living.  He said that wages, profits and salaries would have to be kept at a proper level.  He <Col N="463" /> also spoke of the various means by which a more modest standard of living would be imposed on the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was relating my remarks to what Deputy Booth said about the budgetary policy of O.E.E.C. I relate my remarks to the Supplementary Estimate for £224,000 which is designed to give some little assistance and provide some little money to relieve unemployment.  When the Minister for Finance introduced his Budget last May and when gloom was gathering around the House, the Minister for Education said it was a back to work Budget.  That was the slogan taken up by Fianna Fáil.  If the exactions of the Budget appeared to be very serious, in any event it was going to put people back to work, to increase production and employment, to decrease unemployment.  We see now how the Government are facing up to the test, coming in here with a Vote of £224,000 in order to make some little gesture to the figure of unemployment which is growing steadily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton spoke about 86,000 people being unemployed and he was interrupted by the Minister when he said that was a record figure.  I was inclined to agree with the Minister because, of course, it was not a record for Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil reached their record in 1936 when at least 10,000 more than the figure mentioned by Deputy Norton were unemployed. The Fianna Fáil average figure over the years has been nearer to 110,000 than 100,000.  In any event we are in the position now where unemployment is rising week by week.  This £224,000 has already been spent.  I suppose it has had its effect in keeping the unemployment figures from rising to a still higher point.  Whatever effect they have had, it is now exhausted and we will now resume the upward march of these figures.  We are trying to help the 86,000 unemployed with this little bit of assistance while at the same time <Col N="464" /> emigration has reached a new peak. In addition to that, business is depressed and there is no way in which industrial activity can be given new life.  All the forecasts for the next Budget are getting gloomier and gloomier; there will be no reliefs given; nothing more is being promised; there will be more stern taxes and bigger impositions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Except when I relate my remarks to the statement of Deputy Booth who so approved of the O.E.E.C. budgetary policy.  That policy meant further increased taxation. I think it was Deputy Norton who said that the people should be allowed some recompense for the removal of the subsidies.  We can take it that the subsidies will not be put back.  There is no promise of a reduction in emigration, no hope of smaller unemployment figures.</P>
      <P>Of course there is no money.  If any money had been available it would have been spent, as Deputy Booth said, on the relief of unemployment; it would have been disbursed by way of the Local Authorities (Works) Act and such schemes.  Of course there is no money.  There is not money even to meet the ordinary expenditure of the State from week to week.  There is no money, Deputy Booth said.  And Deputy Booth sits behind the Minister for Industry and Commerce who two years ago had a plan for the provision of £100,000,000 without any increased taxation, without resorting to foreign capital.</P>

What happened to the £100,000,000 which <Col N="465" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce said he could get within two years?  Not merely is it the case that we can afford only £224,000 at this stage to try and relieve the very heavy unemployment now disclosed, but one of these days we shall be discussing Deputy Lemass's new plan to get capital from abroad which, for many years, he frowned upon.</P>

      <P>That is the setting in which I am getting this matter.  We have discarded the £100,000,000 plan of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and we are now to draw on foreign resources.  We are to get capital in here from American and English sources.  We have asked the people to submit to a more moderate standard of living for the next 20 years; we are not bothering about emigration which tends to keep down the unemployment figures.  People have got to live according to more moderate standards; they have to live on less money and on money of a debased coinage as the months go on.</P>

      <P>I am relating my remarks to what other people were allowed to say in a wider field than that.  I have my notes in regard to what Deputy Booth said and I have not moved outside that widened area. I think it was Deputy Burke who spoke of the success of the last loan, a loan which was very nearly a short term loan.  It was at 6 per cent.  There had been three loans floated in England&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am again relating my remarks to what was said by another Deputy.  Deputy Burke spoke of the financial wizard the Minister for Finance was because he got £10,000,000 last year.  I am concerned with what Deputy Burke said.  If Deputy Burke is allowed to traverse that field, I am entitled to answer him. Of course, he ran away from that when it was pointed out that the rate of interest was 6 per cent.  That is the kind of confluence people are showing when a ten-year loan has to be floated at 6 per cent.  Confidence that has to be bought in that way is very nearly an insult.</P>

      <P>Then I shall deal with that at another time.  We are discussing a sum of £224,000, and that is the sole resort the present Government has to the mounting unemployment figures.  Even those are not made full and true by the addition of the increased emigration there has been during the past six or seven months. All this unemployment and emigration can be related back to the policy behind the last Budget.  This policy was that people were living too well under the previous Government, that they had to be brought down to another level and that their purchasing power must be reduced because if it was not reduced, then the Government had no resort against what they thought was going to be inflation.  The measures which we took did prove successful and they will be successful as long as the blundering hands of the Fianna Fáil Government are not put upon them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have before us a very small Estimate of £224,000, a <Col N="468" /> Supplementary for the purpose of financing work which, in the main, has already been carried out.  On the day on which we are considering this Estimate, we had a reply to a parliamentary question that unemployment is in the region of 86,000.  If we refer back again to the attitude taken by members of the present Government and even to the discussions here on the formation of the Government and on the introduction of the Budget last year, we will possibly see on the records an indication that the Government proposed to take some kind of steps to deal with this question of unemployment.</P>
      <P>I myself contributed briefly to one of those discussions and, as I recollect, the words I used were that with the new Government, even one that had had some 16 years of experience in office, neither the House nor the country would be expect that unemployment would be cured in a day, or even that it would be cured in a month, but that the House and the country would in the months that followed the setting up of that Government, follow very carefully any steps taken for the purpose of achieving a substantial reduction in the figure of men, women, boys and girls unemployed.</P>
      <P>There is no purpose in dwelling too long on the type of propaganda that was issued throughout the country, on the type of posters that were published in my own and other constituencies: &ldquo;Vote Fianna Fáil and let us get cracking.&rdquo;  Hallow'een has come and gone and we do not see any sign of anybody getting cracking.  The only way that word can be related to the present situation is the crack of the economic whip on the back of the ordinary citizen and the workers.  Certainly in the last few months, there is hardly a working-class family that has not felt the crack of that economic whip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man, youth or girl who is compelled to sign at the local labour exchange, either for benefit or assistance, must be thinking very bitterly about the developments of the past 12 months.  Instead of observing around them the results of the efforts of a Government that was very proud to <Col N="469" /> use the word &ldquo;strong,&rdquo; to reduce unemployment or to create, in the words of some of their spokesmen, &ldquo;conditions which will achieve that end,&rdquo; they find very little comfort in the figures.</P>
    <P>I will not attempt to refer to the situation in the rural areas.  Deputies familiar with the situation in their own districts have already spoken and have very clearly demonstrated, not the emptiness of promises, but certainly the complete lack of purpose.  Within the City of Dublin, the unemployment figures are equally as high, if not higher than, they were when this Government came into office.  At the present day, we can record, with a very serious expression of regret, that there are fewer workers employed in the building industry, whether for local authorities or for private interests, than at any time since building recommenced after the emergency.  There is no doubt that there has been a greater degree of emigration of building workers, skilled craftsmen and unskilled workers from the City of Dublin during the past year than indeed for many years, and certainly there does not appear to be very much hope in the future.  It is not too many years since appeals went out from this House to bring back building workers from England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual, I will accept your direction.  Sir, but nevertheless I am sure you will permit me to remark that a time of serious unemployment in our city is a time at which consideration of an Estimate like this can include reference to the extent of unemployment <Col N="470" /> and reference to the need for moneys such as those referred to under this sub-head.</P>
      <P>There are fewer employed in Dublin this year than for many years and far more workers, of any and every kind, have left the city during the past 12 months than for many years.  During the course of the debate on the Budget, in May, 1957, I referred in my contribution at that time, to the fact that a Minister of the present Government and a Deputy, who unfortunately passed away some months later, and myself, received a deputation of working-class women who were concerned with the effect of certain actions of the Government.  A spokesman of Fianna Fáil indicated that in their view what was urgently needed was employment and he indicated in this House that these working-class women had stated that if their husbands or sons had regular employment in their own city, they would not be so concerned with the increases arising from the withdrawal of the food subsidies.</P>
      <P>Those words were uttered here in this House.  They surely indicated, as far as the Government and their supporters were concerned, that they were concerned with the existing heavy unemployment at that time and that they were concerned to an extent with the effects of the withdrawal of the food subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>They indicated that they were satisfied that if work was provided, if the ordinary families in our cities were assured that the breadwinners had reasonable employment, their complaints under the other heading would be minimised to a great extent.  Nine months have passed. This Government were returned to power because of the belief of the ordinary people in the constituencies of Dublin, and throughout the country, that they had some plans and, given power and authority, would utilise those plans for the purpose of solving the economic difficulties of the country and so resolve the economic difficulties facing each and every family in the country.  This was noted nine months <Col N="471" /> ago and nine months later, we have 86,000 unemployed.</P>
      <P>The present Estimate, of course, will be passed.  There is no doubt about that.  Practically all the money is spent.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance, in replying to this discussion, will indicate whether, in his view, it was not possible to come before the House this time with a much larger Estimate, with some proposals that would have effect on the existing situation.  As I understand it, the moneys provided in the present Supplementary Estimate are to a great extent already spent.  Whatever value they had in providing some employment in urban and rural areas has in a large measure disappeared.  The Minister might indicate in his reply whether he has anything else in view, because it should be very plain to the general public that this £224,000 is not an additional £224,000 for the future, and no group of citizens, either in urban or rural areas, will obtain any significant assistance from the proceeds of this Estimate.</P>
      <P>It has already assisted a number of citizens and one of the criticisms we would make from this bench is that the sum mentioned to-day is a very miserable one, in view of the present situation in our country.  We realise, of course, that this is supplementary to an amount already provided but, even when we add it to the original Estimate, it will give no indication to the families who are actually suffering hardship, as a result of unemployment, that there is any vestige left in existence of the dynamic plan which was going to provide for a new era almost overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is never a pleasant thing at any time, or under any circumstances, to use the words &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;, but the most bitter occasion on which words of that nature can be used is an occasion such as this, when, after a period such as has elapsed since the formation of the present Government, the picture is beginning to become very clear.  The Government, which through the Minister for Finance, comes before this House seeking this Supplementary Estimate, appears in recent months to have taken up its <Col N="472" /> classic position, that they will let private enterprise, private initiative or private anything you like, deal with the problems which are basically problems of government&mdash;the problems of the economic situation of the country. The Estimate will be supported and I trust that the Minister for Finance will not feel that the Deputies who have contributed to this debate have been unduly harsh.  It is very difficult to speak nicely, and to use words of praise, when each day in this capital city one sees the numbers of unemployed growing, the numbers of those leaving our city growing, and the economic position of those remaining with us becoming more difficult all the time.</P>
    <P>The Government have a responsibility. They accepted that responsibility and, if they have not done it in the past, at least let us hope that in the future they will endeavour to forget the publicity slogans they used in the last election campaign.  They should endeavour not to talk so glibly about the housekeeping budget and, at the same time, forget completely about the ordinary housekeeping budget of the citizen and his family.  A good national Budget that rests on a budget of the ordinary citizen which is depreciating constantly and imposes increasing hardship on the citizen's family, is of no value to this or any other nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Larkin referred to the fact that the Government had a responsibility in relation to unemployment.  He went on to say that the Government accepted that responsibility. I think he might have put it rather stronger by saying that the Government sought that responsibility, and did so in a very definite manner, just 11 months ago.  It is right that the occasion of this Supplementary Estimate should be availed of by Deputies to inquire from the Government what progress they have made in discharging the responsibility they so avidly sought this time 12 months ago.  I should like to remind those Deputies on the Government side, who owe their seats to the fact that last February and March they convinced the people of this country they had a plan for ending unemployment, that <Col N="473" /> here on this side of the House there is an Opposition that intends to keep the Government alive to its responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Last February and March, in every part of the country, Fianna Fáil speakers used the phrase &ldquo;Unemployment is the test.&rdquo;  In the last general election, on every hoarding throughout the country, there was the clarion call &ldquo;Women, get your men to work.  Vote Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  In every part of this country 12 months ago those out of work were told by Fianna Fáil &ldquo;Change the Government and you can vote yourself into a job.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Did the Minister for Finance think, in introducing the Supplementary Estimate, that it would be a formality? Did he think that this Dáil consisted of so many dummies who would not be prepared to remind him and his colleagues of their responsibilities in this matter?  I do not like to estimate numbers but I do estimate that there are some 15 or 16 Deputies sitting in this House who were sent here because they were pledged to implement a policy immediately to end unemployment. How many an unfortunate man 12 months ago was eager to get the pencil in his hand and mark a ballot paper in favour of Fianna Fáil when he heard the present Tánaiste say, as he did on the eve of the last election, &ldquo;Beginning next month a Fianna Fáil Government will work relentlessly for the ending of unemployment&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>That was 11 months ago.  What result has been achieved by a Fianna Fáil Government pledged to work relentlessly for the ending of unemployment? To-day there are over 80,000 people out of work, hopeless, disillusioned Irish citizens who cannot find employment in their own country. In the 11 months that have passed since this Government was sent in to end unemployment there has been a steady stream of emigration of hopeless persons sent out from our shores and forced to seek employment elsewhere. Has that been the result of a Government seriously committed to work relentlessly for the ending of unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is indeed unfortunate for the public life of this country that 11 <Col N="474" /> months after an election deliberately fought by the present Government on unemployment, they should come to the Dáil with their hands out for more money to spend in the relief of distress. A sum of £224,000 as a supplementary item is needed now, 11 months later, because unemployment is increasing and because this Government has not a plan to solve it.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the members of the present Government are complacent as regards this matter.  I do not know whether they think they can shrug off the responsibility they sought 11 months ago.  It is a matter entirely for their individual or collective consciences.  Certainly, in the interests of public integrity, I should have expected that, at some stage in the last 11 months, some spokesman of the Government would have given some indication of a policy which would end or seek to reduce unemployment. If this Government is working at all, why can they not tell the people what they are doing?  If they have any plans or any policy, why can they not tell the Dáil what those plans are and what the policy is?  Are the unemployed to be given no hope now that their votes do not count?  Surely some member of the Government, after 11 months' consideration, should be in a position to tell the people of this country what the plan is for unemployment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the fact that money is sought in this Vote for urban employment schemes as a distress measure and if money is sought in that way, we would expect that there would be some statement of policy by the Government which would show what proposals they have to provide permanent employment both in urban and rural areas.  Apparently that is not forthcoming and the unemployed must just hope on for the day in which, perhaps, better times may come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pointed out that the money we are asked to vote now, £224,000, is money already spent, money which, in relation to its expenditure, has had its effect in presumably <Col N="475" /> curbing in some way the unemployment figures.  Is it not, therefore, disturbing that, after a total expenditure of over £800,000 on unemployment and emergency schemes which may be put under the collective term of distress measures, there are still 86,000 people unemployed?</P>
    <P>I feel that, while the money sought will not be refused by the Dáil, it is right that the opportunity presented should be availed of to seek from the Government some declaration of their policy with regard to the future.  Are we to expect that henceforth from time to time Supplementary Estimates of this kind will be sought&mdash;stopgap measures to curb temporarily the rise in unemployment?  Can we expect now after sufficient time has been given to the Government to see some evidence of a long-term policy and proper planning?</P>
    <P>Certainly, so far as we in the Fine Gael Party are concerned, we shall continue to seek such a disclosure of policy from the Government and we shall continue to remind the Government that they sought themselves this responsibility 11 months ago and, having got it, must live up to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>In a debate of this nature, there is a danger of repetition, but, like my colleagues, I feel that the unemployment situation at the moment is of such dimensions that too much cannot, be said about it.  The time of this House, far from being wasted, can be very wisely spent in bringing to the notice of the Minister and the Government the feeling not alone of concern but of frustration that pervades the different constituencies at the moment, so far as the unemployment situation is concerned.</P>
      <P>I do not know if any of my colleagues from Cork City have spoken on this already.  I think not, but, no doubt, later, they will give us the benefit of their observations on the matter; but I am quite sure that they cannot but agree with me that the unemployment situation in Cork City at the moment is the worst we have known for very many years.  As a matter of fact, it is the worst that I can remember since I came into public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> One aspect of the situation which strikes me very forcibly is the type of person who is now forced to sign on at the local employment exchange.  You have people signing on there who were never idle in Cork City before.  I met a friend of mine the other day&mdash;a man of about 40 years of age, a good, industrious, family man.  He told me that he originally went to work at the age of 16; he is now something over 40, and had never been unemployed in his life before.  We have experience of people who were in reasonably good, sound, employment a short while ago who are now joining the ranks of the unemployed, people who were creditworthy enough to get loans from the Cork Corporation and the Cork County Council to build their own houses, people who appeared at that time, some few short years ago, to be in reasonably good employment.  We can take up the local newspapers in Cork every day now and see that their interests in their bungalows and houses which they set up for themselves and their families are available for anybody who wishes to invest.  These houses are being closed up and the man, his wife and family are taking the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>Of course, when the adult population and those already employed are faced with that problem, one is struck forcibly by the lack of opportunities available to boys and girls in their teens about to leave school and for whom the normal course would be to go into jobs of one sort or another.</P>
    <P>It has been said here&mdash;and I concur &mdash;that the Government have difficulties. They are bound to have difficulties and I personally would not expect any Government to be able to work wonders, but I feel that there have been sources left untapped by the Government which would give proper employment.  My colleagues from Cork City will confirm me when I say that the unemployment situation amongst the building trade is chronic at the moment and it is not that there is no work to be done.</P>
    <P>We have already pointed out on other occasions in the House that, in the City of Cork alone, we require at the moment something like 2,000 houses.  The people living in slums and <Col N="477" /> hovels need these houses and the building operatives are there to get cracking on the job, but no progress is being made because no lead is being given by the Government to tackle that problem and absorb these people into useful employment.</P>
    <P>It may be asked: what can the Government do about it?  I have here in my possession a pamphlet, a news sheet, issued at the by-election immediately preceding the last general election in Cork City and in that by-election we got what might be regarded as a preview of the Fianna Fáil policy for the electors in the general election that followed shortly afterwards.  It is interesting now to reflect upon and study some of the statements made there enticing the electors of Cork Borough to return Alderman Galvin to this House, which of course in their simplicity at the time, they duly did.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Galvin is here because no doubt he will be interested to explain to us what has happened between his election and now to make him so silent on this unemployment question.  Deputy Galvin in his own personal address to the electors of Cork on that occasion said this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In Fianna Fáil we have set a state of full employment as our goal. We believe it can be achieved.  We are working out the details of a dynamic programme of investment which in an expanding economy will bring the nation to that goal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They were working out the details of it over a year ago&mdash;a dynamic policy. No doubt, Deputy Galvin will give us the details later on.  He goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We eagerly await the opportunity of putting that programme before the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Galvin and the Government that the electors of Cork and all others are eagerly awaiting the implementation of that programme. We are eagerly awaiting an announcement as to what it contains and I seriously suggest to the Government that this humbug must stop, that they have a responsibility to the people they duped <Col N="478" /> on that occasion and that they should make a statement of policy.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That, since modern developments have greatly modified the usefulness of present expenditure on defence and rendered it wasteful in large measure, Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that a Select Committee consisting of 14 members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, of whom six shall be a quorum, should be appointed with power to send for persons, papers and records to inquire into, consider and report upon the whole question of national defence expenditure.&mdash;(Deputies McQuillan and Browne).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate merely to point out that it is only reasonable for us to assume that the advent of nuclear weapons in everyday warfare, as has come about, is bound to have its effects on the defence programme and plans of every country in the world.  That being so, I think it is only reasonable that a motion such as this should be accepted.  I cannot see what is wrong with a Select Committee of the Dáil and Seanad being set up with power to examine the whole question of defence and report back to this House.</P>
      <P>Nobody, I think, denies that it is necessary to have an army for the protection of the lawful, elected Government of the country.  I have no doubt that an army is essential to ensure that the established Government is kept in office: without an army the Government would be liable to be overthrown by any armed group that felt they had a right to usurp the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have found many differing opinions throughout the country in connection with the Army.  Some hold that it is <Col N="479" /> too small to be effective in case of war and others that it is too big for the purpose of keeping internal order. I am not judging that issue but, if, as in my view, the main purpose of our Army is to keep internal peace and if it is too small for effective defence of the country.  I think it would be the duty of this Select Committee to point that out.  If it is too large and overstaffed and costing too much I think the time is ripe when pruning should be done, savings effected and the moneys diverted to some other Department where they could be more usefully employed.</P>
    <P>Whatever the reason, whether the Army is too big for the country or too small, whether it is overarmed or underarmed, I think the setting up of a Select Committee, a fact-finding committee, surely deserves the support of the House, and accordingly I am completely in favour of the motion.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief in my concluding remarks.  It is quite clear from the contributions made so far to this debate that no case whatever has been made by the Minister or the Government that would convey to the House the feeling that this motion is inopportune.</P>
      <P>The Minister himself resorted to very mean and low tactics.  I think it is accepted that whenever an individual has no case or is badly beaten he resorts to sneers, innuendoes and personal abuse.  The present Minister, instead of putting forward cogent arguments to counter those made in support of tills motion, resorted to personal abuse so far as I am concerned. I can assure the House I am not greatly worried by this coming from the present Minister for Defence, but I think he has a duty as Minister to answer to the other members of the House, a duty to give the reasons why the Government is not prepared to accept this motion or a similar one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke for approximately 35 to 40 minutes but he did not give as much as one sound reason why the motion should not be accepted.  He began by saying that the aim of both myself and Dr. Browne was to denigrate the Army and that I had persistently <Col N="480" /> or consistently&mdash;whichever he likes&mdash;sneered at the Army in the House.  I think it would be wiser for me at this stage to go on record, because these debates will be read elsewhere, as pointing out that since I came to this House eight or nine years ago my voice was one of the few raised on behalf of the junior commissioned ranks and the badly-neglected private and N.C.O. personnel.  So far as I was concerned no opportunity was allowed to pass without adverting to the conditions of pay and service of the N.C.O.s., privates and junior officers.  On every occasion that I stood up for the interests of those individuals I was criticised by the Ministers concerned on the ground that I was criticising the Army as a whole if I criticised the policy of the &ldquo;brass hats&rdquo; themselves.</P>
    <P>Having failed to put across the point that we were out to demean or lower the Army in the eyes of the public the Minister then sought to suggest that our aim in bringing in this motion was to ensure that we would have no Army and instead that our defence would be handed over to some other State. Nothing in the motion and nothing in the speeches made in support of it will bear witness to that point of view.  If I wanted to hit hard I could suggest to the Minister that when the handing over of this country to the tender mercies of its neighbour was suggested, the individuals who made that suggestion are on the Council of State; not the members of this House.</P>
    <P>This motion simply asks in view of the revolutionary change in modern warfare and in defensive methods over the last few years and in view of the wasteful expenditure which is now occurring as a result of these changes, that Dáil Éireann should set up a committee of the House to examine defence policy in general.  The Minister suggests that by setting up that committee the House would be taking away from him and from the Defence Chief all their rights and secrets in connection with defence.  Is that not a most stupid utterance on the Minister's part?  All we ask is that the committee be set up to examine witnesses and report back to the Minister. The committee will have no function <Col N="481" /> except to make a broadminded examination into the expenditure and report to the Minister their opinions. I see nothing wrong in that.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it is not done in any other Parliament.  That shows how little the Minister knows about other Parliaments.  If the Minister spent 20 minutes each night for the next week reading some of the debates in the British House of Commons, in connection with House Committees there to deal with questions of defence and various other sections of government, he would get very useful information which, if it had been at his disposal prior to this motion, might have allowed him to have a different frame of mind in regard to it.</P>
    <P>In America, the Senate and Congress have special committees which examine thoroughly matters put forward by the various defence chiefs.  It is nothing new in the United States for a Committee of the Senate to bring in all the brass hats in any particular service for cross-examination in regard to proposed expenditure for the current year or criticism of previous expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests that, if such a committee were set up here, Army secrets and defence secrets would be disclosed.  I have never suggested that any secret weapons that we may have in store would be made known or that secret defence plans would have to be produced to such a committee.  Of course, the Minister has his mind made up.  He has a mind like a mule and all the sound arguments in the world will not change it.  The more you prod a mule, the harder you are likely to be kicked.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to think that there is no need for an investigation on behalf of the public into expenditure on defence and defensive equipment. Let me mention one item to which I have already referred.  A few years ago a decision was taken by a Minister on the recommendation of his advisers to purchase three Vampire jet training planes.  In order to fly these training planes, the runway in Baldonnel had to be extended.  The cost of that little adventure in constructing a new runway and in purchasing first-class agricultural land for the purpose <Col N="482" /> was over £640,000.  The three jet planes cost £147,000.</P>
    <P>I shall not refer to the cost of spare-parts, maintenance, fuel or any of the incidentals involved in maintaining and flying these planes.  The argument was put forward that these three planes were necessary for the purpose of training our pilots for commercial services.  It is very desirable that our pilots be trained for commercial services but I do not think it is realistic or practical to spend almost £1,000,000 in order to train a limited number of pilots in planes that were as obsolete as the model-T was when these planes came off the assembly lines.</P>
    <P>When I raised this matter in the House the decision had been made, not to purchase three jet planes but to purchase nine because a squadron is composed of nine planes.  Due to the fact that public opinion was alerted before further, purchases were made, the people who had recommended the purchase of a squadron got cold feet and decided to do with three planes. I shall not refer to it any further except to ask is there not room for an investigation into the expenditure of almost £1,000,000 on the construction of runways and the purchase of obsolete jet planes for training purposes when for the last two hours here we have been arguing as to whether we can make available £250,000 to keep a few people in in temporary employment?</P>
    <P>When it was a matter of expending money on the mad idea of a few crackpots behind the Minister, the money was made available.  When it comes to making money available in order to keep people in employment in the State it is a different kettle of fish and we cannot afford it.  I suggest that there is room for a very searching inquiry into expenditure of this kind.</P>
    <P>I should like also to suggest that this committee would do a very good day's work if it were to inquire into the administration of the Army Vote.  In the last ten years the Army has cost £61,000,000 and, although we have had on paper an Army of 12,500, the Army has never reached more than 8,000.  All that time we have had an officer <Col N="483" /> strength for an Army of 12,500.  In others words, the defence plan that was envisaged ten years ago has never been anything but a paper plan.  We have never had the men although we have always had the officers.  Expenditure on a non-existent standing Army amounted to £61,000,000.</P>
    <P>The Defence Estimate for the year up to 31st March next is over £6,000,000. I ask the House, is it right that, out of £6,000,000, £1,000,000 must go to civilian and Civil Service personnel.  It takes £1,000,000 to administer that small Army through the civil servants and civilians attached to the Army.  Is it possible that that £1,000,000 could be saved and that we could get rid of the great proportion of the civil servants and civilians attached to the Army?  Could we not direct their activities into some other lines?  Is it not a fact that at the present time in many Army barracks skilled tradesmen and craftsmen are occupied as officers' orderlies and batmen, drawing the highest possible grade pay while the work that they should be doing as fitters, carpenters and turners is being done by civilians whose average pay is £10 a week?  Is there not room for inquiry into that matter?</P>
    <P>The Minister says &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  The Minister says: &ldquo;I will not have an inquiry because it will do harm to the Army.&rdquo; The Minister cannot get away with that.  I and others have referred in this House to the fact that the Army could put up nothing but a Stone Age defence at the present time.  I repeat that and that is not a criticism of the young men in the Army.  Although it has been sought here to suggest that when I said we had a Stone Age <Col N="484" /> defence in the way of equipment and otherwise I was sneering at Army personnel. Far be it from me to sneer at those who were my comrades during the emergency.  I have the greatest sympathy with these men who have to do with this type of equipment which I I have described as Stone Age defence.</P>
    <P>This committee would be able to investigate and inquire into the question whether it is desirable to spend £200,000 this year on ammunition of a most doubtful quality while, on the other hand, we cannot raise £30,000 to £40,000 in the Army to buy a single helicopter for coastal service, for the relief of islanders, for the purpose of helping sick people to be brought to the mainland.  Is there not something lunatic about a policy that will allow £1,000,000 to be spent on a runway for jet aircraft while, at the same time, we cannot find the paltry sum required for a helicopter that could have saved the lives of a number of our countrymen over the past few years?  Such a committee, if formed, would be in a position to make a strong recommendation to the Minister as to where savings could be made in the Army Vote&mdash;savings that could be diverted towards more useful lines of expenditure such as the purchase of a helicopter.</P>
    <P>If the Fianna Fáil backbenchers were allowed to vote in freedom and not under the shadow of the Whip&mdash; if this matter were left to their own consciences&mdash;I have not the slightest doubt but that they would support this motion.  I ask the Minister, if the has any decency left, to take off the Whip and allow a free vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a Select Committee, consisting of 11 members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, of whom four shall be a quorum, be appointed with power to send for persons, papers and records, to inquire into and report back to the Dáil within three months on the management and conduct generally of the affairs of the Gaeltarra Éireann section of the Department of the Gaeltacht, with particular reference to the production and marketing of Gaeltarra Éireann goods over the past five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matters which I seek to have examined by a Select Committee of this House are not by any means new to the House.  A variety of reasons have been attributed by both the present Minister for the Gaeltacht and his acting predecessor for my complaints in this regard.  The Minister's acting predecessor, now the Minister for Education, made the bold statement in this House that I was raising these matters because of a vendetta, to use the words of Deputy Haughey, or a spleen against a particular employee of Gaeltarra Éireann, to use the Minister's own words.  Later, the present Minister for the Gaeltacht attributed to me another motive&mdash;that <Col N="489" /> I am making these complaints in order to give air to some sort of curious difference of opinion that exists between Deputy Blowick and myself.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fanciful words in which two Ministers ascribe two different reasons for my motives and for my actions, I want to state here and now that each Minister is wrong in the opinion he has formed or that the information he has received is wrong, that each effort of each Minister in ascribing these motives to me is an attempt to whitewash the action taken not by the present Minister for the Gaeltacht but by the Minister for Education acting as Minister for the Gaeltacht, in restoring to the services of Gaeltarra Éireann an agent whom I dismissed when I was Minister for what I recorded as being misconduct within the terms of his appointment.</P>
    <P>It was alleged there was something curious about the fact that this dismissal took place on the 19th March, 1957, a day before the change of Government.  My answer to that is that there was nothing extraordinary in it, having regard to the fact that from 8th January, or some day around that date.  I was conducting a departmental inquiry, presided over with meticulous care by the permanent head of the Department of Education&mdash;the Secretary of that Department.</P>
    <P>I became Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Education on 2nd July, 1956.  It was not, however, until 15th October, 1956, that the Gaeltacht services section, including Gaeltarra Éireann, of the Department of Lands was by order transferred to the Department of the Gaeltacht.  I became Minister for the Gaeltacht on 24th October, 1956, so that the particular services of this branch into which I now want to have inquiries made was one week in the Department while I was Parliamentary Secretary prior to my becoming a Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, in his capacity as Acting-Minister for the Gaeltacht, in the course of a reply to the debate on the Estimate for the Gaeltacht on 25th June last year, recorded it as an extraordinary fact that <Col N="490" /> I had been in the Department from October to January without making a move in this matter.  That, of course, is where the present Minister's predecessor is wrong.  It will readily be accepted that, in matters of this kind, where there were irregularities, where the people outside were talking about irregularities, where within the branch itself these irregularities were the subject of jealousies and envy, one had to proceed with the greatest possible caution, with, it might be argued, even the greatest possible stealth in order to get the necessary preliminary information upon which one could find the true basis of a departmental inquiry.</P>
    <P>I was engaged, with the help of my then private secretary, a civil servant, in interviewing people from all over the country on these matters and it was as a result of those inquiries, made privately without any reference to any other official except my private secretary, that I was able to get the information from which I formulated questions and had them directed through the permanent head of the Department into the official channels of the Gaeltarra Éireann section of Gaeltacht Services.</P>
    <P>The response to these official inquiries was delayed and the information was meagre.  It was alleged here that during the Christmas of 1956 an incident occurred outside of this city between the particular agent and myself that led to what the Minister's predecessor, the Minister for Education, was pleased to call an inquisition. The incident, was a simple one.  In the midst of some social activity this agent, as he then was, an agent employed in what was than my Department, tried to foist his company upon me and my company because he knew by then that inquiries were on foot, the result of which might be the unfolding of what I now allege and then alleged was the playing of havoc with public money that falls very short, of fraud.  His efforts at making any sort of headway as a result of that overture were repulsed and that is all that was in the incident which the Minister's predecessor, the Minister for Education, sought to clock with such mystery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> As I said, the departmental inquiry moved with its characteristic slowness. A general election took place in the meantime, and I want to put on record that in spite of the fact that there was a general election campaign going on, I twice left my constituency deliberately to go to my office in Dublin for no other purpose than to marshal these negotiations and find out exactly the extent to which they had moved. The result was that I was ready for face-to-face discussions with the officers of my Department on the 15th March, and on the following day with officers of the Department plus the three Irish agents.  When I say the three Irish agents I mean the agents operating in Ireland as distinct from the agents abroad.</P>
    <P>In acceding to the request to set up an inquiry into this matter the Minister, I take it, seeking the advice of the Government or giving the Government advice, would be doing nothing more than putting the public mind at ease with regard to the situation which obtained over a long number of years in this service and, if I might also say so, giving the Ministers themselves the opportunity of showing that they were justified in not standing over the action I took and discrediting me, or, on the other hand, justifying me.  But the overall hand, objective must be the vindication of the people who pay the piper, the taxpayers in this country, with particular reference to the excellent men and women, mainly women, who control the industries of the Gaeltacht and particularly the girls who work there for what could only be described as little more than a pittance.</P>
    <P>I may mention, in passing, that I wanted to know why the commission paid to these agents differed in regard to some of the areas and differed with regard to persons.  I was informed as follows by the Acting-Minister at column 1198, Volume 162, of the Official Debates of the 25th June, 1957:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. J. Lynch: It should be understood that these positions are not permanent.  Neither are they pensionable.  The commission is not in any way out of the ordinary. <Col N="492" /> Deputy Lindsay suggests that 1 per cent. would be sufficient.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lindsay: No; I do not.</P>
    <P>Mr. J. Lynch: Or, rather, that men in comparable positions get 1 per cent. from their companies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was true.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If one applies that to the total remuneration earned by these men, the highest would have been £800 a year, ranging down to less than £400 a year, in the four years quoted by the Deputy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, at that time, on the 25th June of last year, we find the Acting-Minister for the Gaeltacht vigorously defending a commission of 5 per cent., 5½ per cent., 6 per cent. and 6¼ per cent. as being the ordinary commission&mdash;&ldquo;nothing out of the ordinary,&rdquo; he says.  If may information is correct, within the past few months these agents have been either asked or ordered to accept something between 3 per cent.  and 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>If it was to be vigorously defended as the correct percentage in June of this year, why should it be reduced within the past couple of months?  I wonder would I be reckless in venturing a suggestion that this reduction in the percentage commission to agents was part of the campaign to have the affairs of Gaeltarra Éireann put into some semblance of order before this motion came on?  In any event, the House is entitled, first of all, to be told whether it is true that these reductions in commission percentage have been made and secondly, if they have been made, what was the object in view.  Thirdly, if they were ordinarily commissions of sufficient size to be defended in June what was the intervening factor that made it necessary, or justifiable, to have them reduced in the succeeding time that I have mentioned?</P>
    <P>In the Vote for the Gaeltacht on 25th June last the then Minister for the Gaeltacht, acting as he was, was not so concerned, in my view, with giving to the House the facts of the matter as they stood at that time. Rather was he concerned with keeping <Col N="493" /> the House either uninformed or misinformed as to the facts with a view to discrediting my actions and in order to whitewash this agent, restored by him. I hope to prove, in so far as proof can be given on a motion of this kind, that this agent was restored through the influence of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, coupled with the influence of the Minister for Finance, side by side with the withdrawal of influence that might be used on behalf of others by the Minister for Defence.  They are all in it.</P>
    <P>I must say at this stage that in relation to all that part of the story the present Minister must be exonerated as not then having any responsibility in the matter.  But we shall come to a part of the story, as it unfolds itself, where the present Minister found it necessary to defend by evasion, or otherwise, of the facts, this agent who obviously means so much to somebody somewhere</P>
    <P>To give but a brief example of the type of evasion to which I refer it will be necessary for me to refer to the minutes of that inquiry&mdash;minutes which, by the way, have been placed at my disposal even though taken in my time&mdash;by the Minister's for Educacessor, the present Minister for Education. In the course of these minutes, vouched for as accurate by the Secretary of the Department, it will be seen that this agent was behaving in a manner which certainly called for an investigation and from the investigation there could be no doubt in the minds of any business man but that that behaviour amounted to gross misconduct in the carrying out of his affairs.</P>
    <P>On the 15th March, 1955, there was an order from this agent to sell to Messrs.  Todd Burns in this city a total of 2,160 garments for £2,580, less 13 per cent.  On the 28th March, 1955 there was an invoice for 1,196 garments at £1,831 1s., less 13 per cent. and on the 31st March, 1955, there was an invoice for 1,120 garments at £932 1s. 9d., less 13 per cent.  These latter two invoices are signed by the manager of Gaeltarra Éireann and there was no reference to 25 per cent.  It is stated <Col N="494" /> clearly and unequivocally on these two invoices &ldquo;less 13 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was not until the 18th June, 1955, three months later that there is a reference on the departmental file to a request from that particular company &mdash;Messrs. Todd Burns&mdash;where they demand special discount, namely 25 per cent.  On the 19th July, 1955, one month later, after the company demanded a discount of 25 per cent., which is 12 per cent. over that which was specifically set out on the invoice, the manager of Gaeltarra Éireann writes on the file &ldquo;Find out from Mr.&mdash;(the Dublin agent)&mdash;what it is about.&rdquo; There is no further reference as to any inquiries being made from the agent as to what it was about until 27th August, 1955, a month after that, when there is a strong letter from the southern areas agent complaining that garments were to be got in his area at a lower price than their value.  These garments were not substandard in any way.  I put that question deliberately to the southern area agent in the course of my inquiry, presided over by the permanent head of the Department: &ldquo;Were these garments substandard in any way?  Were they unsaleable by way of tinting or shades?&rdquo; The answer was: &ldquo;No, the garments were perfectly standard in every respect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These of course were the garments that Messrs. Todd Burns and some other shops around the city with whom the agent dealt on the 25 per cent. basis, were selling to smaller places down the country at a lower price than that at which the Department's own agent for that area could sell them.  That was on 27th August, but, on 13th September, 1956, there is a memo from the manager of Gaeltarra Éireann that these garments were substandard.</P>
    <P>That memo is from the man who signed the invoices for two lots of them, on 28th March and 31st March, 1955, as so many garments, at such a price, less 13 per cent.  That was the standard discount for standard goods, but here he makes an inquiry from the agent: &ldquo;What is this about?&rdquo; The company did not state what they sought the discount for, but, in September, <Col N="495" /> six months later, when these garments made by girls in remote areas of the country for starvation wages, and passed by the authorities in Gaeltarra Éireann as standard goods, had been shoved all over the country, scattered by the wholesale houses of Dublin, who have pals of this agent in every one of them, when there was no possibility of tracing them or bringing them back in any bulk, they were certified by the manager of Gaeltarra Éireann as substandard.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the Parliamentary replies given to me that the number of substandard goods was negligible; that they were graded as standard, substandard but saleable, and unsaleable &mdash;standard to be sold in the ordinary way, substandard but saleable to be described as such, and unsaleable to be sent back to the centre for redoing &mdash;could anybody imagine that a responsible manager would send out three lots, invoice them as standard and six months later certify them as substandard, without some very good reason?</P>
    <P>In the course of the inquiry, I asked the manager, as a result of the knowledge privately sought and ascertained by me, prior to Christmas, 1956, if he was afraid of this agent or if he was indebted to him in any way.  The answer, of course, was no.  In the course of the next inquiry, two or three days afterwards, I reminded him of the query I put to him and said I was now going to put it to him more mildly by asking was he in any way influenced by this agent.  He replied: &ldquo;I am&rdquo;, explaining that he was a very strong character and a great customer of Gaeltarra Éireann.  Of the strong character part I have no doubt, because I am as certain as I am of standing here, that I was told an untruth when I was told he was not under the influence of the agent. I know he was indebted to the agent in no inconsiderable way.  If you hold the whip hand over somebody, either morally or monetarily, it is easy to get a certificate as to the standard of the goods.</P>
    <P>On another occasion, as has already <Col N="496" /> emerged in the course of the debate on the Vote for this Department, I made it known that this agent, conniving and conspiring with the manager of Gaeltarra Éireann, put into the stocks of Gaeltarra Éireann linen of a type and quality never used by Gaeltarra Éireann before, that never would be used and never could be used by Gaeltarra Éireann, and received in exchange for it in relation to his own business a credit note for tweed.  He has a business of his own &mdash;I will come to that later&mdash;it is a company with a typist holding one share and, therefore, he is not the sole proprietor, according to the Minister's predecessor.</P>
    <P>The strange thing about it is that while I was conducting the departmental inquiry, I was not told about that £109 transaction in relation to tweed.  I was not told that this agent had sufficient influence with the powers that were officially, so that the incident would be closed by his taking back the linen, wiping the matter out, and the manager, who was subject to this strong character who was a good customer, was stopped increments by way of punishment.  That is only a little sample; it is only one of the things that were discovered, and it is a thing I would never have discovered officially, were it not for the fact that I was able to carry on a personal inquiry, prior to setting up the official one.  I may as well add that it came as a great surprise to the persons concerned when I was able to talk to them about it.</P>
    <P>On 15th December, 1954, 45 garments were involved to Messrs. O'Reilly, North Earl Street, Dublin, at a cost of £65 1s. 3d., less 13 per cent.  That may appear a small figure, but it was a figure capable of examination at the time of despatch.  It did not comprise a huge bulk of thousands of garments and it was marked as standard, less 13 per cent.  On 21st January, 1955, about five weeks later, the company demanded 25 per cent. discount.  On 2nd February, 1956, there was a letter from Gaeltarra Éireann to the company saying: &ldquo;We are not aware of any arrangements made to allow you special discount.&rdquo; That letter was written on 2nd February, 1956.</P>
    <P>Curiously enough, in response to <Col N="497" /> this denial of any responsibility for the 25 per cent., the company do not reply until the 8th March.  Again, a delay of five weeks takes place.  On that date the company&mdash;I might say with great and deliberate tact&mdash; phoned; what they could not have contemplated was that the official mind could not resist recording a telephone conversation, and it was recorded. What the company phoned and what the note says is: &ldquo;The company phoned to say that there was a special arrangement about it with Mr. A., the agent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor had that before him.  I asked the question: &ldquo;If he would state the reasons given by Dublin traders, whose names are already known to him, when they applied to his Department for a trade discount of 25 per cent. on knitwear?&rdquo; Listen to the reply of the Minister's predecessor, bearing in mind what I have just read out, which is official and which the Minister has in front of him now, if his file is complete: &ldquo;The traders in question claimed 25 per cent. discount by sending debit notes to Gaeltarra Éireann.  No reason was given for the claim in any of the debit notes.&rdquo; So far, that little bit is true.  But for some reason the tactics of evasion seem to have been abandoned and the Minister went on: &ldquo;And there is no record in my Department that these traders gave any reason whatever for their claim in any other way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the reason&mdash;the memorandum from the company by phone recorded in the office saying there was a special arrangement about it with the agent.  So much for the credibility of the previous Minister and the credibility of those supplying him with answers to Parliamentary Questions. The same story goes on in relation to different other Dublin traders, all claiming the 25 per cent., all claiming it, having taken sufficient time to dispose of the goods and the Department having taken sufficient time to ascertain why the 25 per cent. should be given.  When the whole coast is clear you then have the reason given: &ldquo;the manager certifies them as substandard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> I asked the Minister's predecessor the question: &ldquo;Whether the granting of claims for a percentage discount higher, than that authorised by the management of Gaeltarra Éireann to firms, and business houses in the City of Dublin has resulted in a loss of public moneys and, if so, what steps he proposes to take to make good the said loss?&rdquo; Listen to the Minister's reply: &ldquo;No discount was given to any firm in Dublin City without authority from the management of Gaeltarra Éireann.  The second part of the question does not, therefore, arise.&rdquo; Those are two answers given by the Minister's predecessor, one of them certainly not in accordance with the facts, namely, that there was no record of any reason why these claims were made.  And the second is an evasion of the fact because what he is trying to say is that by showing that these discounts were authorised by the management, it did not really matter&mdash;in fact, he did say it on the 25th June last&mdash;whether they were certified as substandard prior to the sale or in retrospect.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might be allowed to deal with one matter in the speech of the Minister in reply to the vote on the Estimate last June, arising from a question raised by me of the southern areas agent complaining that goods were to be found on sale in the shop in Shannon not sold to the shop by him.  The Minister's reply, given to him from a source at his elbow which should have been the correct source and which should have had the correct information, was as follows&mdash;I am quoting from Volume 162, column 1199:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The second point on which the agent concerned was dismissed was that he sold goods in another agent's district.  First of all, there was an allegation made by the southern agent, at one of the conferences held by Deputy Lindsay a few days before he went out, to the effect that Gaeltarra Éireann goods were found on sale at Shannon airport and that these goods were not sold by the southern agent even though Shannon airport was within his district.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That allegation was true in substance and in fact.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" />&ldquo;That was accepted as an act in breach of his conditions of appointment by the agent in the Dublin area.  But the fact is that those who run Shannon airport&mdash;Aer Rianta or whoever it is&mdash;are responsible for the goods on sale there.  They have their own distributing centre in Dublin and all goods of that description sold in Shannon airport are supplied by that centre.  Gaeltarra Éireann goods sold in Shannon airport are not supplied by the southern agent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Gaeltarra Éireann goods sold in Shannon airport are sold by the southern areas agent and any goods in Shannon airport of Gaeltarra Éireann texture, quality and supply are sold by the southern areas agent, because there is no other source.  Aer Rianta never supplied any goods to Shannon airport, and we had the sorry spectacle of the Minister for Education coming in here the following day to correct what was an obvious falsehood and saying that what he meant was that C.I.E. in Thomas Street <Col N="500" /> supplied the G.S.R. hotel in Galway. Could anything be more positive than that statement about Aer Rianta?  I know now&mdash;I did not know then&mdash;why he had to come in to make his correction. He came in to make it because the phones from Shannon airport nearly burned up the Department telling him, for God's sake, to put the matter right, that they had never bought goods from Aer Rianta, that Aer Rianta never supplied them with goods and such was not the practice.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of fraud with which I was dealing.  That is the kind of fraud which I tried to eradicate, and I believe that in dismissing the agent I did eradicate the greatest portion of the evil.  That is the kind of fraud that the Minister's predecessor and the present Minister are prepared to stand over in the interests of this agent who must owe somebody something very great.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20th February, 1958.</P>
