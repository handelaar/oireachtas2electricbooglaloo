      <P>Before this Bill passes the Report and Final Stages I should like to take this opportunity to say that I have been authorised by the Government to indicate that they are considering generally, and not merely in the cases where common employment would have been a defence, the question of the receipt by persons who sustain personal injury of double compensation &mdash; in the form of damages and of some other benefit &mdash; and what legislation is required to deal with this <Col N="2072" /> matter, provided that no such legislation will deprive the Garda Síochána of any benefits for which they are now eligible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of myself and my colleagues associated with me in this Bill, I wish to express appreciation of the co-operation extended to us by the Minister and his officials. From the outset, the Minister accepted the principle in the Bill and, with the co-operation of his officials and the other members of the Select Committee, we were so able to amend the Bill as to make it more watertight. The object of the Bill was to remove an injustice caused by the successful pleading of common employment to the detriment of workmen.  That had been going on for over a century.  We were met in full on that point and I am quite confident that the Bill will remove an injustice from our law.</P>

      <P>In associating myself with the Deputy Kyne's tribute to the Minister and his officials, I wish also to pay tribute to all Parties in the House who contributed to the speedy passage of the Bill.  No doubt, so long as the Minister indicated that he supported the Bill, it could have gone through; but Deputies, particularly those with a legal background, could possibly have argued small points for a long time.  Therefore, the co-operation of all Deputies should be mentioned. The Bill may be a small matter, but it is no small matter when you consider the position of those who in past years have been deprived of receiving reasonable compensation for very serious injuries.  Even though it may effect relatively few, this Bill is very important and we express our appreciation of the co-operation received.</P>

      <P>Tá dhá aidhm leis an Leasú atá dá bheartú anois ar Scéimeanna Aoisliúntais na Múinteoirí Náisiúnta.  An bun atá leis an chéad cheann ná réiteach a dhéanamh i leith aiscí pósta i gcás banmhúinteoirí a bhí i seirbhís roimh lú Iúil, 1958, agus a phósann ina dhiaidh sin.  Bhíodar san i dteideal aiscí pósta d'fháil, má bhí seirbhís áirithe tugtha acu, fhaid is a lean an riail a chuir cosc ar bhan-mhúinteoirí pósta a bheith ag teagasc i bhfeidhm.  Nuair a cuireadh an riail sin ar ceal ní rabhadar i dteideal aiscí pósta a thuilleadh. Measadh, ámh, nach mbéadh sé cothrom aisce pósta do cheilt ar aoinne acu gur theastaigh uaithi éirí as an tseirbhís ar phósadh di, go háirithe, nuair a tháinig sí isteach sa tseirbhís fén dtuiscint go n-éireodh sí as ar phósadh di agus go bhfaighfeadh sí aisce, má bhí seirbhís sáthach fada chuige sin aici.  Tá foráil dá réir sa scéim leasaithe.  Tá socrú ann freisin chun freastal ar chás ina n-íocfaí aisce pósta fén bhforáil nua agus ina bhfillfeadh an ban-mhúinteoir a bhéadh i gceist ar ais sa tseirbhís mhúinteoireachta.  Sa chás san níor bh'fholáir di fén socrú atá i gceist an aisce maraon le hús iolraithe do réir 5 faoin gcéad d'aisíoc chun go bhféadfaí a seirbhís roimh pósadh di d'áireamh arís mar sheirbhís inphinsin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An tarna aidhm atá leis an Leasú ná freastal a dhéanamh ar mholadh a deineadh ag an gComhairle Idir-Réitigh do na Múinteoirí Náisiúnta fén a bhfanfadh na múinteoirí i seirbhís inphinsin go dtí deireadh na scoil-bhliana ina sroisfidís 65 bliana d'aois.  Tá socrú dá réir ann cheana féin i gcás na méan-mhúinteorí agus i gcás na gCeárd Mhúinteorí.  Fé na scéimeanna a bhí i bhfeidhm go dtí seo bhí ar mhúinteoirí náisiúnta éirí <Col N="2074" /> as seirbhís inphinsin ag deireadh na ráithe ina sroiseadar 65 bliana d'aois.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not <Col N="2076" /> exceeding £50,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of the March, 1959, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The House will recollect that I stated earlier in the year when the plans for the reorganisation of the Dundalk works were under discussion here that, if we found any of the wage grade staffs formerly employed there could not be fitted into the new organisation, it would be my intention to put the company in a position to do something about the situation by way of <i>ex gratia</i> payments to the workers concerned. At that time we had in mind the possibility that some of the former employees of the G.N.R. would not, for one reason or another, be taken on by any of the new commercial companies to be set up.  While we visualised the possibility of some dislocation of employment at Dundalk during the process of rebuilding and re-equipping the shops, the extent of the possible dislocation could not then be fully measured.</P>
    <P>When it became clear that the process of rebuilding and re-equipping would cause a degree of dislocation involving the laying-off of some workers for a time, the board, in consultation with me, decided to assist the workers concerned by the way of interim weekly payments to them under the description of &ldquo;stand off pay&rdquo; to supplement the unemployment insurance benefit to which they would normally be eligible on being laid off.  I undertook to move an Estimate here to recoup the company in respect of that outlay.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that this company will in character and in fact be a private enterprise.  Conceivably it could meet the cost of these payments out of its own resources but in view of the desire to ensure that it will not be saddled with any unproductive outlay and that it will be given every opportunity of developing successfully. <Col N="2077" /> I think that, in all the very special circumstances of this case, we are justified in putting this charge on the national Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In the case of permanent redundancy, the board are not yet in a position to state with any precision the extent that it may have but all the indications are that it will not be very considerable and that the number of workers to whom they will make these special payments will be less than 5 per cent. of the original staff employed at Dundalk.  In their case, it is proposed to pay lump sums amounting to one month's pay for each completed year of service up to a maximum of 24.  The rate of compensation will be calculated on the basis of the worker's basic pay at the termination of his employment and the calculation of the length of employment will not include any periods served as a trade apprentice. In the case of a worker with interrupted employment, a worker who for any reason was laid off during the time of his employment with the G.N.R. Company, his service will be reckoned as the total of two or more spells of employment with the G.N.R. and the Dundalk Engineering Works irrespective of the cause of the interruption of service.  Any temporary absence due to illness of not more than one year's duration will be reckoned as service for the purpose of the calculation.  The payments will be made in accordance with particulars furnished by the company and certified by their auditor in regard to all the workers concerned.</P>
    <P>The position at the beginning of this month was that there were in employment at Dundalk 619 workers and a further 92 workers were in permanent employment elsewhere awaiting recall to Dundalk.  The number of workers who were laid off during this reconstruction period was 256 and, of course, the period during which they will be disemployed will vary for different sections.  The present position there is that the parent company, which will not now be called the Dundalk Engineering Works but the Industrial Engineering Company Limited, is proceeding to <Col N="2078" /> get these subsidiary undertakings organised into production.</P>
    <P>As the House has been informed, there will be five such undertakings. There will be the Dundalk Engineering Works, which will be a commercial engineering concern; the Dalgan Steel Founders, Limited, which will operate the new steel foundry; a company called Frank Bonser and Company, Limited, which has been formed in association with a British company for the production of certain types of agricultural machinery and, in that respect, all the plant from the British works has already been transferred to Dundalk and is now being installed there.  There will be the Heinkel Cabin Scooter Company and a company called Commercial Road Vehicles, which will be undertaking the production of heavy-duty road vehicles chassis.  All these companies have now been registered and the company is striving to get them all into full commercial production as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The payments to workers, who are temporarily laid off, to supplement their unemployment insurance benefit were made for the first time at the beginning of this month but dated back to the 1st October last.  The first payments were in respect of the eight weeks' period from 1st October to 26th November.  I think that the amount provided by the Estimate will be more than adequate to meet the outgoings of the company in respect of these payments but, of course, only the actual amount so paid out by the company will be recouped by the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>There are five separate companies, each an individual commercial enterprise with different activities to direct.  It is hoped, of course, that the activities of these five companies will ultimately absorb all the workers but it may be that some workers will not be required by any of the five companies.  It will be only at some stage when the companies are in production, when their immediate labour requirements have been stabilised, that it will become obvious that some workers have not been absorbed. It is not anticipated that that will be a very large number.  It will be quite small.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy understands that there are no set rules covering this matter.  There is a provision for <i>ex gratia</i> Payments where it is obvious that they are justified.  In the case of temporary unemployment, there is no great problem because the payment is being made only to men actually receiving unemployment insurance benefit and therefore can be assumed to be unemployed.  In the other case, I take it, the circumstances in individual cases will have to be examined.  I should think that these payments will be made in the main to men who, because of their long association with the Dundalk Engineering Works, are not likely to be employed elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>What will be the position with regard to railway work as such in relation to contracts with C.I.E.?  In yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> there was a reference to compensation paid to redundant workers at Inchicore.  What I am anxious to know is whether there will be a continuance <Col N="2082" /> of railway work in Dundalk.  There are a number of men there who depend solely on the continuation of that kind of work.  We know that the various private concerns are anxious to get the railway work out of the way so that they can go ahead with their private plans.  As the Minister knows, the local shop is ideally fitted for the doing of this work and the men are specialists in it.  It would be a pity if every effort were not made to channel as much railway work as possible into Dundalk.</P>
      <P>What will be the position when the re-adaptation of the existing shops is finished?  They are being adapted to fit in with the new plans and most of the men are, naturally, engaged in labouring work.  When the work has been finished and the shops are completed, the chances are that a number of these men will be laid off again. I should welcome an assurance from the Minister that every effort will be made to send as much railway work as possible to Dundalk to fill that gap.</P>
      <P>I should like to mention a fact of which the Minister must be aware, that the employment position in Dundalk is not very good, apart altogether from the railway aspect.  Recently a number of men were dismissed from one of the local breweries.  I mention that to emphasise the importance of doing everything to ensure that the Dundalk Engineering Works will prosper and be a source of much employment to the men in the future.</P>
      <P>There is one point to which my attention has been directed which has relation to the fact that at the moment a certain amount of overtime is being worked in Dundalk.  I do not know whether that can be avoided or not. I assume that certain contracts have been obtained which it is desirable to turn out as quickly as possible, but it appears unfair to give overtime to some of the men while some other men, former employees at the works, are walking about the streets.  I do not condemn the management for doing that, but it does seem strange. I understand that it would not be fair to bring back a handful of men in order to get the work done on time and then dismiss them again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should welcome an assurance from <Col N="2083" /> the Minister, if he can give it, that the amount of employment available will be spread over as many men as possible and that preference will be given, not only to married men with families, but to certain single men who have the responsibility of supporting either their parents or brothers or sisters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one inquiry from the Minister.  The Minister referred to the five new industries which would grow from the present Dundalk Engineering Works, itself being one of the five and the parent company having some new engineering appellation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Industrial Engineering Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it proposed to finance the five companies?  Is it intended that the State should put them in funds or that they should go on the public market or to the Industrial Credit Corporation?  Is there to be any private capital of any kind or is it to be exclusively State capital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise two points, one of which has been already mentioned by Deputy Norton.  The Minister did say that this concern, both in character and in fact, to use his own words, was a private concern. When we were discussing the legislation here some time ago, he said exactly the opposite and made it clear that the capital was going to be provided, in some shape or form, by the Exchequer and, if possible, there would be legislation to deal with it. I think the appointment of the directors was a matter which the Minister had dealt with at that time, certainly in so far as the chairman was concerned, and I do not think it was quite accurate to say that both in character and in fact this was a private concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable that we should have it made quite clear for the record what the intention is.  It does seem to me that the Minister, by the answer he indicated a minute ago, is putting a premium on lack of enterprise.  I can see the point of view that if people are wanted to come back and do not <Col N="2084" /> come back the Minister can say fairly that disentitles them absolutely from that date to compensation.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the scheme, as has been announced by the Minister, declares a premium on a person not making any effort for himself.  While all of us hope that the maximum possible work will be available in Dundalk for the personnel concerned, I do not think the Minister is very hopeful that the work which will be available will embrace all those who will be seeking work.  If that is so, would it not be far better to have some scheme of compensation or, perhaps, gratuity on a different basis so that anyone who was sufficiently enterprising to go and get himself another job in Dundalk or in any other part of the country would, when he did so, have the option of saying: I am no longer to be regarded as a possible compensation charge in Dundalk.  I have found myself another productive niche in the body politic and, accordingly, I am applying for a gratuity on another or limited basis.  It would be well worth while from the point of view of building up morale if something on that line could be done.</P>
    <P>One of the great difficulties we have had&mdash;and this refers to every Government&mdash;is that we have always taken the line that in the long run the person who has not made any effort for himself is the person who should reap more benefit than the man who has.  That is very bad public morale. Some type of a limited gratuity scheme&mdash;more limited, perhaps, than the compensation that might be payable&mdash;would be well worth while from a public morale point of view.  If a person could find alternative employment and be able to say that he had got himself something else and would no longer be regarded as a possible charge on Dundalk some scheme on the line I suggested would improve public morale.  As well as that it would mean that the Dundalk works would be faced with fewer problems in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy may be quite certain that the operation of this compensation <Col N="2085" /> arrangement will be designed to ensure that there will be no discouragement to any worker to get any other employment that may be available to him.  When he is required at Dundalk, he will be called back. If he declines to come, that will be the end of the matter.  If he is not called back, then, irrespective of the circumstances under which he is then in employment, the probability is that he will be regarded as eligible for compensation payment.  This is not a statutory scheme with fixed rules. The circumstances of individual cases will be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will administer the scheme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that no rules are drawn up.  The company said they aimed to resolve the situation in a particular manner.  I told them to go ahead and resolve the situation in that way.  With regard to the prospects at Dundalk, first of all, attention must be directed to the fact that the C.I.E. Board have already entered into an agreement with the Dundalk Engineering Works, to have done for them at Dundalk all the work that would have been done there for the G.N.R. part of the C.I.E. system as if the amalgamation of the two organisations had not taken place.</P>
      <P>All the indications available to me show that the relationship between the C.I.E. management and the Dundalk management is quite harmonious and that there will be a general desire on the part of C.I.E. to help out Dundalk in any difficulties that they may encounter during their initial development period.  Of course, there will be no question of transferring to Dundalk any specific block of works now performed for C.I.E. in the C.I.E. workshop. I do not think that is intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that this commercial engineering concern which will be fulfilling the C.I.E. contract will also be seeking other types of engineering work.  Taking the long-term view as to the amount of railway engineering <Col N="2086" /> work likely to arise in this country in the future, the more successful they are in getting other types of general engineering production under way the greater will be the security of employment in that section of the enterprise and the greater its chance of expanding from the position now contemplated.</P>
    <P>The board of the company have conveyed to me generally an optimistic outlook on the prospects of work in the Dundalk development.  It is to be appreciated that a fundamental change has taken place in the situation there.  There was a railway engineering works therefore the annual output of which was related to railway activity and it could be foreshadowed for a long period ahead.  There are now commercial enterprises the success of which will depend on their ability to sell their products in competitive markets.  While these companies will be starting off with many competitive advantages in the form of new equipment and market contacts, their future success will, of course, depend entirely on the ability with which they are directed and the availability of markets for the things they produce.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Deputy Coburn it would be undesirable that unnecessary overtime should be worked at Dundalk.  It should be appreciated that there will be circumstances in which an amount of overtime by certain workers is necessary and which could not be substituted by the employment of additional workers.  The whole aim is to get this process of re-equipment completed so that commercial work can begin and so that the earning of revenue will start.  The company is now engaged in the operation of getting these five separate enterprises into production.</P>
    <P>As I said some weeks ago in Dundalk, the development of activities there is not limited to these five companies. Certain other possibilities are being explored.  The company, quite rightly, have decided that they should concentrate on the immediate job of getting these five enterprises under way before exploring new possibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>How many of them have gone into production?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2087" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To an extent there is an amount of engineering work being done there.  The Heinkel Works are in production although not in full manufacture.  They are assembling parts which have been purchased for the purpose of training their workers and gradually building up their full manufacturing programme.  I hope to see them all in commercial production quite early next year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the financing of the enterprise, I think Deputy Sweetman must have misunderstood something I said before, because the intention is, as I made quite clear here, that its development will be financed by an issue of shares.  It is true I said I expected that the entire amount of the first issue would have to be taken up by the Industrial Credit Corporation and held by them for a time.  They will not, I think, contemplate putting them on the market or inviting private subscriptions for the shares until they had some commercial success to show, which would help to contribute to the success of such an operation.</P>
      <P>That process of completing the financial arrangement with an issue of shares, and the provision of the permanent capital of the company has been delayed somewhat by the protracted and rather serious illness of the chairman.  I hope he will be back in full activity in the early future, but the process of finalising the negotiations and signing the documents has been held up by reason of his illness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position will be that this Industrial Engineering Company will be the parent company and it will complete the process of rebuilding the shops and re-equipping them and then enter into arrangements with the separate concerns under which they will eventually repay to the parent company the amount so invested by the parent company.  At some stage, 20 or 25 years ahead, no doubt, this parent company may go out of existence and each of the separate concerns will be completely independent and in full ownership of its assets.  For the time being, they will be subsidiaries of the parent company but working towards full independent status.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

You will pay us £5,000 a year, plus interest, and at the end of ten years the factory is yours.&rdquo;  The payments going into the parent company will be adequate to remunerate and repay that capital and that capital, no doubt, will be represented by a loan obligation on the parent company.  Furthermore, the parent company will have an investment in the enterprise and the profits made will determine the value of that investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear again that the Government is not providing the finance in this matter. The money for the Dundalk Engineering Works will be provided mainly through the Industrial Credit Corporation, and possibly by the Industrial Credit Corporation in association with certain other institutions, but the Exchequer will not contribute any money.  We have, of course, already guaranteed a loan raised by the company to get over its early stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, I want to say I think there is no reason why this enterprise at Dundalk should not be successful, in the sense that they will be able to absorb the bulk of the workers formerly employed in the G.N.R. works and gradually to grow up from that level to a still higher level.  It would perhaps be unduly optimistic to think that each one of the five enterprises will be as successful as the others.  Some will be more <Col N="2090" /> successful, but at the moment it is impossible to draw any picture as to how things might develop.  The expectation is that they will be able to start off with a volume of business sufficient to absorb the bulk of the workers formerly employed by the G.N.R. and from there each will be on its own.  I am certain that the future growth of these enterprises is to be anticipated, just as we would expect any other private commercial enterprise which started on the right lines gradually to expand and enlarge its business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before moving the adjournment of the debate last night I had attempted to indicate some of my reasons for favouring single member constituencies as against multi-member constituencies.  I then came to consider what is the best way in a single member constituency to arrange for the election.  It could fairly be said that one could still keep the single transferable vote.  It has been said here that absurdities will arise where there is not a single transferable vote and that the proposed system can be shown by example to lead to absurd results.  Of course, that is true.  I doubt if there is any system of election to Parliament or to any other type of body where it is not possible to pick an example to <Col N="2094" /> show how absurd the method of election is.</P>
      <P>I mentioned last night that Deputy Blowick referred to a particular set-up that might arise in a three-corner contest. He showed to his own satisfaction that this was an absurd situation. I attempted to show that, with the single transferable vote, it could still, with the same figures, be an absurd position.  I mention this because I have no faith in this system of picking out odd examples and saying that this will produce absurdities.  It is like &ldquo;Lies, damned lies and statistics&rdquo;.  Examples with figures thrown in to suit a particular argument do not appear to me to have any real validity.</P>
      <P>While I agree that absurd results can come under the proposed system I am equally satisfied that just as absurd results could arise in single member constituencies with the single transferable vote and I am perfectly satisfied that, under the present system, quite a number of absurd situations have arisen.  These have been referred to before by other Deputies speaking in this debate.  We have had examples of a man at the head of the poll in the first count failing to get a seat while another man who was at the bottom of the poll at the first count manages to get a seat.  I do not think that that type of argument on one side or the other is really helpful.  I do not think it proves anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own belief is that if we come to single member constituencies then the simpler the method of election the better it will be in the long run.  My belief in that respect is, I admit, coloured very much by my belief that what is wrong at the moment is that we have the appearance of P.R. without in fact having it.  I will go further, as I think I did refer to it already, and say that I do not believe it is possible to get P.R.  Nobody yet has been able to show me what size of a minority it is desirable that we should arrange to have represented in the National Parliament and yet that consideration is bound to come into any plan that may be devised to arrange for the size of the constituency and the number of people who will be elected to represent <Col N="2095" /> it.  Therefore, as far as the theory of P.R. is concerned, I doubt if we are losing very much in abandoning what we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning of my remarks, what I find very attractive in this measure is that, because the provision is in the Constitution, the people are to be asked their opinion.  I mentioned that I think this is a provision that might have been used on other occasions but it is important to remember, in discussing the Bill before us, that our function really boils down to this: that we attempt here to give an indication to the people of our views on P.R.  We are advising the people from this House as to what we think best.  What advice has in fact been given?</P>
    <P>What I find really rather extraordinary is that all the people who favour P.R. in this House are on one side of it and that all the people who are against it are on the other side of the House.  I am not trying to pretend I am politically innocent by saying that. I know that Party people find it very difficult to see things the way I do, being outside a Party.  To them, the most natural thing in the world is that they should have their Party point of view and when the chiefs of the Party settle a policy it is the most natural thing in the world that they should all follow suit.  But I think the people outside will think it rather odd that by some queer chance&mdash;in particular, since this was not an issue at the election&mdash;under our present system we manage to get all the pro-P.R. people on one side of the House and all the anti-P.R. people on the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>I can see that it may very well be a case of everybody looking at it to see what will suit himself.  That is a very natural attitude.  It does seem odd, however, that people should say to the Taoiseach: &ldquo;This is a plan you have brought in to secure the perpetuation of your Party&rdquo; and blame him for having an idea that inside his mind he knows the mind of the Irish people.  Surely, in the criticism, the critics are themselves believing that they, in their minds, know the mind <Col N="2096" /> of the Irish people.  I do not see any validity, therefore, in that argument of theirs.</P>
    <P>One of the assumptions that has gone on here as to what may happen is that the contest will be at least three cornered.  There seems to be some confusion of thought about that too.  Deputy McGilligan spoke very strongly about how, in 1954 and 1948 but more particularly in 1954, the various Parties who came together to form the inter-Party Government were able to find this unanimity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In the one case before and in the other case not.  But the point was that these various Parties could find this strong unanimity which enabled them to form a Government.  Surely that same unanimity should enable these Parties in an election for a single member seat to take advantage of what they believe to be the position in any constituency and to use that unanimity to see that Fianna Fáil does not get that seat.  I do not see why, as Deputy Rooney says, we should have to wait until after an election to find this unanimity. It should be possible to find it beforehand. I do not want to take Party sides, but it does seem to be odd that the people who want to secure small Parties also say that these small Parties can find enough unanimity to form a Government.  If they can find all that unanimity, I cannot see why they cannot form a Party.  However, considerations like that can be overdone. Far too much of this debate has gone on Party lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was this point also made with regard to the setting up of the commission which it is proposed should settle the constituency boundaries: that apparently, in the minds of some people at any rate, it will be impossible to find an impartial commissions.  A good deal that should not have been said was said.  One of the odd things in this country is that a great many people are often sneered at because they hold aloof from politics.  This is not the best way to invite them in.  As soon as you come in you are sneered at and it is wrong to have political views. <Col N="2097" /> Apparently it is impossible, once you get into politics, ever to be impartial again.  You are a Party man and a Party man you will be no matter what you do later.  Apparently it is not impossible to find an impartial commission of experts, as in the words of the Fine Gael amendment.  How is that impartial commission of experts to be found?  Where are they to come from who have not Party affiliations? I do not want to be contentious about this.  I am just looking at it from outside of Parties as a rather absurd situation.</P>
    <P>It has been said here that this is a very dangerous thing to do now and that we are making a break with tradition. I think that is true, but it is one of the reasons I am in favour of this. I indicated earlier on that one of the faults I had to find with multi-seat constituencies was that there was too much emphasis on Deputies being the representatives of individual people rather than coming in here to be legislators. I do not deny it is an important function but over the years we have built up too much of a balance in that direction.  Deputies are inclined to lean too heavily there.  They concentrate too much of their time looking after individual interests and, as I said before, I believe there is a good deal of codology about it.  I do not believe there is half of these hard cases to be dealt with.  I think Deputies invite them with this sort of competition that goes on between the various representatives in constituencies.</P>
    <P>There is another tradition which is very obvious in this House.  That is that the major Parties apparently cannot get away from the 1920's. People in both the major Parties continue to regret this in one breath and proceed to slight the fellow on the side in the next breath.  This continual dragging in of the civil war and what followed has poisoned Irish political life.  I can understand people who were personally involved but I cannot understand that it should be carried on when those left who were personally involved are rather elderly gentlemen who should have by now cooled off and learned sense.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made&mdash;and I <Col N="2098" /> think some of the references were very undesirable&mdash;to the effect that this change may make in the minds of certain people in this country.  Everyone who referred to it has carefully indicated that they disapprove of these young men, but I am far from happy reading some of the statements that have been made. Some of them go very near incitement. That is a most regrettable thing.  I do not believe it will have this effect at all.  I do not agree with the policy of Sinn Féin.  I think one of the most disastrous decisions they took was that if elected to this House they would not take their seats.  I do not like some of the other things they propose.  But to assume that they are so wild&mdash;Deputy O'Higgins referred to &ldquo;the lunatic fringe&rdquo;&mdash;that they will be driven underground and that this measure will force them to use the gun, seems to me to be a very wrong suggestion to make.</P>
    <P>There is a sort of implicit belief in these remarks that Sinn Féin is in fact a small minority which will find itself in a hopeless position.  Does anyone really know that?  Does anyone really know what the strength of Sinn Féin is?  It might very well happen that Sinn Féin could secure as many or more seats under the single member constituency system as they have won heretofore.  There is a good deal of muddled thinking about what will happen in these elections. I do not believe it is inevitable that one Party should benefit or that a minority like Sinn Féin should be deprived of any possible representation. I certainly do not think they should be dragged into this debate with a sort of broad hint to them that they are about to be wiped out by this system and that naturally, if that is what they fear, we expect them to resort to the gun.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to the apathy which the electorate has tended to show.  I agree with him.  In fact, I will go further.  I think the percentage poll which we have had here in several elections disguises the real apathy.  I have endless experience, in the last few elections at any rate, of people who in between elections spent most of their time saying: &ldquo;A plague on both sides <Col N="2099" /> of the House.  I am fed up of politics. I will never vote again.&rdquo;  Many of these people are influenced at the last minute, by the beating of the Party drums or by representations made to them by friends.  Suggestions are made to them: &ldquo;Having quarrelled with your neighbour for years about Party politics, are you now going to sit at home and admit he was right?&rdquo; All these arguments are used and people get whipped up in the surge of election excitement and the next day very often regret that they bothered their heads.</P>
    <P>My own belief is that the apathy and cynicism here are more widespread than even the election results tend to show.  I believe that the reason for movements like Sinn Féin is the same reason as exists for the apathy and cynicism, that is, the complete unreality of politics here.  Deputy O'Higgins underlined that, to my mind, when he talked about change with continuity and continuity with change.  He went so far as to say that when you get a change of government here, you do not get a change of policy.  There is no revolution; there are no landslides; there are no sudden reversals.  It is that that is making the people apathetic.</P>
    <P>Most people cannot find the slightest difference between the two sides of this House except the one&mdash;the civil war &mdash;which still dominates the entire political scene.  It is the continuation of that bitterness that I believe is the real reason for Sinn Féin, and movements like that, and the real reason for the apathy and cynicism.  If this revolution, as some Deputies have described this amendment of the Constitution to be, jolts the people and jolts both the big political Parties out of existence&mdash;not that I wish them ill &mdash;it might be a good thing.  If it could have the effect of getting rid of this now ancient quarrel, for that reason alone it would be a good job to do it.</P>
    <P>I have only one thing to say, in conclusion, on the same topic.  I believe most sincerely that, if the Parties cannot rid themselves of this attitude of mind that the most important thing in Irish political life is the continuation of the quarrels of 1922, and onwards, <Col N="2100" /> then I do not think it will matter a great deal in the long run what system of election we have to the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>When this debate started, Fianna Fáil back benchers were more or less told that they would not be allowed to speak on this measure. Since the debate started, 19 members of the Fianna Fáil Party and 31 Opposition members have contributed to it.  With such a large number of speakers, a good deal of the ground has been covered.  The issue before the House is a very important one and, should the debate continue for some more weeks, I am sure speakers would still find many points to discuss. Those who contributed to the debate within the last few days have been more realistic in their approach than those who spoke earlier, particularly on the Opposition side.</P>
      <P>The most important contribution so far&mdash;a contribution in simple language which everyone could understand&mdash; was that made by Deputy Sheldon last night and this morning.  Some of the points made by Deputy Sheldon were points I intended to make myself.  A speaker on the Opposition side said yesterday that this measure came as a bombshell.  It is difficult to understand a statement like that, remembering what has happened in the past. On many occasions, we have been treated to public controversy in the newspapers as to the relative merits or demerits of the P.R. system of election. Reference was made to some of those controversies.  On several occasions, the Taoiseach has referred to the inherent weaknesses in the P.R. system.  Not alone that, but away back in 1933 and 1934, the newly formed Fine Gael Party at the time, in its provisional programme, went so far as to indicate that they had it in mind to change the system of election from P.R. to the straight vote system.  They discussed the matter and we were told by Fine Gael speakers in this debate that it came before the Fine Gael Árd-Fheis at the time and was scrapped.  Be that as it may, it is on record that 25 years ago the newly constituted Fine Gael Party were thinking very seriously of changing the electoral system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2101" /> In later years, we can all remember that on many occasions prior to 1948, the Taoiseach had reason to appeal for an overall majority in various elections.  He invariably pointed out the difficulty of getting such a majority with the P.R. system.  It has been suggested here that the Taoiseach decided to change the system because of the advent of the two Coalition Governments. It has been suggested that the Taoiseach resented that action on the part of the Irish People and is setting himself out to ensure that such a situation will not occur again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if that argument were sustainable, it would be a good argument, in my opinion.  I see nothing wrong in it.  But the Irish people are entitled to get an opportunity of having whatever system of election they prefer.  This Bill is an attempt to give them that opportunity. The people have that fundamental right under our Constitution and all we are doing is asking them to review the existing system and to indicate whether or not they want to change it.</P>
      <P>The only case that possibly could be made against taking this step at the present time is on the basis of cost.  We are told that the referendum will cost a considerable amount of money which could be more usefully expended in providing employment and relieving the hardship that besets people. We all subscribe to that view, but in a matter of such importance as this, the expenditure is inevitable and justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very good system we have which enables matters of this kind to be referred to the people so that they may consider the pros and cons and give a clear decision.  The speeches in this Assembly on this measure should be of such a nature as to help the people in coming to a decision on the question put before them.  I have listened very carefully to quite a number of speakers from the other side of the House.  They have endeavoured to make the case that the people are not competent to decide on a measure of this kind without prolonged instruction and enlightenment <Col N="2102" /> as to the difference between the existing system of P.R. and the straight vote system which the Government propose to enshrine in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I have a fairly good idea of people's knowledge in matters of this kind.  I have gone out of my way in recent weeks to discover exactly what the majority of people know on the subject. I can tell the House that the people are better judges of this measure than Deputies are inclined to give them credit for.  The people nowadays are reasonably well educated. Quite a number of people have, perhaps, a higher degree of education in many respects than the majority of Deputies have.  They have the advantages of newspapers, radio and several other media to enlighten them on any subject in which they are interested.</P>

This is the first time the people have got an opportunity of deciding a question by referendum, although the Constitution which provides for referenda has been in force for 21 years.

      <P>It has been suggested that this whole thing has been sprung on the people and has come as a bombshell. I have tried to indicate in a general way that this change has been expected for a long time.  We can all remember that immediately prior to general elections for the past ten or 15 years, certain newspapers referred to the Taoiseach's dislike of the P.R. system and in editorials or articles by political correspondents indicated that each such occasion was an appropriate time for the people to discover if the Taoiseach and his Party were returned to power they would make any change in the system.  Just before the 1957 general election, one of the morning newspapers carried an editorial and sub-editorial of that nature.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition said in the course of his speech opposing this, Bill that the first that the public knew of this matter was when a morning newspaper carried a report from a political correspondent indicating that it was proposed to change the electoral system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain degree of criticism has <Col N="2105" /> been made by Opposition speakers regarding discussion on this measure at the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis.  Is it not the appropriate place for the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, when proposing a change of this kind, to make it known to the annual convention of his Party?  I was hoping that the speakers on the Opposition side would indicate what more appropriate notice could be given to the people than was given in this instance.</P>

      <P>I wonder is there any precedent for that?  As far as I know, there is not.  This matter is being referred back to the people in the form of what might be called another general election.  If we go back over the years, we will find that the Coalition Government, when in power, gave a very unsatisfactory example in the matter of introducing a certain measure of vital importance to this country, one which was very controversial at the time.  They did not put it on their programme for the general election, but the announcement was made in an after-dinner speech in Canada.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is three months now since the people heard of this proposed change. It has been dealt with in statements by the leaders of the Government and the Opposition at Party conferences and important meetings throughout the country.  It has been debated in the Dáil for quite some time and I think that by the time the people are called on to decide upon the matter, as much information as could be given to them will have been given to them.  However, there are various debating societies throughout the country who have an interest in this matter and they <Col N="2106" /> might think it worth their while to arrange a series of debates so as to further educate the people.</P>
    <P>I think that too many people are inclined to lay undue stress on the fact that the people are not sufficiently well educated in this matter to decide upon it.  The people are well acquainted with this matter and I have no doubt that their decision, when they make it, will be a proper one.  I have very little doubt also that when this matter is put before the people, a very substantial majority will vote in favour of the change.</P>
    <P>There are two amendments put forward to this measure.  One is by the main Opposition Party indicating that it wants the Dáil to refuse a Second Reading to the Bill.  The other amendment is in the names of Deputies Blowick, Beirne and Donnellan.  I will give credit to the movers of the second amendment for having at least made some reasonable attempt to do their best in this matter.  They have put forward an amendment which indicates that they prefer the single seat system but with the transferable vote.</P>
    <P>The measure we have here differs from the motion I have referred to, to the extent that we prefer a single seat constituency with a non-transferable vote.  One or two speakers here have already made a very convincing case for the single seat constituency.  In that connection there is very little that I could add to what Deputy Sheldon has already said.  He did, however, in my opinion, leave out one or two rather important points with which he might have dealt.</P>
    <P>I will try to avoid repeating anything the Deputy has said and I will try to keep to those two points.  The first point I should like to deal with is the duplication of effort under the present system.  Every Deputy is aware that in very minor matters the entire number of Deputies representing a constituency are required to co-operate on matters on which one Deputy could act as successfully as the whole team. The difficulty which a Deputy finds himself in at present is that he is not a free agent to make up his own mind in a matter of that kind.</P>
    <P>Under the present arrangement, Deputies are not allowed to do the <Col N="2107" /> work that they are sent here to the Dáil to do.  The pressure of ordinary routine business prevents them from giving the time and attention to legilation that is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If they did that and did not do their other work, they would not get in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that Deputies got into this House when they did not have that routine work to do. They got in much more successfully than they have done since they began to do that type of work.  It would be interesting to go back and find out when Deputies began to bring all that trouble on themselves.  I think it happened about ten years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Deputies now find themselves in the position that they cannot do the work they were sent here to do.  Somebody may try to misrepresent what I say here in this connection by suggesting that I have indicated that in ordinary matters the Deputy is not obliged to co-operate with his constituents.  I have not said anything of the kind.  Ninety per cent. of the matters with which Deputies are called on to deal would come right if the people allowed them to develop in the ordinary way.  I am quite sure that every Deputy here will agree with that statement.  I am new in this House but I have no doubt that what I say is correct.</P>
      <P>The rôle which a Deputy plays in general matters with regard to individual problems is more or less determined by what he thinks the Deputy in the opposite camp, or his colleague in his own Party, will do.  The single seat constituency will avoid that situation. You will have a Deputy for the particular area within reasonable reach of his place of residence and he will be very conversant with the problems of his area.  He will have an opportunity of serving the people of that area as their representative and not as a representative of the Party that put him there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain speakers made the point <Col N="2108" /> here that an appalling situation will arise in most constituencies under this proposed arrangements where a sizeable proportion of a particular school of political thought will be deprived of representation, where Fianna Fáil will obtain the particular seat and where Fine Gael will have no representative for the area.  A number of Deputies went so far as to say that they would be disfranchised.  What they wanted to convey was that they would not be represented.  We have to agree that in a situation of that kind a section of people would not be represented but the same applies at the present moment.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of North Kerry the Fine Gael Party have no seat just at present.  I have the experience, day in and day out, of various people with Fine Gael allegiance coming to me in connection with individual or general matters.  As far as I am concerned, there is no question whether they are Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil or whether or not they voted for me.  Those of them who took a prominent part in the election in opposition to me and who were not of my way of thinking come to me without apology.  They have a right to do so and ask my support in connection with matters of general and individual interest.  I support their views in matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why any Deputy should come along and make a point against the single seat constituency by saying that under that arrangement only one section of the people would have representation.  The same applies in the multiple-seat constituency.  If you were to carry that out to its logical conclusion it would mean that we would have to let every voter into this House as an individual if we were to give all people actual representation. If the merits or demerits, as the case may be, of the single seat constituency versus the multiple-seat constituency could be discussed it would simplify matters to some extent.</P>
    <P>The other important matter is the system of election.  I think all of us, whether we are in Opposition or in the Government, should be very happy that this is a matter which we can pass on to the people to decide.  Having listened to the arguments for and against, it is <Col N="2109" /> my opinion that this is one of the most important matters that has been put before the people for a great number of years.  I feel that Deputies of all Parties should be agreeable to put the question before the people in an objective way and people can then decide upon the system they want.  If we can succeed in enlightening the people to an extent which is fair and proper and then put it before them to make their decision, we have done our work as representatives of the people.</P>
    <P>We are told that the present time is inopportune to ask the people to decide a measure of this kind.  I have to disagree entirely with that suggestion. How anybody would have the nerve to put it forward is beyond me. Do we not all know that, according to the Constitution, we have to have a redistribution of seats before November, 1959?  Are we not all very well aware that in the case of the redistribution of seats the size of the constituency, whether it is three, four or five seats, will have to be faced in the ordinary course of events.  If there is any proposal in regard to that change, why should it not come in good time?</P>
    <P>We are told that we should await a more favourable economic trend. If we were to wait for more favourable economic conditions I am afraid we would never agree that the economic position was such that we would be entitled to go ahead.</P>
    <P>Last but not least&mdash;indeed, it should be the first point but I left it last deliberately&mdash;is the question of the Government having an overall majority and being in a position to pass legislation.  We have been waiting for that position for a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>

      <P>It might be that it will be a long time before any succeeding Government will be able to get such a majority with P.R., if it be retained, as we have at the moment. It is quite obvious that it is only when a Party with an overall majority has decided to be unanimous on this issue and bring it before the Dáil that it is possible to offer it to the public. <Col N="2110" /> In the early stages of the debate the various predictions which usually come from the other side of the House were forthcoming.  We were told on one occasion that the matter was pushed through the Fianna Fáil Party without giving the ordinary Deputy a chance of speaking on it. Another speaker made the point that if there were a free vote on the measure, the people would readily ascertain which members of the Fianna Fáil Party were or were not in favour of the measure.  I sincerely hope there will be a free vote because, as far as I am concerned and as far as the members of the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am grateful that the Deputies interrupted me.  I know the situation that obtains in the Fianna Fáil Party.  I think it would be quite inappropriate for me in this debate to discuss the general routine in the Party.  The issue in question came up in the ordinary way in the same manner as it would come up in the Fine Gael Party. I do not profess to know what happened at all the Party meetings when this matter was being considered, but Fine Gael members have told us what happened at all our meetings. I can say that this particular matter was fully dealt with and carefully looked into.  It was decided by a unanimous vote of Fianna Fáil that we would introduce legislation to bring about this change.  We make no apology for proposing it because we are doing something which we thing is right and proper.  We are <Col N="2111" /> permitting the people to judge the issue and that is what the Opposition forget all the time.</P>
      <P>The suggestion about the time being inopportune for the introduction of this measure has, in my opinion, fallen flat.  If subsequent speakers can elaborate on that point all the better. I am still open to being convinced on that point.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the single seat constituency in a general way.  I have indicated that the only difference between our proposal and that of the three Deputies who tabled the amendment is that they want it by the single transferable vote and we want it by the straight vote system.  Those Deputies who are a party to the motion made the point that a Deputy could be elected in the single seat constituency by the straight vote system with a very small minority of votes based on the total valid vote.  That is so, but that can happen under the P.R. system as well.  After all, the people have the choice under the old system of marking their papers 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on.  Under the other system they may be confined to marking their choice in the first instance.  That is a more practical way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>They have a choice. The first choice is the only choice.  I have some experience of canvassing.  I remember visiting a voter and being told beforehand that he would tell me he had voted for me.  I had heard that he had given me sixth or seventh preference.  The voter assured me he was going to vote for me.  I said I would be very grateful and I hoped I was very high in his list of preferences.  What is the use of giving No. 1 to A and, just because you want to oblige B of the opposite Party, transfer it to B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the Opposition Deputies spoke about the system in operation in <Col N="2112" /> some European country&mdash;a system of P.R. under which you were obliged to vote for a panel of candidates.  I think that was the best system of the P.R. range.  It prevented you from transferring your vote to another Party. Why should there be a second, third or fourth choice?</P>

      <P>I hope they will endeavour to do better during the later part of the debate because if they do not, the debate will end to the detriment of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>We had speeches from two Independent Deputies on this matter which were of some importance.  It is quite obvious that individual Deputies who have done all right are more or less content as far as they are personally concerned to leave the arrangement as it is.  There is more than that attached to the question.  There is the question of the stability of the Government in the future.</P>
      <P>We all know that in recent years under any system, let it be what it is, it is pretty difficult to get stability in Government in any country.  For that reason, I think it is a wise decision that Fianna Fáil have prepared for that situation and have offered the people an opportunity of making a decision on this very vital matter.  I sincerely hope that the people, when that opportunity comes, will give us the benefit of the majority view so that we can pass this Bill into permanent legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has gone on for a considerable time.  In my opinion it is about the best debate <Col N="2113" /> I heard since I came into this House seven or eight years ago.  It is only natural that we should have a wide divergence of views.  If you have a Party supported by one Independent determined to change the Constitution, it is natural that the reaction will be pretty severe in any national assembly. I think it is only right that everyone in this House should speak in this debate no matter how long it continues because, as has been said by previous speakers, it is our duty to instruct the public on this matter.</P>
      <P>One of the main arguments used is that the object of the measure before the House is to produce political stability.  I wonder if that is the case. The present Government were elected with an enormous majority.  There is no need to go into the reason why they were elected&mdash;it was because of the promises they made&mdash;but the fact is that they have a majority.  They are in a position to stay here as the Government until 1962.</P>
      <P>I should like to put it to the House that far from producing stability this measure will have the contrary effect. It is the Fianna Fáil Party who are forcing this referendum on the Irish people.  No matter how they may try to varnish or whitewash the position, the referendum is being forced on the Irish people by the Fianna Fáil Party. Perhaps, I am unfair to the Fianna Fáil Party.  I should say that the referendum is being forced on the people by the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil and by a small section of the Front Bench in Fianna Fáil all of whom are in Dublin and have the Dublin outlook.  It does not matter to them what the rest of country may think.  They are forcing this referendum on the Irish people.  If they lose the referendum, will that create political stability?  Is it not an answer from the people that they do not want them any longer?  How long will it be before the Taoiseach goes galloping to the Park looking for a dissolution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish people will ask: &ldquo;Why did we give Fianna Fáil a majority they did not want?  Why did we elect a stable Government if, as soon as they have been scarcely one and a half years in Government, they are <Col N="2114" /> going to try a referendum on the Irish people that nobody wants and will then go for a dissolution?&rdquo; Can the Fianna Fáil Deputies stand up and solemnly assure us that there will not be an election if they lose the referendum? It will be well to have it on the records of the House, but it is not worth the paper it is written on because one man, and one man alone, will take that decision and right well every Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party sitting behind that Leader knows it. I think that is a fair statement of the case because it has happened before.</P>
    <P>It happened before when the Taoiseach, the Leader of the Government, went unexpectedly to the Park although he had a majority, and dissolved Dáil Éireann.  Therefore, I maintain that under P.R. at the present moment complete and absolute stability exists which is being undermined by the action of the Government.</P>
    <P>If they win the referendum, will we have political stability?  I wonder.  It is no harm to refer to the Bill for a moment here.  If they win the referendum, what will happen?  It is rather difficult to read this Bill because the printing of the translation, about which there was so much talk, seems to have been messed up in some way.  However, on the last page of the Bill as introduced, in the English translation, it is provided in Article 7 of the Schedule:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Until the date of the dissolution of Dáil Éireann occurring next after the 15th day of April, 1961&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and in any case any Deputy thinks he is sitting pretty here until 1961 I shall read the next few lines: we are assuming now that Fianna Fáil have won the referendum:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;or occurring next after such earlier date as may be determined by a resolution passed by Dáil Éireann...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the referendum is successful, if Fianna Fáil achieve their object, having built the constituencies to suit their own interests&mdash;it will probably be very easy to make 77 safe seats for 77 Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash;the Dáil will then be dissolved.  The excuse <Col N="2115" /> will be easy.  They will be told that as the country has passed the referendum and as we have new constituencies, it is not fit and proper that the Deputies should sit for constituencies which, under the constitutional change, they no longer represent and that the Taoiseach should go to the Park and dissolve Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>There is the stability for you!  I should be anxious to hear what Deputies on the other side have to say. I see that the Minister for Health has just come into the House&mdash;practically for the first time in this debate.  No doubt he will contribute his voice to the matter.  I challenge the assertion that stability in Government will be achieved.  I say there is political stability at the moment, if there is any meaning in political stability.  The Fianna Fáil Party or, if not the Fianna Fáil Party, the leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party, are responsible for producing a condition of instability in the Government.  I ask the House to judge whether or not that is a service to the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>The Irish nation have dealt very fairly with the Fianna Fáil Party under the present electoral system.  They have given them an over-all majority on several occasions and have been very tolerant of the number of dissolutions we have had.  Any instability we have had throughout the years has been due to unnecessary dissolution and it would be easy for me to show that that is so.  I will draw the parallel of electoral systems in other countries and the alignment between Parties in other countries, to which I intend to refer later on.</P>
    <P>It is no harm for me to refer to what other Deputies have repeated, and for which they had such a poor case, namely, a statement by the members of the Government that P.R. was forced on us by the British Government. That simple statement has been made by Fianna Fáil speakers, but nobody has tried to substantiate it.  In fact, it is just one of the wild sweeping statements we have heard, such as the statement that France has been so unstable under P.R.  Even several responsible Ministers did not bother to <Col N="2116" /> look up the fact that France has not P.R.  The other statement is that P.R. was forced on us by the British Government.</P>
    <P>In 1912 John E. Redmond was leader of the Irish people&mdash;I do not think anybody can challenge that&mdash; and the Irish Parliamentary Party played a considerable part in the political life of this country.  It is always well for Deputies to remember that Irish nationalism, Irish tradition, Irish politics, did not commence in 1916. There was an Irish national movement before that.  In fact, for hundreds of years, there was an Irish national movement.  We should get away from thinking only of our own times, if we want to take an unbiassed view of Irish political life.  In the Home Rule scheme of 1912, P.R. was enshrined by John E. Redmond, the then Irish leader, as a protection for minorities. In many European countries P.R. is enshrined for that purpose as well. He was one Irish leader.</P>
    <P>In 1920 Arthur Griffith, the then spokesman of the Irish race, enshrined P.R. in his Constitution and the present Taoiseach enshrined it in the Constitution of 1937.  I apologise to the House for repeating all this because it has been stated by other speakers but, when a statement so false as the statement that P.R. was forced on us by the British Government is made, it is well to deny these things.</P>
    <P>We in this House are supposed to represent truth so that the country may judge the issues.  That is why I deny that statement again.  I state the truth and throw back that statement at the Party over there.  They would show far more dignity and grace in this debate if somebody on their benches got up to speak the truth. When you fall away from the truth in politics, as in everything else, you find yourself walking into difficulties. Let that be accepted now as a fact. It is no harm to tell the truth.</P>
    <P>The electoral results in Ireland, generally speaking, do not show sweeping changes because the people are conservative-minded in voting.  They adhere to the same Party and persons. However, there have been examples <Col N="2117" /> in the course of Irish history when leaders of Parties were swept away overnight.  Daniel O'Connell, the hero of the Irish people, had to be protected at one time in the streets of Dublin.  The same applied to Henry Grattan and to the Redmondite Party in their closing days.  They found it hard to speak.  The same applied to this Party I represent.  We had to be protected at one time.  I think it is also known that some of our colleagues opposite have found difficulty in speaking during recent years.</P>

      <P>In 1918, we had an election here under the direct voting system.  We were then under British rule.  We had the voting under the system the Fianna Fáil Party propose for this country now.  The Irish Parliamentary Party were swept out of existence overnight by the direct vote.  They had a considerable amount of political experience to offer this country.  They had fought for the people's rights in an alien atmosphere over a great many years.  They may have been considered by some at that period to be too slow.  It may have been thought that John Redmond's action in connection with the first World War was against the national interests.  The fact remains that they were defeated by this proposed system and this country was denied all the political experience they could offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result was that practically one Party was returned at the election from all around the southern counties, there being only one survivor and that was in Waterford.  There were some close misses in Louth, in Wexford, where there were two seats, and in several <Col N="2118" /> other counties as well.  In any case, you had only one political Party and there was a split in that Party.  Whatever the rights or wrongs of that split, the fact remains that there was a split. I think it is fair to say that if you had P.R. about 25 or 30 of the Irish Parliamentary Party would have survived, and you would have had a political opposition.</P>
    <P>Under the new system, when there is an election and an overwhelming majority of Fianna Fáil Deputies are returned, how long will they last before they have a split?  They might even have a split before they get the overwhelming majority which they expect to get under this system.  They can deny that, if they like, but they are the Government who will fix the constituencies, as they are fixing other matters in this Bill which are supposed to be a democratic safeguard for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>One can regard the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste as the architects of this Bill.  With all respect to be other members of the Fianna Fáil Party, I believe they are only a pale shadow of these two.  The Taoiseach in opening this discussion made a very short statement considering he was introducing a measure so important as this. It has been stated that the object of this discussion was to instruct the people on this question.  One would have thought the Taoiseach would have revealed his intentions and ideas more clearly than he did.  He did, however, refer to stability, with which I have dealt, but I think I will be able to show that this Bill will produce anything but stability.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote what the Taoiseach said at Column 992, Volume 171 of the Official Debates of 26th November, 1958:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The argument that this is being done at a strange time is, as I have said, completely wrong.  It is provided in the Constitution that, when any alteration or amendment of the Constitution is thought advisable, a Bill providing for the proposed amendment must first be passed&mdash;or be deemed to have been passed&mdash;by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I emphasise the words &ldquo;is thought <Col N="2119" /> advisable&rdquo;.  Who thought this Bill advisable?  Some months ago, when we began to hear rumblings in the Press and statements by the Taoiseach that the political situation was to be altered, I asked a Fianna Fáil Deputy if we were to have a change in the Constitution, if it was the general policy of Fianna Fáil to have this referendum or to have what we are debating now, and I was told: &ldquo;No.&rdquo; It was only a suggestion and there was nothing to it at all.  However, it was deemed advisable by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The next step on the road was when we heard that the matter was being discussed by the Government. Then we heard that the Taoiseach had succeeded in convincing the Government that it was necessary.  Following that, there was a Fianna Fáil Party meeting and we heard that the Fianna Fáil Party had accepted the proposal, hook, line and sinker.  Therefore, we are discussing this question when, as other Deputies have truly stated, we might have been discussing other things more germane to the country's problems and more vital to the people.  We are having this debate because it was deemed advisable by the Taoiseach and I think I might include with the Taoiseach the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his short statement forced home his argument in regard to stability and gave us the history of elections under P.R. in this country.  He told us that when elections took place, they always took place in twos.  If there was any instability in Ireland, who was responsible for it but the Taoiseach?  On three occasions, he tells us, he was forced to go to the country the following year after an election because he did not get an over-all majority.  That is why it was deemed advisable to put the country to all this expense, to have this long debate, to have a referendum and to disorganise the whole political life of this country.</P>
    <P>Are we the only country in the world with P.R.?  Are we the only country in the world where the biggest Party in Parliament do not get an over-all majority?  I could cite <Col N="2120" /> many instances, as I will before I sit down, where they do not get an over-all majority, but where the leader of the Party concerned who subsequently became the head of the Government was able to co-operate with other Parties as a statesman and as a politician.  For the benefit of the Fianna Fáil Party, we may say that a statesman is a person who does what he deems to be good for the State, even though he deems it inadvisable otherwise; a politician is a man who governs in the interests of his Party.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any personal attack on the Taoiseach.  He believes he should be the Leader of an over-all majority in an Irish Parliament, and he is entitled to believe that.  I suppose he is entitled under the Constitution to dissolve the Dáil, if he wants to look for that majority, if he has not got it, but I fail to see why he and his Party should force a referendum on the Irish people on the plea of instability, when the only real instability there has ever been was produced by him in dissolving the Dáil on three or four occasions when it was unnecessary to do so, when he could wait, having got a Government, and a stable Government.</P>
    <P>They talk about the Coalition Government, about how we could not pull together, about how we could not agree.  I think it is only fair that everybody in political life should be entitled to express his opinions, and it is a very poor specimen who will come into Leinster House and sit there, as dumb as can be, and never say what is in his mind.  There were two Coalition Governments here and that is one of the reasons why there is this change of front, and why this Bill has been presented.  There were two Coalition Governments and they lasted, on the average, longer than Fianna Fáil Governments. That has been said before and no one has denied it, or attempted to deny it.  But, right through the Taoiseach's speech&mdash;and it was a very frank speech and a very short one&mdash; was the argument that he wanted to change the Constitution so that one Party could get an over-all majority.</P>
    <P>Where did the Taoiseach turn for inspiration and light, but to the British <Col N="2121" /> parliamentary system?  The British parliamentary system, the Northern Ireland parliamentary system and the American system are the only three systems in existence that are envisaged in this Bill, and we are going to adopt the same system as they have.  Of course, they are totally different from us.  We are a totally different country from Britain, economically, politically, culturally, in every way.  The majority of our people speak the English language, but the political conditions that apply in Britain have no parallel here whatsoever.</P>
    <P>What we fear on this side of the House is a large, overwhelming, dominant Party and it is possible that can arise.  It occurs in the Six Counties because the constituencies are twisted about in such a way, and are so jerry-mandered, that they do not make sense to anyone.  In Britain, you have the South, the Conservative South, and you have the industrial and Labour North, no matter what happens, no matter how big a landslide may be.  There was a terrific landslide there in the '20s when something affected the British electorate and they swept the Labour Party away, but, even then they were able to maintain a considerable force in the British Parliament as an Opposition.  What we fear, however, is that there will be a huge parliamentary Party sitting on the Government benches, and we have had some small taste of what strong Government means.  We have had a small taste of it within the past 18 months and we know perfectly well, and the Irish people should realise, that they will have 100 or 120 Fianna Fáil Deputies, with maybe 20 or 30 Opposition Deputies, and that huge Party are likely to do what they like.</P>
    <P>The members of the Fianna Fáil Party know that.  They know that, with the large majority they have already, many things have happened in that Party with which they do not agree.  They know that they are controlled by a small crowd who force the issues on them, and what then will the position be?  Will they put up a resistance? Either they will do that or, as I said already, they will split again and we will have political bitterness.  You always get political bitterness far in <Col N="2122" /> excess of any other bitterness, particularly when an individual Party splits. A row in a family is always more bitter than a row outside, and that is one thing to remember when we come in here.  I suppose we cannot blame them&mdash;they are hide-bound by the Party spirit.  They are told to toe the line that is marked for them.  I ask them to remember they are not doing any good for the democratic outlook of this State, and we should guard and cherish the democracy we hold here. It was bought dearly enough.</P>
    <P>There is one point in the Taoiseach's speech to which I wish to refer more than any other.  He was apparently so impressed by what he was told, from 1948 to 1951, of what the people thought of the Coalition Government that he could not understand how we had not heard it, and he asked the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy J. A. Costello, why he did not take the cotton wool out of his ears.  He, the Taoiseach, heard from people who wanted him to hear.  He heard from his own friends and those around him when he went to meetings.  He heard from them strong criticism of the then existing Government and I wonder has he himself now got cotton wool in his ears.  If he has, he had better take it out and listen, and he will hear a few things that I have been hearing about this Government, who were elected with a strong majority under the P.R. system.  Those things I heard were not alone from members of the Fine Gael Party.  I can assure Deputies opposite that I heard them from members of the Fianna Fáil Party as well and, in fact, the majority of the criticisms I hear come from that Party.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce was one sea-green incorruptible who supported this Bill with all the force he could command.  He feels that P.R. should go.  When he was challenged that he said the direct opposite previously, he answered he had changed his mind, and I do not think any the worse of him for that. It is open to anybody to change his mind and admit he was wrong, and I do not think anybody need be ashamed of that, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as reported in the <Col N="2123" /> Official Reports, Volume 171, column 1030 said: &ldquo;Why will they not agree to give the people the chance of voting on it?&rdquo; That is rather begging the question.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce wants us to agree; he wants us to say that this Bill is right. Fianna Fáil have produced this Bill. They want to change the Constitution. They want to change the constituencies. They want to have their own representatives in this House.  Why should we agree and say nothing about it?  Why should we agree to a referendum?  It seems to beg the question. Are we to have a referendum on every little point that Fianna Fáil wants?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Tánaiste, as No. 2 in the Government, the second head of the State, is treating the Opposition shabbily when he suggests that if Fianna Fáil like a referendum, we should agree and should not oppose it.  He also stated: &ldquo;Why should they not be given the opportunity of making a change, if they want to make it?&rdquo; It was the people he was referring to.  The argument of Fianna Fáil all the time has been that this should be tested on the people.  I suggested in a Parliamentary Question to the Taoiseach that if he wanted to get some measure of test of the feeling of the people, other than what he was hearing, even with cotton wool in his ears, from the Fianna Fáil Party, he should submit the matter to the elected representatives of the local authorities for their opinions.  He did not seem to like that.</P>
    <P>It is significant, however, that Fianna Fáil is very subservient to Dublin opinion&mdash;they get the greater part of their strength from Dublin&mdash; and Dublin Corporation has already pronounced itself against this measure. On top of that, Dublin County Council did so as well the other day. In spite of that, the Tánaiste asks why should the people not get the opportunity of making a change, if they want to.  If Fianna Fáil want to do anything, the Irish people are expected to want it straight away.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste also said, at column 1044 of the same volume:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2124" />&ldquo;In every country where P.R. has operated for a long time, the tendency towards a multiplicity of Parties has been pronounced and it is inevitable that it will have that result with the formation of splinter groups, when divisions which may occur within Parties over comparatively minor issues of policy or personalities, need not carry any electoral penalties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In every country where P.R. has existed, there has been trouble.  Of course he did not name any countries at all.  He is wedded to the British system.  We have got to have the British electoral system here; that is all they are interested in.</P>
    <P>I wonder does he know that Belgium had political instability when they had the direct vote, up to comparatively recently?  As a result of that instability, they changed to P.R., and they have had political stability since then.  They have only three political Parties in Belgium under P.R., where they had eight or nine before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much.  The Tánaiste said that if we go over to the other system, we will have a Conservative Party and a Labour Party.  Of course, that is just wishful thinking on the part of the Tánaiste, or rather it is a carrot held out to the Labour Party in the hope that they will persuade their followers to accept this system so that the referendum will be sure to go through. If they get it through, they can arrange the constituencies so that the Tánaiste will lead practically the only Party that would exist.  It is a very clever argument.  The Tánaiste is a very clever man and probably an able politician, but I am sure the Labour Party will not be affected in any way by those arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as that, the Tánaiste feels the people do not understand the electoral system.  Apparently he is not the only person in Fianna Fáil who thinks that, as practically all the speakers for that Party were at pains to stress that the Irish people do not <Col N="2126" /> understand the P.R. system.  They have voted under the P.R. system for 36 years and it may interest Deputies opposite to know that the system of election here is considered, in other countries, to be the fairest system in the world.  It is also considered to be the best carried out P.R. system.</P>
    <P>I noted that Deputy Booth was rather annoyed because he was elected on Clann na Poblachta votes.  I do not know if he was very angry, but he seemed to be a little peeved.  Surely a minority&mdash;and I think Clann na Poblachta could be considered as a minority; even Fianna Fáil would probably accept that&mdash;is entitled, if it is unable to elect its own candidate, to transfer the votes to somebody else?</P>
    <P>I am mentioning this only because Deputy Booth mentioned the election results.  It was one of the main arguments he used to show that P.R. was entirely wrong, because he got 8,000 votes&mdash;he was very popular in his constituency&mdash;and Mr. Begley, who stood for Clann na Poblachta, was eliminated and gave him some 800 votes and he was quite annoyed.  I do not see anything wrong with the people who voted for Mr. Begley having a second choice.  They could not have been some of those very unintelligent people to whom the Tánaiste has referred.  He said the people do not understand the system. In fact, he said the people are really too ignorant to have that system and that they want a simpler system.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland understand the transfer system very well.  If they did not understand it, I would not be in this House&mdash;which in itself might not be a great loss&mdash;and a great many Deputies would not be here.  I do not believe one-third of the Deputies sitting here were elected on the first count.  We were all elected on subsequent counts.  I myself, in County Wexford, got in on the last count.  I received transferred votes and I watched three Fianna Fáil Deputies being elected and they had only a small number of votes to be distributed. I got transferred votes and I was glad to get them.  It so happens that, in the final analysis, I would have got in without them.</P>
    <P>All the same, why should a person <Col N="2127" /> not have a second choice?  It is the freest and fairest method in the world.  We are one of the few countries with this system.  Malta and Gibraltar have that system of election and it also exists in Tasmania, which is not a federal Parliament, but one of the groups that constitute the Australian Parliament.</P>
    <P>P.R. has been with us for a great number of years.  The people have proved that they understand P.R. and they have proved that they know how to work it.  It has given good results in this country and I do not see any argument for its abolition, other than the argument that one Party wants to rule.</P>
    <P>The Scandinavian countries have perhaps produced more political stability than any other part of Europe.  It may be because of the temperament of the people&mdash;I do not know.  They have a system of election not entirely comparable to ours but very similar.  We shall take Denmark.  It is a country which, to a large extent, is economically the same as ours.  It is an agricultural country, not heavily industrialised. They have a P.R. system and it differs from our system in that they have 179 seats: they elect 139 by P.R. in somewhat bigger constituencies than we have.  Two seats are allotted to the Faroe islands and the other seats, about 40, are divided among the small Parties, an equal distribution according to the percentage of those who have not got anybody elected.</P>
    <P>I think that is the fairest system, even more fair than ours.  They elect nearly three-quarters of their Parliament by the P.R. system and those that have no representation are allocated 40 seats so that every Party, no matter how small, will be represented. There is no political instability in Denmark and there is a Coalition Government there.  There have been coalitions in Denmark for years, but I do not think in the last 20 years they have had a dissolution before due time.</P>
    <P>The same applies to all Scandinavian countries with the possible exception of Finland where there is <Col N="2128" /> a political crisis at present.  That crisis is extraneous to Finland and not due to internal questions.  The situation is due to Soviet pressure because the people chose to elect a Government which was too much to the Right in the estimation of the Soviet overlords.  The result is that the Finnish people have been pushed into a political crisis.  In case any Fianna Fáil Deputy may indulge in wishful thinking, or try to make a case about instability in Finland, he may forget it.</P>
    <P>Another country which could be classified as in the Scandinavian group is Iceland where there is also a political crisis at the moment.  They have had P.R. but they had quite a measure of stability in the Icelandic Parliament and again their troubles are attributable to Communist pressure.  They are having a fishery dispute at the moment. The principal Minister there&mdash;as the Minister for Agriculture should be in this country&mdash;is the Minister for Fisheries and he happens to be a Communist and again, the pressure is coming from the Soviet sphere and there is political instability.</P>
    <P>Germany has been quoted as producing a multiplicity of Parties because of P.R., but they have not got P.R.  In Germany they have P.R. only for their local elections: for their Federal Parliament they have practically the same system as the British except that they have what they call &ldquo;the second voice.&rdquo;  When they vote for a particular candidate they may also give a vote for the Party so that if a person wants to vote for, say, the Social Democrats&mdash;which is the Labour Party in Germany&mdash;and at the same time believes that Herr Adenauer is the most suitable person to lead the country, they may give the &ldquo;second voice&rdquo; to Adenauer.  Otherwise the system is practically on a par with the British system.  The system of election of local bodies is quite different. Seventy per cent. of the members are elected by the direct vote system and 30 per cent. by P.R.  Yet, there is no instability.</P>
    <P>I think France deserves a special chapter because it is one of the countries on which Fianna Fáil seemed to have banked all their hopes.  France <Col N="2129" /> was cited as the acme of political instability. Because France produced that great man, General de Gaulle to counteract this instability they had a referendum.  I wonder is that why we are having a referendum also.  France has not had P.R. since 1945.  They have had the direct voting system and the only difference was that candidates were nominated by the Parties and the people voted for the Party, not the individual.  That was the voting system.  The political instability in France&mdash;admittedly, they had many Parties&mdash;was due to the fact that under the Constitution it was not necessary to have a dissolution if a Government fell.  That is why they had repeated changes of Government.</P>
    <P>Another cause of political instability in France, which does not apply here in the slightest degree or in any other country in Europe with the possible exception of Italy which is on this side of the Iron Curtain, is that they had one quarter of a House of 600 Deputies who were Communist.  They had at one time 151 Communists. Subsequently the number fell to about 130 but they were added to by the Poujadists who were anti-everything just as the Communists were.</P>
    <P>The political system in France and the Parliament itself are very similar to that advocated here last night by Deputy Sheldon, the committee system. According to that system the representation that every Party has on those committees is proportional. Much work is done in France by these committees and they exert pressure on individual Ministers.  They have a very big say in the administration of France.  It stands to reason that if out of 600 Deputies there are 130 Communists and about 30 Poujadists who are against the democratic system there will be some upheavals.  That is why these political committees are a source of great embarrassment to, and exercise considerable pressure on, any Government.  That was one of the main reasons, apart from the fact that they could not dissolve, why French Governments fell.  I hope that is clear to the House.  It proves definitely that there is absolutely no parallel whatever between this country and France. <Col N="2130" /> In any case, we have not political instability.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth made a case about political instability in Italy.  Italy has direct voting.  Before the war prior to the days of Mussolini, Italy had P.R. and Italy had political stability with P.R., but a rather different set of circumstances applied, and as a result of that you had the monarchial system with Right Wing Parties.  You also had what was the budding Christian Democrat Party.  They were in opposition to each other and there was no unity between them.  They were at the stage at which the Monarchial Party were going down and the Christian Democrats were coming up and therefore there was political instability at that time. That is the period on which Deputy Booth based his argument as an argument against P.R.  That was a great many years ago.  Since then Italy has changed her electoral system.  She now votes by the direct system and she has political&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If you have a single member constituency and if the Party nominate one member for it, whether you vote for the Party or the individual, you are voting for the direct system, and you are voting possibly, for a minority there.  That is the position in Italy at the moment and they have political instability there.  Admittedly, you do not get very much political instability with the direct system.  I am only citing this to show that it is possible to get it.  It is possible to get it here. Under the three-Party system, you can get political instability.  Political instability has been got even under the British electoral system, which Fianna Fáil appear to admire so much, since they are endeavouring to impose it on the Irish people.</P>
      <P>When you had the three Party system there, you had the Liberal Party, the Labour Party and the Conservative Party.  Before the realignment started, it just became a system of one Party or the other, and they had political instability.  Subject to correction from the Minister for Health, who seems to have studied all these facts so carefully, I think I am right in saying they had general elections in Britain inside eight months. The Liberal and Labour Parties had a coalition against the Conservative Party, and there was political instability after it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have endeavoured to show the House as fairly as I can what the political situation is in other countries. I may have made mistakes.  The Minister for Health will speak after me and he can correct anything I have said which may be wrong.  I have been speaking without notes and from memory, and it is quite possible I may have made errors here and there. But, in the main, I think I have made a fairly reasonable case that P.R. is a fair system of election and that, though you have cases of instability, as I freely admit, you also have cases of stability as well.  Taking it by and large, I believe you have just as much stability in P.R. as you have in the <Col N="2132" /> system being imposed on us now. Further, under P.R., you are leaving to the people of this country the method given to them by three Irish leaders over the past 40 years, and you are giving every man and woman the right to express the opinions to which they are entitled.  But, by taking the step we propose now&mdash;and do not let us disillusion ourselves about the result of the vote we will take&mdash; we are taking a retrograde step in Irish democracy.</P>
    <P>We have built up our State here under difficulties.  I have no connection with what took place in 1922.  I do not want to refer to it at all, but, <i>en passant</i>, I can say this State was built up under difficulties.  Our first Irish Government was immature in political experience.  Subsequently, we had a Party who for a time did not take part in the politics within this Chamber, but later came in, came into power and governed under the democratic system&mdash;the most difficult system in the world.  The only trouble is that, when they did get back, they interfered with the existing system set up under P.R.  I think they were wrong in doing that.  The first retrograde step they took was to turn the constituencies here from the larger constituencies into three-member constituencies. The three member constituency is P.R. but it is not as fair an interpretation of P.R. as the larger constituencies were.  If the Government wanted to produce any change in the Constitution, they would be well advised to go back to the larger constituencies. With regard to the transferable vote in the single member constituency, that is not P.R. at all.  It is what they call the alternative vote.  The true P.R. is the large constituency and that is the one we should have here.  If they want to amend anything, let them go back to that again.</P>
    <P>I should like now to come to the Bill.  I cannot see that it is really a democratic Bill.  It was drafted in an atmosphere of smokescreens.  It purports to set up a commission.  The idea is that having got this through the Dáil with the vote of the Fianna Fáil Party and perhaps two or three Independents, and if they are lucky <Col N="2133" /> enough to get it through the Seanad and succeed in the referendum, then we have a coat of whitewash to make everything all right.  A commission is a cover for everything.  We are to have a commission of three members of the Government, nominated by the Taoiseach, and three members, considered to be Opposition Deputies, nominated by the Ceann Comhairle. We are to have an independent chairman. As far as my memory serves me, he is to be nominated by the President, and to make it sound better, the President is to have the advice of the Council of State.  I have a very suspicious mind, so when I heard that the Council of State were to advise the President, I began to take an interest in the Council of State.  I had a feeling they were not a particularly active body and that they did not function very often.  I knew they were being brought into this solely to make it sound better.  It sounds better than merely saying the President will nominate the Chairman.</P>
    <P>The House will excuse me if I dwell rather a long time on the chairman. He seems to have rather extraordinary powers as head of the commission that other chairmen heretofore in this State do not appear to have had.  If I am wrong, the Minister for Health will clarify it when he speaks.  The Council of State are to advise the President. Roughly speaking, the members of the Council of State number nine against five&mdash;nine men who have been at some time or other associated with the Fianna Fáil Party and five who have not.  So it appears that, in the first instance, Fianna Fáil have a sizeable majority on the commission.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not they are elected under the P.R. system.  I do not know whether or not they have a monopoly.  I have been trying to find out how exactly they fit into one part of this Bill here, Part II.  It contains the following provision:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A constituency commission shall consist of seven members appointed by the President, of whom one shall be appointed after consultation by the President with the Council of State, three shall be appointed from the members of Dáil Éireann on the <Col N="2134" /> nomination of the Taoiseach and three shall be appointed from the members of Dáil Éireann on the nomination of the Chairman of Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me there may be a loophole in that for the Government.  To put it crudely, it seems to me that a member of the commission can be fired by the President and by the Council of State.  I cannot interpret the provision in any other way.  This point needs clarification.  The proposition is that we should upset the whole electoral system in the country.  Perhaps the point will be clarified by some member of the Government Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We are entitled at least to lay the foundations for putting good thoughts into the minds of the Government so that they will clarify, at some stage, these points which are not clear.  This piece of legislation is wholly undemocratic and that is why I am drawing attention to these things.  I am glad the Minister is taking due notice of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This commission appears to be the only commission so far set up not subject in any way to the courts as to its findings.  The courts are to be abrogated altogether.  Here, the Government are doing something special. Surely every precaution should be taken to safeguard democratic rights in every way?  There is always the risk that some one may slip in the drafting of the Bill, or some one may slip in the workings of the commission.  In such an eventuality, the courts are the last standard of justice.  The proposal now is to abrogate the courts altogether. Hitherto everybody, rich and poor alike, had certain rights and could apply to the court, if they felt themselves wronged in any way.  This commission will over-ride the simple rights of Irish people.  Possibly the point is one for clarification on Committee Stage and I trust the Government will give due consideration to it between now and then.  Some responsible Minister may, at a later stage, explain why it was thought necessary to <Col N="2135" /> incorporate such a provision in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs stated that they would consider any amendments put in.  There seems to be grave reason for amendment in this instance.  Is this commission really a commission?  It will be constituted of three members of the Government Party, three members of the Opposition, and the chairman will be a member of the Supreme Court or the High Court.  I shall not say anything about the judges.  Judges, when they are sitting on the Bench, are, I presume, judges.  It will be a different matter when they come to act on this commission. The same rules and regulations will not apply.</P>
    <P>If this commission fails to agree as to constituency boundaries and if no report is produced within six months of the setting up of the commission, the chairman shall present a report. Now the chairman will be chosen by the President and by the Council of State.  Eight or nine members of the Council of State are affiliated in some way with the Fianna Fáil Party; five members of the council have a contrary affiliation of some other kind.  Is that a fair commission?  Is it not a smokescreen? Is it not rank hypocrisy, and nothing else, to produce a commission like that?  Is it not a negation of everything for which we have fought? Have politics sunk to such a depth that we have to look for a smokescreen like that?  What is happening every day behind the Iron Curtain?  There the smokescreen is in constant use.  Has Irish democracy reached such a stage of development in the wrong direction that we have to resort to that?</P>
    <P>This Bill will be an everlasting disgrace to the Irish people.  Mark my words, it will be a bad day when Fianna Fáil play about with the Constitution. I have had the honour to represent Ireland in the Council of Europe since 1954.  Many people from other countries have spoken to me about our political system here.  It is recognised as a fair system.  It is recognised for what it is&mdash;the voice of a free nation, a nation that had to wait many centuries to determine its own <Col N="2136" /> affairs.  We have that democratic process now.</P>
    <P>There are things one would prefer to leave unsaid, but Fianna Fáil, in this Bill, are motivated by nothing but self-interest.  The very set-up of this proposed commission proves that. Whatever Fianna Fáil Deputies may say, in their own hearts, they know this is a bad day's work for Ireland. It is a retrograde step and a gross imposition on a people who have suffered so much.  Fianna Fáil have a majority here.  They should be the last Party to try to inflict this piece of legislation on the Irish nation.</P>

      <P>I should like, first of all, to congratulate Deputy Esmonde on the fact that he has been the first Deputy on the Opposition Benches to address himself to this issue with a degree of reason and argument hitherto lacking in the Opposition approach to this measure. I am sorry that in the concluding protion of his speech he should charge those of us who have introduced this Bill, and whose responsibility it has been to draft it, with bringing in the measure purely in order to serve our own self-interest.  What interest have I and the other senior members of our Party, or the Taoiseach, in trying to make Irish politics a preserve for Fianna Fáil?  In the ordinary course of nature, we shall soon be leaving the political scene.  What advantage can we get from this Bill?  What advantage can we get such as the Deputy alleges we are seeking to draw?  Even if we were self-seeking in this matter, even if we were trying to serve a selfish interest, what assurance have we that we shall ever succeed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde has said that, if this Bill goes through, Fianna Fáil will get an overwhelming majority. I hope that Fianna Fáil will get a majority.  I do not want it to get an overwhelming majority but, whether it is large or small, Fianna Fáil will not get a majority unless the Irish people think well of those who stand for Fianna Fáil, unless they think that those who are candidates for Fianna Fáil are worthy to sit in an Irish Parliament, and unless they are convinced that the policies put forward <Col N="2137" /> by Fianna Fáil are in the best interests of the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>The remarkable thing about the Opposition speeches in the course of this debate is that they seem to despair of the prospect of ever being able, standing as a single Party, upon their own merits, to convince the Irish people that they are the best fitted to administer Irish affairs.  The speeches from the Opposition with regard to this Bill are speeches of despairing men.  I would ask them to cheer up. Surely, Providence, in His mercy to them and in justice to the Irish people, will give them the opportunity of so mending their ways that when we have the system of the straight vote in this country, they will be called at some time by the suffrage of the Irish people to administer our affairs.</P>

      <P>When he opened for the Opposition and spoke against the Government's proposal that the people should be given the opportunity to consider whether or not P.R. should be replaced by the single nontransferable vote, Deputy John A. Costello committed himself to some statements for which he can find no warrant in the proposal now before the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>For instance, in column 1002, Volume 171, he is reported as having first of all solemnly enjoined us not to &ldquo;interfere with the affairs of another country&rdquo; and then directly went on to say that the political disorder which had characterised public life in France since the war of 1939 was due to &ldquo;conditions endemic to the people&mdash;of that country&mdash;as a whole&rdquo;.  This is as much as to say that the French people, in the view of the Leader of the Opposition, are unfit to govern themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I conclude, I may have something to say about the main causes which led to the breakdown of parliamentary government in France; so that a few weeks ago the great freedom-loving French people were induced to contemplate <Col N="2138" /> with positive relief the prospect of a military government.  For the moment, however, I shall pass on to recall with warm approval one sensible, one cogent remark which the Leader of the Opposition did make.  It is a pity that it has to stand almost in isolation, amid so much that was unworthy of a serious occasion.  And this is a serious occasion.  The Fine Gael leader himself stressed how serious, when, as reported in column 1002, Volume 171, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are engaged here in a debate of the utmost gravity.  We are about to take a decision which may well affect the future lives and liberties of this and future generations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Government is in full accord with that view.</P>
      <P>It has been argued against the proposal to abolish P.R. that Fianna Fáil has done well under that system and that accordingly we should leave well enough alone.  It is certainly true that we have had a greater measure of success even with this system of election than any other Party in the State. But that has been due, not to the method of election, but to the faith and trust which the people have in this Party and its policies, and particularly in the Taoiseach who is our leader.</P>

      <P>Nothing, therefore, but an acute realisation of the dangers to the political liberties of the people which are inherent in P.R. would have impelled us to take the course upon which we have embarked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde referred to P.R. in the 1937 Constitution.  As the Taoiseach made clear when the Constitution was being debated here in 1937, it was only with great reservation and, I may say on my part, with grave doubt as to how that system of election would ultimately serve the national interest, that P.R. was carried over from the Constitution of 1922 into the people's Constitution of 1937.  Those reservations and doubts were engendered by the fact that a <Col N="2139" /> few years before that time we had seen the democratic Republics of Italy and Germany brought down and totalitarian dictatorships enthroned on their ruins.  Poland, Austria and Greece had gone the same road before 1937.  Even Belgium at that time was not so secure.  There was a Rexist movement in Belgium whose aim and purpose it was to destroy the parliamentary system in Belgium.  That movement was defeated only by the statesmanship of the then King of the Belgians and the man who afterwards became Prime Minister of the State. All this, however, was before the second world war.  Since then, we have seen democratic France confronted by the same peril and almost succumb to it.</P>
    <P>I am very sorry that Deputy Esmonde has left the House.  If he were here I would in his presence have corrected certain of the misstatements which he made about France.</P>

      <P>I was saying that France was confronted by the peril of a military dictatorship a few months ago and almost surrendered to it. Quite recently in Belgium and the Netherlands&mdash;this is relevant to what Deputy Esmonde said&mdash;great and prolonged difficulties have been experienced in forming stable Governments. <Col N="2140" /> These difficulties all resulted from positions created by elections conducted under the system of P.R.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Even within the past week Coalition Governments in Finland and Iceland have fallen apart; in Finland under external pressure from Russia.  Deputy Esmonde seemed to think that in some way this pressure from Russia should extenuate the failure of the system of P.R. to produce a stable Government in Finland, and to excuse the tendency of P.R. to bring about Coalition Governments.</P>
      <P>What has happened in Finland? Precisely the sort of thing that we are trying to safeguard the people of this country against.  Russia has been bringing economic pressure on Finland in order to make the Finnish people conform to Russian policy and serve Russian interests.  There have been men in Finland who stood up against Russia.  They stood up against here during the great war of 1939.  But in face of this pressure the weak elements in the Coalition have withdrawn from it.  The Finnish Government, which was defending the interests of the Finnish people against the pressure of Russian aggression, has been brought down.  That is precisely what happens wherever you have a Parliament composed of disparate elements such as in Finland.</P>
      <P>The same is true of Iceland.  Iceland, in an endeavour to assert and safeguard its territorial rights over waters which the Icelandic people believe belong to them and on which their whole economic life depends, has become engaged in a sort of cold war with some of the Western States, who have traditional rights, they contend, to fish in those waters.  Thus there has been created a very grave economic situation in Iceland.  Now what has happened?  Under stress of these economic circumstances a Party in the Icelandic Coalition has withdrawn and the Government of Iceland has collapsed.  I need hardly say that in both countries elections are by P.R.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With these examples before us surely it was our duty as men charged, for <Col N="2141" /> the time being at least, with the care and custodianship of the people's liberties, surely it was natural that we should study how it was that such situations, such calamitous situations, had been brought about.  In all cases there was the same answer; the electoral laws by which the Parliaments of these countries were constituted and the tenure and type of the executive determined, appeared to be the main factor in creating political instability. In short, we found that wherever P.R. was in force, it left a democratic structure so rickety, that, in times of public stress, a determined authoritarian movement, even though it were in a minority, had little difficulty not only in overthrowing the Government but in abolishing Parliament itself.</P>
    <P>I am not going to contend, and I think no one will contend that it was the only factor.  In those democracies where there was inherent political instability&mdash;as there is invariably with P.R. and in Coalitions based upon it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In due course I am coming to Switzerland.  In those democracies, where because of P.R. there was inherent political instability, economic stress, the personal antagonisms of politicians, such as we had when Deputy Dr. Noel Browne fell out with Deputy Seán MacBride and the selfish exploitation of economic and budgetary difficulties by sectional interests within Cabinets may have helped to create conditions in which it was relatively easy to destroy the parliamentary system as, for example, in Italy and Germany.  It is almost beyond question that if the Governments in these countries had been soundly based on strong majorities in Parliament, they would have survived all these vicissitudes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The course of events in Great Britain over the period when Mussolini and Hitler were riding to power supports this contention.  In that country, as in those I have mentioned, the war <Col N="2142" /> of 1914-18 was followed by years of acute industrial unrest.  Coal strikes, steel strikes, railway strikes culminated in the great general strike of 1926; but British parliamentary government was not overthrown.  Neither was it overthrown in the pit of the 1931 depression; when unemployment was rank all over the country; when bands of hungry men plodded all the roads of England, marching on London.</P>
    <P>There was no attempt even then to emulate Mussolini's march on Rome, and if such an attempt had been made, it would have been readily defeated by a Government whose strength was drawn from the support of a solid, cohering majority in the House of Commons.  Even when financial disaster overtook Great Britain in 1931, as it had overtaken Germany and Austria the British Union of Fascists were not able to take advantage of the misery, anger and hunger of the people who had lost their all, to destroy Parliament as Hitler's Brownshirts had been able to do in similar circumstances in Germany.</P>
    <P>It is true, perhaps, that men as well as measures, were, to a significant degree, responsible for the defeat of Fascism in Great Britain.  For do not let us forget that there was, prior to 1931 and prior to the last great war, a determined effort to create a Fascist Government in Great Britain. I was saying that it was perhaps true that men were responsible, to a significant degree, anyhow, for the defeat of that movement because in contradistinction to the British Government, the Governments of Italy and Germany were the creatures of Party Coalitions, weak, fumbling, transient and unsure of themselves, compelled to trim their sails to every puff of discontent or displeasure, no matter from what quarter it came, or how trivial the occasion of it.  They could not rule their country nor lead it.  They could neither rule their country nor lead the individuals in it because those Governments had no solid ground under them for the simple reason that in Parliament they had no solid majority to support them. They were performers on a parliamentary tight-rope and when it was twitched the Governments fell.</P>
    <P>Governments were formed and in a <Col N="2143" /> few months, or a few weeks, or within even a few days, they were tumbled by those who had brought them into being.  What respect could there be for such Governments as entities, or for the politicians who, from time to time, figured in them when their lives were so habitually short and chequered and occasionally contemptible.</P>
    <P>Almost 200 years ago Alexander Hamilton, one of the shapers of the great United States, wrote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To trace the mischievous effects of a mutable Government would fill a volume.  I will hint a few only, each of which will be perceived to be a source of innumerable others.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on then to enumerate some of them and thereafter continues:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was saying that the events&mdash;the stagnation, sometimes the feverish excitement, the feverish temporary excitement&mdash;which this country experienced under the first and second Coalitions have demonstrated to each and all of us how true is what Alexander Hamilton said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The want of confidence in the public councils damps every useful undertaking, the success and profit of which may depend on a continuance of existing arrangements... In a word, no great improvements or laudable enterprise can go forward which requires the auspices of a steady system of national policy. But the most deplorable effect of all is that diminution of attachment and reverence which steals into the hearts of the people towards a political system which betrays so many marks of infirmity and disappoints so many of their hopes.  No Government any more than an individual will long be respected without being truly respectable; not be truly respectable without possessing a certain portion of order and stability.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>These words written almost two centuries ago are a searing exposé of the situation which, in elective systems of government, P.R. tends innately to produce.  They carry also a warning for us.  There are many who hold&mdash;and we have often heard it from them&mdash;that our people are weakening in their attachment to the representative régime.  It is very ominous that this should be said of us who have done so much <Col N="2145" /> to establish democratic procedures in other lands.  It can only be because we have an electoral system which affords politicians a ready excuse when they betray political principles in return for political place.</P>
      <P>We have an electoral system which facilitates the political higgler; we have an electoral system which begets political coalition; we have an electoral system which makes for unstable Governments; and therefore we have a system which is not truly respectable, because it does not possess &ldquo;a certain portion of order and stability&rdquo;.  We have an electoral system which, if it be not abandoned, will surely bring upon us the ills which afflicted Italy, Germany, Poland, Austria, Greece, in the days before the last war&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Indeed, this is, to repeat once more the words of the Leader of the Opposition, a debate of the utmost gravity.  In it we are&mdash; or at least, we ought to be&mdash; discussing the basic problems of democracy: how to accomplish the extremely difficult feat of reconciling the representative principle with the need for a responsible, established, stable and effective authority to lead and direct the State and to manage the public affairs.</P>
      <P>Over 200 years ago again, a Frenchman who was at once an acute political thinker, a lawyer and a man of affairs stated our difficulty in these terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In a democracy the people are in some respects the sovereign and in others the subject.  There can be no exercise of sovereignty but by their suffrages which are their own will.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Having stressed how democracy is a duality Montesquieu went on to conclude:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2146" />&ldquo;The laws, therefore, which establish the right of suffrage are fundamental to this form of government. And indeed it is important to regulate in a Republic in what manner, by whom, to whom and concerning what suffrages are to be given, as it is in the monarchy to know who is the king and after what manner he ought to govern.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>By Montesquieu. The proposal which is now before the Dáil is that the people should be asked to agree that the method as now prescribed by the Constitution for determining the result of their suffrages shall be changed.  This is, as the Leader of the Opposition informed us, a debate of the utmost gravity.  Why do those who think otherwise in regard to this matter not argue their case on its merits?  It is not that they regard our present method of election as being perfect, or even good.  In this debate, Deputy J.A. Costello, the Leader of the Opposition, has been at pains to make himself clear on that aspect of the matter.  As reported at column 1011 of Volume 171 of the Official Report, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have always had a conviction that there are defects, perhaps serious defects, in the rules governing the operation of elections under that system.  I tried to find out where those rules came from and it is not, to say the least of it, very easy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later, as reported in column 1016, he went on to say that he was positive that &ldquo;the system is capable of improvement&rdquo; and indicated that such improvement is at least desirable in order to give additional strength and stability to governments formed under it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago&mdash;then, as now, in oppositive&mdash;Deputy Costello was even <Col N="2147" /> more precise in indicating a few of the weaknesses of P.R.  He held at that time that P.R., though on paper a perfect system, is in practice quite the opposite.  In particular he emphasised how it breeds disorder and dissension in Parliament.  He told us how this evil was, in his opinion, &ldquo;inherent in any&rdquo;&mdash;note that word &ldquo;any&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;in any system of P.R.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amplifying this statement, he then went on to say, as reported in Volume 68, column 1345:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under the system of the single transferable vote we are bound to have a large number of Parties returned...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was then speaking for the people who are sitting opposite, his colleagues to-day, and for himself of course.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We always understood that the real defect under any system of P.R. and particularly the system of the single transferable vote, was that it led, in circumstances where there are no big economic issues before the country, to a large number of small Parties being returned, making for instability in government.  That is inherent in the system of P.R. and the single transferable vote.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Consider now the views of Deputy Dillon.  He also, like Deputy Costello, does not think much of the present system, the one the Opposition is now fighting to preserve.  In his speech last Wednesday, he referred to it as a fraud and told us that it is debauched. Eleven years ago, he told the Dáil much the same thing when he said, at column 1714 of Volume 108:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Personally, I think P.R. is a fraud and a cod, and that it ought to be abolished.  I believe in the single member constituency, with the transferable vote, so that the man who gets the support of the largest number of people living in the constituency will represent the constituency. The constituency should be of a size to enable the T.D. to familiarise himself with all its problems.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At that time, eleven years ago, Deputy Dillon wanted single member constituencies. Last week, however, we heard <Col N="2148" /> him arguing for bigger and bigger and bigger constituencies, following, perhaps, in the train of Deputy Esmonde, who wanted the whole country to be one constituency and P.R. carried to its uttermost limits.</P>
    <P>However, to get back to Deputy Dillon:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under that system you would get a clear majority in this House, with a good strong Government and with no doubts about it after a general election.  The rag-tag Constitution&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Remember, that reference is to the Constitution which they are now fighting to preserve inviolate&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;that we have provides for P.R.  I suppose that, until we can change that, we have got to abide this as well as the many other evils that have been foisted upon us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark, &ldquo;until we can change that.&rdquo; We are being opposed by Deputy Dillon when trying to change it now. Thus, however, the superman of Fine Gael addressed himself with characteristic dignity and restraint to this grave issue.</P>
    <P>One does not want to weary the House in dredging up the past, but it would not be fair to the junior members among us to fail to let them know what the present professor of constitutional law in University College, Dublin, and a former Attorney General, Deputy McGilligan, has said about our present system of election. He is reported in Volume 67, column 1070 of the Official Report as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was always held that with regard to P.R. which this country adopted, we had adopted the worst possible system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I can sum up then and say that it is fair to state that the Leader of Fine Gael is extremely dubious about the merits and advantages of P.R.  He is in no doubt whatsoever that it breeds a multiplicity of Parties and makes for instability in government.  He tells us, indeed, that these evils are &ldquo;inherent in the system of P.R. and the single transferable vote.&rdquo;  Moreover, on the matter of P.R. constituencies, <Col N="2149" /> his views are in marked contrast to those held by his colleague, Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has something, though an illogical something, to say in favour of P.R.  He said it was a fraud and a cod ten years ago, but to-day he has something to say in favour of P.R., with, however, seven seat constituencies.  Whereas Deputy Costello is on record as saying that: &ldquo;In practice, the fact of having a big constituency is nullifying P.R. completely.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the general question, however, of the merits or demerits of the system, Deputy Dillon has expressed himself much more emphatically than his leader.  According to him &ldquo;P.R. is a fraud and a cod and ought to be abolished.&rdquo;  It is, he has declared, &ldquo;the child of the brains of all the cranks in creation.&rdquo;  So far as this country is concerned, &ldquo;it was tried out on the dog.&rdquo;  Deputy Esmonde does not agree with that but, after all, who expects one member of the Fine Gael Party to agree with another?  &ldquo;It was foisted upon us,&rdquo; said Deputy Dillon, &ldquo;by a collection of half-lunatics&rdquo;&mdash;they are now standing up for it&mdash;&ldquo;who believed that they had something lovely that would work on paper like a jig-saw puzzle.&rdquo;  And, finally, Deputy McGilligan admits that it is generally held that the system of P.R. which obtains here is the worst possible.</P>
    <P>Now, in the light of all this, is it not deplorable that when the Government propose that the people should be given an opportunity to decide whether or not this system, which is so generally condemned, should be changed, the spokesmen for Fine Gael, in particular, and the Leader of the Labour Party, personally, should overwhelm us with vituperation?  Is it not inexcusable that my predecessor as Minister for Health, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, should go so far as to threaten civil disorder, even perhaps civil war, if the people venture to change this worst of all possible systems of election?  In the light of the speeches which we have heard, with the solitary exception, perhaps, of Deputy Costello, in part, <Col N="2150" /> and of Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde, is it not reasonable to ask ourselves if reason has not foresaken the Opposition?</P>
    <P>Speaking a few nights ago, outside this House, the Leader of the Opposition tried to induce the people in this country to believe that in this matter we are taking a leap in the dark.  But are we?  My contention is that we are not.  P.R. has been tried in many countries.  Except in very exceptional circumstances, it has failed in most of them to produce stable and effective Governments and consistent public policies.  The system has been critically examined by eminent students of political science and of constitutional organisms and it has been condemned by them all.  There is scarcely any public procedure that has been so closely studied as election by P.R.  It is not for want of experiment and adaptation and modification to eliminate its manifold evils that the system everywhere failed to satisfy the requirements of the public interest and I make no exception to that rule.</P>
    <P>If the system is in operation in certain countries to-day, as admittedly it is, it is only because there have been built up around it many selfish, sectional interests whose advantage it is to maintain it.  It is only when the people have become desperate under it, as recently in France; or when a dictator overthrows the parliamentary régime whose foundations it has rotted, as in Germany or Italy; or when there is a Government strong enough to overbear the vested interests, and to submit the matter to the people, as is now being done in this country, that P.R., once introduced, can be abolished.</P>
    <P>The Government are not asking the people to leap in the dark in this matter.  Many examples of the ghastly experiences of other countries under P.R. have illuminated the public mind and have now brought home to our people&mdash;I believe to the majority of our people&mdash;how closely the welfare and security of our Republic is bound up with the abolition of P.R.</P>
    <P>In this debate, the general opinion outside is that the honours have been with those who are supporting the <Col N="2151" /> Government's proposal.  They have been with them because those who want to get rid of the system have been able to support their case by the citation of historical facts, facts which, because they are within the recent knowledge of all of us here, cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>Against these facts the Opposition, I regret to have to say it, have had little to offer but personal abuse and undignified vituperation.</P>
    <P>In his telling speech in support of the Amending Bill, Deputy Booth a few days ago gave a general review of the history and fatal consequences of P.R. in most of the post-1918 democracies.  Notwithstanding this, I shall venture to refer to some of them again and to quote the judgments of some political leaders who lived through and were at the heart of the events which led to the destruction of the democracies which they themselves had helped to establish.  I shall take Germany first.  I must summarise briefly the events which led to the establishment of the Weimar Republic by reminding the House that after the abdication and flight in 1918 of the then German Emperor and the collapse of the German Empire, the great parties, the Catholic or Centre Party, the Liberals or German Democrats, and the Socialists or Social Democrats, having defeated all attempts to bolshevise Germany, cooperated together to establish the first German Federal Republic, the Weimar Republic as it was popularly known.</P>
    <P>Among those who played a leading part in these events was Erich Koch-Weser, a Liberal who in the Federal Government was Minister for the Interior in 1919-21, and later, in 1928-29, was Minister for Justice&mdash;a man, therefore, who could speak with knowledge and authority.  In his book, <i>Hitler and Beyond</i>, he has given this picture of the political scene from 1920 to the advent of Hitler as German Chancellor:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From this time on there were frequent changes of government in Germany.  Now there were minority governments that could be toppled at any moment, now majority <Col N="2152" /> governments that disintegrated because the members could not agree among themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first Coalition Government here of 1948-51!</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The parties felt at ease neither in the opposition, where they were without any influence, nor in the government, where they were unable to accomplish all they wanted.  There was constant horse-trading.  The picture was continually changing. Sometimes the German People's Party, consisting of the upper middle classes, took part in the government, though reluctantly and with an air of suspicion, and then there was either a government of the moderate parties, or if the Social Democrats joined, a so-called grand coalition. Now there was a minority left-wing government, and now the Social Democrats withdrew ill-humoredly because things were taking too much of a turn to the right to suit them. Then again the right-wing German Nationals had to be included, but never felt at ease in the Government for any length of time and resigned whenever any important decisions had to be made about foreign affairs.  The Catholics and the German Democrats almost always bore the burden of unpopular government policies, and the German Democrats in particular thus forfeited votes.  The republic came into ill-repute through long-drawn-out negotiations concerning the make-up of the government and through its instability.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The party history of these years proved that the German people were too much divided about politics, religion, economics, and social and cultural questions to send substantial majorities to the Reichstag.  The system of P.R. only increased the evils of the situation. It had been claimed that P.R. in the Reichstag would afford a mirror of public opinion.  But actually it shattered the mirror into splinters that could not be used for government purposes.  To the very end of the republic there was always the difficulty; later even the impossibility, <Col N="2153" /> of forming substantial majorities.  Too frequent turnover in the government was largely to blame for the fumbling conduct of affairs of state and for the people's disappointment in it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I was saying that the account which I have quoted was written by a man who was a leading Liberal, a man who was twice Minister in Governments of the First German Federal Republic.  That is the description which he has left to us of the events which led to the downfall of the republican régime in Germany and the enthronement of the Nazis and Adolf Hitler as German dictator.</P>
      <P>This account set down by a German Liberal is supplemented and corroborated by the judgment of a member of the Centrum or Catholic Party, Karl Spiecker, who in <i>Germany: From Defeat to Defeat</i> in explanation of the downfall of democracy in Germany tells us:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There were other organic, and therefore much more dangerous, defects which ultimately became fatal. These were, first, P.R. as laid down in the Weimar Constitution....  The fathers of the Weimar Constitution strove to create a democratic-parliamentary Constitution of the greatest <Col N="2154" /> possible perfection, and therefore ...to make the franchise entirely just, provided in the Constitution for the P.R. system.  Through this even small political groups and minorities were to be assured of adequate representation in Parliament. The authors of the clause in question did not suspect that by so doing they had signed the death warrant of the Republic... No wonder that on this soil the Parties flourished amazingly&mdash;in fact they cropped up like weeds after a thunderstorm ...  The first Reichstag election on this basis destroyed&mdash;for ever&mdash;the coalition that had done such good work at Weimar.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That good work was to restore law and order in broken and defeated Germany, to resist the attempt of the Spartacists to institute a Communist régime, and as against Communism to establish a democratic republic.  All that good work was destroyed as a result of the fact that the Germans were so greatly idealistic that they included P.R. in the Constitution of the Republic. Spiecker then concludes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As time went by it became increasingly difficult to form effective coalitions in the Reichstag and it soon happened that no reasonable majority could be mustered at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To these accounts of how German democracy became the easy prey of Hitler, I should like to add the judgment of perhaps the wiliest, and, certainly, the luckiest German politician of that era, von Papen, twice German Chancellor, the precursor of Hitler and himself a Vice-Chancellor in Hitler's régime.  Referring to the difficulties which beset the new German Republic von Papen tells us in his memoirs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was also the problem, both in the Federal Government and the States, of a highly artificial electoral law and a serious lack of coordination between the Central Government and that of Prussia&mdash; the largest individual State.  Amendments, to the Constitution could only be made with the approval of a two-thirds majority, which, given <Col N="2155" /> the distribution of the Parties, meant that no fundamental change was possible.  The terms of the Constitution became a serious source of conflict between the Left and the Right wing Parties.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I was particularly opposed to the list system of voting.  It was praised as the most democratic in the world.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde contradicts that.  He says ours is; on the other hand, Deputy McGilligan says ours is the worst.  The German system, however, according to von Papen, was praised as the most democratic in the world. Von Papen continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Not a single vote was wasted or without effect.  In point of fact, it corrupted the very basis of a healthy democracy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>After describing how the system worked out in practice, he gives the final verdict in these words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The consequent splintering of representation amounted to the suicide of democracy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may be contended that the system of election which has been thus condemned was not quite the same as that which is in force here.  That is true.  But it does not differ from it in essential principle.  It does differ from it in the degree to which the principle of proportionality is applied. However, if P.R. is a good thing at all, it should be good all through, and the more largely, and the more exhaustively you apply it, the better should be the result.  Nevertheless, in Germany, von Papen declared that it led to a splintering of representation which amounted to the suicide of democracy.  Whatever von Papen may have said and others have said about the system of P.R. which obtained in Germany, in the view of the Opposition, or at least of some of the leaders of it, the German system was a better system than ours, even though it did, as von Papen says, corrupt the very basis of democracy.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, for instance, must hold that it is better, fairer, juster than ours, because he has told us that our system of P.R., the one he is now calling for, is &ldquo;the worst <Col N="2156" /> possible system&rdquo;.  Deputy Dillon must hold the same view, since he has declared that our system, which again he is fighting for, is a &ldquo;debauched&rdquo; system.</P>

Deputy Booth has already told the Dáil how Mussolini was called to take over the Government of Italy, when, due to the disintegrating effect of P.R., parliamentary government broke down in that country, because no Party or group of Parties could be certain for any reasonable time of a majority in the Chamber of Deputies.  The startling fact, however, about the events of 1919 and the events which took place over that period from 1919, when P.R. was first introduced, until 1922 is how rapidly the development from democracy to a dictatorship took place.</P>
      <P>The first P.R. election was held in 1919.  On October 29th, 1922, Mussolini, following the breakdown, due to P.R., of the Italian parliamentary system, took over; and next day his Blackshirts were out on the streets of Rome bludgeoning any and every citizen who dared utter the word &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>But even when the proposal to provide for P.R. in the Italian Constitution was being debated, the disastrous, disintegrating effect of it upon parliamentary government was foreseen and the consequences which would inevitably flow from it were foretold in extraordinarily percipient words by an Italian Deputy.  Opposing P.R. he asked:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What is the function of P.R.?  It consists in ... creating an elected Assembly, in which the forces of the different Parties are distributed in the same proportion in which they exist in the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2157" />&ldquo;But that, gentlemen, is absurd. Parliament is confused with the nation.  The nation, gentlemen, has continuity of existence; it has permanence ... Parliament has a duration of five years.  In this short time it must carry out a programme and support a Government or replace it.  Its purpose and action cannot be accomplished without a majority.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now, what is the result of P.R.?  To create not a majority, but a collection of minorities, often incompatible with one another, with ideas which are mutually contradictory.... The nature of the minorities which we get with this system of P.R. excluded the possibility of a Coalition in Parliament, whereas, the passion for power's sake, which is so strong among the Latin peoples, leads to paralysis and destruction....</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The application of this system under present conditions would lead to a very bad functioning of the Chamber, would make it impossible to form a lasting Cabinet, and would bring about in the long run a paralysis of public life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How disastrously Deputy Alessio's prophecy was fulfilled is told by another Italian, this time an historian, who writing of this period records that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While the forces which were to destroy democratic institutions in Italy were being massed and organised, the Chamber of Deputies was discrediting itself with inconclusive battles of words and trivial acts of violence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have had the battles of words but we have not yet had acts of violence in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The quotation continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It finally reached a point where it was unable to create a Cabinet that was worthy of anything but contempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Decidedly, a disease was undermining the Italian political constitution&mdash;a <Col N="2158" /> parliamentary paralysis.  And outside Parliament there was another disease at work&mdash;civil war.  Either Parliament must recover its powers and put an end to the civil war, or Parliamentary institutions would break down in Italy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps because men had forgotten how fatally P.R. had eased Mussolini's path to power, or perhaps because some foreign politicians wanted it in some country other than their own, but wanted to have it in Italy, so that Italian Governments would be always precarious, proportionality again is a feature of Italian electoral law.  Once again it has manifested itself as a disunifying disintegrating force.</P>
    <P>Not even the wisdom and states-manships of De Gasperi could prevail against it.  In an attempt to secure some stability in the Chamber and to find a firm foundation for an Italian Government, he introduced the Electoral Reform Bill in 1953.  That Bill was passed in the Italian Chamber of Deputies early in that year and became law on the 31st March of that year.  It provided, among other things, that Parties would be permitted to form electoral alliances and that any Party or group of Parties obtaining 50.01 per cent. of total votes would automatically receive 380 of the 590 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Government was dissolved in June, 1953, and four Parties, namely, the Christian Democrats, Republicans, Democratic Socialists and Liberals combined to form a single democratic front against Togliatti's Communists and his fellow-travelling Socialists. At the subsequent election they polled 49.7 per cent. of the votes and had a majority of 16 in the Chamber but did not qualify for bonus seats.</P>
    <P>De Gasperi who had been Prime Minister of Italy from the end of the war, and who had given a certain degree of political stability to the country, formed the first 1953 postelection Cabinet.  Because of a split in the Parties, it only lived for 12 days.</P>
    <P>The next Government was headed by Pella.  It was formed on the 17th August, 1953, and remained in office for less than six months and fell on the 5th January 1954.  Then <Col N="2159" /> Fanfanni who, at the moment happens to be Prime Minister again, formed his first Cabinet on the 18th January, 1954, which lasted less than a month. He was succeeded by Scelba who was able to form a Cabinet in February; and, wonderful to relate, it lasted throughout that year.</P>
    <P>Following the general election which was held in May last, Fanfanni again became Prime Minister as head of a Coalition Government.  Unfortunately for the economic and social wellbeing of the Italian people this Coalition Government is already tottering. Defeated last week in a fiscal matter, it had to seek a vote of confidence, which on last Sunday it secured by the narrow margin of eight votes in a Chamber of almost 600 Deputies.  Its position, therefore, it will be admitted, is extremely precarious.</P>
    <P>It would be almost a miracle, however, if it were otherwise.  For elected by P.R. the Italian Chamber, consisting of 596 Deputies, contains at least ten Parties, ranging in strength from three to 273.  The largest of these is the Christian Democratic Party with 273 seats, next is the Communist Party with 140, and third, the fellow-travelling Italian Socialist Party which has 84 seats.  In addition, however, to the Parties which succeeded in electing more than one candidate, almost 20 other Parties put up candidates for election.  Between them they secured one seat.</P>
    <P>How can representative government survive, let alone be respectable with such a system?</P>
    <P>And yet Deputy McGilligan, let me repeat, prefers it to ours, which he says is the worst that could be devised, and so also we may prognosticate does Deputy Dillon, who proclaimed that ours is a debauched system.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that people will say the Italians are not Irish people, that they are not English people and are not British people and do not behave as we do.  They are a people who have accomplished great things in their history.  They are a people, the descendants of the Roman people, who established their own well-administered system of government over the greater portion of the then known <Col N="2160" /> world.  It is not that the Italians are not capable of governing themselves, but it is that the Italians have given, to themselves a system of parliamentary election which creates instability and makes government impossible.

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised at the figures given by the Minister for Finance.  I presume he believed what he said but as a practical farmer, who bought a farm 21 years ago and had to buy everything for it at the time, I know very well that not alone has everything increased in cost by three times since that period, but the price of practically everything has increased six, seven or eight times since 1938, when I first became the owner of my own land.  The Minister for Finance said that in 1939 the price paid for milk was 6d. per gallon and to-day it is 1/6.  He did not think that wages had increased threefold in that period, or that any industry was now getting three times the price it got in 1939 for its products. I am well acquainted with prices all down the years, because I had to do the buying and purchasing of everything for the farm and for the household as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take wages, which are a very important factor, for a start.  In 1939 the indoor wage for a farm worker was 12/- a week.  To-day a farmer would be very lucky if he could get a workman at £4, which is seven times the cost in 1939.  Rates in County Cork at that time were 10/- in the £; to-day they are 37/- in the £, and we shall be lucky if, in the coming year, we can <Col N="2162" /> hold them at 40/- which is four times what they were in 1938.  Then there was the price of farm implements. Manure forks cost 2/6; to-day they are in the region of 20/- to 24/-, some eight times the cost.  A hayfork was 2/6 and to-day it is 15/-, six times the price.  Milk buckets were 2/6 and to-day they are £1, which is eight times the price.  Machinery generally is four times the price.  Clothes and boots are four times the price.  I know it because, as I said, I had to do all the buying and selling.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that while he had every sympathy for the dairy farmer there were other aspects to be considered.  He agreed that there was an undoubted increase in the cost of living, but it did not hit the farmer so much as the people in the towns. He did not think the farmers' costs had increased very much in the last few years.  I think the figures I have given are sufficient proof that farming costs have increased out of all proportion to the income they are receiving at present.  If they did receive 6d. a gallon in 1939 they would be entitled to 2/- a gallon to-day, because of the increased cost of production which is the general trend.</P>
    <P>I know it would cost a tremendous amount of money for the Government to subsidise too much better from this country.  The Minister has stated that it would cost £1,200,000 to give even an increase of one penny.  Last year the Minister reduced the price of milk by one penny and where did that penny go since?  The fact remains that every other section of the community received an increase since then in their allowance.  To start with the civil servants got £1,000,000.  This week the teachers are getting £400,000 &mdash;a 6 per cent. increase in their salaries.  Local authority workers, clerical workers and road workers all got an increase from 6 per cent. to 10 per cent. to cover the increased cost of living.  Now the Minister says that the increased cost of living does not lie so hard on the farmers.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that the increased cost is just as heavy on the farming community as it is on many other sections, especially in these times because young people will not stay on <Col N="2163" /> the land unless they are provided with as good clothes, as good boots and as reasonable a standard of living as their counterparts who go to the city or town.  The time has come when the young people will not stay on the land to milk the cows unless they get a reasonable standard or a reasonable wage.  It was very different 30 years ago when the farmer rarely say the City of Cork or the City of Dublin. Now the young men travel in cars and the cost of petrol, clothes, amusements, food and everything else is hitting the rural community, and the youth, just as severely as it is hitting people in the towns.  They will not stay there unless they get more consideration than they are getting at present.</P>
    <P>The money was found for other things and I know it can be found to give some inducement to the dairy farmer to maintain his herd.  If he does not get it I know what will happen.  I know that the young boys and girls will not stay in rural Ireland for the drudgery in dairy farming.  They will leave the countryside and the country will be all the poorer because there will be nobody there to milk the cows.  When this <Col N="2164" /> country becomes short of dairy cattle&mdash;which is the very foundation stone of the whole economy&mdash;we shall have a sorry table to tell in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I could go on quoting Dr. Lucey and various men in high places who realise the necessity for doing something for dairy farming, but I have not the time at my disposal.  However, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the decision very carefully and seriously before the rot sets in too deeply.  It has set in, in the reduction which has taken place in the amount of milk and butter which is being produced.  That will be far more serious in future and I hope the Minister for Agriculture who is with us here to-day will see fit to make some statement on the matter, so that dairy farmers may go about their business and feel happy that they have some support.</P>

      <P>November 22nd, 1944. The headlines are &ldquo;Defence Pact with Britain After War: Essential to Security&mdash;General Mulcahy.&rdquo;  The quotation is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The advisability of entering into a defensive military agreement with Britain was stressed by General Mulcahy, T.D., Leader of the Party, at the Fine Gael Árd-Fheis, which opened at the Mansion House, Dublin, yesterday.  He asked the Party to consider, in the months that lay <Col N="2167" /> immediately ahead, whether such a step was not the key to national security, unity and prosperity.  The question, he added, must be approached from the point of view of leading the national thought of all Parties along the road which the nation must travel if they were to be true to their tradition in a world which might have to struggle for freedom, or if, in a dangerous world, the Irish people were to become strong and happy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further down in the same paper, General Mulcahy is reported as having said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A necessary preliminary to entry into any world combination for military security should be discussions and decisions with Britain for mutual defence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>General Mulcahy, again speaking at a Fine Gael Árd-Fheis, is reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Wednesday, 6th February, 1946, as expressing these views:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Experience must convince them, General Mulcahy said, that Ireland's political liberties, military security and hope of ending Partition were firmly bound up with membership of the British Commonwealth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are the references to which I referred last night.  Those statements have been published in the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  The Deputy's memory must be very much in error because in 1944 the Fine Gael Party got out a special pamphlet on the same issue of mutual security pacts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That as the Taoiseach, in continuing to hold the post of controlling director of the Irish Press Ltd. While acting as Taoiseach, holds a position which could reasonably be regarded as interfering or being incompatible with the full and proper discharge by him of the duties of his office and further as he has not considered it necessary to indicate the position to the House, Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that he has rendered a serious disservice to the principle of integrity in parliamentary government and derogated from the dignity and respect due to his rank and office as Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess that when I first learned that the Taoiseach, while act, ing as Taoiseach, also continued to act in his capacity as controlling director of the Irish Press Ltd.  I was both shocked and surprised.  Most of us understand the position of Deputies who come into this House and take up office of one kind or another.  We are not elected here as members of a vocational assembly.  We are elected in our capacity as independent individuals and it is our function, as Deputies, to try to represent as far as we can the cross-section of opinion which sends us here, rather than continue any adherence to outside personal loyalties, business loyalties or professional loyalties.  This is not a vocational assembly and we have, therefore, a responsibility to act as impartially as possible and independently <Col N="2170" /> as possible in deciding the issues that come before us from time to time.</P>
    <P>Now, if that is true of Deputies, it is clearly even more true of those who take up office of one kind or another, be it Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Minister or, above all, Taoiseach. There can be no question as to the ideal at which one should aim.  Above all, and beyond all, the Taoiseach must quite clearly be in a position to act in a completely impartial judicial capacity in relation to the many difficult and complicated matters which come before him from time to time, both as Leader of the House and as Leader of the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>In relation to the latter category, it is important that his position should be clearly understood.  In the Cabinet, he is faced with conflicting loyalties and different points of view.  Ministers are trying, each in his own Department, to win advantages, possibly at the expense of another Department, and, ultimately, perhaps, at the expense of the country generally. There are the conflicting demands of the different interests&mdash; large industrial vested interests of one kind or another, professional interests, trade union interests, workers' interests and State pensioners' interests.  The Taoiseach must, in his capacity as Taoiseach, be above and outside all these groups.  When he gives a decision, he must be in a position to demonstrate fully and clearly that not only has justice been done but that justice appears to be done.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that everybody knew about the Taoiseach's associations, that everybody knew that the Taoiseach continued to hold these posts in the Irish Press newspapers, that it was common knowledge.  I think it is true that it was common knowledge that the Taoiseach acted as controlling director of the Irish Press newspapers, but what was not common knowledge&mdash;certainly, I was not aware of it until very recently&mdash; was that he did not adopt the usual practice in this type of case of either resigning or asking for leave of absence without pay from these posts, while acting in his capacity as Taoiseach.  That was the general <Col N="2171" /> principle that most of us assumed he had accepted and was acting upon.</P>
    <P>I believe that the principle has been reasonably clearly established here by precedent, with the exception of the Taoiseach's particular behaviour, that a Cabinet Minister does resign or in some way or other divests himself of outside responsibility, on taking office as Minister.</P>
    <P>There is the general consideration of the very considerable responsibilities of the Taoiseach and the necessity for him to be utterly independent of any outside capacity in all these matters.  There is the other very important consideration that this group of newspapers is a chain of national newspapers which has become a very important and very influential industry.  It comprises the three papers, <i>Evening Press, Irish Press</i>, and <i>Sunday Press</i>, all of which have a very considerable circulation and are extremely prosperous as far as one can see, in so far as they have expanded over the years.  Because of that, it is not as if this job were a sinecure or as if the Taoiseach were in a position to delegate his responsibilities and allow his full time to be taken up with his responsibilities as Taoiseach.  This post of controlling director is, as I have shown, a post of very wide responsibility, involving very important functions and very considerable powers.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is morally bound, as far as we know, to discharge these very considerable responsibilities to this group of newspapers.  He is morally bound to the shareholders in these newspapers and to his other directors in these newspapers to discharge these functions fully, to the best of his ability and capacity, and, on the other hand, he is morally bound to discharge his functions here as Taoiseach, that is, as the Leader of the Government, Leader of the House and the person responsible for defining national policy from time to time, foreign policy and so on, and all the other responsibilities that have to be discharged by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, even if you leave aside the first point I raised, that the second point, the question of no man physically or intellectually being competent to do it completely <Col N="2172" /> efficiently, must recommend itself to anybody who gives this matter objective consideration.</P>
    <P>While he is the controlling director of a very large commercial concern that is attempting to make a profit and to expand its business, with responsibilities to shareholders and to the employees of these newspapers, I cannot see how any man could at the same time discharge the other multifarious responsibilities of a person upon whom the people conferred the great honour of Taoiseach and the great responsibility of Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Taoiseach was ill-advised to have established this precedent. It is one which has very dangerous possibilities, perhaps not even with him in the present position he holds, but it is a precedent which could be very seriously misused in the future in certain circumstances.  The Taoiseach was wrong in holding these two posts at one time, in leaving himself open to the charge: &ldquo;Whom are you working for; are you working for the <i>Irish Press</i> or are you working for the Irish People?&rdquo; That is a reasonable question that he must be asked and that he must be in a position to answer.  He has weakened his position very much in the country, and must weaken it very much, in putting himself in the invidious position in which that becomes a fair and reasonable question.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach is quite happy in his mind, as he appears to be, that this is a perfectly permissible practice on the part of the Taoiseach or a Minister, I think it is wrong of him to have&mdash;well&mdash;failed to disclose&mdash; that is the way I put it.  I believe it goes further than that; it amounts to concealing the fact.  As far as I have been concerned, at any rate, it was concealed.  However, I leave it at &ldquo;failing to disclose&rdquo;&mdash;to this House that while acting as Taoiseach, he was at the same time controlling director of these three newspapers.</P>
    <P>I have on a number of occasions asked questions in the House in order to try to find out what the particular position was.  There have been other people in the past who have also asked questions in regard to this matter and, to the best of my ability, I have tried <Col N="2173" /> to establish the principle which has guided the several Taoisigh in their decisions as to what is the wisest thing to do in the particular set of circumstances where the Minister or intending Taoiseach holds other posts, company directorships and such, prior to taking up office.  Such questions were asked in 1947, 1948, 1951 and 1957 and they all took much the same pattern:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Taoiseach whether any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary was, on his appointment as such, connected with any public or private company or business interest, and, if so, if he will state the name, style or description of the company or interest involved and the capacity in which such Minister or Parliamentary Secretary was connected with it, and whether he is still so connected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the gist of most of the questions which have been asked.  I do not want to weary the House with long quotations from questions which have been asked.  I shall try to refer merely to the relevant section of the question because some of them are very long.  The Taoiseach, I have no doubt, will be in a position to refute it, if I am in any way misquoting, which I do not propose to do, of course.</P>
    <P>On 11th December, 1947&mdash;Volume 109, column 722 of the Official Report, Deputy Cogan asked the Taoiseach:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...does the Taoiseach not realise that there is a definite restriction established by custom on Ministers taking active part in business concerns and does he not think that the same restriction should apply to Parliamentary Secretaries?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not know what the Deputy means by &lsquo;custom&rsquo;.  We are just as strict here as, for instance, in Britain.  Here no member of the Government or Parliamentary Secretary holds a company directorship carrying remuneration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the fairly consistent answer of <Col N="2174" /> the Taoiseach on occasions on which I have since asked similar questions. That is the straight answer to the particular question.</P>
    <P>There was a question as to whether farmers should divest themselves of their farms.  I think that it was agreed amongst both sides that it would be unreasonable to expect a farmer to do that, but, outside that, I think the general principle in that answer was &ldquo;No company directorship carrying remuneration&rdquo;.  That was the point raised by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The next question on the matter was asked in March, 1948.  In column 157 Deputy Cogan asked the then Taoiseach if it was the intention of the Government to see that every Minister and Parliamentary Secretary would refrain while in office from active participation in any business or profession for reward.  Deputy Costello, who was then Taoiseach replied at some length, but wound up:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In particular the rule is being observed and will be observed that a member of the Government or a Parliamentary Secretary should not hold a company directorship.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a significant difference between those two answers.  Deputy Costello's answer was that they should not hold a company directorship. Deputy de Valera's, the Taoiseach's, answer was that they should not hold a company directorship carrying remuneration. That seems to be a very important question.</P>
    <P>In March, 1948, the then Deputy Lemass asked:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Will the Taoiseach express a view as to whether he thinks it proper that a member of the Government should act as a committee man of a trade union having business with Government Departments?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was rather anxious at the thought that a Minister should hold any job other than his job as Minister or that he would be a trade union official. While I do not want to attach more to the statement of Deputy Lemass than is actually in it he could reasonably be said to disapprove of that suggestion. I am just mentioning that.  The <Col N="2175" /> main point is that the difference between the two Governments is that one will permit company directorships not carrying remuneration and the other will not allow company directorships at all.  The present Opposition would not allow a Minister to hold a company directorship at all.</P>
    <P>Another question was asked by Deputy Flanagan in 1957 when the question of whether a person should get leave of absence without remuneration came up.  The then Taoiseach reiterated the point about company directorships carrying remuneration and said that there was no Minister holding a company directorship which carried remuneration.  I asked another question on the 24th April, 1957.  This question was asked in order to elicit the position concerning the holding of a directorship by any of the members of the Government.  I shall be obliged to read it at some length because it does cover the whole question.  It was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Taoiseach whether any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary was, on his appointment as such, connected with any public or private company or business interest, and, if so, if he will state the name, style or description of the company or interest involved and the capacity in which such Minister or Parliamentary Secretary was connected with it, and whether he is so connected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the general principle underlying the subject of this question and its application, I would refer the Deputy to the replies given to similar questions in this House by me on the 11th December, 1947, and the 19th July, 1951, and by the then Taoiseach on the 9th March, 1948.</P>
    <P>The general principle, the observance of which is what concerns the Dáil and the public in this matter, is that no Minister or Parliamentary Secretary should engage in any activities whatsoever that could reasonably be regarded as interfering, or being incompatible, with the full and proper discharge by him of the <Col N="2176" /> duties of his office&mdash;for example, acting in a position such as a company directorship carrying remuneration. I might mention, for the information of the Dáil, that the new Government, at one of their first meetings&mdash;on the 28th ultimo&mdash; formally decided that the principle would apply to their members and to the Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>
    <P>As happened on the occasion of the change of administration that took place in June, 1951, most of the Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries who, immediately before their recent entry upon office, held positions that would conflict with the principle I have just mentioned have already complied with the principle, by resignation or by being given leave of absence without remuneration.  In the remaining few cases in which full compliance was not immediately practicable, steps are being taken to comply with the principle as soon as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A further question on the 5th June, 1957, elicited the same response.  In a supplementary question on the 24th April, I asked for further information and the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These are private affairs of Ministers&mdash;what they have been doing before they became Ministers. It is what they do as Ministers that matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My question had asked what connection the Ministers at that time had with business and whether they were still connected with business; if they had resigned from such businesses, companies or concerns, I had better read the question:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Taoiseach whether all the Ministers in the present Government who, on taking up office, were either directors of, or had any other controlling or business association with any exporting company or corporation or any manufacturing business or other industrial or shipping concern, have resigned from such businesses, companies or concerns.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The answer, I suggest, was an evasive one in so far as I was not given to <Col N="2177" /> understand whether the Taoiseach had given up his position as controlling director of this particular concern&mdash; the Irish Press, Limited.</P>
    <P>In a further question on the 12th March, 1958, I asked the Taoiseach:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If members of the Government who held directorships or had controlling interests in firms with which they were connected immediately prior to taking up their posts as members of the Government have resigned such directorships or divested themselves of such interests.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first part of the reply is the usual and says that no Minister holds any position that could be reasonably regarded as interfering, or being incompatible, with the full and proper discharge by him of the duties of his office.  The answer then goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is, perhaps, right that I should add, however, that, as the culmination of work which was begun by a Minister over two years ago&mdash;that is, about a year before his entry upon office as a Minister&mdash;a certain private company was formed and recently registered.  In the articles of association of that company, the Minister was named as one of the first directors.  He has, however, resigned from that position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prima facie</i> it looks as if the Taoiseach adheres to the general position that no Minister will hold the post of Taoiseach and at the same time hold a company directorship carrying remuneration.  That is different from Deputy Costello's point that Ministers should not hold any company directorships at all.  The Taoiseach appears to me to have parted to some extent from his general principle here when he explained why a particular Minister held a directorship in a private company and why it was difficult for him to rid himself of that directorship but that he was making all possible speed in getting rid of that directorship.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that the Taoiseach would like to adopt two different standards of behaviour for Ministers and for the Taoiseach.  One position is that he himself can adhere to this <Col N="2178" /> very important Jekyll and Hyde existence as Taoiseach and controlling director of a chain of national newspapers and on the other hand, as far as his own colleagues are concerned, it is desirable for them to rid themselves of their directorships or ask for leave of absence without remuneration.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach why he did not adopt this course in his own case.  Why did he not decide to ask for leave of absence without remuneration or resign his controlling directorships temporarily upon taking over the position of Taoiseach?  If he believes it is permissible for him to retain these very important posts, then surely the same principle must apply to his colleagues? I should like to ask him further whether his colleagues exonerate themselves from any charges that might be made against them here by refusing to take remuneration during their period of office.  Is that so?  Have all his Ministers resigned their directorships?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; it was the general principle with which I was concerned.  If it applies to all his Cabinet, I should be interested to know whether he applies it to himself.  Does he exclude himself from that general principle?  I think it is important to show that in raising these points we are not being irresponsible, captious or anxious to create difficulties for the Taoiseach in any kind of thoughtless or precipitate way.  We have been moved by an examination of the responsibility of the Taoiseach as controlling director.  We know his position as Taoiseach.  There is not a more responsible position in the country. There is not an individual with wider powers and functions or with a greater burden of work, if he does this work conscientiously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to find out whether it is compatible with his position as Taoiseach to hold these controlling directorships, I think it is necessary to examine the articles of association.  It is quite obvious that there are directorships, <Col N="2179" /> sleeping partnerships, where there is little or no work to be done by a director, in which case, although I would object to it, I suppose a case could be made for a Taoiseach or Minister holding directorships which involved only attending the annual general meeting once a year and that being the end of his responsibilities and functions, but that is not so in this case, unless the articles of association are wrong.</P>
    <P>The functions of a controlling direc-to are these: &ldquo;The controlling director shall have sole and absolute control of the public and political policy of the company and of the editorial management thereof and of all newspapers, pamphlets or other writings which may be from time to time owned, published, circulated or printed by the said company.&rdquo;  That is a fair responsibility in itself, it seems to me. It goes on to say that he may &ldquo;appoint and at his discretion, remove or suspend all editors, sub-editors, reporters, writers, contributors of news and information and all such other persons as may be employed in or connected with the editorial department and may determine their duties and fix their salaries or emoluments.  Subject to the powers of the controlling director the directors may appoint and at their discretion remove or suspend managers, editors&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not know if anybody has wider powers than those in any business concern. The controlling director has absolute and sole control of public and political policy and editorial management. I understand that this is the second largest chain of newspapers in this country.  It consists of a daily newspaper with a very considerable circulation; and evening newspaper and a Sunday newspaper also.  They are very widely read.</P>
    <P>The position of Taoiseach implies practically everything that any one of us could conceive of trying to do in our lifetime.  While acting as Taoiseach, with all its responsibilities and acting as controlling director of three newspapers&mdash;a very important commercial concern&mdash;it seems to me that it would be impossible to do this job well. <Col N="2180" /> Either one or the other must suffer.  I think the Taoiseach has placed himself in a very false and serious position in allowing it to be suggested that he has either furthered the interests of the people and the Government at the expense of the shareholders of the Irish Press, Limited, or has furthered its interests and prosperity and the expansion of the Irish Press, Limited, at the expense of the national wellbeing.</P>
    <P>If you look at it, you can see on one side, a fairly prosperous continually expanding and widely read chain of newspapers with an increasing circulation and, on the other hand, you have a position of almost national bankruptcy and social decadence of one kind or another, with emigration, unemployment and all the things we talk about from time to time and which are equally the responsibility of the Taoiseach in determining national policy.</P>
    <P>And so it seems to me that either the Taoiseach has devoted too much of his time to this expanding industry, this commercial project, Irish Press Ltd., consisting of one daily paper, an evening paper and a Sunday paper or too little of his time, in which case the shareholders would have a grievance. If he is responsible as controlling director for the prosperity of that newspaper, then he does leave himself open to the charge that he has neglected the national wellbeing, the welfare of our people in order to create the prosperity of a commercial enterprise, which, no matter how important it may be to him, is not as important as the welfare of our people as a whole.</P>
    <P>If he is not responsible for that prosperity and for creating that expansion of those newspapers, then whoever is responsible is a competent person to leave in charge of those newspapers when he takes over the position of Taoiseach.  He could have no worries that anything would happen in his absence.</P>
    <P>On this question of company directorships carrying remuneration, I think the Taoiseach attaches rather to much importance to those two words &ldquo;carrying remuneration&rdquo;.  I myself believe it was a device used by the Taoiseach, to obfuscate or mislead us <Col N="2181" /> here in the Dáil and the public generally, on this question of whether he or his colleagues hold directorships. His remuneration as controlling director is £250 a year, a negligible sum, I am certain, to the Taoiseach. In refusing that sum, as I assume he has refused it, because he gave us his word that he has refused, I think everybody must agree that is no sacrifice, in the circumstances of the particular case and the position of the man concerned.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that £250 a year is not a remuneration one would get as pay for running a chain of national newspapers.  Publicity and propaganda, the ability to put one's view across, are the life-blood of a politician and there is no money&mdash;£250 or £250,000 &mdash;which would pay for the position which the Taoiseach enjoys as a controlling director of a chain of national newspapers and as a politician.  He must think we are very native, very ingenuous, if he thinks he can fob us off with this simulation, with this hairsplitting, on the question of whether he does or does not take his £250 a year.  If one is allowed to continue as controlling director of an evening newspaper a Sunday newspaper and a daily national newspaper, as a politician, one does not need any remuneration after that.  Therefore, I think there is no real substance in those two words &ldquo;carrying remuneration&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is clear there are much more important considerations involved in being a Prime Minister of Taoiseach, head of a Government and a company director, particularly a company director who controls the activities of three vast newspapers.  He is remunerated by having his speeches reported at great length; his photograph appears on page one, page three or page five&mdash;everything he does from the time he gets up in the morning till the time he goes to bed at night, everything he says here, every time he leaves the country or returns to the country&mdash;all this is reported and, of course, that is the essence of a politician's existence&mdash;his ability to make contact with the community as a whole, and the people as a whole, and maintain contact with the people <Col N="2182" /> and the community as a whole, so I do not attach much importance to that particular point.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one serious matter which arises out of an answer I received from the Taoiseach to a parliamentary question.  I asked a question concerning the duty on newsprint and the Taoiseach's answer is given at column 576 of Volume 171, of the Official Report, of 12th November. I asked a supplementary question:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the very close personal and financial interest which the Taoiseach has as controlling director....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The answer the Taoiseach gave me was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have no financial interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that is a very important matter. It is possible for him to say he gets no remuneration.  I think it is quite unimportant whether he gets remuneration or not.  As I say, he is making a mountain out of a molehill in that regard.  I think these words were put in to allow him to carry on as controlling director and change a general principle established by the Opposition or maintained by the Opposition, if you like, or a principle which the Opposition had observed.  I do not think it had any other purpose at all.</P>
    <P>On the question of whether the Taoiseach has or has not any financial interest in this concern, the Irish Press, Limited, clearly he has a personal interest in so far as the fact that so many key positions in the newspapers are held by members of his own family on the personnel side cannot be denied.  On the question of financial interest, we must turn again to the articles of association.  On page 23, we find:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The first controlling director shall be Eamon de Valera who is hereby appointed such controlling director and who shall hold in his own name shares of the company of the nominal value of £500.  He shall continue to hold the said office of controlling director so long as he shall hold the said sum of £500 <Col N="2183" /> nominal value of the shares or stock of the company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not the Taoiseach is still controlling director of the Irish Press newspapers, but I am assuming he is.  If he were not, he would have stopped me long ago.  If he is still controlling director, he either has £500&mdash;quite a large block of shares &mdash;in this enterprise or he has not.  If he has not, then it seems to me that he is breaking the articles of association and infringing company law or else he has £500 worth of shares, in which case it seems to me that he has quite a substantial financial interest in these three Irish Press, Limited, newspapers.  If he has, it was, to say the least of it, grossly improper of him and misleading for him to say that he had no financial interest in those newspapers. It is on matters such as this that one has to judge people in high positions such as that held by the Taoiseach, and also his attitude to this magnificent parliamentary institution&mdash;one of the greatest barriers against autocracy and the development of autocratic government we probably have.  It can continue to survive only so long as we can be absolutely certain that the highest standards of integrity and honesty are observed by the members of the Dáil and, of course, above all, by the Taoiseach.  I think it must be conceded that the Taoiseach has, in fact, a financial interest in this concern. It is quite a sizeable financial interest and he has not rid himself of his financial interest since taking over as Taoiseach.  I think it is very improper indeed for a person in his position to continue to retain this financial interest in his circumstances of being Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>If this is all as I have put it, and I assume it is, the Taoiseach has placed himself in a position which must lead to serious embarrassment.  He has the very wide responsibility and function to supervise, control and direct the Irish Press Ltd., this big commercial concern, on the one hand, and to act as Taoiseach, on the other.  He is faced with responsibilities in the Cabinet of considering many matters from time to time on which I think he would be in a very much stronger position to arbitrate, were he a completely <Col N="2184" /> independent person with no ties whatsoever with industry or commerce.</P>
    <P>In the very near future, there will be a review and a redrafting of legislation relating to company laws, trading practices of one kind or another. These are very important and very complicated matters on which the Taoiseach should be able to sit back, as I said in the beginning, in a judicial capacity to try to weigh up the interests of the company, business men, industrialists, on the one hand and the consumer, the ordinary man in the street, on the other.  He should not be a judge in his own case; he should not have allowed himself to be placed in the position where he is a judge in his own case, thus contravening one of the first principles of simple justice.</P>
    <P>He is also, as Taoiseach, a person who should try to be objective about all the questions arising out of trading and commerce, business concerns of one kind or another, trading practices concerning rings, <i>cartels,</i> price agreements and arrangements of one kind or another.  His own company, presumably, must from time to time be faced with such agreements and arrangements with other companies. He has the question of pools and lotteries to consider which also are matters of very great import to him, particularly in his Sunday newspapers. He has to consider the question of the imported Press.</P>
    <P>There is the question of whether or not the Government's attitude to the imported Press is motivated in its attempt to tax imported papers and periodicals of one kind or another by any personal interest.  I may say that some of these imported papers are excellent and their distribution should be encouraged in this country rather than restricted.  Or, on the other hand, some of the printed matter imported is just rubbish that should be taxed out of existence.  The general principle that arises is whether the newspaper-owner or the Taoiseach is deciding on the question of whether these papers should be penalised, whether their admission into the country should be penalised and obstructed.  Is it that, from a national point of view, you do not like these imported papers or <Col N="2185" /> that, from a business point of view, you do not like their competition? Whose interests are you deciding and how are we to know if you do not divest yourself of your responsibility as a newspaper controlling director, or whatever the title is?</P>
    <P>There is then the question of the settlement of strikes and trade disputes of one kind or another.  It seems to me invidious that a person in the Taoiseach's position should be the controlling director and possibly at loggerheads with one or more of his employees and should have to try to arbitrate and decide on hiring and firing editors, sub-editors&mdash;journalists and employees of one kind or another. I suggest it is very wrong that a Taoiseach should retain these powers in respect of a commercial concern, while being Taoiseach, that he does derogate considerably from his very high office in putting himself in such a position.</P>
    <P>I shall not refer to it at any great length but I might stress &ldquo;The controlling director shall have sole and absolute control of the public and political policy of the company....&rdquo; in relation to the extraordinary method followed, particularly by the Sunday newspapers, in which a series of articles have from time to time been pervading this newspaper glorifying the gun.  Then, when the young lads accept that glorification of the gun of politics, of whatever you like to call it, they are locked up.</P>

      <P>The attitude of the young people to-day is that we are fighting the R.U.C. and the British military in the Six Counties.  I believe that, were I in the Taoiseach's position, with control of a newspaper, my endeavour would be to try to break <Col N="2187" /> with that period and to encourage in every way young men to look towards this House as the fountain head of Parliament in which they might achieve their objectives, the reunification of our country.  I feel that these other sad pages in our history&mdash;which I am not denigrating in any way&mdash; should, for the time being, be left to the historians to decide on their merits.</P>
      <P>I think that the Taoiseach could have helped to a very considerable extent if he had been able to orientate young men's minds in that direction. I think he would have helped himself and removed many of his very worrying and frustrating problems because I have no doubt that they do cause him worry and frustration. However, many of his worries, I think, are of his own making.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of taxation. We had a recommendation by a number of people in relation to the newspaper industry.  This is a very considerable industry.  There are the three national papers, the evening papers and the three Sunday papers; then there are the provincial newspapers, probably one of the most important factors in helping to retain some life in rural Ireland.  All these newspapers have varying functions including the employment of journalists, editorial staff, typographical workers, and so on.  Then there is the vast background of the distributive trade which is involved in the circulation of newspapers. The position in relation to this vast industry is that it finds itself in a certain amount of financial difficulty, and some of the newspapers are in greater difficulty than others.  The journalists' union have asked that a taxation of 5 per cent. be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach is himself a very important and influential part owner of a chain of newspapers.  We all have our own personal, private associations and loyalties before we take up our positions in office.  The Taoiseach has his in his newspapers and he could not cease to be a newspaper proprietor no matter how hard he tried.  He has now left himself in the position of having to try to arbitrate on this very important question concerning this large industry. <Col N="2188" /> He might even be open to misrepresentation if, having been the owner of a newspaper and given leave of absence on assuming the office of Taoiseach, he tried to arbitrate in this manner.  It could be said he was interested only in his own newspapers.  However, as Taoiseach it would be his duty to come to a decision and say: &ldquo;I have taken this decision in the interests of the community and I do not care what anybody says.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has put himself in the very unpleasant position, as controlling director of three Irish newspapers, of having to arbitrate on a question in which he has both a personal and a financial interest.  I think it was very wrong and foolish of him to put himself in that position.  He is a businessman and presumably he is in business for what he can get out of it.  I am not suggesting it is money, but there are more ways than one of killing a cat.  I believe he must promote his enterprise to the best of his ability. That is what he was appointed and paid to do.</P>
    <P>He has competitors in business and a number of those competitors are in a relatively weak state from the commercial point of view.  There is a number of newspapers in danger of going out of business.  Is there not a very great temptation there for a person in the Taoiseach's powerful position?  In arbitrating on this taxation question he can make the final decision and say: &ldquo;We shall remove this duty and in that way allow these papers to survive.&rdquo;  It may make all the difference between their survival and their going out of business.</P>
    <P>It would be ethical for the Taoiseach as a businessman to try to get these people out of business and allow his daily and evening papers to scoop up what was left after the competitors had crashed out of business.  As far as I can understand it would be legitimate commercial practice to put the opponents out of business, but to use his position as Taoiseach to do so is grossly improper.  It is difficult for him to escape the suggestion that that is what he must do if he is to honour his responsibility to his shareholders, the people who employ him as controlling director.  &ldquo;Get rid of your <Col N="2189" /> competition.&rdquo;  That is the essence of private enterprise, &ldquo;Increase dividends to shareholders and increase the circulation of your newspapers.&rdquo;  That is his moral responsibility to those people.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration. Some of these competitors are distinctly unfriendly and hostile to the Taoiseach.  What a magnificent position it is in which to find himself! These are people who harry and criticise him.  They do not accept the dogma of infallibility about the Taoiseach that so many seem to accept; they reserve their right in our democracy to criticise him and they criticise him as they see fit.</P>
    <P>What is to prevent the Taoiseach's saying: &ldquo;This is the simplest way out of my dilemma.  These people are in financial straits.  I can tighten the knot.  I can drain the life-blood of these hostile newspapers.  I can end this undesirable criticism of myself and have the continued unadulterated adulation of my own editors and correspondents.  They will dominate the minds of our people and I shall continue to rule unworried by legitimate criticism.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Assuming he believes he can keep on these two posts at the same time, many politicians would say he was justified in getting rid of his opposition in that way.  As politicians, most of us believe that the essence of truth and right lies with us, and I am sure the Taoiseach is no exception.  Is it not feasible that he could use his position to rid himself of this hectoring opposition from these newspapers?</P>
    <P>I think that is one legitimate criticism and a legitimate analysis of the very foolish position in which the Taoiseach has put himself by his decision to retain his position as controlling director, and to retain the power these newspapers give him in our society.  He has power and advantages, on the one hand, but he must face the fact that he has created these very serious, complicated positions for himself, on the other hand. He has left himself open to what I believe is this perfectly legitimate criticism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2190" /> What if he decides that his own newspaper is hard up and could do with this concession?  Should he put himself in the position that he would decide, as a newspaper proprietor or a major executive in the newspaper business, or controlling director? Should he have taken the opportunity, on being made Taoiseach, to retain this position of controlling director, and so decide on this very important question in relation to his own financial position in the Irish Press Ltd., because he has the financial interest in making this decision?  Should he ever have left himself open to that suggestion? It is a legitimate suggestion that anybody would make, and were you here on the other side of the House, you would certainly make it about your opponents.</P>
    <P>Let us say there is a good case for this 5 per cent. reduction&mdash;I do not know whether there is or not&mdash;and say the Taoiseach decides that he has left himself open to this charge, that he has, as Taoiseach, put himself in a position where he can arbitrate on a matter which too closely and financially concerns himself, and say he decides to run away from it politically &mdash;surely that would be a very serious thing for him to do, if there is a just case for the remission of this taxation duty?  There are many people involved in this question, in the newspaper industry, and they should not be made the pawns of political decisions by the Taoiseach, be they wrong political decisions, or ill thought out political decisions of the Taoiseach.  If they have a legitimate grievance, if they demand for a remission of this taxation is permissible, is acceptable, and is badly needed to keep the greater part of this industry on its legs, then the Taoiseach has no alternative but to grant it, no matter what political consequences may arise for himself.  Those political consequences would not arise at all if he had acted as I understand so many of his colleagues have acted, in shedding their directorships, and in that way he would do the best he possibly can do to show that not only is justice being done but, as well, appears to be done.</P>
    <P>I think it is unfortunate, in many <Col N="2191" /> ways, that these questions are now being examined and considered in this atmosphere and I hope that the Taoiseach will bear that in mind.  If serious financial reverberations were to follow his failure to remit this taxation, I hope he will have the courage to take whatever is the just, correct, and right decision, no matter what the consequences may be to himself.</P>
    <P>As I say, I think that probably the most serious thing of all is that the Taoiseach, in holding on to this post of controlling director, has established a very dangerous and very undesirable precedent for the future, whatever he may or may not do as Taoiseach himself. He may do none of the things I have suggested at all, but, at the same time, he has created this precedent which will conceivably allow us to have part-time Taoisigh and part-time Ministers.  There could be the position where a barrister might decide to keep on part of his practice when he is Taoiseach, and the same could apply to a solicitor, or a shopkeeper or an industrialist, or a soldier, for instance. A military man might decide that he could stand to become Taoiseach, to become the Leader of a Government, and in that way wind up as a military dictator of one kind or another.  I suppose that is conceivable.</P>
    <P>Why not have a trade union leader as Taoiseach, keeping on his job as a trade union leader?  The Tánaiste referred to this earlier when I put supplementary questions to him.  He was concerned about the question of a trade union leader being a Minister, but, because of this precedent set up by the Taoiseach, there is no reason in the world why a trade union leader should not be Taoiseach and carry on with his responsibilities to his union.  Clearly, that would be grossly improper as a Taoiseach's responsibility is towards the mass of the people, and, therefore, he could not retain his trade union leadership and at the same time decide, in an independent way, or ostensibly independent way, on the complicated questions coming up for consideration before him.</P>
    <P>So it is I think that the Taoiseach has done a very grave disservice to the <Col N="2192" /> whole conception of our parliamentary democracy here by continuing to hold on to his two posts.  I do not think it matters very much, should such a post not be big, but this happens to be a big post and is not a nominal directorship. I think the general principle is a bad principle and the Taoiseach, above all people, should have been particularly conscious of his very grave and serious responsibility, as one of the major leaders in our society, to establish the principle that the Taoiseach has one loyalty, and that is to the people as a mass, as a whole, and cannot have a divided loyalty.  He cannot serve two masters.</P>
    <P>The point which will probably appeal most to the ordinary people is the fact that here now in this country we have never been in a time of greater national crisis.  There has never been a time when dynamic leadership was more needed, when a Taoiseach was needed who would have all the time in the world to devote himself to the very vast, considerable and worrying problems which he must have to face from day to day in his office&mdash;such problems as unemployment, emigration, and defective social services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I suggest that if the Taoiseach could divest himself of his very far-reaching responsibilities as controlling director of the Irish Press newspapers he would, in my opinion, have more time to give to his much greater responsibilities as Taoiseach. Whatever we can hope for from him in the line of dynamic leadership and originality in the solution of our problems, as a full time leader and a full time Taoiseach, it is quite clear he cannot give the people the time and required dedication for that work while he is acting in this dual capacity as a big businessman, the controller of a chain of newspapers, on the one hand, and Taoiseach on the other.</P>

      <P>As regards my being controlling director of the <i>Irish Press</i> there is no question of secrecy about it.  I have been that for 30 years, since the Irish Press Company was founded.  My name has appeared on the letterheads and on the official communications of the newspaper during these 30 years, and they have been distributed widespread throughout the whole country.  That I am controlling director has been known also to the members of the House over a considerable period. References to that fact have been made on many occasions here in the House.  I made my position clear in regard to the <i>Irish Press</i> back in the early days when I was president of the Executive Council.  My position as controlling director is a fiduciary one.  As such I was given all the powers that seemed necessary to enable me effectively to safeguard the interests of those who subscribed the capital, and the purposes for which the money was contributed and to be in a position effectively to prevent the newspaper's policy from going in a direction contrary to that for which it was founded.</P>
      <P>I have never received any pay, in office or out of office, or remuneration of any kind for anything I have done for the <i>Irish Press.</i>  Over the period in which I have been acting, I have not found at any time that my duties conflicted in any way with the full and proper exercise of my duties as Taoiseach. There is such a thing as delegation. It was never intended, when I was made controlling director, that I should do all the things I was given power to do.  I was one of a board. That board originally, and since, consisted of such businessmen as John Hughes, Lyle Stirling, T.P. Dowdall and J.C. Dowdall of Cork, and others who acted as directors without any payment whatever.  That had been the position of the directors for a long number of years, while the paper and the company were seeking to establish themselves.  A newspaper, as everybody who has read the history of newspapers knows, does not establish itself in a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These men were businessmen of proved capacity and they acted and <Col N="2194" /> controlled the paper through their board meetings from week to week. There were other people who continued to serve similarly for a considerable period such as Philip Pierce of Wexford; Stephen O'Mara of Limerick; and T.P. O'Mahony of Cork, and so on.  Therefore the business side of the newspaper was in competent hands, and it was not necessary for me always to be there.  I did act as chairman for some years before I became Taoiseach and later for a period when out of office, but when Taoiseach I refrained from going to board meetings and from dealing with the day-to-day conduct of the business.  I made it clear in this House that I was not responsible for the day-to-day conduct of the newspaper. I had to see that the work was properly delegated and I felt it was right that I should retain the reserve powers given me by the articles of association.</P>
    <P>Had it been necessary at any time to exercise any of these powers I would have been entitled to do so, but the suggestion that whilst I was Taoiseach I was part-time Taoiseach is not correct.  Neither is it true that I as director was paid on the 500 shares which a director has to hold.  The company has not distributed profits and the money was used for expansion so as to achieve the original idea of those who founded the newspaper, which was not merely to have a morning newspaper but also an evening newspaper and a Sunday newspaper.</P>
    <P>Profits have not been paid.  A sum of £250 a year was suggested as the remuneration which I was expected not to take as it was a trifle.  The profit that would come from 500 shares would be still less important.</P>
    <P>I have therefore discharged my duty both to the people who subscribed the money by retaining that ultimate power, and I have discharged my duties to the State by giving it my whole time.  It is true that if there was a very important development in the <i>Irish Press</i>, if there was some new departure, or, something of that kind. I would expect to be consulted and that if it was a departure which I considered wrong and not for the purpose for which the money was subscribed, I would intervene.  Fortunately <Col N="2195" /> it has not been necessary for me to do that because the conduct of the paper was in the hands of people who were competent to do the work properly.</P>
    <P>There is a story, which members of the House may know, of a certain French ruler who was distracted by his day-to-day problems.  He went out into the fields and saw a shepherd. This shepherd was running around because there was danger of wolves coming along.  He was distracted.  The ruler saw this shepherd trying to save his sheep and, despite the shepherd's efforts, the sheep were being mauled by the wolves.  The ruler said: &ldquo;There go I.&rdquo;  That is precisely my case.  The ruler later found a shepherd apparently taking things quietly and the ruler feared this shepherd was neglecting his business.  He abused the shepherd and said to him: &ldquo;Why are you behaving like this?  Look at your <Col N="2196" /> flock.  They are open to attack by the wolves.&rdquo;  As it happened, some wolves came.  But there were dogs there and the dogs sprang to the attack and tore the wolves to pieces. And the shepherd said to the ruler: &ldquo;See how it is done.  I take care that the dogs are well chosen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This shepherd was able to delegate to his dogs something that the other distracted shepherd was unable to do. By the delegation and reservation of these powers, I am quite satisfied that the interests of the shareholders, whose chief interest was to establish a newspaper which would meet requirements badly in need of being met at the time of its establishment, have been amply safeguarded.</P>
