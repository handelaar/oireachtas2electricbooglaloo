An interim report dealing with the milling and banking qualities of Irish wheat from the 1956 harvest has already been presented and printed copies will shortly be on sale.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the institute that they hope to be able to submit a further interim report, relating to the 1957 harvest, in the course of the next few months, and that when the wheat from the current year's harvest has been examined, a final report will be prepared.  It is not expected that this work will be completed for another year.  It is intended that the reports as they are received will be made available to the public.</P>

      <P>On 1st January, 1958, the surplus wheat amounted to approximately 117,000 tons.  On 28th June, 1958, the surplus remaining to be disposed of amounted to approximately 23,000 tons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be good enough to say how does he define &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; in that context?  Is it after allowing for a certain volume of carry-over, or who determines what is surplus and what is adequate carry-over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="5" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>When you make allowance for the estimated amount that will be necessary for manufacture into flour plus the normal carry-over, you deduct that from the total and get the surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that, on that definition, there are surpluses in the hands of practically every wheat-growing country in the world running into many millions of tons in the United States, Canada and Australia and considerable surpluses in many European countries and that in each case these are held and used as opportunity presents itself?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, that is what we have been doing too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be clear about this, Sir.  I understand that when wheat is determined in this country to be surplus, hereafter it is to be disposed of at whatever price it will fetch as animal feeding stuff or, in the alternative, supplied to biscuit factories at that price in order to enable them to compete on the home market. Surely there ought to be more precision in determining what is the surplus if that is the way in which it is to be disposed of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is complete precision in the manner in which the determination is made.  When the required amount is estimated for conversion into flour plus the carry-over, be it 40,000 or 50,000 tons, it is then a very simple matter to discover what the surplus is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided the Minister accepts the proposition that it is quite unjustifiable to marry two harvests. You may have a harvest in 1957 in which there is a surplus, as defined by the Minister, to be followed by a harvest in 1958 in which there will be a deficit.  If we hold the surplus wheat, as defined by the Minister, from the 1957 harvest it could easily be absorbed if the 1958 harvest did not come up to anticipation instead of being jettisoned on the terms fixed by the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of the carry-over determined is regarded as a <Col N="6" /> reasonable safety margin having regard to the estimated acreage that is under the crop this year.</P>

      <P>The Fishing Weir Operation (No. 2) Order, 1957, which authorises the operation without a free gap of the Thomond Weir, Limerick, also provides that of the fish entering the weir during the period from the 1st February in any year to the 19th July following there shall be released upstream not less than 18/25ths of such fish.  Outside such period all fish entering the weir must be released upstream after counting.</P>
      <P>The operation of the Thomond Weir in accordance with this Order is kept constantly under observation by the Limerick Board of Conservators and the position as to the maintenance of salmon stocks in the River Shannon generally is kept under review by the Fisheries Division of my Department. I am satisfied in consequence that 18/25ths of the fish entering Thomond Weir are duly released and that that measure of escapement is adequate for the maintenance of stocks in the river.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the closing of this gap is having a very adverse effect on the supply of salmon particularly on the upper reaches of the Shannon due to the fact, amongst others, that the fish cannot get down the river to the sea after spawning and also that the natural flow of the salmon up river is impeded by this contraption?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the House adjourned last week, I had occasion to express pleasure at the way the Estimate was received in general.  I should like to say again that most of the criticism was of a useful and constructive kind.  I shall deal, first of all, with some of the points made by Deputy Blowick.  He referred to the fact that the number of migrants moved from West to East and of those others moved within their own counties appear to have shown some decline.  Part of the reason for this was a cut in the Improvements Vote in the Estimates for 1957-58 and there was another reason in a particular district.  However, the prospects seem to be good.  We anticipate, if we have the means, that we can arrange for 100 migrations in the current year, which would bring the average for the past four years to cover that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hope to effect 520 rearrangements. The number carried out last year is a very good average on about eight years' operations.  Therefore, we have operated fairly satisfactorily in that respect.  I should make it clear that the hard core of rearrangements is coming upon us.  Naturally, the inspectors choose those areas where the most work can be done with the minimum of effort.  However, there are estates where conditions are more difficult, where agreement is more <Col N="12" /> difficult to secure.  There are a number of areas where agreement has been held up through the action of one or two people.  Like all Ministers for Lands, I would make an appeal to some people, who feel reluctant, to think over again their position and the offer that has been made to them in the hope that we can deal with some of these difficult cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick suggested that the problem of congestion and fragmentation in the West should be tackled by an all-out effort in the next four or five years.  He also suggested that we should purchase about 1,000 holdings for cash each year.  As the Deputy knows, under the Land Act which he passed, a direct cash purchase can be used only for migration or rearrangement.  That limits the application of the cash principle.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we have to be very careful in using cash for purchasing purposes. If we started to buy land in large quantities it might have the effect of inflating the price in the case of private sales.  I think every Deputy will agree that the use of large quantities of ready cash for a specific end in a limited period might have that effect.  As a result, the Land Commission might be severely criticised for interfering in the selling of land privately.  It could be undertaken only after very serious consideration.  I do not feel justified in upsetting the ordinary land market, much as I should like to finish off the 9,000 worst cases of unvested intermixed estates.</P>
    <P>Next, I should like to answer Deputy Dillon who, in speaking of the decision of the Land Commission to permit the letting of land for periods, issued a caveat against the dangers of reviving landlordism.  I do not think I need say very much except that we have no intention of reviving landlordism.  I made it clear in my opening speech that the Land Commission will prevent the acquisition of large amounts of land, particularly by persons speculating in land.  Permission to let will be given in such a way that there will be no possibility of recreating landlordism.</P>
    <P>The fact which we have to face and <Col N="13" /> which has been adverted to by Ministers for Lands in other Governments &mdash;it is no new discovery&mdash;is that, out of 12,000,000 acres of arable land, 750,000 acres are taken in conacre or on the 11 months' grazing system.  I do not think any Deputy proposes that the Land Commission should after its general rules in regard to land which it acquires compulsorily.</P>
    <P>We have a tradition of free sale and free use of land.  Some people might say that the Land Commission standards of adequate production and employment are very modest while others might say they are quite adequate.  I do not believe there is any demand anywhere for a radical change in the general rules under which land is acquired.  That means that a huge part of this 750,000 acres is let for convenience by persons, with the understanding of the Land Commission that there is a reason for it, and the land is not acquired compulsorily.  I am not saying all of the land is of that character.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission, with its limited funds, may, in certain areas, be unable to acquire lands which it otherwise would acquire.  I asked the Land Commission to tell me what the result would be if they had more money and if the Improvements Vote were increased&mdash;whether they could acquire more land.  The inspectors reported that they might, for a few years, be able to acquire about 25 per cent. more land under the prevailing regulations. That is all it would amount to.</P>
    <P>I was informed that the pool of badly-worked land is diminishing and for that we can be thankful.  Well-worked land gives employment. According to statistics, one man is employed in this country for every 100 acres and nearly three men on estates of over 200 acres.  There has been a tremendous emigration even of permanently employed agricultural workers.  We have to think of that side of the picture as well as of the relief of congestion.  That has been the view of successive Ministers for Lands over the past ten years.</P>
    <P>There exists this very large acreage of let land.  A typical instance would be a widow with a very young son who decides to let the land sometimes for <Col N="14" /> ten, 15 or 20 years.  We see the possibility of giving some chance to landless men who are ambitious to earn money to buy a farm, and who need to climb the farming ladder&mdash;an expression frequently used by farm organisations and by the late Senator Moylan. All we are doing is to enable that widow, for example, to let her land for five years, knowing that the fertility will be maintained, that a young man will have the chance of doing good work on the land and saving some money which he may use to purchase a farm.  Whatever he does, he will improve his position.</P>
    <P>This huge amount of land is let in a way that, so far as I know, is almost unique in Northern Europe.  Deputy Dillon can be assured that I, as Minister for Lands, will be advised by men who have years and years of experience on land acquisition and division and that, between the Land Commissioners and myself, and such other advice as I can get, this new experiment will be conducted without harmful results.  I can assure the Deputy that anything in the nature of recreating landlordism on a large scale will not take place as a result of this decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Land Commission propose to set holdings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It proposes to permit other persons to let land. Deputy Dillon also referred to an inquiry, which he believed was started under the last Government, into the possibility of the Land Commission letting land itself to young men.  No detailed examination of that suggestion was undertaken.  I think the decision to hold that inquiry was made late in October, 1956.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with the idea.  I find myself in a very difficult position when I try to propose measures to assist young men anxious to get land without extending the ambit of the present Land Commission's activities. That is why we propose this private letting of land as an experiment which may assist the solution of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody wants the general ambit of Land Commission work to extend.  I do not think anybody wants further interference with <Col N="15" /> land ownership to take place.  I think they recognise the limitations of Land Commission work; that the problem of congestion can never be solved by the Land Commission; that there will never be enough land; that all we can do is to acquire badly-worked land that comes within our competence and work towards ending extreme congestion in the West.</P>
    <P>My difficulty in dealing with this suggestion, that the Land Commission should let land, is that it would inevitably diminish the pool of land from which we attempt to settle this problem of extreme congestion.  In addition the method of selection involves difficulties.  It involves some sort of competition of a very definitely established kind.  The opportunity in the future may be given to me to study this problem further.  I myself would like to see a proportion of the Land Commission's land awarded to young men on some basis, but I find it very difficult to carry out that principle and at the same time end the extreme congestion in the West and to satisfy the traditional requirements of uneconomic landholders, and to alter the tradition of the Land Commission without causing dismay or discouragement on the part of those who will be deprived of their chance of getting land, when land is acquired adjacent to them.</P>
    <P>Since Deputies with different political origins, such as Deputy Moylan, when speaking in 1946 and Deputy Dillon, made proposals of this sort, and since the former Minister left on the records a sentiment of his own in regard to doing something for young people, and since the National Farmers' Association and Macra na Feirme have proposed an elaborate apprenticeship scheme, involving a great deal of administrative work, I shall examine the position again to see if some solution can be arrived at.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred again to the question of making land available to landless men and cottiers and I can only repeat what I said on the Estimate, that whatever disagreement I might have with previous Ministers for Lands on policy, and I have very <Col N="16" /> little, I agree with them on the general decision that to include landless men, sons of farmers and cottiers among those qualifying for land taken primarily for the relief of congestion, would simply add to our difficulties.  I know cases in some eastern counties where there would be 100 applicants for ten or 12 holdings and if you are to include all those classes the only common factor between them would be competence.  I think the competence would require the kind of examination that takes place in Holland, where conditions are very different, amounting almost to a competitive examination. I cannot see the possibility of carrying that out here and I believe it is right to keep the functions of the Land Commission largely for the relief of congestion and giving land to persons who have experience not only of working it but also of owning it, however small the amount of land may be.</P>
    <P>I may be considered conservative in that but having looked at the records of what happened when land was given during the experimental phase to landless men, I feel we are on a safer course and above all avoiding the difficulties attached to the allotment of land when a number of extra classes of persons have to be added to those comprising extreme congests in the West and local uneconomic landowners. I have every sympathy with those people who have, one way or another, acquired experience and then feel themselves deprived of land but as I said I see no possibility of enabling all those persons to be considered and it would make the work of the Land Commission extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>There were complaints about the delays in disposing land on hand from Deputy Carty, Deputy Hughes, Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Tierney.  I should like to make it clear again that the Land Commission are going to try and dispose of all arable lands in their hands by March, 1960, with the exception of holdings associated with complicated rearrangements and migrants, where delays are experienced for reasons well known to Deputies.  I hope thereafter there will be no undue delay in allocating land because it is inimicable <Col N="17" /> to good production, and above all, because people remain uncertain in regard to their chances of allotment.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the maintenance of Land Commission roads.  I think there again the Land Commission with the limited funds at their disposal, cannot be regarded as a road body except in the first instance where access is required to land they are preparing for disposal.  We have no organisation to maintain roads and it would be wrong for us to maintain roads once they have been built.  That is a matter for the local authorities and the Special Improvements Schemes Office, I would not like to see a triplication of functions with regard to roads.  We already have two authorities to deal with them and let us not have a third. Consultations do take place between the Land Commission and the local authorities regarding such matters if road sites may be required.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes complained of a number of holdings that had been let in his area subsequent to allotment.  I gave an analysis of several hundred holdings awarded since 1933.  About 13 per cent. of the land allotted was let. That figure can be considered in light of our prevailing system of land tenure not very good and not very bad.  So far as allocations during the last ten years are concerned I think that the record has been better and that that is due to the fact that the Land Commission quite obviously demand a higher standard of competence from those to whom they allot land.  As I indicated in my Estimate speech I am encouraging them to continue in that direction because while I do not think 13 per cent. is a disastrous percentage it is too high because of the very valuable gift made by taxpayers to allottees, an amount that is never paid in the annuity that is provided.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick and Deputy Carter asked for further information about relief for the Shannon area.  About £100,000 is being made available from the National Development Fund and a special corps of inspectors is being detailed to investigate all aspects and to prepare a specific scheme.  It is hoped to complete the scheme in the current year and next year.</P>

      <P>Deputy Carty referred to some unallotted holdings on the Kenny estate in Galway and said the houses were unsuitable.  My information is that the tenants who were to come into these holdings refused, not because of the particular style of the houses being erected, but also on more general grounds.  These lands are now being held because they may be required because of the Shannon floods.  That is why there is a delay in making the final allocation.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy reads the immensely long report, he will find some of the proposals involved the deepening of basins which might have other consequential effects.  We felt that whatever action was taken over the report, it would be so many years before it came into operation that something should be done to deal with this particular type of unique flooding, which only takes place on the stretch from Athlone to Meelick, rather than wait for the report which might be years and years.  The estimated cost runs into some tens of millions for carrying out the scheme, if it were adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay made what I think was an unjust attack on Deputy Doherty for his action in trying to straighten out a difficulty that arose in connection with co-tenants paying annuities.  I should like to say only that Deputy Lindsay must have misunderstood Deputy Doherty's motives in that.  We all of us, as Deputies, receive requests to straighten out receivable order difficulties from time to time.  I certainly receive a good number.  In trying to straighten out these difficulties, I think both Deputies and, in general, the tenants, are perfectly aware that it does not give the Deputy any legal right to interfere.  He is simply trying to straighten out some administrative difficulty that has arisen in the payment of annuities.  I am quite certain Deputy Doherty was not <Col N="20" /> trying to take unfair advantage of his position as a member of the Dáil to give the impression that he had overwhelming influence with the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe the action taken could be described as rigidly as that.  I do not believe Deputy Doherty had any intention of appearing to have excessive power in this matter.  Payment is effected by all sorts of persons on behalf of other persons without their being entitled to any legal right as to who is co-tenant, as to whether both tenants share joint annuities or must pay them together or any other circumstance.  I am just defending Deputy Doherty.  I do not think he had any sinister motive in trying to increase his reputation as a Deputy by appearing to be able to go into the Land Commission and, as it were, to swing the law around his head.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde referred to the extreme delay in dealing <Col N="21" /> with land given in Wexford.  That question is being dealt with at present. We hope to reduce the delay.</P>
      <P>Deputy Killilea expressed his objection to some of the work of the Land Commission in Galway.  The Land Commission divided twice the amount of land in County Galway in 1957 as compared with 1956, including a great deal left on its hands for a long time. The question of the non-acquisition of a very large bog can be considered by the Land Commission again.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde dealt with one question, namely, absentee owners.  He referred to an American owner of land who apparently lived away from the country for a long time.  I should say that in all the arduous work of the Land Commission in making decisions in acquisition cases, I do have tremendous sympathy with the Land Commission when they deal with absentee owners who so often say they will come back to retire and frequently it is a vaguely expressed sentiment which may never be fulfilled.  I think they must have tremendous difficulty, particularly in the West, in deciding whether to accept these promises or not.  I would say that sometimes their judgment may prove bad for no fault of their own simply because they take statements and decide: &ldquo;This fellow seems to be sincere when he says he will return within five or ten years when he has made his fortune abroad.&rdquo; But then circumstances change and the owners decide to remain abroad.  I have the greatest sympathy with the Land Commission.  From what I have seen and from the many files which I read in order to acquaint myself with how they operate, I think their judgment has proved remarkably fair in most cases.  But of all the decisions I would have to make if I were a Land Commissioner, I would find the most-difficult would be the acceptance or rejection of pleas by absentees that they will return to land from which they have been absent for a considerable number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the preservation of documents.  The importance of these documents is fully appreciated in the Land Commission and every possible care it taken of <Col N="22" /> them.  The documents are preserved in a special records branch of the Land Commission where they are fully indexed and filed in steel boxes which are kept in strongrooms.  I can assure the Deputy these documents are in good hands.  Occasionally, they are consulted by research students from the university, people claiming to be descendants of former estate owners and people interested in genealogy. That disposes of the humorous suggestion made that if the Land Commission were compelled to move their offices, nobody would ever be able to find the files again.  These historic documents are well cared for.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister, as a matter of interest, has he considered the desirability of getting the views of the National Librarian on the microfilming of this vast mass of material?  After all, we all know the documents are thought to be very safe in safes, but if they are destroyed, there is no remedy for it.  Microfilming would be the remedy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tierney has not been very long in the House, so I will not say very much about the fact that he was the only Deputy who questioned the independence of the Land Commission. I will simply say I feel sure that when Deputy Tierney has been long enough in the House, he will agree with the vast majority of the members that the Land Commission should have a judicial aspect.  As the late Deputy Seán Moylan said on the occasion of the debate in 1956, the heart of nearly every Minister for Lands has been broken because he never has been able to complete the task.  The task is impossible and there never will be enough land to solve the problem.  They would be more quickly broken if they were to have the direct control of land acquisition and land allocation.  When I look at the different personalities of previous Ministers for Lands and their different political viewpoints and their unanimity about this, I feel I am in very good company in saying I must <Col N="23" /> resist Deputy Tierney's suggestion that there should be direct political control of land acquisition and land allocation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say again that neither the order of acquisition nor acquisition itself will be altered by the formation of land leagues.  In any case, those land leagues consist largely of people other than those who would be likely to get the land, if it were acquired.  I should like to say also in that connection, that land leagues which agitate by putting up notices surrounding lands which have been well worked and the free sale of which is guaranteed under our traditions will serve no good purpose; they will prevent a private sale being effected to somebody who would give good employment in the district.  At the same time, they will not force the hands of the Land Commission.  Such events, I am glad to say, have become very rare with the passing of time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes made a fairly serious statement in regard to estates in Carlow. He mentioned in passing that an estate had been purchased by a foreigner.  I should make absolutely clear what I said before, that the Land Commission does not take account of the nationality of the owner of the land in carrying out its activities. Nationality is not mentioned in the Land Acts.  I should like to repeat that the attitude of this Government and the past Government in regard to the purchase of property by non-nationals was stated by the Taoiseach in Volume 164, column 937, of the Dáil Debates for 21st November, 1957.  I would ask Deputies who want to know the general attitude towards the purchase of property by non-nationals to read that very carefully devised statement, which made the position absolutely clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, in this estate in Carlow the nationality of the owner had no relation to the position.  The Land Commission can acquire land where production and employment seem to be inadequate.  In the case of these <Col N="24" /> estates, there has been up to now no evidence that production was inadequate. In fact, in the case of the estate of Brownshill, which was sold without the Land Commission intervening, there was satisfactory evidence that good amounts of fertilisers had been applied, since a report was made by the Land Commission in 1953; that there were 22 per cent. more cattle and 70 per cent. more sheep on the land than before and that good crops were harvested.  In the case of the large estate which was purchased, Oak Park, the statement was made by the purchasers that they intended to carry out a proper rotation as soon as they had cleaned the land by means of a tillage plan, that they were employing 57 persons and that, although they would only put cattle on the land in the autumn and winter to begin with, thereafter they would commence the raising of pedigree stock.</P>
    <P>In view of the past record of the new owner and in view of what had taken place, so far as the Land Commission could gather from inquiries about the management of the two estates, it would be impossible to acquire the estate on the ground that there was inadequate employment or inadequate production.  Since some members of the deputation referred to questioned the &ldquo;good husbandry&rdquo; of the estate, questioned as to whether the estate was conducted on the &ldquo;rules of husbandry&rdquo;, I should say that it is quite clearly stated in the Land Acts that the main consideration is &ldquo;employment and production&rdquo;.  I think the framers of the Land Acts were quite sensible in not using the words &ldquo;good husbandry&rdquo; in regard to the acquisition of land, as they would have made proceedings in the courts tremendously difficult, with agricultural experts on both sides trying to convince people as to whether or not land that might be producing adequately was being run according to the rules of good husbandry.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous amount of controversy on that subject.  As Deputies well know, there are good farmers who operate almost entirely without the use of farm manure and use artificial fertilisers.  Others would <Col N="25" /> say that that is detrimental to the land.  I should like to make it clear that the statement in the Land Acts refers to adequate production and employment. I should add that no reports have been received by the Land Commission in the last two years on the sale of large estates to foreigners.  I mention that because there has been agitation of a nebulous kind about foreigners buying up large acreages all over the country.  With the exception of this report, there have been no reports over two years that foreigners are buying estates.</P>
    <P>I should say also that we have far too many houses of not excessive size and in reasonably good condition, surrounded by 60 or 100 acres of demesne land, unoccupied, in this country. Many people who live in the same type of house give excellent employment.  I hope the Land Commission will be able to dispose of those houses in their possession and I hope that we can encourage people of the right kind to occupy those houses and to make use of the demesne land that is left around them, in order to increase production and give good employment. We have to bear that in mind in regard to the work of the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes, might I direct his attention to one aspect of the problem, that is, the sale of these houses?  Has he ever caused an inquiry to be made into the poor law valuation of these houses? If he does, he may find the key to his problem.  The rates having gone up from 7/- in the £ to £2 in the £, some of those houses have become unoccupiable, because the rent through rates upon them has become an unbearable burden.  Would the Minister look into that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,224,460 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including grants to local authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount which I have moved to be granted, together with that voted on account, involves an estimated expenditure from the Vote for Local Government in the present year of £3,734,460.  In the Book of Estimates, the net decrease on the Vote for the preceding year is given as £994,240, which is the difference between the net total of the present year's Estimate and the corresponding figure for 1957-58 as it appeared in the Book of Estimates for that year.  My predecessor, however, announced to the Dáil when moving the Estimates for last year that he proposed to reduce <Col N="27" /> it by a sum of £500,000, comprising £270,000 from the £2,000,000 provided in sub-head I (2) (housing grants) and £230,000 from the £400,000 provided in sub-head K (Works Act grants).</P>
    <P>The actual amount saved from the provision of £2,000,000 for housing grants in that year was, however, £473,327 10s., so that the total saving on the Vote for Local Government for 1957-58 was approximately £700,000. The net decrease in the Estimate for this year as compared with the amount spent last year is, therefore, really less than £300,000.  The only notable increases in particular sub-heads of the Vote are a sum of £10,000 in sub-head I (1)&mdash;contributions towards housing loan charges of local authorities&mdash;and a sum of £50,000 in sub-head L&mdash;contributions towards loan charges of local authorities in respect of sanitary services works.</P>
    <P>There has been a continued fall over the last five years in the volume of local authority housing work in progress. A decrease in housing activity naturally results from the progress made with the satisfaction of housing needs and this, coupled with the hold up in 1956 of the commencement of new works, accounts for a drop of 33? per cent. in the number of houses in course of erection in 1956-57 as compared with the preceding year and a further drop of over 40 per cent. in 1957-58.</P>
    <P>The position at 31st March, 1958, was that the housing needs on which the post-war housing programme had been based were satisfied in full in 23 county health districts and 42 urban districts.  In 20 of the latter, the original estimates of needs were found to have been inflated, but the actual needs have been met in full.</P>
    <P>In areas where past needs have been met, programmes for current and future building are being formulated to meet new needs arising through family growth and the obsolescence of old houses.  All current housing projects which are shown to be required to meet specific needs and which are found to be properly planned are being sanctioned without delay and no project <Col N="28" /> is being held up for financial reasons.  The new schemes sanctioned during 1957-58 involve a total expenditure in that year, in the present year, and until their completion, of about £3,000,000.</P>
    <P>Now that the building programmes to meet arrears of housing needs are being completed, housing authorities will be expected to give more attention to the conservation of existing dwellings, whether provided by local authorities themselves or by private enterprise, and, side by side with that programme, to concentrate on the eradication of unfit dwellings which are incapable of being made fit at a reasonable cost.  I am, in particular, pressing for a more dynamic approach by local authorities, especially in the larger cities, to the elimination of slum dwellings.</P>
    <P>We are now at a turning point in the history of Irish housing.  When we look back over the years at the legislative, administrative and technical efforts that have been brought to bear upon the elimination of bad housing, at the financial sacrifices which both the community and the private individual have been required to make, we can readily see that our main duty now is to ensure that bad housing conditions will not be allowed to recur. We must aim to preserve the national housing stock, to secure the best possible use of it, and to improve and modernise it so as to keep pace with the unceasing demand for higher standards of comfort and amenity.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have some 130,000 dwellings let to tenants.  The capital value at current prices of these dwellings would exceed £100,000,000. Like all fixed assets, they require adequate management and maintenance. Repair costs have continued to rise with the result that the rents of dwellings contribute less than a quarter of the loan charges and other expenses payable by the local authorities in respect of them.  The taxpayers and ratepayers share the remaining three-quarters in roughly equal proportions.  The taxpayers will contribute in the current financial year more than £1,800,000 towards what is, in effect, a rent subsidy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> Of this amount, approximately £700,000 relates to dwellings provided prior to 1946.  With the ratepayers' contribution, the total rent subsidy from public funds comes this year to over £3,600,000, much of which relates to pre-1946 houses.  The justification for a rent subsidy for these houses on such a scale was fundamentally the relationship between rent and income.  Many local authorities have found, however, that in the vast majority of cases this relationship has changed beyond recognition and has ceased to be a justification for so large a subsidy benefiting a section only of the community.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities are also finding a new reluctance on the part of ratepayers and their representatives to pursue their housing programmes to completion in view of the prospect of this continuing subsidy being further increased.  Curtailing maintenance work to reduce the amount of the subsidy would be contrary to the interests both of the local authority and of the tenants.  These local authorities have accordingly found it necessary to revise the basic rents of the older dwellings which naturally are now the most expensive to keep in repair.  It seems inevitable that with present trends in costs and incomes other housing authorities will have to adopt a similar course.  These old rents can, of course, be adjusted in stages, where necessary, to avoid hardship and any general scheme for the purpose can also contain provisions for increases based on the capacity of the individual tenants to pay.</P>
    <P>The sum of £1,300,000 provided in sub-head I (2) is that estimated to be required for grants for new houses, reconstruction works and the provision of private water supplies and sewerage facilities being undertaken by private persons.  This shows a reduction of £700,000 as compared with the provision in last year's Estimate, but as I have already indicated, the real reduction as against actual expenditure under the same sub-head last year is £226,672 10s.  The reductions in the payments as against the Estimate for last year and in the Estimate for this year are due almost entirely to a falling-off in the numbers of applications received for new house grants.</P>

    <P>The present Estimate contains adequate provision to meet a demand for these grants during the present financial year equivalent to that of last year.  While there was evidence of a slight decline last year in the number of applications for reconstruction grants in rural areas to small farmers and agricultural labourers, the demand for repair and improvement grants under Section 12 of the 1954 Act, which relate mainly to urban areas, showed a corresponding increase.</P>
    <P>Up to the 31st March last the preliminary investigation of applications for grants under Section 12 of the 1954 Act was undertaken by local authorities. This system did not prove satisfactory and amending regulations were made by me in March last, providing for the full operation of the section by officers of my Department on the certificate of the local authority that the premises are suitable for repair or improvement.  It is hoped that the new arrangements will make for expedition in the examination of applications and for uniformity of treatment in assessing eligibility.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude this section of my review by stating the four main <Col N="31" /> objectives on which I propose to concentrate my attention on the constructional side of housing.  These objectives are: first, the eradication of the slums that still remain in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and elsewhere; second, the rehousing of the persons thereby displaced, preferably by the development of the cleared central city areas; third, the encouragement of the necessitous individuals who are still badly housed and who are not served by local authority housing to have new houses erected for themselves, and, fourth, the encouragement of reconstruction and repair of houses which can thereby be rendered suitable for occupation.  I have reviewed the statutory and financial facilities already available for attaining these objectives and legislative proposals which I am laying before the House contain provisions approved by the Government for giving increased financial assistance to private persons towards the improvement of unsatisfactory housing conditions.</P>
    <P>Progress continues to be made with the provision of water supplies and sewerage schemes and with the improvement and extension of existing installations.  On the 31st March last 52 water supply and 26 sewerage schemes were in progress, the aggregate capital cost involved being about £4,250,000.  During the year 1957-58 new loans sanctioned for sanitary services amounted to over £2,140,000.  Of these I might mention in particular a new regional waterworks scheme at Whitegate, County Cork, which will supply a number of small concentrations of population but which is intended primarily for the service of the oil refinery now under construction. The North Dublin main drainage scheme is now practically completed and is already in partial operation. The North Dublin regional water supply is also in operation in most of the areas to be served.  The Lough Mourne regional water supply scheme, County Donegal, is also well on the way towards completion.</P>
    <P>A recent survey has shown that, out of 416 towns with populations of 200 and over, 387 have piped water and 320 <Col N="32" /> have sewerage schemes.  The preparation of schemes for the remaining unserviced towns is proceeding, and, in addition, similar services have been provided or are in course of planning for a number of smaller towns and villages.  Many rural areas are supplied with water from large regional or sub-regional schemes and many more are, of course, supplied from local installations.  In the matter of local water supplies, county councils have been urged to take advantage of the rural electricity network which is being extended in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that sub-head I (2) includes provisions for grants under the Housing Acts to encourage and assist individual effort in the installation of private water supplies and sewerage facilities in individual houses.  During the last financial year such grants were allocated for 1,759 water supplies and for 955 sewerage installations in private dwellings.  The new Housing Bill contains provisions for increasing these grants and also for increases in new house grants where serviced houses are provided in an area not supplied with public sanitary services. I earnestly hope that these measures will have the effect of encouraging an increasing number of people in isolated rural dwellings to provide their homes with sanitary facilities.  Modern standards of public health, the need for eliminating domestic drudgery and the encouragement of holiday visitors to our rural areas as well as to our towns, all demand these sanitary improvements in rural houses.</P>
    <P>A survey of fire brigade services was carried out last year and reveals a steady improvement in the service, if one may judge from the figures regarding fire engines and other appliances maintained by fire brigade authorities. The total number of such engines, etc., at the 31st March, 1957, was 414 as against 29 in 1939.</P>
    <P>I now pass to the subject of Road Fund finances which is traditionally dealt with on this Estimate, although the Road Fund is, of course, an item separate from the Local Government Vote.  The revenue from motor taxation last year was considerably up on <Col N="33" /> that for the preceding year but this was chiefly because many vehicle owners deferred taxing their vehicles or took out only part-annual licences for 1957 before the beginning of the financial year 1957-58.  Taking this into account the estimate of revenue for the current financial year is £5,400,000. There are standing charges against this revenue amounting to approximately £600,000, made up of £186,000 for administrative expenses and £414,000 for loan charges.  With these burdens on the fund, the total annual allocation of grants to local authorities was kept at the same figure as the preceding year, namely, £5,000,000. Some time ago I had a circular letter issued to county councils advising them of my policy in regard to schemes of main road realignment.  My circular letter on the matter was intended to be laid before the elected members of the council so that it would be of assistance to them in connection with their considerations of road work schemes for the present financial year. As my intention did not seem to be clearly understood in some local offices, I subsequently sent out a specific direction that the terms of that letter be brought to the notice of the members of each county council.</P>
    <P>As far as may be practicable in respect of this year's road works schemes and as a fixed practice for future years, my intention is that the elected members of county councils will be given an opportunity of critically examining the more ambitious and expensive types of road improvement works proposed to be undertaken out of Road Fund grants and of directing, where agreement is not reached with the county engineer or the county manager, that the views of the elected body as to the magnitude of particular works or the propriety of undertaking alternative schemes be-referred to the Department for consideration by me before sanction issues to the schemes.  My own views as to the necessity for critical appraisal of schemes involving road diversion have been embodied in the circular letter.  I have informed the county councils that while realignment works can be justified to eliminate definitely ascertained traffic hazards or where expenditure on substantial road improvements would <Col N="34" /> be wasted if carried out on the old line of road, ambitious realignments not justified on such grounds are not warranted at the present time.  The circular letter also advised that, in present circumstances, substantial road-widening schemes should not be undertaken save where they were shown to be essential and urgent.</P>
    <P>I have had the pleasure of arranging for a further edition of the road safety booklet entitled <i>Rules of the Road.</i></P>
    <P>I am aware that many people consider that new legislation is needed to further the objective of road safety. Legislative proposals have been in course of preparation for a long time. Several Departments of State and various other interests are concerned in these proposals.  There were consultations with these interests by my predecessors. The greater part of the legislative proposals are for the purpose of consolidating and modernising existing provisions.  As regards any really new and radical proposals, I did not find full unanimity amongst the interests concerned.  Further consultations were, therefore, necessary and these have now been completed.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, to be soon in a position to make submissions on these matters for decision by the Government. I hope that the approved proposals will then be speedily available in the form of a Bill.  It would, however, be a mistake to assume that any legislation that I or any other Minister can promote will, of itself, achieve any automatic improvement in the conduct of road users or conduce towards a substantial diminution in road hazards. We must continue with the slow, but, I hope, ultimately effective, remedies of improving the roads, of signposting them with adequate injunctions and warnings and of inculcating caution and courtesy in the minds of road users by every means at our disposal.</P>
    <P>During the past year the total revenue expenditure of local authorities, excluding vocational education committees, committees of agriculture and harbour authorities, was approximately £51,600,000.  The corresponding figure for the present financial year has been estimated at £52,800,000.  These figures represent gross expenditure. Of the £52,800,000 the State will contribute <Col N="35" /> about £22,100,000.  Taking into account other sources of local revenue such as rents of local authority houses, the net amount falling on local rates will be approximately £20,700,000, which represents 39.2 per cent. of the total expenditure.  There are decreases in the rates struck by three county councils in the current year.  There is no change in the case of three other counties, while in the remaining 21, the rates struck show increases.  The average county rate is 36/7½d. as compared with 36/2 last year.  At 31st March last 97.7 per cent. of the collectors' warrants had been accounted for, compared with 97.5 per cent. for the previous year.  Deputies will realise the extent of the improvement represented by these figures if I recall to their notice that at the 31st March, 1939, only 77 per cent. of the warrant for the year 1938-39 had been collected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy O'Donnell, I move:</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>This Estimate deals with a number of matters which affect people in all walks of life.  Taking first the question of housing, we will have an opportunity later of considering the new Housing Bill and it will be possible to discuss the many problems connected with housing on that measure in greater detail than on this Estimate.  I think, however, that the figures which the Minister gave concerning the number of allocations for new housing grants are in themselves sufficient to indicate the very serious drop that has occurred in the building of houses over the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of allocations for 1955-56 was 6,095.  That had dropped in 1956-57 to 4,247 and for 1957-58 it was down to 2,504.  The decline in private house building has been even more marked in the Dublin City area where it fell by 50 per cent. between 1955-56 and 1956-57 and, again, substantially from a total of 647 to 452 houses in 1957-58.  On the other hand, the grants for repairs and reconstruction have remained fairly constant.  The year <Col N="36" /> 1956-57 was slightly up on the year 1955-56.  Last year, it was down somewhat.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give particulars in regard to the substantial decline in grants.  If it is due to the fact that the housing programme has been completed in a number of areas, then the explanation is reasonably satisfactory.  In other cases, it is obvious that certain areas of the country have sufficient houses and may have sufficient houses of a particular type.  In that connection, I would suggest that the Department should prepare detailed particulars of the number of houses of a particular category required in different districts.</P>
    <P>So far as I can gather from the Minister's introductory speech, a number of local authorities have already completed the post-war housing programme, on the basis of a survey made in 1947.  I understand that a more recent survey has been undertaken which involves a revision of the numbers which were regarded as necessary in certain cases and I should be glad if the Minister could furnish particulars of the local authorities' areas where further housing schemes are necessary.</P>
    <P>So far as the cities are concerned, rehousing is still a big problem.  Speaking of the problem in Dublin, it is obvious from views expressed in many quarters that building out on the fringe areas has reached the limit to which it is desirable to go.  In fact, most of the people who have been transferred to these areas would prefer if they could get accommodation in areas where they formerly resided, where clearance work has been undertaken, areas which are now available either for housing schemes or flats.  A variety of reasons influence people in that direction.  Their traditions and upbringing associate them with particular areas and when they are changed out of their environment, they lose the familiar conditions to which they have been long accustomed.  In addition, they have to bear the burden of the cost of getting to and from employment and in some cases of sending children to and from schools and, generally, the heavy transport charges entailed when people reside in these <Col N="37" /> fringe areas far from their places of employment.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that it is desirable national policy as well as good policy for the local authorities concerned to build as rapidly as possible in these cleared areas.  I understand that one of the problems in getting possession of sites has been the delay in getting title to the various properties, in many cases old properties that are no longer habitable, in many cases derelict for a number of years.  Because of outmoded legal procedures and the difficulty of establishing title, neither the local authority nor the interested parties can get possession of these sites that are, in many cases, if not already cleared, lying derelict.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Department of Local Government in collaboration with the Department of Justice should devise a simple procedure, or certainly a more simple procedure than that which obtains at present, in order to secure that these sites will be cleared quickly and that the facilities available for building either new houses or flats could be developed to the full.</P>
    <P>In that connection, when it is obvious that the housing drive has slowed down to a very considerable extent compared with a few years ago, I would urge that where local authorities submit schemes to the Department for sanction, the schemes should be considered expeditiously.  In the past, because of the backlog of work and because of the large number of local authorities submitting schemes at the same time, quite considerable delay occurred in many cases.  With the drop in the housing tempo in the case of both private enterprise and local authorities, the same number of schemes are not being submitted and it is therefore vital that schemes should be sanctioned quickly.</P>
    <P>In many cases, local authorities have now reduced their operations so much that, if there is delay between the completion of one scheme and the sanctioning of a new scheme, skilled personnel find that there is a gap between their employment on one scheme and the commencement of another and, in these circumstances, <Col N="38" /> are obliged to seek work in another district or, in many cases, to seek work abroad.  I would therefore urge that the Department should consider schemes as rapidly as possible when they are submitted so that sanction may be forthcoming in order to maintain an even tempo as far as possible.</P>
    <P>One of the advantages of the survey I refer to is that it ought to be possible to get over a period a general picture of what is required and at the same time to estimate the rate at which the number of houses required will be built. One of the biggest problems which confronted the whole building industry was the rapid tempo for a number of years&mdash;admittedly, it did not last long &mdash;and then the tampering off at a rapid pace.  Now the rate of progress is at a much lower level.  That involves serious problems for builders, local authorities and building workers, both skilled and unskilled.</P>
    <P>If it were possible to have a more accurate estimate of the rate of building which is expected and if, where possible, the Department sanctioned building in various districts on an agreed basis, the ups and downs which the building trade has experienced might be less severe and a more rational approach to the problem could be undertaken on the basis of what is required from the point of view of having houses built as quickly as possible and at the same time keeping in view the other objectives&mdash; stability of employment, continuity of work and the Department, in collaboration with the local authorities concerned, having a more accurate picture of the general progress of new houses by local authorities and private enterprise, although in the latter case it is not quite so easy to plan.</P>
    <P>Recently, because of the very severe rainfall, flooding problems have presented themselves.  While I appreciate that some of these problems are local, I should like to direct the attention of the Minister and the officers of his Department to the very serious problem which occurred in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  That matter was discussed briefly here recently on the Adjournment.  I appreciate that the Department, in collaboration <Col N="39" /> with the local authorities, is considering the problem.  I understand that the Dún Laoghaire Corporation and the Dublin County Council have submitted a joint scheme which will provide drainage for the whole of that area.  To those who have had experience of flooding over a number of years in that area it is obvious that a comprehensive drainage scheme is essential, that nothing less than a drainage scheme which will drain the entire area will be adequate to alleviate such flooding as has occurred. The technical problems involved in it should be considered as expeditiously as possible and sanction granted.</P>
    <P>This problem has recurred in that area with very unfortunate results on many occasions.  The heavy and protracted nature of the recent rainfall has caused flooding in some parts of this constituency where it never occurred before.  In other cases flooding has occurred on a far bigger scale than was ever experienced before.  In Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock, Stillorgan, Dundrum, Churchtown, Rathfarnham, throughout the whole constituency, but particularly in the places mentioned, floods rose to unprecedented heights and many householders were obliged to vacate their premises and, where possible, to salvage their furniture and property before it was damaged further.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I wish most strongly to urge not merely that the comprehensive drainage scheme which has been submitted by the local authorities concerned be considered and approved as soon as possible, but that pending the carrying out of that work, steps should be taken either under the Local Authorities (Works) Act or whatever other schemes are available, urban or rural as the case may be, to enable the local authorities concerned to carry out temporary measures by draining streams and rivers, by cleaning sewers and other pipes that are the responsibility of the local authority.  In some cases a few hours' rain is sufficient in those areas to give a flooding problem of a most serious nature.  In fact it is difficult for someone who has not seen <Col N="40" /> the extent of flooding in these districts to imagine how it is possible for such problems to arise in what would be normally regarded as a developed urban or semi-urban area.  To those who have experience of it, it requires no words of mine to stress the gravity of the problem or the importance of providing a remedy as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>The question of separate managers for the local authorities concerned in Dublin has been under consideration for some time.  I can speak only for the Dún Laoghaire Corporation and the Dublin County Council, but I gather from a report in to-day's paper of last night's meeting of the Dublin Corporation that the corporation also wishes to have a separate manager. This matter is one which should be dealt with on that basis.  It is impossible for an individual, no matter how many deputies he may have to do all the work involved, and it is in no sense a criticism of the efficiency of the city manager or his deputies to say that the members of these local authorities would all prefer&mdash;and I believe it is in the best interests of efficient administration&mdash;that separate managers would be appointed.</P>
    <P>You have separate managers for a variety of reasons, particularly because it is possible for a manager to give more time and attention to the problems of one local authority but also because the interests of the individual local authorities may conflict and the problems which some of them have to deal with are different from those of others.  It is therefore a matter on which there has been a unanimous expression of opinion that a separate manager should be approved for the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council, and that the manager who is acting for the Dún Laoghaire Corporation should be allowed to remain functioning as a separate manager.</P>
    <P>One of the matters which come within the responsibility of the Department of Local Government is the question of road safety laws and rules. The substantial increase in traffic has meant that the old legislation is now out of date, and I am glad to note that <Col N="41" /> it is proposed to issue shortly a new set of rules.  This is a matter about which people may have different views. Certainly anything that will lessen the number of deaths due to road accidents will be welcomed in all quarters of the House and by all shades of opinions.</P>
    <P>In that connection the Department of Local Government should review the whole question of road standards.  A great many people feel that some of the main roads are now too elaborate and that one of the consequences of the too-elaborate road system provided in some cases is to increase the speed at which vehicles travel and thereby to increase the risk both for other vehicle users as well as for pedestrains. I should be glad if any statistics are available which would indicate whether this view is correct or not.  As a road user I believe it is more difficult, particularly at night time, to drive on these long stretches of straight main roads than on roads that have some curves.  Furthermore the rate of expenditure and the cost of construction on the basis of the existing standards seem, in some cases at any rate, to be beyond the capacity and the needs of the country no matter how great the number of vehicles or how much traffic is likely to be put on the roads in future.  Undoubtedly at times of peak traffic these roads are fairly crowded with vehicles travelling both ways, but with the exception of peak periods the problem is nothing like as great, and for very long periods comparatively little traffic uses them.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Department should, in collaboration with the Department of Justice, use to the maximum the Garda patrols which have been effective in reducing the number of accidents and in getting greater respect for road regulations and rules.  On the other hand, the mere enactment of legislation or the passing of new sets of rules will not of themselves solve this problem.  No matter how restrictive or how comprehensive road or traffic regulations may be, they cannot provide a remedy, unless people are prepared, themselves, to endeavour to avoid the consequences of their acts, or unless the roads are made effective through the deterrent effects, such as <Col N="42" /> I have mentioned, of the Garda patrols. It is not possible to find a solution merely by changing the law or applying new rules.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from the large number of persons now using mechanically-propelled vehicles that the time has arrived when a driving test should be obligatory.  This is one of the few countries where a driving test is not obligatory.  With the very large increase in the number of vehicles, a driving test is surely desirable if not essential before people are allowed to take any form of mechanically-propelled vehicle on to the highway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister for Local Government to have an examination carried out in relation to the very severe and repeated flooding that has occurred in my constituency. In one of the northern districts, Balheary, the local people attribute the severe flooding to the opening of drains in County Meath, which is just above the border.  It is felt that, instead of starting the rivers at their base, they are opened and let into an adjoining county which is opening out to the sea.  The result is that, when very heavy rain comes, there is flooding.  It has been exceptionally severe in certain areas in North County Dublin, particularly at Balheary and Broadmeadow, in the past few years.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to examine the matter and deal with it so that people will not have to endure flooding of their homes and their property.  I suppose that, in County Dublin alone, thousands of pounds worth of damage has been done as a result of the abnormal flooding the week before last. It is very serious if rivers are opened in an adjoining county and then flow into an area where the rivers have not been cleaned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about that rivers which are dealt with under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I do not want to put any responsibility on the Minister which he has not got.  I am dealing only with that point. <Col N="43" /> Some rivers which, a few years ago, were opened under the Local Authorities (Works) Act have become closed again with weeds and dirt of every description.  That was another cause of flooding.  Where land is continuously flooded, and especially where people suffer losses, the people concerned should get consideration so far as their rates are concerned and they should get consideration in regard to rent from the Land Commission.  They are at a shocking loss and their crops are destroyed.  This has been happening time out of number.  Day after day, people are asking public representatives what they are doing to help in such matters.</P>
      <P>I should be grateful if the Minister would have an investigation carried out to see what he and the Dublin County Council can do in relation to flooding so that people will not be compelled to put up with such serious inconvenience and loss, time and time again.  Their homes are flooded.  Their furniture and effects are destroyed. Their crops are damaged or destroyed, not to speak of the grave hardship and inconvenience which must be endured as the result of flooding and of rivers not being cleaned.</P>
      <P>For a long time, I have been pressing for the extension of sewerage and water supplies to areas throughout County Dublin where there are big populations.  I come from Donabate, where there are a number of private sewerage and water schemes.  During the summer, I suppose that as many as 10,000 people are there.  We have no public sewerage and water schemes in that parish.  A few years ago, I got so many glowing promises from the Dublin County Council in relation to this matter that I thought that, before reaching home, the sewerage and water supply schemes would be in Donabate before me.  It seems like a fairy story now.  The same can be said about Rathcoole, Lusk, Newcastle and quite a number of popular areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just consider the position of Port-marnock on a summer Sunday evening when thousands of persons go there. I urge the Minister, in his own good time, to ask the Dublin County <Col N="44" /> Council why adequate and proper sewerage and water supply schemes are not provided in populous areas in the county.  When one asks them about the matter, they blame the Department of Local Government.  I take this opportunity of mentioning the matter publicly.  The time has long passed when we should at least have good drinking water.  That is essential for health.  Such schemes are essential in seaside areas where thousands of people are go on a Sunday evening, especially in fine weather.  Some of these people stay in various houses in the vicinity.</P>
    <P>A number of council cottages schemes in County Dublin are being prepared.  There is still a lot of overcrowding in the county.  In Cloughran, there are three families living in a small house.  In the past few weeks, the Minister sanctioned a very necessary scheme for Lucan and I thank him for it.  I would remind him that we have other areas in a very bad way so far as housing is concerned.  I want the Minister to try to expedite the sanction of any scheme which comes to him from the Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>There is another problem which I would like to deal with, that is, the refusal by Dublin County Council of loans to people who had already applied for them.  They are now turning these loans down because the ground rent of the housing site is more than £10.  The county council have made a by-law overnight regarding this matter.  I protest strongly about this overnight legislation which is causing utter confusion to the various applicants who have committed themselves to buying houses and to the contractors who, is good faith, have built houses and who thought that the applicants were entitled to loans.  It would have been all right if the Dublin County Council had given prior notice of their intention to make this by-law and if they had said that as and from a given date, nobody would get a loan except where the ground rent of the house was £10.</P>
    <P>During this recession period in the building trade, we expected that the <Col N="45" /> various county councils, and the Dublin County Council, would have endeavoured not to impede the progress of the housing drive.  Instead of that, overnight they have written to applicants and told them: &ldquo;You will get no loan when the ground rent of the house is £10.&rdquo;  Admittedly, taking the long term view, that may result in forcing down the ground rents, but I do not think it should have been done so quickly.  I do not think that any hardship should be inflicted on the people. It was an undiplomatic move on the part of the Dublin County Council, and if I may say so, a vicious move.  I have received a number of letters complaining about this.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to pursue this matter, but I suggest that the Minister has control over the Dublin County Council.  I know the has not made this ruling, and that he would not be associated with making it, but I am pointing out the difficulties which the Dublin County Council <Col N="46" /> have raised and the hardships which they are causing to a lot of people. While I have conveyed my own protest to the county council, I want to protest to the Minister and to emphasise that we feel very sore about it. It is an injustice to the people.</P>
      <P>Another point is that while other councils throughout the country gave full co-operation in respect of any Housing Act passed here, the Dublin County Council, again overnight, cut out the supplementary grants.  I would almost go as far as to ask the Minister to put in a commissioner and abolish county councils which do not carry out the spirit of the Acts, and try to introduce by-laws against the spirit of these Acts.  Nobody in this House wants to inflict hardship on any county council, or on the ratepayer, but a reasonable attitude should be adopted by the local authorities and their managers in matters of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency in County Dublin, I suppose there are about 7,000 or 8,000 people who have got the S.D.A. loans.  They got the loans from the Dublin County Council, the Dublin Corporation or building societies and insurance companies.  People of moderate means brought these houses and just when they were up to their necks in their purchase and could not withdraw, they were told: &ldquo;You will not get the supplementary grants.&rdquo;  I do not think that is fair.  It might have been fair if they had given prior notice to applicants that after a given date, they would not be given the supplementary grants.  Instead of that, they passed this retrospective by-law and the result is that a number of these unfortunate people now have a millstone around their necks and a number of them cannot carry on.  If the Minister cannot get co-operation and common understanding from the various county councils without making laws and having consultations with the officers of his Department to see that no hardship is inflicted by the by-laws which are made from time to time, then county councils who will not give that co-operation should not exist at all. The people would be very pleased to see such county councils abolished and <Col N="47" /> a commissioner, who would co-operate, put in.</P>
    <P>There is also the position in regard to the county councils which have encouraged repairs to houses and it is a pleasure to speak to Deputies on both sides of the Houses about this and to hear about repairs which have been carried out in their areas.  If a reconstruction grant is given in County Dublin, the Dublin County Council very grudgingly, under certain circumstances, gives 50 per cent. of the grant which the Department of Local Government will give.  Surely there is a lack of co-operation there again, because other county councils are able to do it.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of co-operation with the Department and with the spirit of the Act, which leaves it open to county councils to contribute the same amount as the Department of the Local Government will give, say, £100, £60 or £50 as the case may be, towards the reconstruction of a house or whatever it may be.  Taking it from the long term point of view, it will improve property in the area and increase the rates.  I want to say that I condemn that lack of co-operation with the Department of Local Government in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>We have another problem.  I do not know what to do about it.  I will not ask the Minister to give any decision, but in the interests of the people I represent I have to mention it.  We have the problem of the large number of tenants of S.D.A. loan houses who have to leave the houses when they go on full rates.  Even from the point of view of the most conservative ratepayer, is it good policy to be forcing so many tenants out when they are unable to pay the full amount?  Would it not be better policy to give them a longer period of remission?  One has to consider the great inconvenience caused when these people have to leave these houses when they have to meet the loans charges, ground rent and full rates, and also the fact that they have to be rehoused by the local authority. About three-quarters of my constituency is under the jurisdiction of Dublin Corporation, and I must say <Col N="48" /> the corporation have been very helpful in rehousing such people.</P>
    <P>Would it not pay the ratepayers and be a great relief to the rates to permit these people remain in their homes by extending the period beyond seven years?  As a public representative, I have to be as fair as I can to all sections of the people.  This is a problem which does not concern other constituencies as much as it concerns the constituency I have the honour to represent.  It has come up again and again during the last few years.  I have had appeals to secure an extension of the period of 12 years.  It is contended that, if they got 12 years, not so many people would be forced out.  It is also suggested they should be put on a sliding scale.  I just mention this as one of the problems brought to my notice.</P>
    <P>We have in County Dublin and in the City of Dublin a system of managers. We have a city manager and three or four assistant managers.  I want to refer to one of them, the assistant manager dealing with health services in the county.  His headquarters are at St. Kevin's.  I know the amount of work he has to do day in, day out.  There is not a day in the week &mdash;and sometimes at night, too&mdash;but he has to attend meetings of some kind or another.</P>

      <P>This Estimate touches <Col N="49" /> the lives of ordinary people in both town and country in a matter in which very few other Estimates do.  The change over of the provision of houses from private landlords to local authorities that has been so noticeable within the past 30 years and the fact that the Minister in charge of this Department is responsible for water, sewerage and roads would indicate that his Department comes in contact with many more people than any other Department whose Estimate comes before the House.  I suggest, therefore, it is of the utmost importance that public representatives should avail of this Estimate to discuss policy in general and, perhaps, in particular, grievances if they have any in their various areas.  I shall endeavour to keep my remarks based somewhat on the Minister's statement and try, as a public representative, to contribute suggestions along lines of constructive criticism, with a view to an improvement in administration as I see it and to offer to the Minister suggestions that have struck me during my years as a public representative.</P>
      <P>I notice the attention the Minister directed in his opening remarks to the fall in housing construction.  He indicated that in 23 county health districts post-war planning aims had been practically achieved.  That may be so; the drop-off is considerable.  It is understandable that there would be a drop-off as housing needs were satisfied but I wonder if the progress the Minister claims has been made?  I do not know the position in many counties but I do know the position in Waterford City where I am a member of the corporation. I know we heard it announced by the city managers there two years ago that, as and from that night, any man with a wife with two children in need of a house would have a house available.  Notwithstanding the repeated efforts of people like me, giving him the names of people with a wife and two or more children, this housing accommodation has not been made available, or if it was made available, it was not at a rent within the ability of the people to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware of housing needs in Waterford City where there are seven adults and six children all within one <Col N="50" /> room.  These housing needs have been drawn to the attention of the city manager and, whether by bad management or by his inability to provide housing, they have not been met.  Any time the Minister is interested in getting the particulars, they will be readily available to him.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister says that finance need not stop the building of houses where housing is needed.  I do not know.  In County Waterford, the housing survey showed a need of approximately 160 cottages.  This was about three years ago, before the present Minister was in office, under Deputy O'Donnell.  Notwithstanding that our medical officer of health examined each case individually and passed roughly 160 families as needing rural cottages, on a re-examination ordered by the then Minister, Deputy O'Donnell, the housing needs were cut to approximately 63 cottiers.  I suggest that that was done under compulsion.</P>
    <P>The very same medical officer who okayed 160 cottages as being needed now changed his opinion, with the help of the Departmental officials sent down specially to do so.  I should have preferred if the Minister had said at that time, honestly and straight: &ldquo;There is no money there; we cannot do it in view of the very bad situation we are in.&rdquo;  Then it would be clear; but to come along and re-survey and by a series of tricks deprive people of their right and take them off a housing list, is a scandalous performance.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that certainly, if it did not happen anywhere else, in the case of Waterford City, he should revert to that list of the 160, to continue the balance of those people then in need and still in need of housing, and if and when the money permits, give them the houses they badly need.  If, as he says, money is not the keypoint, let him do it now. In that way, he would win the respect of the local authorities.  I should like him to tackle housing in the same manner as the late Deputy T.J. Murphy, God be good to him, tackled it, in an honest attitude.  If he cannot provide for it, let him say out the reason and the people will not be impossible to deal with. <Col N="51" /> In Waterford at the present time, under the Minister, we have the stupid spectacle of the Department sending down and stating that the contract price for labourers' cottages is too high, when we in the local authority ourselves know that even by direct labour we could not build within £100 of some of the contract prices.  We have the sorry spectacle, where we want 60 houses built, of the total sanctioned by the Minister's Department being four.  Now we are told that the fencing costs of a cottage are too high and the Department suggests that we should either reduce the size of the fence or reduce the size of the ground on which the cottage is built.  In other words, we are now to be compelled, so that we can provide houses for the working class people, to reduce the acre of land to half an acre.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether any of the officials in the Department who make these suggestions realise what an in-between measure a half acre of land is.  It is too small to be any good and too big for the ordinary person.  If you do not want to till it, it is too big to take half an acre&mdash;one-eight would do; if you want to till, half an acre is useless. The Department ought to realise the needs of the working people and forget this economy drive.  It is on the essential needs of the people that the economies are being made.  Surely to goodness, if tenders are invited and contracts are taken in and recommended by the local authority officers and sent up to the Department here in Dublin for sanction, some more sensible explanation could be given than saying that a tender is too high?  That is presumably a way of refusing to sanction the provision of housing without saying there is a shortage of money or that the Department's policy is not to sanction.  The Department can keep on delaying it.  That is the story of Waterford County Council under two Ministers.</P>
    <P>In the urban council of Dungarvan, of which I am a member for the past three years, we have been trying to acquire a site of land.  We got an arbitrator in after about two years. He finally decided to come in and investigate it, and after about eight <Col N="52" /> months, he gave a decision as to the purchase price.  If it takes three years to get a plot of land for this purpose, surely it would take ten or 12 years to get the houses built?  Therefore, there are many ways of choking a dog besides chocking it with a pound of butter.  It is very easy to say that money is not going to stop building, if you can use all the other devices to stop it.  The Minister should not be fooled by the officers.  He should not just accept Department statements&mdash; that saturation point has been reached in every local authority area.  There is a serious need for housing in many areas of which I have knowledge and certainly in those two I mentioned.</P>
    <P>In the last housing survey in Dungarvan, at the meeting of the urban council we had something like 120 applicants for houses.  These were people who had not any houses, who were in one-roomed lodgings; some were in slum dwellings and some in dwellings, the rent of which it is absolutely impossible for them to afford.  I suggest that the Minister might be doing a very good action to himself and to the local authorities of Ireland if he took a leaf out of the book of the late Deputy T.J. Murphy, and personally visited the local authorities, talked with the local representatives and heard their problems at first-hand and undertook to investigate those problems.  In that way, he would win the respect of the local authorities and the gratitude of the people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I notice what the Minister says in connection with the conserving of old buildings, both private and local authority.  I welcome this attitude of the Minister's.  Many of us in local authorities have been pressing for this for a long time, that money spent in the reconstruction of old buildings, rather than pulling them down to build new ones, is a wise and good policy.  I suggest, however, that many of the standards expected by his Department are much too high, if that policy of preservation of old buildings is to meet with any success.  I believe that the standard of floor space required is too high.  I believe that the Department expects too much air space in respect of windows and doors.  It is much too <Col N="53" /> high a standard to expect.  Certain old buildings may not be up to present-day standards, but with a little money spent on them in the form of reconstruction they could be made reasonably sound jobs, where people with not too large families could live in comfort and in good sanitary conditions.  I suggest that the provision of laid-on water, sewerage arrangements, a good repair to the roof and certain internal repairs, is all that is necessary to qualify for a grant.  Sound houses should not be turned down because floor space or window space is not big enough, because of standards which it is impossible economically to carry out on reconstruction of old buildings.  I suggest that the Minister should get his Department to relax some of the conditions.</P>
    <P>I know the answer can be that it is a matter of the health of the public, that it is the new way.  I suggest to the Minister that he should read Dr. Saunders's reports on the poliomyelitis in Cork of two years ago.  He pointed out that the children of the people in the sanitary houses were the people who suffered, and not the people in the insanitary houses.  I suggest that some examination of the standard of the regulations that must be complied with to qualify for a grant should be made.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that roughly one-quarter of the amount repayable for loans of housing is recovered by way of rent and he states that three-quarters of it has to be provided by the taxpayers and ratepayers.  I have no doubt that is correct, but if one wishes to get a loan at present of £1,500 for a small dwelling over a 35 year period, one repays £1,000 plus the £1,500.  Somebody is making money, apart from the person who occupies the house.  I suggest the Minister has a real problem there and it will not be solved by simply doing what he advises, jacking up the rents.  That is what the Minister suggests when he says that local authorities would be well advised to consider increasing the rents in the case of older houses.</P>
    <P>Did it every strike the Minister that these houses may be already paid for by rent paid over the past 80 years, and that if these were on a purchase basis, they would have been bought <Col N="54" /> out?  Does the Minister not think that where a rural cottage or urban dwellings was built at a cost of £120 and where £200 or £300 has been paid back, he would be advocating a moral injustice by recommending that the present occupier, even though he and his forefathers enjoyed tenancy of the house, should have the rent increased? If that were my case, I would feel I had paid double or treble the value of the house and I would resent a manager saying that I should pay more to subsidise other people.  That, I suggest, is not the saving that should be made.  This matter will probably have to be tackled rather at Government level than by a Minister.</P>
    <P>While I can understand a certain amount of delay in regard to reconstruction grants, I feel it would be advisable if the Minister would have the payment of primary and secondary grants investigated, with a view to speeding up the process.  I have had a number of complaints in my area of what I think is unjustifiable delay in the inspectors calling.  It may be that there is a shortage of inspectors in that area.  I would also suggest&mdash;and in saying this I am not going into anything that is happening there&mdash;that the Minister should recommend to his inspectors that more individual attention be given to alleged repairs.  I shall not go further than that because of certain happenings in that connection.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that there is urgent need for a change in the Road Safety legislation, but no matter what is done in that regard, unless the road users co-operate in carrying out the legislation, very little will be achieved.  I suggest that in regard to the stop line at the end of all by-roads, if it is insisted that each car stop before moving on to the main road, it would be of great value in saving life.  On that subject, I might say that the pedestrains in cities and towns on whose behalf many of those regulations are made apparently ignore all the precautions.  Here in Dublin we have the pedestrian crossings where motorists must give pedestrians right of way, but I suggest that the jay-walkers who deliberately step off the side walk and cross over should be <Col N="55" /> equally subject to the law for risking their own lives and the lives of motorists.  Certainly, in England, where the Belisha beacon was introduced as it has now been introduced here, if a pedestrian attempts to cross at any point except the pedestrian crossing where he has the right to cross he is just as liable to prosecution as the motorist is in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Here the motorist appears to be public enemy Number 1, as far as the police are concerned.  If they cannot summon you for parking they will summon you for speeding, if they get a chance, and if you have an accident, it is better to pay the damages and leave the car to the other fellow and go home.  The police apparently think all motorists are public enemies and I am afraid every judge feels that he must decide the case against the motorist.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Before, I conclude, I want to draw the Minister's attention to a matter he mentioned in his speech.  I suggest that serious consideration be given by <Col N="56" /> the Minister's Department to the advisability of giving notice to all county councils that future rate collections should be carried out direct through the office.  It is a bit of a farce to find, say, in Waterford County Council, that it costs over £15,000 a year to collect the rates.  The E.S.B. does not have collectors in that sense; they have meter checkers.  If the E.S.B. can collect through the Dublin office or the sub-offices, and if the Land Commission can collect through banks or otherwise, I can see no reason why the rates could not be collected in some similar way.  It may be said that they have to be followed up and prosecutions instituted and so on.  That may be so, but if this system of bartering jobs&mdash;because that is what rate-collecting means to me&mdash;by political Parties on all sides and in all councils continues, I suggest the Minister should seriously think of taking power to himself to compel the local authorities to carry out rate collection through their own offices.</P>
    <P>The Minister is new to his office, but I believe he is sincere in what he is endeavouring to do.  I believe he will bring a fresh approach to his task.  I wish him well in the year to come, but I would advise him to rely on his own knowledge and experience, acquired while he was a member of a local authority.  He should see to it that the ordinary representatives have sufficient power and that they receive serious consideration by him when they appeal against decisions.  In that way, we can gradually restore the position of the local authorities to what it was in the old&mdash;and despised days&mdash;when public representatives really represented the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the decrease in building activity which is evident at present compared with some years ago.  I do not know whether I am right or wrong, but I am of opinion that the last survey of housing needs in this country was made a considerable time ago, and it is questionable whether there has been such a decrease as the Minister suggests. Deputy Cosgrave, in his contribution, suggested that a survey of that sort should be made at the present time. <Col N="57" /> It would give us more realistic figures and tell us how we stood in that regard. I do not intend to speak much on the housing aspect of this Estimate as a new Bill has been introduced, dealing with housing, which touches on all the various aspects of the problem.</P>
      <P>I should like to endorse the remarks of those who have spoken about the sometimes unprecedented delays which are occasional when people apply for reconstruction grants, and for grants for building new houses.  It may be, as Deputy Kyne says, that there is not a sufficient number of inspectors in the respective areas.  It may also be that people who apply for grants are not too well versed in their obligations, but I would ask the Minister to try to do something to expedite cases of that sort.  Personally, I know people in my constituency who have been waiting months for the issue of the sums they have been promised, having constructed their houses, and they are very annoyed, financially inconvenienced and embarrassed by the non-issue of these grants.</P>
      <P>I wonder will the new Bill aggravate conditions in that respect, because it provides for additional grants to be given to people who apply for them. That will aggravate the position to an extent because more people will be inclined to apply for these grants. More people will apply for them in the future, which will entail more inspections and more inspectors.  That is an aspect of the question which should instil into our minds the importance of attending to this matter with as much expedition as possible.  I should also like to ask the Minister is it a fact that grants may be paid to a person who builds a two-storey building in which there are two apartments, one apartment on top of another, each containing five rooms.  There are people who wish to build such structures and they want to know if they can obtain a grant, and also an S.D.A. loan.  I am not sure on that point and I should like the Minister to enlighten me in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of roads was mentioned, it being in the bailwick of the Minister, and I should like to refer to a reply which was given to me recently <Col N="58" /> in this House when I asked for certain facts and figures in relation to road grants in each county.  I observe, on perusing the reply given to me, that County Louth has a total of 6,717 licensed vehicles compared with 2,337 licensed vehicles in County Leitrim, and the amount of grants given to Louth is £57,192 and to Leitrim, £125,763.  Again, in Louth, there is a total number of 7,000 driving licences, compared with a total of 2,836 in Longford; yet Longford gets £90,000 odd in grants compared with the £57,000 odd Louth gets.  I am quoting those figures only to draw the Minister's attention to the injustice&mdash;if I might so term it&mdash;of his method of allocating grants to my constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister pointed out in the course of his remarks that the Road Fund is an item separate from the Local Government Vote.  It does not arise on this vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>He also mentioned that it is usual to take it in conjunction with this Estimate.  I am merely drawing the attention of the Minister to it and asking him to be a little more generous in future, because Louth is a county through which passes one of the busiest roads in the country. It has passing through its confines the road from Belfast to Dublin, and the traffic density on that road must be one of the greatest in the 32 Counties. Some parts of the country receive special tourist grants, especially counties which have special tourist attractions.  That is obviously to put the roads of those counties into a good state so that they will be pleasing to the eye and will be easy on the motor cars of visitors.  Louth does not qualify for such grants, and that is all the more reason why it should be considered in a more favourable manner for any grants for which it does qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks, I have noticed men painting white lines on main roads.  I am not referring to the white line that is placed in the middle of the road; I am referring to the extra white lines. Sometimes we see roads with three and four white lines and I fail to see the necessity for the extra lines.  Are they <Col N="59" /> laid down for the purpose of confining traffic to its particular lane, or is it a case of trying to find work for men who are unemployed by various local authorities?  I do not know what benefit that work is, other than providing relief schemes for the workers, and I do not think it is legally binding on a motorist to travel in any particular lane.</P>
    <P>Very often, we see very large holes and depressions in roads which have undergone reconstruction.  Sometimes a section of a road is ripped up for the laying of water and sewerage pipes, and filling is put on top of the pipes. Those fillings must be allowed a certain number of months in which to settle down before they can be concreated or finished off with tarmacadam. From our experience, we know that those holes are left there, and often on bog roads are a danger to cars, and cause much damage to tyres and springs.</P>
    <P>I know that some contractors are very conscientious about this and they do top up those little areas every two days or so, especially on roads over which much traffic passes but there are other contractors who are very negligent in this matter.  The Minister should instruct local authorities to be very insistent upon bringing this fault to the attention of contractors who infringe in this respect.  It is most improper to endanger cars by negligence and carelessness on the part of some of these contractors who leave holes and ruts in the roads.  Sometimes these holes are almost half a foot below the ordinary level of the road.</P>
    <P>One of the things which emphasise the need for road safety at the present time, especially in my constituency, is the recent closing down of certain railways.  That will accentuate the problem.  Of course, the main causes of accidents on the road are excessive speed and carelessness.  I would suggest that the Minister should seriously consider introducing a speed limit in built-up areas.  They have it in the Six Counties and I cannot see why it could not be introduced here&mdash;at least for a trial period.  I am sure that much good would come of it. <Col N="60" /> Another matter for consideration is the giving of special grants to local authorities for the purpose of removing very dangerous corners.  We have many such dangerous corners in this country.  These special grants could also be utilised for the cutting of hedges. Money so used would be money well spent.  By cutting the hedges on bad corners, motorists would be enabled to see what lies ahead of them&mdash;almost to see round corners.</P>
    <P>I wonder would it be possible to construct special laneways for the convenience of cyclists and confine those laneways to cyclists alone, especially in future schemes and where we are building completely new roads or relining main roads?  The construction of such laneways for cyclists would mitigate the danger on the roads considerably. The danger will increase in the coming years because people are becoming more car-minded.  Many people are now buying cars who heretofore had never intended to do so. That will accentuate the problem.  The dangers of travel on the roads at the present time should be emphasised in the schools and by the parents.  Some Deputies referred to the question of a driving test.  It is very necessary that there should be a driving test before a person is issued with a driving licence.</P>
    <P>With regard to sewerage and water schemes, I would suggest to the Minister that in view of the importance of having each area in the country supplied with a local water or sewerage scheme he should suspend for a number of years the spending of money on the making of new main roads and apply the money to the provision of water and sewerage schemes in areas which do not enjoy these much-needed amenities at the present time.  I think that local authorities would welcome such a move.  It would not reduce the employment content in any material way because much employment would be given in those areas where such projects were commenced.  The money would be spent and the people would get employment and the amenities for which they are paying at the present time but which they do not get.  I do not see why rural people should not <Col N="61" /> be given the ordinary comforts of life which their urban neighbours enjoy at the present time.  The rural electrification scheme brings electric light to their houses but at the same time the water and sewerage schemes do not keep pace with it.  I think the Minister should consider that.  I do not know whether it is feasible.  It is an idea which came suddenly into my mind and I think there is some merit in it.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain in some way that people will understand the new system as it applies to applicants for reconstruction grants. Up to recently the practice was for people to go to the local town clerk or town surveyor and ask for a form. The applicant looked forward to getting a certain grant for the job.  The town surveyor inspected the house and if he approved of the work, it would be done if he considered it came within certain conditions and qualified. He sent his report to Dublin and after the local town surveyor's report had been examined in Dublin an inspector was sent down to the local town. Eventually, the applicant would get a notification telling him that he had been allocated a certain grant; that he was free to commence work and, when the work was done, that the payment of the money on the final inspection would be made.</P>
    <P>I understand that the local authority now does not come into the matter at all, that the person who wishes to reconstruct his house must apply direct to the Department who sends down an inspector and the old routine is then carried out.  Would it not be possible to permit the local authority surveyor to inspect these houses and let him look after all the routine work so as to expedite the issue of the grants to those people?  The Minister in reply may say that the Department will have to inspect the job because, after all, Governments and the Department are giving money to have this work done and the local authority might be influenced by the local people.  We must remember, however, that the local authorities are also very cagey when they issue money.  They have to safeguard their own funds and the local surveyors are instructed by the local <Col N="62" /> county manager to insist upon the regulations being carried out.  If my suggestion were adopted, I think it would expedite matters.  At all events, it would certainly obviate the very long delays experienced by applicants for grants if the work of inspection before the work commences and before it finishes is left to the local authority surveyor.</P>
    <P>I understood that this debate will be adjourned at 6 o'clock when the House will consider the Solicitors Bill.  I only hope that the Minister's efforts to expedite local government matters in general will meet with success.  I hope his new Housing Bill will act as a fillip to house building in the areas where house building is still very necessary. As the Minister says, there are 23 counties in which the housing needs of the people have been met.  At the same time, however, there are some pockets, especially in the large towns and cities, and in Dublin and Cork in particular, where there is a very big demand yet to be met.  I hope that when the new Bill begins to operate and when its provisions are applied to individual cases it will help considerably the building of new houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of this Bill is twofold.  First of all, it proposes to provide for striking off the roll the name of a solicitor or his suspension from practice, or his admonishment in any case where he has been found guilty of misconduct. Secondly, the Bill, if enacted, will enable the names of solicitors which have been struck off the roll unconstitutionally to be struck off in a constitutional way, if the High Court decides that this should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for this Bill has arisen because it has been decided by the Supreme Court that some of the provisions of Part III of the Solicitors Act, 1954&mdash;and, notably, those which provide for striking the name of a <Col N="63" /> solicitor off the roll&mdash;are repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There will, I am sure, be general agreement that the position which has arisen as a result of this decision should be rectified with all possible speed.  The solicitor's profession is one which brings its members into close and intimate association with members of the public and it is plainly in the public interest that a solicitor who is guilty of professional misconduct should be subject to severe penalities including, in proper cases, the penalty of being put out of the profession.  This is the more necessary because a solicitor is often placed in such a position that he has in his hands money belonging to his clients which, if he is dishonest, he may dispose of to his own personal advantage and so defraud innocent people.</P>
    <P>The 1954 Act purported to give the power of striking off or suspending from practice to the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society with the right of appeal to the Chief Justice. The Supreme Court have now held that the right of appeal is not sufficient to bring provisions, otherwise unconstitional, within the Constitution.  The Bill proposes in Section 3 to give the power of striking off, suspending from practice etc. to the High Court, which shall in addition have power to impose a fine, a power not given to the Disciplinary Committee by the 1954 Act.  In particular cases, the matter will be brought before the High Court on a report by the Disciplinary Committee after it has held an inquiry.  This inquiry is provided for in Section 2, under which the committee may inquire into the conduct of a solicitor alleged to have committed misconduct as defined in the section, and when the inquiry has been held the report of the committee is to be set down by the Law Society for hearing by the High Court.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 are to deal with cases of striking off, etc., in the future. Section 6 covers cases where the Disciplinary Committee have already purported to strike off.  In such a case, jurisdiction is being given to the High Court to strike off the roll any name <Col N="64" /> purported to have been struck off. There are a number of these cases.  In the instance of any solicitor concerned, the Law Society will apply to the High Court under Section 6 to have the solicitor properly struck off; and the High Court will have before it the evidence which was before the Disciplinary Committee.  If satisfied with this evidence, the court may order that the name of the solicitor in question be struck off and any such order shall have effect from the date of the original purported striking off by the Disciplinary Committee under the 1954 Act.  However, though the order of the High Court is being made retrospective, it will not affect the solicitor's right to collect costs for any work done by him before the date of the High Court order nor will it make it an offence for the solicitor to have practised as such before that order.</P>
    <P>I now come to Section 9 of the Bill. This section confers an absolute privilege on any acts done by the Disciplinary Committee or their registrar in purported exercise of the powers conferred on them or him by the 1954 Act. This means that the committee cannot be successfully sued for libel or slander in respect of orders made by them striking off the name of a solicitor or suspending him from practice or in respect of the filing and publication of such orders.  It is only right, I think, that a body which was acting in good faith in pursuance of statutory powers should be given this protection in the circumstances that have arisen.</P>
    <P>The section also clothes with absolute privilege the making of reports to the High Court under the Bill or the setting down of such reports for hearing by the High Court.  At this point it will be convenient to mention that there is a printing error in Section 9 (1) (b) of the Bill where the second reference to the Disciplinary Committee should be are reference to the Society.  This can be corrected at the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In addition to protecting the Disciplinary Committee and the society against actions for defamation, it is also desirable to protect persons, including the society, who make or have made applications to the Disciplinary Committee in regard to the conduct <Col N="65" /> of a solicitor or who give or have given information in connection with such application.  These persons are being protected in Section 9 (2) by what is called in law qualified privilege. This means that they will have a good defence to a libel or slander action unless they acted maliciously: that is to say, unless their conduct resulted from a wrong or indirect motive.</P>
    <P>As provided by Section 8, the jurisdiction of the High Court is to be exercised by the Chief Justice or by a judge of the Supreme Court or of the High Court assigned by him, and Section 7 provides that an order of the High Court under the Bill shall be final and not appealable.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill deals with the removal of a solicitor's name from the roll at his own request.  Removal may be effected by the Disciplinary Committee or if they refuse to do so by the High Court.  Under Section 5 the High Court may restore a solicitor's name to the roll where that name has been removed or struck off.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill are largely consequential and provide for the re-enactment of the existing provisions of the 1954 Act, which it is desirable to retain, and for the requisite repeals.</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill to the House, I should like to express my thanks to the Council of the Incorporated Law Society for their cooperation and assistance in helping me to frame the measure.  It may be that I shall have to propose some minor amendments on the Committee Stage. However, they will not be amendments of substance and I do not propose to take up the time of the House by discussing them on this stage.  They are at present being examined.  As the House knows, our intention is to have this Bill through the Dáil this session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I had some very close association with the passing of the Act which is called in this Bill the Principal Act, namely, the Solicitors Act, 1954.  Accordingly, I would give general support to this Bill being Conscious of the fact that it is brought in to meet a serious difficulty.  I have <Col N="66" /> made it a rule never to express anything approaching a constitutional opinion on matters of constitutional law arising out of a Bill before the House.  I propose to adhere to the same practice on this occasion and merely to hint that in one minor respect I am rather hesitant in thinking that the provision is really constitutional.  I have no doubt the Minister has received adequate and expert opinion on the constitutionality of this Bill, particularly having regard to the fact that the Principal Act in certain respects has been declared to be unconstitutional. While general approval of the Bill should be given, certain matters may arise for discussion on the Committee Stage, it being agreed, I think, on all sides that a measure of this kind should be approached with a view to seeing that the best possible Bill will be secured in the public interest and that it will not unduly trespass upon the private interests of practising solicitors.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's statement that the public do require to be protected against defaulting solicitors. There are, however, many extenuating circumstances that arise sometimes when professional men get into difficulties and their cases has to be treated with a certain amount of sympathy.  I should like to know from the Minister if a draft of the Bill has been given to the In corporated Law Society for their approval and if they have approved of it.  I gather from the Minister that he did receive assistance from the Incorporated Law Society and that, of course, was understandable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the matters I mention would be more properly dealt with on the Committee Stage, I think it right that I should draw the Minister's attention to them so that he may consider them. I am rather uneasy about the provisions of Section 3.  The procedure-putting it shortly and not necessarily accurately in every way&mdash;is that where a complaint is made against a solicitor that he has been guilty of professional misconduct or has failed in his duty towards his client, the Disciplinary Committee has to inquire into the allegation, take evidence and make a report.  Under the provisions of the <Col N="67" /> Bill the Disciplinary Committee on that evidence shall make a report to the High Court expressing at the same time an opinion as to what the High Court ought to do.  The High Court them takes that opinion as it comes up and on that report, and on that report alone, except in one particular respect, the High Court must express an opinion.  I am a little uneasy as to the constitutionality of this provision.</P>
    <P>I would have been less uneasy if the procedure had been that a report would be made by the committee to the High Court who then exercised their judgment upon that report and took such evidence as they thought fit, but the High Court is presented with a report and an opinion and it is only where fresh evidence could be given in accordance with the practice of the hearing by the Supreme Court of an appeal from the High Court, that the High Court can take fresh evidence. That seems to me to be extremely restrictive. I doubt very much whether that is strictly constitutional and whether it is strictly in accordance with justice.</P>
    <P>It would, to my mind, have been preferable to provide that the Disciplinary Committee would act as a fact-finding committee, make up their own minds in their own fashion and give their own opinion, but let there be a full appeal to the High Court.  I would have no doubt whatever then as to the constitutionality of the procedure.  I go back to the time when the new procedure of appeal from the Circuit Court came before the High Court. The whole basis of that original appeal was that the High Court should exercise a pretty elastic hearing of the appeal from the Circuit Court.  That was the former practice and is the present practice, and the Supreme Court held they would hear that appeal on the basis of an appeal from a judge without a jury.</P>
    <P>The position here is that the case will be taken as it stands.  There will be no documents.  The High Court judge might find himself in disagreement with the decision, and say: &ldquo;If I had to decide this case originally I might have come to a different decision <Col N="68" /> but as the facts are found by the Disciplinary Committee and as they have expressed an opinion, I do not feel inclined to interfere with the judgment.&rdquo; If my recollection is not inaccurate, the position as regards doctors, medical men generally, and all other professional men, dentists, veterinary surgeons and so on, is that they have a full appeal to the High Court from the decision of the disciplinary bodies.</P>
    <P>I mention these matters merely that they may be adverted to in the consideration which the Minister and his advisers will give to the Bill in the interval between the Second Reading and the Committee Stage.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate I am not mentioning it merely for the purpose of raising difficulties but for the purpose of directing attention to what I see may be difficulties which the Minister should consider.</P>
    <P>There may also be some doubt and certainly some controversy on the subject of the High Court more or less giving legislative sanction to actions by the Disciplinary Committee which have been declared illegal and unconstitutional. There may be controversy about that, arguments certainly, as to whether in the event of a man obtaining a judgment of the Supreme Court that the action in removing him from the rolls was unconstitutional, automatic steps may be taken by virtue of an Act of Parliament to copper-fasten the original position.  It may be strictly within the Constitution to express an opinion on that on the merits one way or the other, but I should not like to express an opinion at the moment.  Certainly, some of these people appear to think they have had cause of action against the Incorporated Law Society and whether they should be deprived of that is a matter for debate and argument, at least, on which I express no opinion at the moment.  Subject to these observations, I think something in the same nature is desirable. Accordingly, we shall support the measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy J.A. Costello that legislation of this type is necessary even if it is not in exactly the from in which we think it <Col N="69" /> is required.  I also agree that it is necessary that we should get this patchwork legislation through as soon as possible so as to close the gap shown in the original Act of 1954 as revealed by the recent judgment.</P>
      <P>I have some doubts with regard to two or three of the points mentioned by Deputy J.A. Costello.  Apart from the question of whether or not what is proposed in the legislation would pass the test of constitutionality, I do not know why it is thought necessary to put in certain clauses.</P>
      <P>Deputy J.A. Costello mentioned that, under Section 2, when the Disciplinary Committee hold an inquiry they then make a report, bring the whole matter to the notice of the High Court and include a recommendation to be made by the Disciplinary Committee, as to the order that they think should be made under Section 3.  Why it is necessary to have a recommendation proceeding from them, instead of stopping short at the point of the Disciplinary Committee's finding certain facts after reporting to the High Court, I do not know.</P>
      <P>The Minister will probably tell us the reason for giving to the Disciplinary Committee power to make a recommendation to the High Court&mdash; apart from the recent judgment that the Chief Justice, sitting as a person on an appeal from the activities of the old Disciplinary Committee, had taken the view with regard to what the Disciplinary Committee did that it was not open to him to swerve in any great degree on what the committee had recommended.  I think that was one of the points on which the 1954 Act foundered, according to the judgment. It might lead to a conflict in the courts in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>I am mentioning points that ordinarily would be reserved for the Committee Stage.  However, we are told, and we agree, that it is necessary to have this legislation through before the end of next week and therefore I think I may make these points now, even on the Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Section 3 (1) (d), page 4, about line 10, the High Court, after hearing the case, may do certain things.  It can order the striking off <Col N="70" /> the roll of the name of the solicitor; it can order the suspension of the solicitor from practising for such periods as the High Court may determine or it may admonish the solicitor or admonish him and, by order, impose a fine upon him.  Why is it not said that the High Court may refuse the application?  I presume the answer will be that, if they do not strike off or suspend or admonish, the position is satisfactory so far as a solicitor is concerned.  Costs arise after that.  The payments of costs is related entirely to the payments by the solicitor whose professional conduct has been impugned.</P>
    <P>Supposing the High Court finds that something being done to the solicitor because of alleged misconduct is not good and refuse.  Has he, if he has successfully got through the ordeal, to meet his costs?  There is nothing in the Bill as to such a solicitor, or anybody else, being given his costs.  I suggest it would not be any blight upon the Bill to indicate that at least the High Court has power to refuse the application.  All that is provided here is to do three things which are adverse to the solicitor.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the jurisdiction of the High Court to strike off the roll the name of any solicitor in respect of whom an order striking his name off the roll was purported to have been made under the earlier Act.  I gather that this is an effort to make good the defects in the old Act.  If the High Court, on the application of the society, finds that the people already struck off should have been struck off, then the High Court decide and, if they decide, the striking off operates from the old date.  That may or may not be found good constitutionally. Supposing it is good constitutionally, why is it necessary to make the jurisdiction or the striking off operate from the earlier date?  What would happen if it operated only from the date the High Court made the order?</P>
    <P>I recognise that it is provided in the legislation under this same Section 6 (c), (i) and (ii), that, if the High Court makes an order striking the name of a solicitor off the roll, it shall have effect as on and from the operative date on <Col N="71" /> which the purported order was made but not so as (i) to affect the right of the solicitor to recover any costs due to him for work as a solicitor during the period commencing on the operative date and ending on the date on which the order is made by the High Court or (ii) to make it an offence for the solicitor to practise as a solicitor during the said period.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the finality of orders of the High Court under Sections 3, 4, 5, or 6 of this Bill.  Why has it been thought fit to make the High Court judgment final and not appealable?  I do not see anything wrong in doing that.  I think the legislative body has a right to say this. Appeal to a Supreme Court is limited. It does not proceed from the orders and judgments save where otherwise directed.  Why is it thought necessary to prohibit an appeal, which would be the ordinary thing, from a decision of the High Court in such a case?</P>
    <P>One of the things mentioned in the judgment as lending force to the contention that the Disciplinary Committee were performing a judicial function was the powers given under Section 19 of the original Act.  Section 10 of this legislation adapts Section 19 of the Principal Act.  The only adaptation is that the powers given to the original Disciplinary Committee are now given to the Disciplinary Committee under this piece of legislation.  They are usually described as all the powers of a judge of the High Court type in respect of enforcing attendance of witnesses, putting people under oath, compelling the production of documents. These were two or three of the things to which the judgment of the Supreme Court referred, lending a good deal of strength to the argument that what was done by the old Disciplinary Committee was something of a judicial nature and then it was decided that it was not of a limited type.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in page 8, towards the end of Section 12, to where publicity can be achieved for certain entries made in these two files that will be set up.  But, towards the end of Section 12, it is said that care <Col N="72" /> has to be taken&mdash;where a note has been inserted at the direction of the society that the furnishing of a report might cause injustice.  I do not see where, positively, in this legislation that power is given to the society, that is, that they should be entitled at times to direct the insertion of a note that publicity of a creative type might work unjustly.  I would ask the Minister to see if it was gathered in as an inherent power that the Disciplinary Committee would have or whether it is proposed to give them, in explicit terms, a power such as this.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with application of the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879.  An application to or an inquiry or other proceeding before the Disciplinary Committee is to be a legal proceeding within the meaning of that expression as used in the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879.  The purpose is clear.  It is, I suppose, in order to have easy production of entries from bankers' books.  The proceedings before the Disciplinary Committee are regarded as legal proceedings.  That clearly does affect the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister might take advice as to whether any reference to the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879, is worth anything at the moment.  Bankers are defined, for the purposes of this Act, as people who have duly made a return to the Commissioners of Ireland Revenue. I understand that no bank makes such a return nowadays.  It would appear that no institution could qualify on a strict interpretation as a banker for the purposes of that Act.</P>
    <P>That question was brought to the notice of the courts in England many years ago.  The result was that in the Companies Act of 1948 there was an amendment to the effect that if a group of people carrying on the business of banking made certain returns to the company's office, then that precluded the necessity of making returns to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue.  The Act has been called in question by some judges as being by no means clear.  The Act has staggered along so far, but it might be improved by some amendment by way of the adaptation of the company law to ensure that the banks, as we know them, would be covered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> Finally, I presume this is the first effort in the immediate emergency in connection with solicitors to get some association of limited powers of a judicial nature to be carried out by people who are not judges appointed under the Constitution.  There are many other bodies who may find that disciplinary committees which they have established would also come to be declared as carrying out powers and functions of a judicial nature, which would not be regarded as limited, and which might fall under the sweep of the judgment in the solicitor's case.</P>
    <P>I understood that the judgment had been considered not merely in relation to solicitors but to other groups.  The judgment did, of course, expressly exclude people who entered into an arrangement of a contractual type, whereby they allow themselves to be controlled in their activities by a disciplinary body but where disciplinary committees are established or control given to anybody in a piece of legislation, then the eyes of the courts may again light on such bodies and, as I say, the sweep of the judgment was very wide.  The judge who delivered the judgment, speaking of limited powers and functions of a judicial nature, did say anything that affected people in their lives, liberties, fortunes or reputations could not be considered limited.  If that is to be extended to other professional bodies, I should imagine that there will have to be a considerable amount of legislating for other groups such as the medical profession, the veterinary profession and such other groups.</P>
    <P>We are dealing at the moment with the one group whose fortunes have been affected particularly by the judgment and certainly we will help the Minister to get this legislation through at the earliest possible moment in order to meet the emergency situation that has arisen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should like to say is that I can give no assurance that the Bill will be any more constitutional than the Act which it proposes to replace.  I say that merely as a layman.  I feel certain that when the 1954 Act was going through this House as a Bill, it received the fullest <Col N="74" /> discussion.  I feel sure that before it ever reached the House it received all the consideration that a Bill of its character should receive.  I can say the same in respect of the present Bill.</P>
      <P>My first reaction when I studied this Bill was that it was a simple Bill, couched in simple language.  That was the impression I got.  I studied it section by section, sub-section by sub-section, and paragraph by paragraph and I thought I undersood it.  I thought it was drafted in clear language and expressed what it was intended to express.  Personally I was satisfied that this was a Bill to amend a situation created when the 1954 Act was declared unconstitutional.  The Bill has received all the consideration that could be given to it by the people most capable of dealing with this subject.</P>
      <P>The Bill was in fact submitted to the incorporated Law Society.  It is designed, among other thing, to protect the committee of that society for acts resulting from the operation under the 1954 Act.  If the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy McGilligan, or anybody else thinks that this Bill can be improved, there is no reason why an amendment should not be put down. We ourselves will have a number of small amendments; we may possibly have one of some importance that might meet some of the views expressed by the Leader of the Opposition and by Deputy McGilligan.  If it is thought that the Bill can be made better than it is at present and if it can be made secure against another declaration of unconstitutionality, then I shall be very happy to receive the appropriate amendments.  Naturally, none of us wants to enact a Bill that is of doubtful quality constitutionally and that may, in the future, cause the same difficulties as the 1954 Act has caused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any Deputy feels there are sections in the Bill that can be improved, I shall be glad to hear about them. Of course, we do not want to bring in anything that is not connected with the particular matter that gave use to the declaration of unconstitutionality.  We do not want to utilise this Bill to bring in matters other than those with which the Bill is intended to deal. Personally I felt certain that the legal. <Col N="75" /> authorities who dealt with this were giving me a Bill that would be fairly copper-fastened against any danger of another declaration of unconstitutionality. I want to say, without any disrespect, that it amuses me very much&mdash;and I want to emphasise that this is without any disrespect&mdash;to hear this Bill, which was brought in with the designed purpose of ensuring that its provisions would be constitutional, now at its very birth, being queried as likely to be unconstitutional in certain aspects.  If there is anything in the Bill that has even a suspicion of unconstitutionality about it, I would appeal to Deputies to give me their help to ensure, as far as the House can ensure it, that the Bill will be within the constitution and will become an Act that will attain the object for which it is being brought in.  I do not think I can say anything more than that.  The whole matter can be dealt with in a much fuller way when we come to Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The question is&mdash;I am not sure whether Deputy Costello or Deputy McGilligan referred to it&mdash;as to whether the High Court would be the right tribunal to deal with the misconduct of a solicitor or whether the Chief Justice himself should be the tribunal. I have considered this question. I asked myself: if the Chief Justice were to deal with these matters, should we have an appeal to a higher tribunal than the Chief Justice?  Like Deputy McGilligan, I feel that there might be an appeal from an order striking off a solicitor's name, but those who are advising me do not at the moment seem to share my viewpoint.  Naturally, being a layman, I did not press it.  If the Chief Justice is to be the Judge, then to whom is the appeal to be made?  I suppose it could be to the Supreme Court, but that would prevent the Chief Justice from sitting in the Supreme Court on an appeal from himself? That is the difficulty.  I shall examine the question again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave us some statistics of the number of houses erected and reconstructed in the last <Col N="77" /> three years.  It is quite obvious there has been a considerable fall, but whether that was due to the demand being fully satisfied or not, we do not know.  Possibly, in some areas it was fully satisfied.  We know there are areas in the country still that need considerable re-housing, but the authorities are afraid to tackle the job because the prospective tenants would be unable to pay the rents without a large subsidy from the local authority. That applies particularly to urban areas.</P>
      <P>It often occurred to me that, over the years, nothing was ever done to see if it were possible to provide houses at a cheaper rate than the present-day cost.  Three factors go to make up the cost of a house.  One is planning.  As the years have gone on, the planners have been improving the designe and so on at the expense of the prospective tenants or the ratepayers.  They could cut out a lot of the trimmings and still have a first-class house that would serve the needs just as well.  The second factor is the cost of materials. This has gone up.  Have the Minister and his Department had any consultation with the planners, the architects, the builders' providers and the skilled operatives who erect the houses?  At this stage, when we are embarking on a new housing drive, so to speak, something should be done to pull down the cost of houses.  It has gone too high. The rent the people will have to pay will put the houses out of their reach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many houses are required, even in villages in rural areas.  The cost of erecting them, even in villages and rural areas, is so high at present that the prospective tenants could not pay the rent without a large subsidy from the ratepayers.  I am referring to planning costs, the cost of materials and labour costs.  The Minister should have consultation with the three interests involved to see if it is possible to erect houses at a lower cost than that which they are being erected at present. They can be just as durable and they will serve the needs just as well. costs have been mounting all the time over the years and a stop should be put to them.  If the Minister put down his foot and said: &ldquo;Thus far shalt thou go and no further&rdquo; in the cost of houses, <Col N="78" /> all the interests concerned would put on their thinking caps and provide ways and means to provide houses more cheaply.</P>
    <P>I heard a Deputy from Waterford on the Labour Benches ask the Minister why he did not sanction a scheme for rural houses.  The price of the house was, I understand, something in the region of £1,500 or £1,600.  I would not blame the Minister for not sanctioning such a scheme.  There seems to be no limit whatever to housing costs.  We do not know who is getting it.  Very definitely, the architects have been stepping up the design of the houses all the time and putting on frills which have been costing a lot of money.  Contractors will tell you they can put up just as good a house for a couple of hundred pounds less down the country, if they cut out certain of the frills which the architects have added.  The Minister should do something about that.</P>
    <P>On the cost of materials, it is questionable whether they should go up all the time, too.  Many contractors say the labour output has been dropping over the years.  The trade unions which cater for skilled workers could do much to deal with that.  If new money is provided, the Minister would be doing a good day's work if he could prevent the cost of housing going up further. Undoubtedly, once new grants and subsidies are provided, the cost will go up again, as some group is sure to make them go up each time.</P>
    <P>In regard to the housing letting regulations made by Ministers, some of these were made when there was a considerable scarcity of houses.  Those regulations were drawn up very strictly.  A manager cannot let a house now unless he has a certificate from the medical officer of health about the housing needs of the particular person the local authority I know best, the medical officer deals with about 2,000 lettings a year, urban and corporation and county council lettings.  His whole time is taken up in giving certificates. That was never intended.  Houses are in reasonably full supply in most areas and there should be some relaxation of the restrictions.  There should not be <Col N="79" /> a highly competent and highly paid medical officer, with a hundred and one duties to perform, engaged most of his time in certifying housing needs.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if a rural cottage is being built out the country, the local engineer examines the site and advises the county manager about its suitability. But that is not good enough. The medical officer is sent out to the backwoods, into a field, to see if the field is suitable.  That is a bit silly. The engineer should be capable of determining the suitability of a site for an isolated rural cottage.  A lot of red tape has grown up over the years and it is time some of it was cut out. The local medical officer's certificate should be sufficient.  He would have far more knowledge, in his own dispensary area, than the county medical officer would have, about the housing needs of a particular individual, in regard to a rural house at a cost of £1,000.</P>
    <P>A matter which came to my attention lately shows what peculiar things can happen.  A rural house was being erected and the prospective tenant objected to the sitting of the house; he got in touch with the Department and the Minister's architect was sent down 90 or 100 miles to see if the county council's architect was siting the house in the right direction.  Things like that should not happen.  If a fully qualified architect cannot decide the aspect of a rural cottage, no one in the Minister's Department can.  They all got the same training.  It seems silly to send a man down 100 miles into the country after another architect.</P>
    <P>In the beginning of the housing drive 25 years ago, a lot of things may have been necessary, but that is not so now.  The Minister should trust the local people.  There are architects, doctors and managers now to make decisions about housing.  The members of the local authority do not make them.  At present every single thing must be referred to the Custom House, just as it was 20 or 30 years ago.  Much of that should be cut out. especially the looking for sanction for everything, including the acquisition of the site.  The Minister the acquisition <Col N="80" /> from his own experience, that a lot of it is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I do not know if we can discuss roads under this Vote.  I suppose we can refer to the main roads improvement grants. The way the grant is spent is determined by the Department.  That has grown up over the years.  It should be left to the county engineers to do that, as they would know best what to do.  Many main roads need banking, improving and strengthening, but large sums of money are being spent in cutting off big slices of corners which are not really dangerous at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is silly and should be stopped to a great extent.  I admit that many dangerous corners have been taken off, but now they have gone on to the second, third and fourth grade of corners and still the policy goes on, that a large slice of the road improvement grant should be used each year by the Department, rather than give it to the county engineer for the banking and strengthening of trunk roads.</P>
      <P>There are many miles of poorer type main roads on which considerable sums could be spent.  I know of such instances myself.  I see planning going on and planners on some of these roads, who plan them a dozen times in a dozen years.  They are not employed by the local authority and I do not know where they come from.  They can put notices there if it is a narrow road or if there are dangerous bends.  One thousand years would not be sufficient to straighten all the roads of the country. The Minister should insist that local authorities put stop lines where minor roads come out on main roads. There seems to be no settled view as to what these notices should be; they vary from county to county but there should be a uniform policy.  These signs are supposed to have the effect that the motorist would stop but many people do not understand some of these signs.  That is something that should be considered by the designers of the signs which should be easily understood by everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody desires safety on the <Col N="81" /> roads but safety depends on many factors.  No laws the Minister could bring in or Dáil Éireann could pass would give 100 per cent. safety.  I think it was Deputy Kyne who mentioned the fact that responsibility should be placed on pedestrians as well as on the motorist and that there should be a responsibility on parents in regard to their children.  Fewer children would be killed if that were the case but as the law stands it appears the responsibility is on the motorist if the child is under 16 if anything happens, even though it may be the child's own fault. The Minister might consider that point also.  I do not know if our accident statistics are worse than in other countries but I doubt if they are.  Much has already been done and I suppose in the future new drivers will be more experienced than their fathers because they will have more motoring sense.</P>
    <P>Late at night there is also the problem of people who have had &ldquo;one more than the half-one&rdquo;.  No regulations the Minister can make will prevent these people having &ldquo;one over the half-one&rdquo;; perhaps such people feel they should drive a bit fast but many accidents take place late at night as a result of these people staying too long in places of refreshment. Such accidents may also happen early in the morning but not all accidents are caused by this practice.  Many things enter into the matter which the law cannot control.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will make a note about housing costs.  Without doubt, if more money is provided for housing costs will creep up.  Even if the Minister doubles the grants they will be eaten up by the factor I have mentioned, the cost factor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the sponsor of the motion to refer this Estimate back I must first of all apologise to the Minister for not being present when he opened the debate.  I can assure him that it was through no sense of discourtesy to him that I was not present. I have since had the privilege of reading what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three or four years ago, when I had the honour to introduce this Estimate, I remember debates lasting two or three days.  These debates centred <Col N="82" /> round the financing of the affairs of Dublin Corporation.  I have read through the Estimate and I do not find the finances of Dublin Corporation referred to even once.  I made inquiries to find out what had Deputy Briscoe to say to-day about Dublin Corporation finances or if he had any inquiries to make of the Minister as to how these finances would be provided in the future.  I gave an undertaking some few years ago in introducing the Estimate that a sum of £4,000,000 would be made available out of the Local Loans Fund that year, last year and this year if I were in office, to finance the capital projects of Dublin Corporation. I presume the Minister is honouring that undertaking when no reference was made to it.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to read in the Minister's statement that there has been a continued falling off in the past five years in the volume and degree of housing activities and that this naturally results from the approach made to the satisfaction of housing needs. That is exactly what I said two years ago, that we were almost reaching saturation point in the provision of houses and that it was much better that we should taper off activity rather than some day come to a complete close-down.  I am glad the Minister agrees now with what I said then but neither the present Minister nor Deputy Briscoe nor the Fianna Fáil Deputies agreed with me when I said that some two years ago.  I was almost howled down when I made that statement. I am in complete agreement with the Minister when he says our housing needs are now almost met.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the position is to-day under Dublin Corporation but the Minister is quite right in saying they should now concentrate on the demolition of slums and the building of flats in central Dublin.  I said that on a few occasions when I occupied the Minister's seat and I thought that the housing programme of Dublin Corporation was responsible for the traffic congestion in the city.  Without thought the corporation began housing schemes outside the boundaries and on the outskirts of the boundaries and&mdash; fortunately or unfortunately&mdash;most of the people who went into these houses <Col N="83" /> were employed in the centre of the city.  They had to be transported to and from work and that transportation built up the congestion which we have to-day in Dublin and which will take years to clear off.  I sincerely hope that the Minister's advice to the corporation will be accepted.  It is advice that I also gave them but it went unheeded. I hope the Minister has more influence with them than I had.</P>
    <P>In regard to the small Dwellings Acquisition Act loans, the Minister is again making funds available through the Local Loans Fund and I appeal to him to do something about costs to borrowers.  I am referring to legal costs.  I recently had a case where a borrower borrowed the sum of £300 from a local authority and the legal costs amounted to £40.  Something should be done about that.  I cannot blame the solicitor who handled the business, but I do blame the system that required such title to be made to the local authority before they would advance the sum.</P>
    <P>In the case of registered land, there must be a charge on the land certificate. Equities must be discharged and that costs a considerable sum of money. I think, if the Minister would look into it, it might be found possible for local authorities to accept the land certificate by way of equitable deposit, and the costs would be negligible in such a case.  After all, it would be impossible for a person to mortgage his property on a second occasion, while the land certificate is in the possession of the local authority.  If that were done, it would make the Local Loans Fund more available to individual borrowers than it is at present.</P>
    <P>I know for a fact that solicitors down the country have advised their clients and builders to go to the banks and get two securities, in preference to going to the trouble of providing a proper title discharge in equity for the purpose of borrowing a small loan.  The Minister should look into this matter and, if possible, give local authorities a direction that they should accept land certificates as equities and, if they do not do that, then they should not insist on the discharge of equities.  The <Col N="84" /> discharge of equities is very often a costly proceeding, and is often very protracted.  Very often a builder finds great difficulty in procuring materials on credit, pending the granting of a loan from a local authority, and if the Minister would look into this matter, he would be doing a considerable amount of good for borrowers.</P>
    <P>I note, on looking through the Estimate and reading the Minister's speech, that a sum of £400,000 will be saved on the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  That, I think, is false economy.  That Act was introduced by a predecessor of both the Minister and myself, the late Deputy Murphy&mdash; go ndéanfaidh Dia trocaire ar a anam &mdash;and it has done a considerable amount of good in rural Ireland.  Not only did it do a considerable amount of good, but it actually gave a considerable amount of employment and at no stage in our history was employment more needed than to-day.  I think it was a colleague of the Minister, Deputy Cunningham, speaking at a county council meeting in Lifford the other day, who appealed to local authorities to give all the employment they possibly could because there was never more unemployment than there is at the present moment.  If we had that £400,000 for the Local Authorities (Works) Act, it would provide a lot of employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister on one occasion, as reported in Volume 157 of the Official Report, column 1392, said we were being strangled by red tape.  The Minister has had an opportunity to do away with the red tape, but, unfortunately, the Minister not only cut the red tape but he also cut away the spool.  There is nothing left.  As a member of a local authority, the Minister must have known the amount of good work that was done by allocations from the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  We all know there was a lot of money spent scandalously, but the scheme was only in its infancy and now, with our past experience and with wise thinking, a lot of good could be achieved through the working of that Act.  A lot of employment could be given and it is a pity that this £400,000 allocation is now being abolished.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> I am glad to read what the Minister says about main road improvement. I think that one of the first things I said, on taking office, was that we should abolish boulevards for plutocrats. I was attacked for daring to state that boulevards were being provided by local authorities out of the Road Fund, and I think the Minister is doing a very wise thing in abolishing the further making of boulevards for plutocrats.  I agree with Deputy Allen that we have done enough cutting of corners and we want to see more money spent on actual road improvement. I endeavoured to compel local authorities to do that by stopping all main road improvement grants, from a certain date in the month of September, that is, all unexpended Road Fund grants, and diverting them to county roads.  I believe that county roads should be built up and more attention should be given to them, and the Minister should endeavour to see that a greater allocation is given to local authorities for the improvement of county roads, even at the expense of main roads.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's scheme or suggestion that the members of local authorities be consulted by county engineers, and in cases where there is not agreement, the matter should be referred to him, he should insist that the views of the local representatives should be satisfied and not the views of the officials, in dealing particularly with the cutting and alignment of roads.  When there is not agreement, the Minister should do that and should see that his decision is carried out.</P>
    <P>Travelling from here to Cavan, I saw these boulevards being built and I stopped what we considered to be excess expenditure on one road, but now work is proceeding again, and with machinery only one or two men are employed.</P>

      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to speed up the sanctioning of tourist road grants.  There has been an unprecedented delay this year in issuing sanction, and local authorities are becoming a little uneasy.  It would be a very good thing if the Minister could speed up the sanction of road grants, particularly the sanction of tourist road grants.  There is a hiatus in employment given by local authorities each year, and that hiatus is something we should endeavour to bridge.  I remember recommending to local authorities that during that particular time, when they have really no employment to give on the roads, and no employment to give under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, their employees could be beneficially employed in cutting hedges.  Any motorist who travels along the roads of this country will readily realise that the view of our very beautiful countryside is being completely obliterated by overgrown hedges.  Local authorities have jurisdiction under legislation providing that where a farmer does not cut down a hedge, after notice has been served on him, they may cut the hedge themselves and make him pay.</P>

If Deputies look at these tourist buses going around the country, they will see they are much higher than the ordinary buses.  They were built so that tourists could see over the hedges.</P>

      <P>I should like to make special reference to Lifford <Col N="87" /> Bridge.  I do not suppose the Minister is responsible for the delay but there is a delay in the building of Lifford Bridge.  I understood that agreement had been reached between our local authority and the Six Counties to have this bridge built, but we do not appear to be getting any nearer the building of it.  I sincerely hope that the threat of spiking on some future occasion is not the cause of the delay in proceeding with the project.</P>
      <P>I should also appeal to the Minister to consider the question of the rate collection.  It should be possible to collect the rates in a more economical fashion through the office, as is done in the case of Land Commission annuities. Some rate collectors earn as high as £1,200 and £1,300 per year on their poundage.  I think that could be saved. Each local authority has some 20 rate collectors and there could be a considerable saving if the rates were collected through the office.</P>
      <P>I know it was not customary in the old days to pay the rent or the rates&mdash; it was one of the things we were all told to avoid.  Nowadays people are more educated and the number of civil bills issued by the Land Commission in respect of annuities is negligible.  If we paid our rates through the office, we would find ourselves in the same position and there would be no necessity for the issue of civil bills, and neither would there be any necessity to send out the county registrar or the sheriff.  If there are isolated cases and hard luck cases, I am sure the Minister would use his discretion and that the local authority would do likewise.  I understand that the scheme in Kerry was not a financial success.  Kerry was really a pioneering county in regard to the project.  If the experiment were carried further, it might be a success. In any event, it is something the Minister could look into.</P>
      <P>I remember in 1956, when introducing the Local Government Estimate, I had taken in conjunction with the Estimate a motion put down by Fianna Fáil.  That motion read:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, in view of the increasing congestion <Col N="88" /> of traffic on the roads and of the large number of fatal and serious accidents, the Government should without delay bring before the Dáil comprehensive proposals for dealing with the problem.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before that debate was concluded in 1956, the Tánaiste, then Deputy Lemass, intervened to make an appeal to me to bring before the Government legislation for dealing with road traffic.  I gave him an assurance and an undertaking that the matter would be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.  In order to carry out that undertaking, a sub-committee of the Cabinet, comprising the Minister for Justice, myself and the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, met and we formulated and drafted a Bill which was ready for introduction to this House when we went out of office some 14 or 15 months ago. Despite the urgency of the matter in 1956, nothing whatever has been done to introduce legislation here to amend the Road Traffic Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We had gone a long distance.  We had reached the stage at which the Bill was drafted.  The Tánaiste said the matter was urgent in 1956.  It was so urgent that he intervened on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government to appeal to us to introduce the legislation. Nothing has been done despite the fact that fatal road accidents have increased considerably since then.  The Minister should endeavour to speed up this legislation.  Deputy Allen pointed out some of the dangers in regard to motoring at the present time.  In addition, I think the Deputy should endeavour to impress on his colleague, the Minister for Justice, the absolute necessity of enforcing the law as it stands because I believe that, were the existing law enforced, we would not have the number of road accidents, particularly <Col N="89" /> the fatal road accidents, which we have.  Day in day out we read in the Press of fatal and other serious road accidents, but no effort is being made to educate the people to comply with the regulations and the sections of the various Acts governing this matter.</P>
      <P>The Department did issue a pamphlet and I see that the Minister is to issue a revised one.  I sincerely hope it will meet with the success it deserves and that all applicants for a driver's licence will not only be required to read the pamphlet but will be required to understand it and be able to satisfy competent authorities, when questioned on it, that they understand it because if they do not, we will get nowhere, no matter what legislation is introduced.</P>
      <P>No later than a few hours ago, I appeared in a court where a lady motorist did not use traffic indicators, despite the fact that she had them, with the result that she caused a minor accident.  There is no regulation governing the use of traffic indicators. There is a regulation compelling you to have them, but there is no regulation compelling you to use them.  In the same way, it is illegal to have a motor car without a dimming device, but there is no law compelling you to use that device.  I do not know who introduced the legislation compelling people to have them but the Minister could go further and compel people to use them. If he did that, he would go a long way towards avoiding some of the more serious accidents at night.</P>
      <P>The Minister should persuade his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to bring in the long-promised amendment of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  We would have less use of the bottle in the hip-pocket.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that the Minister announced his intention to give an opportunity to public representatives to be consulted where huge expenditure is being undertaken on the removal of dangerous corners.  I intend <Col N="91" /> to refer to expenditure which I consider unnecessary.  I have protested at the county council against huge expenditure on a mile of road.  I have travelled the road in question for the past 35 years and I did not consider it dangerous.  When they were told that a huge grant was being made which, if not accepted, would be withdrawn, the councillors were compelled to agree. We did not understand that 40 per cent. of the grant would be spent on huge machinery, bulldozers and other road-making equipment.  There were 20 feet added to a trunk road.  That happened in Kilmacanogue.  A sum of £6,000 or £7,000 was spent the first year.  There was a garage there and it was decided that the tenant of the garage would be allowed to build a garage on the opposite side of the road, where there was a new trunk road.  It was discovered that that man was only the tenant and that there would be interference with the landlord's right.  The result was that, instead of removing one dangerous turn, there are three turns because the road leading into the garage could not be interfered with.</P>
      <P>I have received complaints from large ratepayers in the area about huge expenditure at a time when we are supposed to be tightening our belts, especially in view of the fact that the labour content of the work was practically nil.  There are 20 feet of tarmacadam now, with nine feet on one side and ten feet on the other side and a bank of five feet or six feet.  If any motorist gets a skid on that road at night, I do not know what will happen.  I could understand leaving a margin of nine feet beside the tarmacadam if the pedestrian or cyclist could use it.  I could understand engineers trying to impress foreigners by having a stretch of road on which they could travel at 100 miles an hour.  There is no consideration for the pedestrian. Cyclists have had to carry bicycles and get on to the grass verge when cars were approaching.  All last year I protested against it at the county council meetings and suggested that a danger sign should be erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suggest that the main road <Col N="92" /> has not been improved but the Minister has experience of public administration and can understand the indignation of people at the expenditure of thousands of pounds on this road and huge machinery lying idle at a cost of 25/- an hour, which is charged against the county.</P>
    <P>The people in the adjoining parish called a protest meeting.  Two public representatives were there.  The parish priest was there.  The complaint was that children were unable to travel to school over part of a road in that parish.  We could not explain that the money spent in the other parish was a special grant for a trunk road. Their only concern was that, after bad weather, the children were unable to go to school along that road because there were so many potholes in it.  It was agreed that £100 would be spent as a temporary measure to carry out some improvement on the road so as to allow children to go to school.</P>
    <P>Stones were carted 20 miles by lorry while there was a quarry adjacent to the place, which would have given employment to the idle men in the Kilmacanogue area.  It is a deserted village now, partly due to the fact that lorries were used to bring stones from a distance five miles beyond Wicklow to Kilmacanogue.  It is no wonder that it cost over £12,000 to do a mile of that road, and it is not finished yet. There is further expenditure on the road towards the Glen of the Downs. The ratepayers have protested.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to high ditches.  Along the road to which I refer there were beautiful trees.  They have been removed.  There are three strands of wire stretched along the bank to prevent anybody rolling down the bank.  That work is unneccessary. We protested against it at the time. The work that was carried out is a credit to the engineering staffs of the county council and the Department of Local Government, but I consider that it was unnecessary to add 20 feet to the width of that road and to make a race track of that mile stretch.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Allen.  We have spent too much on alignment of roads. The county council passed a resolution that the engineer is not to hire machinery or to charge against a <Col N="93" /> scheme 25/- an hour for machinery that is lying idle, without the prior permission of the county council.  That was a practically unanimous decision of the county council.  If the Government give a grant, we consider that the greater part of it should go to the relief of unemployment, instead of on machinery.  Of course, it is argued that it is necessary to have machinery.  That is admitted, but I do not like to have machinery that is brought in for a week's work being left on the job for a month or two and charged against the road account for the time it is lying on the side of the road.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I would ask the Minister to look into.  An engineer resigned on pension.  Some members of the council were in favour of reorganising the district.  Twenty years ago, there were three assistant engineers and a county engineer.  There were more houses erected in Wicklow in proportion to population than were erected in any other county.  There were only three assistant engineers, who were then paid commission.  During the emergency, the chief engineer appealed to the county council to put the engineers on a salary.  The argument was put up that when conditions became normal, the engineers would be there to do the work for which commission was formerly paid.  When the work does arise, the engineers always want extra assistance.</P>
    <P>A number of members of the council were of the opinion, as there were no houses being erected in Wicklow, that there should be a reorganisation.  A letter was received from the engineering section of the Department to the effect that an extra engineer must be employed.  The Minister has long experience of public administration and will appreciate the position of members of the council.  Any time I had business with the Department, I received the usual courtesy and assistance that I have always received from the various Departments.  The officials are very helpful in every way.  My criticism is not against the individual engineer. His only concern is to carry out a beautiful job that will be a monument to him.  Members of the council have to consider other matters.  Although we were asked to tighten our belts because <Col N="94" /> the financial position was not all we would wish it to be, we find this huge, unnecessary expenditure on this portion of the road.</P>
    <P>I do not want to worry the Minister by quoting letters but I have received numerous complaints from ratepayers and others in the area in this connection. I would ask that some consideration be given to the man without a motor car, the cyclist and pedestrian in country places.  I do not think the Minister would approve of inconvenience being caused to the ordinary citizen to the extent that the man in the village has to protect himself by carrying a lamp at night time to avoid being knocked down.</P>
    <P>The complaint always has been that we were spending too much money on the cities and towns and not spending enough on the county roads.  I believe that we have done enough for the trunk roads and that we should concentrate on making decent roads at places of worship and near schools.  I hope we will not hear the threat that if we do not agree to certain proposals in respect of roads, we will lose the grant.  This road at Kilmacanogue has involved much expenditure.  Over 40 per cent. of the expenditure on this road was for machinery and carting materials over 20 miles when a quarry was within a mile of the village, which is deserted at the present time because the men have emigrated on account of having no employment.</P>
    <P>The engineers, of course, will always try to justify their actions, but the people living in different parts of the country are not prepared to accept the explanations made by these engineers. It should not be necessary for the people in an area to call a protest meeting presided over by the parish priest in order to get some facilities. As I have said, I hope that when the appeal is made to the Minister, we shall not be met with the threat: &ldquo;If you do not accept this proposal, you will have to forfeit your grant.&rdquo;  I am satisfied that when a reasonable case is put up by the representatives of the county council, the Minister, with his experience, will meet the wishes of the people so that we will not have a repetition of what occurred in connection with the Kilmacanogue road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of going over the whole ambit of local government.  I want to deal with one or two special problems.  My colleague from Donegal made reference to the expenditure on main roads.  There was not much in what he said that one could criticise, but I would like to remind the Minister&mdash;although it is hardly necessary to do so&mdash;that as a result of the recent action by the railway companies, we have a special problem in relation to main roads in Donegal and other Border counties.  I cannot see the Road Fund being able to cope with the burden that is bound to arise in putting these roads into a proper state of repair to carry the diverted traffic from these railway lines which have been closed down.</P>
      <P>I would take this opportunity of asking the Minister to consider seriously having a special allocation fund for the purpose of putting these roads into a fit state of repair, even over an extended period.  This problem is one which makes the local authorities shudder in this county adjacent to the areas where the lines have been closed and where there is a possibility of further lines being closed in the near future.  I do not think, in so far as some of the roads I have in mind are concerned, the Minister could be accused of incurring unnecessary expenditure.</P>
      <P>We may be unique in that we have a considerable number of crooked roads.  The extra traffic certainly brings that problem to the fore and no matter what the future policy may be in regard to main roads, we must bring these main arteries of traffic up to the necessary standard.  I do not think the Road Fund is capable of doing it and I am sure no Deputy would agree that an allocation that would be to the benefit of one area should be made at the expense of another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us feel that the Road Fund already is insufficient to meet the arrangements we have in relation to road repairs generally.  I have yet to meet a member of a local authority who says he is satisfied with the progress being made.  There is no doubt <Col N="96" /> that we have made progress over the past ten or 15 years in the matter of tarmacadam roads, particularly the county roads.  Progress has definitely been made since the introduction of the five-year plan.  We have to face the queer situation in which those roads which are not yet taken on in the five-year plan have to remain in a rapidly deteriorating condition, while those who use them are continually grousing and making appeals to the local representatives to have them put in a proper state of repair.  Meanwhile, the maintenance is like a lot of road maintenance as far as county roads are concerned: to a great extent, it is a waste of time and money.  The cheapest road of all is the road finished with tarmacadam.  The tar dressing has proved to be the cheapest. It necessitates the least maintenance and gives the greatest possible wear. It is a most durable job over the years.</P>
    <P>My main reason for intervening is to deal with the problem we are facing &mdash;Donegal is not the only county that has to face this special problem&mdash;of finding money to put in order some of our main arteries of communication which we cannot possibly afford to do out of the ordinary Road Fund.  We could not expect to have it carried out in the ordinary way.  I appeal to the Minister to have the matter raised at the proper level, with a view to obtaining the necessary funds to enable us, even in a piecemeal manner, to repair all those roads which will cost so much to bring up to the required standard.</P>
    <P>I want to make some brief comments on labour versus machinery.  Many people feel we are putting back the hands of the clock if we discard machinery and go in more for manpower, that is, if we employ more labour.  It is well worth considering if we can employ more labour without endangering the efficiency of the work carried out.  If we can get it done without any extra strain on the funds to be used in doing it, I do not see why it should not go to the cost of labour instead of to the cost of machinery. Where it can be proved that just as good a job can be done without any extra cost, without any lowering of the standard of the work to be accomplished, <Col N="97" /> we should ensure that as much labour as possible is employed on the work, rather than have so much up-to-date machinery which certainly does the job more expeditiously.</P>
    <P>Those who are in favour of the up-to-date machinery and the modern method of carrying out road repairs, building new roads, and so on, always point to America, England and other places where the maximum amount of modern machinery is used in the construction, repair and maintenance of roads.  They forget that, in some of these countries, it is a question of being able to get suitable labour at all. It is a question of having to resort to machinery just because sufficient labour is not available.  That is why so much machinery is being used in some other places.  We have not that problem. Our problem is rather to use to the maximum all the labour we have available instead of dislodging that labour and using the money, as has been done &mdash;and the tendency is increasing&mdash;to import expensive machinery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Engineers generally are not in favour of discarding machinery and one can readily understand their reason.  I have yet to meet the engineer or architect who is not anxious to erect a monument to himself in the way of the finished article he has to leave for the public to see.  One can hardly blame the men who have had special training in that direction.  I think, however, we should get them to realise that there are other sides to the problem.  The employment of the maximum labour content in each job, should be a primary consideration, if it does not impair the standard of work to be carried out or cost too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any great urgency, say, if a large stretch of main road is to be improved; it is not really a serious matter whether it is accomplished in a week or in a month.  While up-to-date and suitable machinery may carry out a job in a week, it would very often cost just as much as it would had labour only been employed <Col N="98" /> to the maximum, except that the job might be extended over six or eight weeks.  The employment factor is important. I have been trying to show that we could, without putting back the clock, so to speak, without taking any retrograde step in the matter of road construction, help to increase employment. That should be a primary-factor in the making of roads while we have an unemployment problem in this country such as we have had for the past few years and have at present.</P>
    <P>In previous years, I have referred to this matter and I shall not labour it now.  I do not know if anything can be done regarding the valuation of property under the jurisdiction of local authorities and the inequitable system whereby certain properties are revalued, while a revision is not carried out on properties of similar standing and value.  Very few members of local authorities are prepared to advocate revaluation, unless it is carried out on a fairly general basis.  There is an easy way of having a general revaluation of property carried out, without imposing undue hardships on certain sections, if the old valuation only would be rateable until such time as a general revision could take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as it relates to the Minister's work I am reminding him, as every Minister over a long number of years has been reminded, of the inequity of the position where certain little pockets are revalued while others are getting away just because they are not taking steps to improve their property and as a result a small section are carrying a higher burden of the rates each year.  I should like to see a general revaluation carried out and then the burden would not fall unduly on any section.</P>
      <P>Most of the members who have spoken referred to the road traffic regulations and everybody is agreed that a new code is overdue.  I do not think there is much use in bringing in a new code of traffic regulations unless we ensure that the most important section of the people are conversant with it, that is the people who drive cars.  As Deputies know, at the moment a blind man can get a licence to drive a motor car.  The only question on the application form for a licence is whether or not the applicant has attained the age of 21 years.</P>

      <P>In certain cases he need not be 21.  He must be over 21 to get a licence to drive a heavy vehicle.  For that reason the date of birth is asked and those of us who have passed the age of 21 merely write down &ldquo;over 21&rdquo;.  Women mostly do that.  I think there should be some test applied <Col N="100" /> which gradually should be made more strict.  One of the tests certainly should be whether the applicant is conversant with road traffic regulations.  There are quite a few drivers, perhaps even in this House, who are not fully cognisant of many of the regulations which exist under the present code.  It is not unusual to meet a Deputy, particularly one from the South, who does not seem to know when to give way to oncoming traffic from the right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would seriously suggest that all of us should be subjected to a test.  Even those of us already in charge of vehicles could submit ourselves to a driving test, and maybe we would then realise how little we know of traffic regulations and how much we have to learn in the matter of proper driving.  Some Deputies seem to hold the view that the person who drives at a rapid rate is a great danger on the roads.  I find that those people who are supposed to be good drivers, who drive slowly, and are perhaps nervous drivers, are a source of danger. In some cities on the Continent one can be prosecuted for driving too slowly.  A slow driver in a city may hold up the entire traffic to such an extent that there is a traffic jam.  There may be as much care and capability in the case of a driver travelling at 70 miles per hour as in the case of one travelling at 25 miles per hour.  I am not advocating that everybody should drive at 70 miles an hour.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to the extension of the franchise to Gardaí.  I think that they may already exercise the local government franchise if their own local authorities permit them to do so.  I have seen voters' lists in certain counties where the names of Gardaí in the area appear but I have not known them to exercise the vote in any election.  It is a point whether or not they should.</P>

I do not think it would be desirable that we should go canvassing them and, mind you, Deputies are not above canvassing votes at election time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope we shall always have that amount of freedom. My principal reason for intervening in the debate was to appeal for some special provision to deal with the unusual problem that has arisen from the diversion of traffic on to the main roads.  It is a vexed and serious question and one in which Deputies who are not concerned may have little interest but those who come from areas where traffic has been diverted to the main roads will be at one in appealing to the Minister to make some special allowance to enable us to undertake a programme to put those roads into a proper condition to carry the extra traffic.  If transport subsidies now cease to be paid annually to concerns that have been losing money, it might be no harm to fix a subvention from the Exchequer which would be equivalent to the amount paid in subsidy to keep in operation transport concerns which were not paying their way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would seriously appeal to the Minister, therefore, to consider this <Col N="102" /> problem without further delay.  I know I am not being parochial and that the Minister is bound to realise some of the problems with which we are confronted in Donegal and other counties, such as Leitrim, Monaghan, Cavan and the Border counties which have to carry this extra, added and increasing burden on their main roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad that the Minister, when introducing his Estimate, paid tribute to the substantial progress made in housing over the years by successive Governments.  For myself, I should like to say I agree entirely with the sentiments expressed in his speech.  The Minister indicated that he proposes to attack or deal with the housing problem under four different headings.  First, and quite rightly, he has placed the eradication of the slums that still remain in the main cities, Dublin, Cork, Limerick and elsewhere.  I do not know what the position is like in other cities.  I cannot speak for Dublin or Cork, but I know that the main observations of the Minister in regard to the question of housing in general cannot apply to Limerick.  They may be applicable, as I say, to the bigger urban centres, but certainly at the rate of progress in Limerick over recent years, it would appear that anything from six to eight years must elapse before the housing problem there is solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, for one, have always held the view that I would rather see a steady, ordered progress of from 200 to 250 houses built rather than experience, as we have experienced in the recent past, a period of boom in house building followed by a period of slump.  Apart from the unfavourable effect on tenants seeking houses, it also has a most unfavourable effect on the employment of housing personnel.  In boom conditions the labour force, both skilled and unskilled, is swollen to unnatural proportions. If there is any falling off in housing progress, it means a considerable number of men are unemployed and have to leave the area and, usually, leave the country, too.  I have always advocated it would be far better to plan ahead for a reasonable production of houses&mdash;reasonable in face of the problem to be tackled&mdash;<Col N="103" /> rather than take the problem in jerks as has happened in the past for one reason or another, into which I do not propose to go now.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that any proposals put to him by housing authorities, provided they are properly planned, would not be delayed in his Department.  I think that is an encouraging statement to make.  But I am a little mystified by the term &ldquo;properly planned.&rdquo;  Perhaps, in replying, the Minister might clarify that term for the benefit of people like myself who do not quite appreciate what it means. As I understand the position, most housing authorities now have efficient officers, architects, assistant architects, other officers, and, in the case of the larger centres, engineers and assistant engineers.  In addition to those you have town planning consultants attached to the various local authorities.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that, with that team of highly skilled and highly paid individuals, housing schemes could be adequately and properly planned and sent up with a knowledge of the local conditions of the tenants seeking houses in particular areas and that it would be largely a matter of form to have the imprimature of the Minister and his Department and have them returned without delay.  However, I would take encouragement from the Minister's remarks.  In the past there has been a hold-up.  This does not directly concern the present Minister or his predecessor but with successive Governments in the past undoubtedly there has been a hold-up in the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned in his speech that he would require a more dynamic approach to the clearance of slum areas in the larger urban centres. Possibly the Minister himself could assist the dynamic approach he requires by a little more assistance to the housing authorities concerned.  As the House is aware, the present housing subsidy is still based on the unreal figure of £1,500 for an urban house.  I do not think any local authority&mdash;to my knowledge, certainly, in one of the <Col N="104" /> larger centres&mdash;can build a house for £1,500.  I think a figure of at least £1,800 would be more realistic.</P>
    <P>There is one section of the community who, certainly as far as Limerick City is concerned, are in a very grievous position indeed.  That is old, single people, both male and female, living by themselves, in some cases under very distressing conditions.  It is very difficult for such people to qualify for a house or a flat.  Naturally, priority is given to people with families, with one, two, three or more children.  It is only right that the family as such should have first call on the housing authority, but the housing of these old people is a very real charity and a very real necessity.  I should like to see some special encouragement given to local authorities, such as the Limerick City Council, to provide little flats, or, if necessary, groups of flats close together where these old people could live and be looked after by their relatives and, where necessary, possibly by a nurse or welfare officer.  There are quite a few of them in Limerick City now.  The corporation are considerably concerned about them, but they find it difficult to give them the attention to which they are entitled because of the fact that they still have about 1,000 families seeking accommodaion of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>In future, the erection of flats, to which reference has been made from time to time on the question of housing, should be confined to the centre of large urban areas.  Flats erected at a distance from the workers' place of employment have not been a success. If we are to erect flats at all, they should be erected in the centre of the city where old people and childless couples could avail of them.  Outside, two or three bedroomed houses could be built for the families concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now very rightly placing emphasis on the conservation of houses that have been built over the years, both through private and public enterprise.  However, it seems to me that, merely assisting the local authority in that regard and assisting people who desire to reconstruct or repair their own houses, is not sufficient. Sooner or later some consideration <Col N="105" /> will have to be given to some modification of the Rent Restriction Act.  That might not be a very popular measure and certainly it would leave room for very unpopular results but it is not logical or sensible to talk about conserving property if you do not give the private landlord an opportunity at least to earn a rent that will permit him to keep the house in question in order.  With proper safeguards for the tenant concerned, a good deal of conservation of property owned by landlords, perhaps people living on small incomes, could be achieved.</P>
    <P>In designing houses serious regard should be given to the present high cost of solid fuel.  Most of the houses in this country were originally designed at a time when coal was a few pounds a ton.  The cost of coal is now £10 to £12 a ton, which represents a very severe impost on a working family that has to provide a fire, not to mention fuel for the back-to-back contraptions that are in a big number of housing schemes.  A family may be faced with a weekly fuel bill of 20/- to 30/- to keep one of these systems in operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the size and proportion of the rent subsidy being paid by the taxpayer and ratepayer jointly.  Certainly, that is quite an imposing sum.  In many instances quite small ratepayers are paying a subsidy to persons enjoying houses built by the local authority whose incomes are in excess of their own. That refers in a particular way to people who built houses under the Small Dwellings Acts.  Some people who had the courage to undertake the building of their own home out of incomes of £10 to £14 a week are now saddled with the responsibility of providing a subsidy to assist persons whose income in some cases is in excess of their own.  I do not know how many such instances there are but there are certainly some.  That inequity should be rectified.</P>
    <P>Every possible encouragement should be given to people to build their own houses.  That is a matter that probably could be more appropriately dealt with on the new Housing Bill.  The mere fact of building and owning a house gives a man a stake in his county or <Col N="106" /> city and helps to make him a better citizen.</P>
    <P>Some encouragement should be given through local authorities to people to buy out their houses, to become tenant owners rather than tenants for the rest of their lives.  A Deputy pointed out that a person could live in a corporation or council house for 30 or 40 years paying rent and, at the end of that period, would have as little claim to it as he had when he first entered it.  It should be possible, with some help from the Department, to evolve reasonable terms on which tenants could buy out their homes.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the question of safety precautions.  I disagree with Deputy Brennan when he says that a safe driver at 70 miles an hour is not as great a menace as a less experienced driver travelling at 20 miles an hour.  I hold the view that the vast majority of accidents occur because people drive too fast.  One sensible contribution to reducing the very high rate of deaths and accidents on the road would be the introduction of a speed limit, particularly in or near urban areas.  I think I am correct in saying that Deputy O'Donnell, when he was Minister for Local Government, was considering the introduction of a speed limit for built-up areas.  I do not know how far they got or what the present position is. The present Minister would do well to revive that idea because a speed limit is urgently required, particularly in the larger urban centres.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I am in order or not in referring to a matter which may also come under the new Bill. Power should be given to local authorities to acquire sites for industrial purposes.  That would be a very useful innovation if it were provided in the new Housing Bill.  A provision whereby local authorities could acquire land for industrial purposes in addition to housing purposes would be a very great facility in an urban area. It is not unknown for industrialists seeking sites to find considerable difficulty in getting them or being asked for exorbitant prices.  A step in that direction would be of considerable assistance in industrial development, to the need for which we all subscribe.</P>
    <P>I should like to agree with Deputy <Col N="107" /> Kyne, who referred to local government in general.  There has been a tendency over the years for local government to become less local in actual practice and more central.  An effort on the part of the Minister to decentralise and to give more power to city and county councils and their managers would be a step in the right direction.  Anything which makes the local representatives more conscious of the needs of their area and more responsible for filling those needs would be a good thing.  We all subscribe, in theory at least, to the idea of decentralisation.  A practical way of achieving that object would be through the medium of local government, making it local in fact rather than in name.  I hope the Minister, who is a young, active Minister, will have the necessary courage and initiative to make radical changes in that regard while he is in office.</P>
    <P>I should like to wish the Minister success in his efforts to solve our housing problem over the years.  As he said in introducing the Estimate, most of the housing needs are filled but there remains a severe problem in the urban areas, including Limerick City.  Any practical help that he can give to Limerick Corporation to solve their problems would be a step in the right direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all very edified at the pleasant and calm tone of this debate.  The debate on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government usually arouses very keen interest and, on occasions, is very protracted. That is only natural.  It is due to the fact that many members of the Dáil are also members of local authorities and can speak with knowledge and competence and from experience, gained from intimate association, on every aspect of local government. Some of them hold very strong and worthwhile views and it is pleasant to hear them speaking so objectively on matters with which they are intimately acquainted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Outside the House, also, there are many people who are very interested in local administration.  It is the <Col N="108" /> administration that affects people locally, affects their very lives and their very livelihood.  It is the administration that is nearest to them and that is vital to them in many respects.  Every householder, whether he be a farmer, a worker, an industrialist or businessman, is vitally concerned with local administration.  They are the people who provide the revenue for the service given in local administration through the rates.  In recent years people are generally very perturbed because of the sharp increase in rates and, allowing for variation in money values, one can hardly justify the present high rate level.</P>
    <P>We were pleased to hear the Minister state this afternoon that in three county council areas in the current year the rate has been decreased.  It is a small fraction of the entire country but I do hope that it is a tendency that will grow in future years.</P>
    <P>Local authorities seem to be out after every possible penny they can get in the way of rates.  Anybody who improves his dwelling or his out-offices, that are so important to his business, is bound to have a visit from the valuation official and a consequent increase in rates.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle may not agree but I think I am in order in stating that the valuation officials are sometimes wrongly blamed, that they will not visit a particular holding or dwellinghouse except at the express invitation of the local authority.  There is a good deal of confusion about that particular matter.  It is felt that the local authorities, through rate collectors or some other agent, will make reports and eventually there is a follow-up by the valuation office and the valuation is increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I think you will agree that, as local authorities are responsible for visits by the valuation officials, reference to it in a matter of this kind should be allowed.  I will just finish by saying <Col N="109" /> that that is doing more to kill enterprise and initiative and to cause disappointment than anything else that appertains to local administration. Personally, I think it is wrong and that some other method should be devised.</P>
      <P>Local administration is very important. It preserves, broadly, the framework of the original Local Government Act that was passed by an outside Government for this country one and a quarter centuries ago.  First of all, it is very nicely localised or decentralised. Each county has its own administrative unit and local people elect their local representatives.  I think it is to the credit of the local representative of to-day, victims of very sharp and unjust criticism, that they have the public spirit to go into local authorities and serve the people. They understand the people, know their needs and are prepared to take criticisms for what they are worth. That criticism, I think, is wrong although there is a tendency for it to grow.  I admire public representatives for what they are doing on these local bodies.</P>
      <P>I think it a great pity that local authority elections are fought on Party lines.  That has given rise, in my opinion, to a good deal of the criticism over the years.  Parties should have a gentleman's agreement between themselves that these elections should not be contested on Party lines and that men should go forward on their personal merits and records so that we would have more objectiveness in the problems facing local bodies.  It is a matter of controversy whether it is right to curb the powers of representatives on local authorities.  Personally, I think the curbing has been too drastic.  Representatives nowadays are objective enough to act up to their obligations without having their powers too severely clipped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great reliefs are given to the agricultural community and recently a Rates Relief Bill was passed whereby a farmer could get specific relief of £17 per workman employed, or for his son. The ostensible idea behind this was to encourage employment on the land but I do not think it has had that effect. <Col N="110" /> An answer given by the former Minister for Local Government to a parliamentary question disclosed, I think, that there was a saving to the central Exchequer of £100,000 under the Rates Bill passed in 1953.  Many people contend that the old system was more equitable and that they got a fairer crack of the whip under it.  There is greater output from the land in some cases because of the use of machinery and without such machinery that would not have been achieved.  I am not advocating the use of machinery at all because in many ways we would be better without it and it has certainly displaced a good deal of manpower. However, many people contend the old supplementary grant was more equitable.</P>
    <P>Housing has been discussed here and local authorities are to be complimented on the number of houses erected all over the country.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that in the areas of several local authorities housing needs are already satisfied.  There should be a good deal of saving for local authorities in that they will not have to face any further commitments for new houses.  That relief should be passed on in some part to the ratepayers and some part could be used for other local activities in order to keep people employed in rural areas.  Personally, I think water and sewerage schemes offer the greatest potential for rural employment in the future now that we are coming to the end of the active part of the housing programme. There should be a general and very careful assessment of the possibilities of providing water and sewerage work in various parts of the country.  When an area or regional scheme is planned it should be so designed so as to get as many people as possible to avail of the amenity it would provide.  This would give much-needed employment at a time when so many people need it because of the completion of the housing programme.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with Deputies O'Donnell and Everett when they say that a good deal of unnecessary, and I would say wanton, expenditure has been lavished on the main roads of this country.  I know that on a portion <Col N="111" /> of our road from Cork to Limerick in County Cork, for a distance of 30 odd miles, £250,000 was spent in recent years.  It was not spent by the local authority; I understand it was all a scheme planned direct from the Department in Dublin.  It was very undesirable and the people resented it very much particularly when the local roads they were using, side by side with this, were sadly in need of resurfacing.</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Donnell was Minister he did his best to divert a good deal of activity to the county roads and he succeeded to a great extent.  I am glad the present Minister has come round to that point of view and that he, in his time, will insist that county roads get a fair share of attention. People living along these roads pay rates and are entitled to the same amenities as those living beside main roads.  I think it is time that was realised generally.</P>
    <P>I wonder what will happen to the abandoned parts of main roads; will they be eye-sores for the future!  I do not know the plans of the Minister or the Department but I respectfully suggest the abandoned portions should be handed back to the former owners of the land or to the present occupiers of the land taken in former years for the development of these roads.  If these people are prepared to fence them and utilise them in some way it would be better than to leave them in an abandoned state.</P>
    <P>Speed limits have been very much discussed.  Deputy Cosgrave, among others, I think, said there should be a driving test but the greatest offenders on the roads, in my view, are young people and they will pass a driving test any time.  A driving test is not the remedy but something might be said for having a test for suitability which would cover all the matters necessary. I think the speed in the City of Dublin particularly at night is disgraceful and something should be done about it very soon.  The same thing applies to our own roads.  I was standing only last evening with some other gentlemen by the road four miles outside the city when a car passed at 70 or 80 miles an hour driven most recklessly <Col N="112" /> and in such a fashion that I could not get the number even though it was broad daylight.  I would have reported it even though it would have had no effect because I have no authority.  As Deputy Russell said the greater number of accidents is really traceable to speed on the roads.  Where there is a well-known, dangerous corner we very rarely have an accident; it is on the straight stretches that have recently been created that the greatest danger of accidents exists.</P>
    <P>Going back to the rate relief question, it is rather ironical that land is assessed and then relief is given to certain people on that land.  It entails a great deal of mathematical calculation and a great deal of time, and also requires extra staffs during the time the rate demand is being prepared.  I would suggest that something should be done in the way of finalising the rate.  We have sufficient knowledge of the system of local government to see no reason why the rate should not be fixed, for a period of three or five years, at the average of the rate for the previous three or five years.  This would give stability and enable long-term planning to be undertaken. Our engineers and local planners would know where they stood, provided, of course, that grants were made available from the Central Fund for each of those three or five years. There is no reason why that should not be done.  It would be ideal in our present circumstances if it were done and would cut out a great deal of expenditure.  I know the headache it is for local officials to spend week after week preparing the estimates each year and, when the estimates are passed, go on to prepare the estimates for the following year.  This preparation takes an awful lot of time and it could be avoided if there was a simple approach to the system of fixing the rate estimates.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not say anything in his opening speech about the Revision of Constituencies Bill due this year.  Perhaps I am out of order in referring to it now, but a stitch in time saves nine.  When that Bill is introduced, I hope that well-defined geographical boundaries will be recognised <Col N="113" /> and that there will be a sharp reduction in the number of Deputies. I know that, according to the Constitution, there shall be a Deputy to so many thousands of people, but, surely in an island like this, where we have such a preponderance of people in Dublin, it is out of all reason to find so many Deputies from Dublin in this House?  It is really a Dublin Parliament, not a national Parliament; and I think the whole question of population should be discarded and that the over-representation which Dublin now enjoys should be cut down considerably.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I should like to congratulate the Minister on the success which he has achieved in the Department in the short time since he has taken office.  One very notable and commendable feature has been the courteous manner in which he receives Deputies from all sides of the House, and the expeditious manner in which he deals with their various complaints. I understand a motion was put down by Deputy O'Donnell to refer this Estimate back, but Deputy O'Donnell, who spoke about half an hour ago, stated that he would hardly change a comma, a quotation, or a sentence in the Minister's introductory speech, so I presume that his motion goes by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> It also appears that the debate on this Estimate will be fairly short on this occasion, due, no doubt, to the fact that to-morrow, I understand, the Housing (Amendment) Bill will be discussed. Therefore, many of us who might speak for long periods on housing will have ample opportunity to-morrow to deal with specific aspects of that subject in which they are interested. Some Deputies complain year after year that local authorities are only Department of Local Government representatives, and that too much power is vested in the Department.  I wish to point out to these people, once and for all, the rights which they have vested in them, and if they wish to allow a city or county manager to fool them up to the hilt, then that is their look-out.</P>
    <P>We know that there are certain city and county managers who are little dictators in their own minds, little Cæsars and little gods, and if local representatives kow-tow to these individuals, then local government will suffer and the Department of Local Government will be blamed for assuming powers which, in fact, it is not assuming. The Minister's predecessor, Deputy O'Donnell, did introduce one very important provision into the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, in Section 4, which empowers a local authority to pass a motion signed by three members, and, if carried by a simple majority of members present and voting, to instruct or compel a city or county manager to carry out the wishes of local representatives in a specific manner.</P>
    <P>That, mind you, applies to the executive functions of county and city managers, with two exceptions, those which refer to matters on staff and those which refer to matters dealing with specific items under the Health Act which were solely vested in local authorities through city and county managers.  In other words, when people say that local authorities, corporations and county councils have no powers, in my respectful opinion, they have the remedy in their own hands, and if they do not use it, they have only themselves to blame.</P>
    <P>My colleague from Limerick, Deputy Russell, voiced a sentiment which I <Col N="115" /> expressed at the last rates estimate meeting of Limerick Corporation when he spoke about the unrealistic figure for loan charges at present in operation. The State pays two-thirds of loan charges on housing up to £1,500 and the remaining one-third is borne as between the ratepayers and the tenants of houses.  At present housing charges, including site acquisition, development work and so forth are about £1,900 per house.  The burden is falling mainly on the ratepayers and reacts also on the tenants of local authority houses.  There is an outcry at the present time because the tenants of corporation and county council houses are not meeting their due share of this burden, but I respectfully submit that the State has been inconsistent in not raising the figures on which it will pay the loan charges to a more realistic figure.</P>
    <P>At one time the system was different. At one time, the figure was £1,200, and when costs increased, it was raised to £1,500, but, unfortunately, it has stopped at that figure.  With regard to flats, too, just as well as in Dublin, we in Limerick in the central city area, having acquired derelict sites, are building flats.  I think in that instance the loan charges are limited to the figure of £2,000 per flat.  I would not press the Minister so much on that because recently there was a very interesting development in Dublin, whereby the costs of the flats in question were reduced very substantially when evidently some questions were asked in the House, but no doubt Deputy Larkin and the other Dublin Deputies are more conversant with that than I am.  The subsidy figure for housing should be revised.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second report of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee, anyone would think that they would have their facts correct, but they are not even substantially correct. It would take too much time to go through it in detail to show where they err.  Any fool could bring in this report.  I certainly think it would be a very bad day for this country, economically and socially, as well as politically, if any of these recommendations, in part or in whole, were to be carried <Col N="116" /> out.  As for the recommendations of the minority report which came with it, that was worse still.  I pay a tribute to the gentlemen who gave their time to preparing the report, but it certainly has not done anything except to draw attention to the necessity for old houses which could be put in a habitable condition receiving more attention from the Government.  I am glad to say that steps in that regard have been taken by the Minister in the Housing (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies quoted from this report.  Let me quote from page 7:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fourth, the maximum assistance from public moneys is not confined to the most deserving classes of the community.  There are no statutory income limits on small dwellings acquisition loans and direct State grants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understood that anyone whose income at the present time exceeds £132 per annum is debarred from securing a loan from the local authority under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  I do not think I am wrong.  Presumably, these gentlemen had all available information from the officials of Local Government and other relevant State Departments, but yet they could not get their facts correct.  They make these most damaging statements and, as a result, we have a spate of uninformed letters to the papers.</P>
    <P>There is one further point which is a very important one and I should like the Minister to deal with it.  We want to speed up the housing programme in places like Limerick where 7,000 people are homeless.  That is a statement of fact.  There are 7,000 people homeless in Limerick.  They are all in need of housing accommodation.  That is on the basis of a family of five persons, a father, mother and three children.</P>
    <P>We have been told by our local authority officials that the fault does not lie with them, that the fault lies with the Government for the time being.  No particular Government is specified, but we happen to be the Government in office.  I would ask the Minister to give us some information so that when I betake myself back to the city manager in Limerick, I may <Col N="117" /> be able to decide whether he is right or not.  They say that until such time as legislation is enacted in this House, it will not be possible to build expeditiously on derelict sites.  Every Deputy must know that.  They say that to ascertain the ownership of specific property in places such as Limerick, Dublin, Cork or Waterford, where the prior title or any portion of it is obscure, would take from five to seven years.  Therefore, the housing of the working classes cannot proceed.  We must proceed slowly.  The law adviser has carried out his work and that is the law as it stands.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether these local officials are not blaming the Department of Local Government in the wrong.  I understand that possibly is not the case, that there are certain ways and means of acquiring derelict sites in an expeditious manner.  I appreciate that we should differentiate between a derelict site and a slum clearance.  The matter should be clarified once and for all.  Is it a fact that, due to faulty legislation, insufficient legislation or the necessity for amending existing legislation, the housing of the working classes is being delayed in the cities of this country?  If that is so, now is the appropriate time when the Minister might be good enough to consider an amendment.  If it is not a fact, we can deal with that question afterwards. I saw a long leading article in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> about the long delays in regard to the acquisition of central city property.  It was stated that the law was archaic.</P>
    <P>I am led to believe that the fault does not lie with the Department.  If a local authority cannot establish ownership within a certain period and if there are owners in New Zealand or America who cannot be traced, surely when the arbitrator has given his award, money should be set aside. When ownership is established, the money could be allocated to the real owner of the property <i>pro rata,</i> together with the interest accruing therefrom.  That would mean that the local authority could proceed with its housing programme.  The Minister might be able to say something about that very important matter in so far as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other cities <Col N="118" /> are concerned, where they are endeavouring to rebuild in the city centres, the falling-down houses having been cleared.</P>
    <P>Another matter imposing a burden on local authorities is this question of building for the Gardaí&mdash;and, I suppose, the women police now&mdash;building for the Army and building for members of the Post Office service and generally building for civil servants. It is about time that the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice took on the responsibility themselves. There are some cases where they erected houses for the married personnel of the Defence Forces.  The Minister should put his foot down once and for all.  He should use his good offices with the other members of the Cabinet to see if this responsibility could be placed on the Department which is best able to bear it and not on the ratepayers already overburdened with rates, trying to solve their own problems.  I think they have a hell of a cheek.</P>
    <P>We have the Department of Defence expecting us to house people for the Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick.  I had a case in Limerick of a family of 13 who came in from Clonmel, I think. Anyway they were transferred to Limerick and had a good number of children with them.  Within a fortnight, or a month at the outside, they got a house from Limerick Corporation. Under the regulations, they were entitled to it; but one can imagine the outcry of people in the city who were waiting for houses for a long period. The Minister for Defence should look after those people; inequitable positions like this should not arise.</P>
    <P>In regard to industrial sites, I never dreamed that a local authority had no powers to acquire such sites.  I understood, and still am of the opinion, that having acquired a property by agreement or by compulsory acquisition, they are empowered to do with it as they wish.  In fact, under the Town Planning Acts, certain areas of a city, including a slum clearance area, are scheduled as areas for industrial development.  That occurs in Dublin and Limerick.  I hold no brief for town <Col N="119" /> planners, but on the specific point of the powers of local authorities, it has been advocated that that power should be given to them to acquire sites for factories.  In my opinion, that power is already in existence.  Possibly the Minister will deal with that.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the question of roads.  I did not see Deputy Dillon here at all on this Estimate&mdash;he may be in yet&mdash;but it was he who spoke about autobahnen, while Deputy O'Donnell spoke about the boulevards. Their observations may be true to a certain extent, but is there not one feature which should be stressed and which should be brought home to the people in rural Ireland?  Why are we concentrating so much on the main roads and spending so much money on them?  I agree thoroughly with that policy and I sincerely trust that no county will depart very substantially from giving the major portion of the Road Fund Grant to main roads.  The reason is clear.  If the major portion were devoted to county roads and if the main roads were allowed to suffer, the big heavy trucks would go on to the county or secondary roads which had been repaired.  If the main road is in bad condition, they will take the best route available, even if it means going out of their way by a couple of miles.</P>
    <P>By doing the main roads first and by bringing them up to a satisfactory standard, we shall ensure that the bulk of the traffic will keep on these roads. Then we can concentrate on the county roads.  Of course, there are some boreens and minor roads, and some not so minor, in all counties which are in a scandalous condition and which should receive some treatment from the local authority.  However, at the annual rates estimate meeting, evidently some of that money is distributed on a proportional representation system, according to the number of councillors there are for a specific electoral area.  Anyway, that is the way we seem to carry on in Limerick.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to accidents and road traffic.  Perhaps the less I say about that the better.  I believe the problem is not so much one of <Col N="120" /> licensing the drivers or of the age or capabilities of the drivers.  Why do the authorities not examine every vehicle?  There are vehicles allowed on the road to-day and we do not have to go beyond the Four Courts to see the results of the defects in some of those vehicles.  When a new road Traffic Bill is envisaged by the Minister it would be a good thing to have a very rigid section in it dealing with the necessity for a certificate of road-worthiness to be produced by whoever is seeking to tax a car.  Someone said on one occasion that a person is not allowed to go around with a faulty shotgun, one with no safety catch or with the trigger loose.  Similar provisions should apply in the case of cars with defective brakes or other defects. However, that is only a suggestion for the Minister to act on in the future.</P>
    <P>There is one matter about which I am appalled.  We know the amount of money the Health Act is costing the country to-day.  We know the method by which houses are allocated.  I never got a house for anyone and I do not think any Deputy could say he did. All we can do is make representations and present the case in the best possible light on behalf of the applicant but the rules and regulations for priority are there and I am satisfied that in the main they are fairly administered. However, I cannot fathom the reason why cases occur year in, year out, all over Ireland where unfortunate people who have been suffering from tuberculosis are discharged from the sanatorium&mdash;being told to report back for a check up every two months or so&mdash;and then have to go back in many instances into the hovel from which they came.  It was that hovel which caused the tuberculosis in the first instance.  Why do they not keep them in sanatoria until such time as they are cured and not put them into these places which caused the disease in the first instance?</P>
    <P>There is another matter on which the Minister might take action.  I wonder if he would give consideration to revising if at all possible the ridiculous density figures which at present apply to housing.  Land is very dear now and whenever we are driving into the larger cities or even into some of the <Col N="121" /> smaller towns we see the result of this in the policy of ribbon development&mdash; long lines of newly-constructed houses along the road on either side, according to certain densities evidently laid down by the Department in years gone by.  The time has come for a revision of that.  Town planners live in a world of their own.  They talk about open spaces, Utopias and the ratepayers suffer <i>pro rata.</i></P>
    <P>In the short time at his disposal I suppose the Minister will not be able to speak about those gentlemen.  I suppose that in time the Town Planning Act of 1934 will be discovered to be completely outmoded in the light of existing circumstances.  The time may come when there will be an outcry about these monstrosities.  Every year my plea is directed against these town planners.  They get very substantial fees.  They are like absentee landlords. I have never seen a town planner in Limerick since I became a member of the local authority.  He is a mysterious individual in Merrion Square who sends down his observations which I am glad to say in most instances are overruled by our very active city manager.</P>
    <P>The public should be made aware why exactly local authorities are not adopting the town plan.  I raised the matter twice and the city manager told me on both occasions that I knew perfectly well why we were not adopting it.  I nodded knowingly.  I did not know but evidently I should have known.  I think many other people and members of local authorities throughout the State are also nodding knowingly.  There must be some reason for not adopting it.  Is it that it would cost the local authority a very substantial amount to acquire property and compensate the owners?  Is it not an appalling state of affairs that a highly respectable individual in this State, being civic minded, and interested in his own business affairs, had to go to the High Court with an action for specific performance or whatever the legal phraseology is?</P>
    <P>We have in Limerick a Ring Road. Deputies will hardly credit this but if any Deputy passing through Limerick would like to call on me, I shall show it to him.  On the approach from Dublin <Col N="122" /> you swing to the south.  This road goes through some of the best property in the city but where it passes through housing schemes on derelict sites it is 180 feet wide.  Eventually it will bypass the city so that you just come from Dublin, go up the Ring Road, bypass the city and go on to Cork. Of course, on the road down to Lahinch or Clare people may have to go through the heart of the city itself and might suffer a little undue delay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but eventually they get out.  The Minister might make some observations on this very important matter.</P>
      <P>In regard to housing, Deputy O'Donnell must admit that when he was in charge of Local Government he was unfortunately in the position that finance was not available for housing to the extent to which it is now.  As the Minister for Finance has stated recently and as the Minister for Local Government has also remarked on several occasions, no scheme for the housing of the working classes will be held up for lack of finance.  It is well to face the fact, however, that we have a smaller proportion of people employed on the construction of houses than at a similar period last year.  I do not think it is correct to say that that is entirely due to the housing needs being met. As a result of the economic or financial crisis in the second half of 1956 and the start of 1957, local bodies brought their work on housing and planning to a full stop and in many instances they have not geared themselves up again to progress with their schemes to such an extent that their activities would be reflected in the Statistical Abstract showing the number of houses and the number of men employed on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do think, however, that the members of local authorities of all Parties should combine to clear the slums in their areas as expeditiously as possible. We hear people say that they would rather see a programme planned and so many houses built over a number of years rather than have building done in a burst and then having the building personnel idle.  That is all <Col N="123" /> correct in my opinion because if properly planned there are sufficient projects to occupy the building trade for quite a long time.  In this connection I should like to mention the Department of Education.  Although it would be more relevant on the Vote for that Department, the question of building has been mentioned and I do not think I am out of order in making this statement.  The only suggestion some people have for maintaining employment in the building industry is that we should spread out the building of houses over a long number of years, but in the building of schools alone, we could absorb many more people than could be absorbed in the building of houses.  If the school building programme were carried out in a realistic and vigorous manner by the Department of Education, in time the building industry would recover.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that the building of schools would provide employment for people in this industry and would absorb those who have become idle due to the solution of the housing problem.  I should like the Minister to clarify one point for me in relation to tenant purchase schemes.  I have heard a number of Deputies on both sides of the House, who are members of local authorities with many years' experience, ask this question: &ldquo;Why should a local authority spend more on keeping an old house, their property, in repair down through the years?  Why not vest it in the tenant?&rdquo;  We tried to do this in a more modern scheme in Limerick recently and we found the cost would be completely unattractive to the tenant. Is there any foundation for the suggestion made by so many Deputies that if the tenants of the local authority houses bought out their houses from the local authority a burden would be taken off the ratepayers? The annual maintenance charges in Limerick were £21,000 last year for corporation property.  Deputies will appreciate that houses built in the last ten years do not need very much maintenance. It is the old property which <Col N="124" /> entails most expenditure.  If it is old property, it can, by reasonable repayments, become the property of the existing tenant and made worth while. In other words, it would become the tenant's property over a 20-year period and the repayments would be near to what the tenant is paying in rent.  I think it would have a very large say in the rates throughout the State.</P>
      <P>Year in, year out, the cost of maintenance of a road or property has become prohibitive not alone in the cities but throughout the country.  The huge amount expended by some county councils on cottage repairs is fantastic. It represents a burden on existing and future ratepayers for many years to come.</P>
      <P>The Minister has shown himself to be most courteous to all Deputies, as was his predecessor, Deputy O'Donnell. Possibly Deputy O'Donnell, through no fault of his own, but because he was a member of an unfortunate Coalition Government, had not the same facilities at his disposal as the present Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening statement, the Minister gave the House what might be termed a sober appraisal of the present position.  He says there has been a continued fall in the past five years in the volume of work in progress on local authority housing.  Though that is a fair and truthful statement, it is not a pleasant one, in view of the fact that successive Ministers, during these five years, treated the House and the country to statements as to the dynamism that would be applied to housing.  The Minister's statement is qualified.  He goes on to say&mdash;his statement is a fair one &mdash;he believes that part of the reason for the continuous and steady fall for five years&mdash;not for one year or two years but for five years&mdash;is that the demand in certain areas for local authority housing has eased off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the smaller towns and rural areas, one wonders whether this demand has eased off because of the satisfaction of the claims of the residents in these areas, or because fewer people are living there now.  Might it be correct to hazard the guess that an estimate of the housing needs throughout <Col N="125" /> the various parts of the country&mdash; I think the estimate was made about 1947&mdash;was based at least on the assumption of a continuation of a certain level of population and on the expectation that, by providing accommodation in urban and rural areas, there might be some encouragement to the people to remain at home?  Would it be considered that these efforts, to some extent, have not proved quite as fruitful as they should?  I just refer to that matter and desire that my remarks should be related mainly to the areas where, we are informed, the demand has eased off.</P>
    <P>In the City of Dublin area&mdash;it may be true also in the case of Cork City and Limerick City&mdash;I do not think the needs of our people for proper accommodation have by any means been satisfied.  On the front page of this evening's <i>Evening Press,</i> there is an excellent picture of 46 families who have been housed in what are termed &ldquo;luxury flats&rdquo;.  How many hundreds of families in Dublin were seeking accommodation in those 46 flats? Quite a few, I am afraid.</P>
    <P>It is true that, within the urban area, a situation has developed which I think is unparalleled since the housing drive started.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this peculiar situation.  It is that, while sites are available on the perimeter of the city for housing development, building work is not going on mainly because of a fear that, in the present general situation in our capital city, families who, under present legislation, would be entitled to be housed in priority, will not accept accommodation four or five miles from the city centre.  I do not intend to apportion blame or responsibility for that state of affairs.  I refer to it as a most unpleasant fact and I will state briefly what I consider to be the main reason for it.</P>
    <P>To live in a house four or five miles from the place where you work, possibly three or four miles from the place where your children may have to go to school, possibly three or four miles from a centre in which your wife can, with any surety, obtain goods at a competitive price, means that the family requires not only a steady income but <Col N="126" /> a reasonably good one.  The position to-day in this city of ours is that there are too many families without such steady income, without such good income, and too many with what might be termed almost no income at all. Consequently, while I believe that there is absolutely no technical, administrative, official or financial reason for delay in building, at least in one portion of the perimeter surrounding the city there is this very serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to another fact, that is, that schemes sanctioned in 1957-58 amounted to some £3,000,000. That again&mdash;I am subject to correction on this&mdash;must constitute an almost all-time low record since building got under way again properly in 1948.  It can be confirmed by the fact that there are fewer workers engaged in local authority building and fewer dwellings under construction than at any time previously.  The statement made by Deputy O'Malley that building work of another kind, of a kind not under the control of the local authority, would take up the slack in employment in the building industry, is a statement which would have to be taken and examined very carefully, because I know of no activity which provides more work in building than cottage schemes.  Employment on the building of flats in the central city area, while most desirable from the point of view of those requiring accommodation, does not provide as high a level of employment as employment on house construction.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he felt we should concentrate on the elimination of unfit dwellings.  That is a sentiment, and I trust an aim and an objective, with which we can all join wholeheartedly, particularly Deputies representing the urban areas and particularly in a city like Dublin, which many years ago had the reputation of having the worst slums in Europe. To-day, after years of activity, it still contains far too many unfit dwellings.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to indicate the desirability of making provision, and I think he has some provisions in the Bill which is to come before the Dáil to-morrow, for efforts to prevent obsolescence and efforts to keep existing dwellings in reasonably good <Col N="127" /> repair and to ensure that those existing dwellings which have not got proper water or toilet facilities will be supplied with these necessaries.  However, if I may, I will sound a slight note of warning in this regard.  It is most desirable to repair a dwelling, but from experience in the City of Dublin, it is complete suicide, both from a financial and every other point of view, to recondition a dwelling.  It is better by far to borrow a bulldozer, level the building to the ground and then build on the site a residence, or a house, conforming to modern ideas of accommodation.</P>
    <P>There are, I suppose, thousands of dwellings remaining in Dublin which in some learned quarters were termed fine Georgian dwellings.  The only fine things about the Georgian dwellings were the drawing-rooms and the parlours. The basements were constructed for people to look after their one-time masters and therefore it was not necessary for the basements to be provided with proper ventilation or light.  The rooms at the top of these so-called marvellous works of architecture get smaller and smaller as you go higher and higher, and to think in terms of the State or local authority making grants of any significant size to permit buildings like these to be reconditioned for the purpose of letting to unfortunate tenants, would be most deplorable.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister and his advisers to take a walk down Gardiner Street, Summerhill or Seán MacDermott Street, and if they have a little energy to toil up the staircases in those reconditioned dwellings in those areas.  They will soon discover, as we in Dublin discovered, that even local authorities, with the best intentions in the world and with the blessing of a Department of Local Government and a Minister for Local Government, can make some terrible mistakes. Here are dwellings on which very considerable expenditure was incurred not too many years ago and the local authority is finding it most difficult to let them, even though they are situated almost within 300 yards of the centre of the City of Dublin.  I would <Col N="128" /> suggest that inducements and assistance to persons, groups, societies and local authorities to repair and keep houses in a fit condition should also contain a clause that this type of house be excluded.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to refer to a matter raised here already, that is, the question of the subvention by the Government and local authorities to assist tenants to meet the rents of their houses.  In looking at this problem&mdash;the cost of providing a house and the cost of maintaining a house or a flat and the rent paid by the tenant&mdash;I wonder if any regard is given to the fact that in providing a proper, modern, sanitary dwelling, the State and the local authority combined may, in effect, be saving the citizens from the results of having people live in overcrowded and insanitary dwellings?</P>
    <P>In making a contribution for this purpose, national and local authorities are saving themselves from heavy expenditure which might have to be met subsequently under other Departments, such as health services.  We have seen a falling trend in recent years, and all sides of the House are happy that there is a falling off, in the demand for a certain type of hospital accommodation.  It is not necessary or desirable to discuss the causes of this very welcome development. Certainly, I think nobody can deny that dwellinghouses for the families of our nation contribute to the general well-being of the nation.  Therefore, consideration should be given at all times to the fact not that national and local authorities are making a contribution to an individual family, but that their contribution is to the families of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which might well be taken into account when considering this much discussed question of local authority rents.  It is a factor inherent in and inseparable from the whole problem, that is, the incidence and effect of the interest charges.  In recent years, the interest rates have continued to increase and have placed a heavier burden on the State, local authorities and the country than any increase in the actual building costs of local authority cottages and flats.  I <Col N="129" /> would suggest that some consideration should be given to the possibility of having fixed interest rates for moneys provided for such essential social schemes as the housing of people under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.</P>
    <P>There is another point which merits consideration, particularly at this time.  We in this country possess an almost archaic outlook when we come to consider the housing standards we are aiming at.  The situation varies in the rural areas.  Mainly due to the fact that the housing situation was so utterly deplorable in the city, it has been accepted for a long number of years that to provide a single room for a man or woman, or even for an old couple, was a sufficiently high standard to aim at, so long as the room had the essential sanitary and cooking facilities.  For many years, and up to recently, it has been accepted that a house with three or four rooms &mdash;two bedrooms and a kitchen and a parlour or three bedrooms and a fairly large living-room&mdash;was adequate for a normal family.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered, particularly when fairly ambitious plans have been brought forward for the construction of houses, whether we are still really living in the Dark Ages.  No single unmarried man contemplating matrimony and coming to the State, the local authority, an insurance company or anyone else would think of seeking a loan for a house unless it had at least five rooms&mdash;three bedrooms and two reception rooms&mdash;and in cases an additional room.  Yet we have been to a great extent patting ourselves on the back if we say to a man who has a wife and three or four grown children: &ldquo;There you are.  There is the key of a house; the house has three bedrooms and a room downstairs.&rdquo;  In the course of a few years, those families grow up and the house becomes overcrowded according to modern housing conditions. The Minister may not be able to deal with that on this occasion, but perhaps he would take a look some time at that problem.  Either we are endeavouring to provide decent accommodation or we are not.  I submit in all seriousness that four small rooms for a mixed family&mdash;father and mother, <Col N="130" /> possibly three girls and two boys&mdash;is completely inadequate nowadays.</P>
    <P>While I am on this question of housing, may I be permitted to raise a matter which has been the cause of some concern for a long period?  How does it happen that a scheme for the construction of houses in an area, consisting of 400 or 500 houses, and embodying space for a school, a church, a civic centre and shops to serve the needs of the people who will live in those houses when they are constructed&mdash;and in these cases the scheme must be approved by the Minister&mdash;can be prejudiced as regards its full development within a matter of months of the plans being passed?  For instance, the Department approves the building of 600 houses in a certain area.  They insist, quite rightly, on provision for playgrounds, a school centre, a shopping centre and so on. On at least a dozen occasions in the last few years, the same Department has come along and given permission to people to build shops on the very perimeter of that scheme.  As a consequence, in some of the better planned schemes in this city, there are shopping sites still derelict five and six years after the houses have been built and occupied.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that we have been suffering in recent years, not only from a lack of understanding and a lack of co-operation between local authorities and the Department, but also from a sense of confusion in the Minister's own Department.  It is inconceivable that a Minister would say there must be a space for 12 shops in a newly planned scheme and then, six months later, say that on the edge of that scheme he will permit the building of six shops.  The 12 shops go and the site, which may have been purchased and earmarked and designed, is just useless.  The difficulty is that, as far as Dublin is concerned, in regard to that problem, nothing can be done now as we have about reached the end of our perimeter development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manley was kind enough here to suggest in the course of his learned discourse that this is what might be termed a Dublin Parliament.  Well, if it is, the Dublin Deputies must be either all dumb or all so impressed <Col N="131" /> with the ability of their friends from the rural areas that they fail to make their mark on this Chamber.  Possibly Deputy Manley has some difficulty in counting.  The City of Dublin represents, I think, one-fifth of our population to-day.</P>

      <P>Deputy Manley was referring to something else.  The Minister mentioned road safety.  I do not know if there is any single factor which can contribute to road safety in present circumstances.  It seems that when thousands of pounds are spent on removing a dangerous corner and providing <Col N="132" /> what is considered to be a reasonably safe and easy corner to negotiate, it frequently happens that at some place where there has never been an accident in living memory, a series of accidents occur in a very short time.  There may be a number of reasons, such as excessive speed, and there, one of the main difficulties is that no matter how expert a driver may be, if his car reaches a certain speed, it takes a long distance to stop it in case of emergency.  I think this, too, has a bearing on the matter: we are by nature considered to be a courteous race, very pleasant and hospitable, but we appear to suffer from a particular disease in that, when we get behind the wheel of a car, everybody else is wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>That fault may be international, but many of us forget, as Deputy O'Malley said, that when one is behind the wheel of a motor car, he may have under his control a weapon more dangerous than a shotgun.  I do not know if legislation can remedy the situation, but I would need to be blind if I did not think that there is one factor which contributes substantially to the dangers of the road.  Anybody who cares to take a run in a car or bus, or go for a few miles outside the city on a bicycle on any evening may see with his own eyes the facts to which I refer.  He will see queues of motor vehicles outside places of refreshment, many of them remaining there from the time the premises opens until it closes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, in many of the cases that appear in the courts where somebody has been involved in an accident, sometimes with damage resulting to the car, sometimes injury to a human being, or sometimes involving the life of a human being, one thing always emerges clearly&mdash;that at no time was the driver of the vehicle under the influence of drink.  He may be sitting discussing the political situation for three hours, taking some refreshment at the same time, but when he goes out afterwards and gets into the car, he is perfectly sober.  We know modern cars need very little driving: you turn the key in the ignition, put your foot on <Col N="133" /> the accelerator and then, under the conditions I have described, there is death in the air.  Too often, unfortunately, it is not the death of the person in that condition but of some perfectly innocent person.  This aspect of the matter has not received sufficient attention. Above all, the advisability of restricting speed limits in built-up areas with large concentrations of population and large numbers of young children should be examined once more.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley, I think, spoke on the desirability, in his opinion, of spending moneys available in the Local Loan Fund on main roads instead of county roads.  If I attempted to enter into that discussion, a number of Deputies much more qualified to speak would deal with me, but I may be permitted to guess what may be the development of these beautiful main roads.  In recent years, they appear to contribute to hurrying the population to the seaports and out of the country. Perhaps if we did not travel so fast, if people found it more difficult to get out, we might have a larger population. Some of these very fine roads are certainly pleasant to travel on if you are in a hurry but many of them because they have been straightened out contribute more to traffic hazards than almost any other modern development.</P>
    <P>Might I suggest that any local authority considering straightening out a corner and providing nice stretches of 300 or 400 yards should accept a Dublin Deputy's view that they should do it only if they are also providing a dual carriage way.  An enormous number of accidents appear to result from head-on collisions on widened main roads.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by asking the Minister to show initiative in encouraging the development of amenity-schemes in various areas.  Housing of itself is most desirable but a modern population requires not only to be housed but also needs playing grounds and sports-fields.  There is one area in Dublin City which I was informed the other evening has no park development, and it is an area which cries out for development in that way.  It is known as the Bull Island.  I mention it particularly because, while those of our <Col N="134" /> citizens who can afford to drive out in the summer time to the mountains of Wicklow and to the strands to the north and south of Dublin have their own means of transport for themselves and their families, other citizens are not so fortunate.  Yet within three miles of the centre of the city, there is situated the Bull Island which, if developed properly and made more readily accessible, could be of immense and almost untold value for the recreation of the citizens of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the present Minister for Local Government is a very lucky man in that while successive Governments had to get rid of the great slum areas that formerly existed, he now looks likely to enjoy the pleasant sensation of being in at the kill.  It looks likely that during his term of office slum clearance in this country will be completed, thanks be to God.  I have heard Deputies many times in this House say that we ought not be parochial.  I prefer to be parochial. I was sent here to represent a county constituency; I want to talk about my own constituency, to praise my own constituency, to complain about my own constituency, and to blame my own constituency wherever necessary.</P>
      <P>I do not think I should speak at length on housing as the Minister is introducing a Housing Bill to-morrow. It was Deputy O'Malley who said we should not say too much on housing in view of that, and we shall have a better opportunity to talk about it when that Bill is introduced.  In my opinion Deputies from the other side of the House, since I came here, never cared whether or not houses were wanted, whether or not money was available, but always howled for more housing schemes, bigger housing schemes and better housing schemes, but none of those Deputies came in here to-day. I would prefer to be straight about it. I do not blame the present Minister for cutting down on housing in various areas as I think the demand for housing has fallen, due to emigration and the constant rise in the cost of living, coupled with higher and higher rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people in Waterford who I am sure would like to have <Col N="135" /> new houses, but they have not made application to the local authority because they could not pay for a house at present high rents.  When houses were built a few years ago materials were cheaper, money was cheaper, wages were lower and people who secured houses then were lucky.  The Minister is now faced with very high costs and also with the problem that the remnants of slum populations are looking for houses at very low rents, rents at which it is economically impossible to build houses.  They are asking that the Minister should subsidise them and that is one of the difficulties he must face.  We have met this problem in Waterford, to the best of our ability, by allowing people to swop their houses.  Where people are better off and want to go into new corporation houses we allow them to do so and let their old houses to people less well off, and I am sure that has been done in a lot of other places.</P>
    <P>I am sure there must have been some advance made in regard to the traffic code but, taking the overall picture, there is no use in blaming motorists or men who drive horses and carts, or even cyclists and pedestrians.  There is lack of courtesy on the roads and that is one of the main reasons for a lot of the accidents that occur.  There is carelessness and a kind of &ldquo;don't-care&rdquo; attitude.  A lot of people do not seem to care about driving regulations, traffic notices or anything else.</P>
    <P>Driving to the Dáil to-day I saw an extraordinary incident.  I drove across from Stephen's Green towards the D.B.C. where there is a three-way traffic junction, two streams from two sides of the Green and the third traffic stream coming from Baggot Street. There seemed to be a bit of confusion in the centre where there is a traffic island and I saw that a man had pulled up there to drop two passengers&mdash;not, mind you, on the traffic island but in the middle of a stream of traffic.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister can do very little about that but I quote it as an instance of carelessness and discourtesy.</P>

      <P>At the same time this is my only chance to mention it.  When I wished to draw attention to such matters on the Vote for the Department of Justice it was suggested to me that it would be better to speak on this Estimate, and I am trying to saddle the Minister with it now. Lorries are becoming bigger and bigger and are carrying more weight than ever before.  That is especially the case now as many railway lines are being closed down, particularly in the Minister's own constituency, and these heavy lorries will play havoc with the roads.  Much money has been voted by this House for road work but these heavy vehicles are doing a great amount of damage to roads, and I would suggest to the Minister that after a certain length of time the size of lorries should be restricted.  We have had to provide a great deal of money in the Estimate to keep the railways going.  Then we allow even bigger and bigger lorries to come on the roads and take the heavy traffic from the railways. I submit to the Minister that that is something to which he should give his attention.</P>
      <P>As far as machinery on the road is concerned, we seem to have committed ourselves to a great deal of money through the local authorities buying a lot of these monsters which eat up the fences and portions of the road.  As a matter of fact, I saw work in progress which was being carried out by two machines.  Quite a number of men were watching.  I discovered that the people watching had come from the labour exchange.  It is a very sad commentary indeed to have men signing on at the labour exchange looking at machines doing the work which they could be doing and be paid for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not enormous Budgets like the other rich countries in the world. Perhaps this Road Fund money would be better spent on men with picks and shovels and on men using horses and carts.  We might not have the same output but we would have fewer men going to the labour exchange.  I think that problem could be dealt with in this way.  One or two local authorities should give this idea a trial.  Some of these machines cost thousands of <Col N="137" /> pounds.  I am sure their life is not very long.  The thousands of pounds paid for these machines and the thousands used for their maintenance would pay a very big number of men. If one were balanced against the other, it is probable that the number of men who would be so employed would do as much work.  That is something we should think about.  It is a tragedy to see men signing at the labour exchange looking at machines doing the work they should be doing.  I think we should stop buying the machinery.</P>

      <P>I do not want counties to throw their machinery over the cliffs.  I will say that some counties may not have bought as much machinery as other counties.  A scheme could be tried out with the old methods.  Of course, if the Deputy would prefer to have machines doing the work, there is plenty of time for him to get up on his feet and make an appeal to the Minister to have the machines.</P>
      <P>The reduction of rates seems to be something that is in everybody's mind. The matter of rates is one of the functions left to members of local authorities. I am glad to speak to a Minister who has been a member of a local authority.  That is a great responsibility on members of local authorities and I do not want to take it from them.  It is good that they do it, but for some years past when the officials of local authorities bring in rates estimates at rates meetings, protests are made.  For example, the estimate might be in the neighbourhood of 38/- and after a good deal of wrangling a rate of 34/- is struck, with no direction to the officials as to what the 4/- is to be taken from.  Everybody leaves the place and says: &ldquo;What good boys they are; they took 4/- off the estimates.&rdquo; The following year there will be a deficit on current expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This seems to have gone on in various counties and very big deficits have been built up.  I, and, I am sure, other members of local authorities and members of the Government, have never been afraid to borrow money to build houses or put in water schemes or schemes of that nature, but actually <Col N="138" /> what this means is that the manager has to go to the bank and get an overdraft.  He is actually borrowing money for current expenditure.  This is a matter that will have to be looked into right away because it looks to me that many local authorities will find themselves very much in the red if matters are allowed to go on for another few years as they have been going on in the past.  Whenever at a rates meeting there are items to be cut, the headings should be given and the amounts stated under each heading.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the question of the rates, there is the matter of valuations. The Valuation Office is a really good office.  The people there are the same as the income-tax men.  They strike you down and that is all about it.  You do not know where the blow comes from.  They do their duty.  It was always an extraordinary thing to me how the local authority or whoever tipped off the Valuation Office, got away with it.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government has no responsibility for the Valuation Office, as has been pointed out to other Deputies.  There is a separate Vote which comes before this House in respect of the Valuation Office.</P>

      <P>What I am driving at is this.  The Commissioners of Valuation are in Dublin.  If someone puts in a new front in his premises in Waterford, who tells the Commissioners of Valuation about it except some official of the local authority down below? That is what I am trying to get at. It is extraordinary how they have been able to get away with this all down the years.  The tradition in Ireland was always against the landlords.  The landlords were always accused of the mortal sin of raising rents if the tenants improved their land or buildings. In this instance, our own local authorities arrange the machinery whereby a man's valuation is put up if he improves his premises.</P>
