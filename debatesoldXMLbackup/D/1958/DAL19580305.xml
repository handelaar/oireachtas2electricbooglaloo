      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether in relation to his statement that the realisation of higher standards for workers must follow, not precede, increased output and efficiency, similar considerations apply in the national interest to the profits and dividends of industrialists and businessmen.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Indeed, I find it difficult to see by what means higher business profits could, in present conditions, be obtained except by greater output and efficiency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether there is any record of any case between 1923 and 1957 in which a Minister refused to receive all the members from any constituency when such members requested to be received unaccompanied by any other person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will realise, to get the information asked for by him would necessitate a search of the daily records of all Government Departments over a period of 35 years.  I do not think that the value of the information sought by the Deputy would justify the expenditure of official time that would be involved in such a search.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, the question seems to be based on the assumption that there <Col N="980" /> was a case in 1958 in which a Minister refused to receive all the members of the Dáil for a particular constituency when such members requested to be received unaccompanied by any other person.  I am not aware that there was, in fact, any such case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <P>I, personally, have no information, one way or the other, as to whether any member of the last Government refused to receive a deputation of the members of the Dáil for a particular constituency.</P>
      <P>In view of the implication underlying the Deputy's question, I should add that I am not aware of any case in which a member of the present Government has refused to receive such a deputation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> A grant of £22,000 was made by An Foras Tionscal towards the cost of constructing a factory at Portumna.  The grant was for the construction of the factory premises only and no part of it was used for the purchase of plant or machinery, the whole of which was provided at the cost of the firm concerned. The agreement between An Foras Tionscal and the firm provided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the factory would not be disposed of, except with the consent of An Foras Tionscal, during a period of five years from June, 1955.  The firm has since transferred the ownership of the factory to An Foras Tionscal free of charge and the provision mentioned is, therefore, no longer applicable.  The closing of the factory was not contrary to the conditions on which the grant was made.</P>
    <P>An Foras Tionscal have advertised in the Press the availability of the factory for the purpose of a suitable industrial undertaking.  I understand that a number of inquiries has been received by An Foras Tionscal regarding the establishment of alternative industries in the factory.  It will be a matter for An Foras Tionscal to consider and approve of any proposals which may be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that such a campaign as he proposes is already being conducted and has been conducted for some years past by the National Agricultural and Industrial Development Association.  The campaign has had the full support of the Government.  I have this year commended specially to industrialists the St. Patrick's Day parade which is being organised by the N.A.I.D.A.</P>
      <P>The promotion of the purchase of Irish goods involves propaganda and publicity.

He said that the N.A.I.D.A. had been carrying on a buy Irish campaign for many years, and their efforts are commendable; but would he not agree that that is not sufficient, in view of the extreme danger to Irish manufacturers?  It will be difficult for Irish manufacturers to expand and increase exports, but it will be just as difficult for them to retain the Irish market.  Will the Minister agree?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister state what the Government's policy is in regard to children who do not come within the one to five years of age group?

      <P>As it had become apparent towards the end of 1951 that the income of the Hospitals' Trust Fund would not be sufficient to enable the hospital building programme to proceed at the level of activity then contemplated, the then Government decided in principle that grants-in-aid should be made available from State funds for the purpose.  A grant-in-aid was made available for the first time during the financial year 1953-54 and was continued each year until the financial year 1956-57.

      <P>It appears from the Minister's reply that the grant-in-aid was first provided towards the end of 1951 by the then Government to finance the building then contemplated. In view of that reply would the Minister explain his statement to the Dáil on the 20th February of this year to the effect that the reason why building projects could not be proceeded with was because of the manner in which the Trust Fund was looted by the Minister's predecessors?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, with the greatest of pleasure.  The position in relation to the grant-in-aid was that <Col N="995" /> though the sum of £1,250,000 was provided for the year 1956-57, due to a stop Order issued by the Minister for Finance only £750,000 of that grant-in-aid was drawn.  Towards the end of 1956-57 the then Minister, having decided not to seek more than £750,000 in the grant-in-aid, thus reducing the prospective income of the fund in 1956-57 by £500,000, also decided to increase the deficit provision to £1,250,000 in 1957-58, when he would not be in office, instead of by the figure of £700,000 which he had included in the July, 1956, Estimates.  By this decision the then Minister reduced the moneys that would otherwise have been available in the fund for capital work in this year by £1,050,000.</P>

      <P>As explained in reply to a question last week by Deputy Esmonde in relation to the Health Act, 1953, these Acts, in addition to providing services for persons not previously entitled to such services, provide a revised statutory basis for services previously provided under other legislative codes. In addition, increases in recent years in price levels and in rates of remuneration have rendered completely out of date any estimates which were made in respect of the earlier Acts.  They have, moreover, rendered it impossible to distinguish between increases in the costs of old services and increases in expenditure resulting from extensions of such services or the introduction of new services.</P>

The governors were informed last August <Col N="999" /> that it had been decided that the Garden of Remembrance scheme should proceed and the site should be handed back to the Commissioners of Public Works as soon as possible. The site is at present partly occupied by temporary units, which, by agreement with the hospital authorities, are to be replaced by new permanent buildings in the hospital's own grounds.  The plans for the permanent units are being prepared as expenditiously as possible and agreement has been reached on the design of the new buildings, consisting of an infants' unit and an extension of the nurses' home.  The working drawings for the nurses' home extension have been completed and the bills of quantities are being prepared.  It is expected that the working drawings for the infants' unit will be completed and ready for the quantity surveyor within the next fortnight.  It should be possible, accordingly, to invite tenders and commence work on the erection of the new buildings well before the end of the summer.  The existing units on the Garden of Remembrance site will be removed immediately the new buildings are available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst a detailed congestion survey, as such, has not been made in this district, it is manifest from the extensive inspection work carried out to date that considerable congestion obtains in the townlands referred to&mdash;which, incidentally, have long been vested&mdash;and that the general pattern of rateable valuation in the area is £5 to £6 per holding.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made by the Land Commission to secure additional land which, together with the 130 acres already on hands in the district&mdash;including some lands vacated by migrants &mdash;can be applied towards the relief of the prevailing congestion.

The question of acquiring the turbary was considered some years ago and was rejected. Fresh representations were received in recent months by the Land Commission urging acquisition of the Cloniffe portion of the bog with a view to its development for allotment to local people but I am not yet in a position to say what the outcome will be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) Where regulations under sub-section (1) of this section fix, in relation to a greyhound race track on which the board maintains a totalisator or to part of such track, maximum charges in respect of bookmakers carrying on their business, the charges shall be so fixed as not to exceed ten times the charges fixed by the regulations (or by other regulations for the time being in force) in respect of persons who are not bookmakers or, in case regulations under sub-section (5) of this section for the time being in force fix a minimum charge in relation to the track or part, the aggregate of ten times the said charges in respect of persons who are <Col N="1034" /> not bookmakers and that minimum charge.</P>
    <P>(4)  Notwithstanding that regulations under sub-section (1) of this section fix, in relation to a greyhound race track or part thereof, maximum charges in respect of bookmakers carrying on their business, any bookmaker may, with his consent, be charged, for admission to the track or part, a charge exceeding that which would be appropriate in accordance with the regulations, and such charge shall not constitute a contravention of the regulations.</P>
    <P>I think this is as reasonable a solution as can be got to this very vexed question of the maximum charges to be made for admitting bookmakers to greyhound racing tracks.  It has two aspects.  The first is in relation to tracks on which totalisators are maintained by the board.  We propose to proceed on this basis: as the minimum charge will accrue to the board in substitution for the proceeds of the levy which otherwise the bookmakers might be obliged to pay, we should take that as our starting point and say that this has no relation to the question of admission to the track or to the amount to be paid to the owner of the greyhound race track for permitting the bookmakers to go on the track and conduct their business there.  Having provided for a minimum charge in the case of totalisator tracks where it is proposed to dispense with the levy and substitute the minimum charge, we take that minimum charge and say in addition to it, the track shall be at liberty to charge up to a maximum of ten times the amount fixed by regulation for admission of the ordinary public. I think that is the best solution that I can find for this very vexed question. It occupied a very great deal of the time of the House and I think it is acceptable to all Parties.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment introduced by the Minister in which he recants 90 per cent. of the tedious tripe for which he and his colleagues were responsible when this Bill was before this House during the period of office <Col N="1035" /> of the last Government.  I have no particular fault to find with this arrangement, but I despise the conduct of Deputies who now sponsor the proposal before the House remembering the records behind them.  I desire to record that it is conduct of this kind which brings this House into disrepute &mdash;this revelation that 90 per cent. of what Deputies, deemed to be responsible Deputies, said, can now be repudiated and swallowed by them within 12 months of their having said it.  This kind of conduct tempts me to say more, but I think what I have already said goes to the heart of the matter and I am relieved at least to notice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As one of the interested parties and possibly one of the more loquacious members of the House when this Bill was before the House on a previous occasion, I wish to say, to borrow an expression from the former Minister himself, that Deputy Dillon is talking complete balderdash. He suggests here to-day that by this amendment introduced by the Minister we have gone back on certain principles which we advocated on a previous Bill.  That is not so.  In fact, due to pressure by this side of the House Deputy Dillon himself, when he was Minister, introduced an amendment to Section 48.  This section now before us does not meet with my full approval but at least it goes so far as to satisfy to a certain extent all the interests of the industry involved, the track owners and the bookmakers.  If Deputy Dillon were to take the trouble of looking up the report of the debate when this section was discussed previously, he would discover no inconsistency whatsoever <Col N="1036" /> in the present attitude of this side of the House.</P>

He now informs Deputy O'Malley that sub-section (4) disappears in certain contingencies. Sub-section (4) never disappears; it is part of the Bill and it provides, as far as I can see without reference to the presence or absence of the totalisator that &ldquo;notwithstanding that regulations under sub-section (1) of this section fix, in relation to a greyhound race track or part thereof, maximum charges in respect of bookmakers carrying on their business, any bookmaker may with his consent be charged for admission to the track or part, a charge exceeding that which would be appropriate in accordance with the regulations, and such charge shall not constitute a contravention of the regulations.&rdquo;  Either that means what it says or it does not.  Does it mean what it says or is there some concealed phrase there which says that if the totalisator is not installed on a track sub-section (4) does not operate?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 30, line 38, to delete &ldquo;50&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;25&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is intended, if accepted, to reduce the normal strength of the Irish Coursing Club, all co-opted, from 50 to 25.  I understand that the strength of the Irish Coursing Club&mdash;which is a body elected for life and, to say the least of it, does not generally represent as a vocational body should, the interests of the breeders and owners&mdash;is now about 70.  The existing section of the Bill suggests that the strength should be 50 maximum and that there be no co-options to the Irish Coursing Club until the number goes below 50. Having regard to the functions that will be allocated to the Irish Coursing Club in the future, the number 50 is somewhat unwieldy and unworkable. It is for that reason that I put down amendment No. 5 and I would ask the Minister if he can see his way to accept it.</P>

I feel that the Irish Coursing Club can still perform very useful work and it is for that reason that I am so anxious that the strength of that body should be fixed at such a number as to make it workable.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to meet my requirements in this connection by deleting the figure 50 and inserting the figure 25.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendments.  I do not think <Col N="1039" /> they are necessary.  Apart from that, the figure 50 represents a measure of agreement which was secured not merely in relation to the 1958 Bill but also by the Minister for Agriculture, I think, in 1954, and the Minister for Agriculture in 1957, the late Senator Seán Moylan.  Apart from that, I think the number of co-opted members is not of any very great significance in so far as they are only entitled to attend and vote at the annual general meeting. Merely by reason of the fact that they are co-opted members, they cannot be members of the executive. If they are members of the Coursing Club and become representative members of the club, then, of course, they can be elected.  I think there is not anything to be gained by reducing the number below 50.</P>
      <P>When the affairs of the club are being reorganised and the Greyhound Industry Board is functioning smoothly and properly and acceptably to all persons, I think co-option to the club will be regarded as a very special honour and I do not see any reason why the members of the reconstituted club should be limited unduly as to the number of reputable persons upon whom the honour can be conferred.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is pretty obvious.  It suggests that the machinery constituting the new executive committee of the club and the standing committee of the club in future would be put into action more quickly.  The period allowed under the existing section of the Bill is far too long and there is certainly no necessity for it.  Reference is made to that arrangement in the Advisory Committee's report and that report certainly does not recommend that such a long period should be allowed.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept this amendment, because it <Col N="1040" /> I would be a pity if the general good that is likely to ensue as a result of this legislation were to be initially jeopardised by the fact that such a long period will elapse before the executive standing committee of the club and the executive committee will come into being.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy not to press this amendment. It would render the reconstitution of the club a work of very great difficulty. If the purposes of the Bill are to be fulfilled, then the reconstitution of the club and the reconstitution of the new executive committee must proceed smoothly and in such a way as not to cause any dislocation in the control of greyhound coursing and greyhound breeding.  I cannot see that that could be done in any much shorter time than that which is provided for in the existing schedule. There is no fear now that the reconstitution will not be carried out in the manner in which the Oireachtas would wish it to be, because under Section 26 a new sub-section has been introduced there which makes it clear that the appointment of members of the executive committee of the club shall be carried out subject to the supervision of the board.  That will mean, first of all, that there will be no ground for criticism as to the manner in which the new constitution is carried out and, as well as that, it should ensure smooth and harmonious working between the Coursing Club, on the one hand, and the board on the other.  I would ask the Deputy not to press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before leave to withdraw is granted, let us comment for a moment on this disgusting display of unctuous hypocrisy between the Deputy and the Minister.  The Deputy puts down his amendment in order to satisfy the neighbours in Listowel and the Minister gets up and pours forth this revolting stream of hypocrisy, swallowing every word he uttered when <Col N="1041" /> this Bill was before the House on another occasion.  I know the Minister to be mischievous in his activities, but there ought to be some standards of decency maintained.  I do not blame Deputies for trying to bring a little grist to their mill in their own areas. I strenuously object, however, to their trying to bring grist to their mill by denigrating their neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed Deputy Burke hopped out of his seat and fled out of the House when he heard Deputy Moloney getting up to make his attack, by innuendo, on the members of the Irish Coursing Club.  Then, when Deputy Burke saw that there was to be a little drama enacted between the Minister and Deputy Moloney, he came trotting back to his seat so as to show what a <Col N="1042" /> decent man he was.  I trust I may be pardoned, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for expressing my nausea and disgust at this revolting pantomime and for expressing the hope that we have seen the last of it and that now a Bill which is useful and which may achieve a desirable purpose, if properly administered, will be passed without any further display of indecent hypocrisy on the part of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this stage it is appropriate to recall the history of the Bill.  In 1951 a committee was set up by the Government of which I was then a member, to inquire into the greyhound industry and to report. Just immediately after that Government left office, the committee reported. There was then a Fianna Fáil Government for a period of three years, in the course of which no attempt whatever was made to introduce legislation here to implement the findings of that committee.  When our Government returned to office in 1954, this Bill substantially, as set out in the White Paper which was circulated with this Bill, was submitted to the House.  There was one fundamental difference.  It was sought in the Bill introduced by me to pay a compliment, and no more than that, to those who had carried on, under great difficulties, the administration of the greyhound industry down through the years from the time when they had first separated the Irish organisation from the British organisation which in the old days controlled coursing in this country.</P>
      <P>This House was delayed for months in the prosecution of a vicious vendetta by the present Minister for Health, mainly I believe against somebody who was dead and gone.  Every sort of detestable vituperation and disgraceful innuendo was sponsored by the present Minister, by Deputy Briscoe and, I think, by Deputy O'Malley.  I think that even Deputy Vivion de Valera was enrolled in that campaign.  Deputy Burke was wont to intervene at various stages of the proceedings to repudiate this conduct and to say that he disapproved of their vituperation and that the individuals whom his colleagues were concerned to defame and denigrate were decent, men but beyond doing that he made little contribution to check or arrest that disgraceful campaign of defamation and vendetta which was being pursued.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am directing the attention of the House to the fact that the contents of this Bill, which I think we should now pass, are virtually identical with the contents of the Bill which was opposed and made the occasion of this disgraceful vendetta in a previous Parliament.</P>
      <P>It is important for the House to know that, for the three years from 1951 to 1954 when this report was in the hands of the then Government, nothing whatever was done to give effect to its recommendations; and that when a Bill was introduced by the Government of which I was a member in 1954 to implement these findings, it was bitterly and viciously opposed by the members of the present Government Party.  I like to record for the record that but for the fact that this Bill, substantially, was introduced by me on the authority of the Government of which I was a member, it is highly unlikely that anything whatever would have been done to implement the findings of the committee which reported in 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> I am glad to think this Bill which is now about to pass was received by the present Opposition in a very different, spirit from that which was manifested by the present Government when they were in Opposition when a virtually identical Bill was before the House.  I hope we shall never have another instance of the misuse, in my judgment, of the procedures of this House such as we were witnesses of in the dispensing of the business which, so far as Dáil Eireann is concerned, I hope is now concluded.</P>
    <P>It is in the interests of this important industry that this Bill should now pass.  I believe it would have been very much better if it had been passed when it was first presented two years ago.  I believe a good deal of damage has been done by the vicious persecution that was attempted by the Fianna Fáil Party when this Bill was first under discussion in the House. However, I say now, with all the sincerity I can command, that, in the interests of the industry as a whole, I hope the disreputable conduct of the Fianna Fáil Opposition may now be decently buried in oblivion because it is very necessary that all those who are concerned for the welfare of the greyhound industry should forget what tranpired in the only too recent past and agree, all sides together, to co-operate in the future so that this industry will be built into what those of us who are concerned for it hope it may yet be.</P>
    <P>The greyhound industry ought to be of value to the State; and it can be of value to the State, and there are men associated with it down through the years who yet have valuable work to do on its behalf.  I trust that, in determining the personnel of the administrative bodies provided for in this Bill, the hateful atmosphere of vendetta will be forgotten and that the individuals chosen for the responsible work envisaged by this measure will be chosen on their merits and not on the personal predilection of members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I want to sound this note of warning. If the right men are chosen, this Bill will work and confer very material <Col N="1046" /> benefit on the country and the greyhound industry, but if the spirit of vendetta is suffered to prevail, and, by its light, the wrong men are installed here, then this Bill, instead of achieving the purpose for which it was designed, may well result in irretrievable disaster for the greyhound industry which would be a very great misfortune for this country.</P>
    <P>I have the name of no one in mind, but I press most urgently upon the Government that, when the committee of control and the other statutory bodies envisaged by this Bill are established, the best men should be chosen for the greyhound industry and that all considerations of personal political allegiance be laid aside and qualifications based on merit made the only consideration.</P>

      <P>I should like to correct some of the inaccuracies expressed by Deputy Dillon.  He accused the previous Fianna Fáil Government of laxity in introducing legislation on receiving the report on the greyhound industry from the Advisory Committee. I should like to point out to Deputy Dillon that he himself set up this Advisory Committee on 21st February, 1951, and that that report was handed in report form to the late Deputy Walsh when he was Minister for Agriculture on 18th January, 1952.  As the late Deputy Walsh stated when speaking in this House in answer to a point raised by Deputy Dillon on the report, that report had to be printed and circulated and unfortunately a very serious printers' strike took place at that time.  Apart from that, we had many other problems on our hands. We had a very serious mess to clear up from our predecessors and it was quite obvious that these other measures would take priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has suggested that there was opposition from the Fianna Fáil Benches, the object of which was to obstruct the passage of the previous Bill.  If that argument is brought to its logical conclusion, it would suggest that Deputy Dillon in the later days of the debate here before Christmas, 1956, saw his own Government's days coming to an end because it is completely <Col N="1047" /> illogical to suggest that the Fianna Fáil Party could have delayed the Bill in what should normally have been a five-year period of office.  The bee that Deputy Dillon had in his bonnet is still buzzing when he speaks of the personal vendetta of the Minister for Health.  As I said previously, that Minister does not require anyone to defend him and certainly he does not require me, but looking through the records of the debate, I have seen no personal references to any individuals, either living or dead, of a derogatory nature.  If Deputy Dillon wishes to suggest that there are innuendoes, and so on, that is a matter purely for himself and it is not the general conclusion drawn by the interested parties and the public generally.</P>
    <P>To-day a new era is dawning for the greyhound industry.  We should be very grateful to the members of the Advisory Committee for the long and arduous task which they performed. We should be grateful to all who contributed to this debate who were both critical and constructive in their suggestions.  While I think the Bill in its present form might not be entirely desirable from all aspects, a good job has been done.  It has tried to cater for all sections of the community, for the greyhound owners, for the breeders, the track owners and, I might say, to a fairly limited extent also, for the bookmakers.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly endorse the sentiments expressed by Deputy Dillon when he urged the Minister for Agriculture, having chosen the establishment date, to do all in his power to select the best possible men.  I sincerely trust that the three members of the Irish Coursing Club having been nominated in accordance with the terms of the Bill and the chairman having been appointed, the other three members will represent, as far as possible, specific sections of the industry, sections for which the three nominees of the Irish Coursing Club would not cater in the ordinary course of events.</P>
    <P>I hope the greyhound owners as such will be represented on the board and that the bookmakers, although there is no specific provisions written into the <Col N="1048" /> Bill, will also be represented&mdash;as they are on the Racing Board&mdash;particularly for the initial stages.  I might say also that I think a member of the board could be chosen who has good experience of the operation of the Totalisator Act of 1929, as brought into operation by the Racing Board in 1945.</P>
    <P>One of the other matters to which I wish to refer is that this legislation could not have come too soon.  The number of amendments which have come to the House and which were accepted by the previous Minister and by the present Minister have all strengthened the Bill.  No time has been wasted on irrelevancies; most of the debate has been constructive and has been of invaluable assistance to the Ministers who have had the task of introducing the legislation to control a very difficult industry.</P>
    <P>When I say that it could not have been brought in quickly enough, I should like to point out that it was only last week at the coursing at Clounanna that we had the unfortunate incident again of two bookmakers welshing on their responsibilities.  In one instance, it was unfortunate that one of the members of the public who did not get his money was a non-national.  The sooner this board is established and tackles its duties, the better for this sport and this industry which unfortunately has fallen on lean times and has lost the respect of the public generally. It has lost as essential feature for the success of any venture, that is, the confidence of the public as a whole.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that all parties concerned with the greyhound industry owe a debt of gratitude to the present Minister for his interest and his contributions to the debates on the previous occasion and the sympathetic manner in which he has agreed to certain of the amendments.  On the previous Bill, I would say that a certain amount of congratulation is due to the previous Minister even though, as I said, he had certain bees buzzing in his bonnet.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words mainly arising from the <Col N="1049" /> remarks made by Deputy Dillon.  Some of those remarks would be applicable only to me for the simple reason that this is the first time I have been elected to the House and some of the allegations made refer to certain things&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the personal attack is concerned, I have no evidence of any of my colleagues being actuated by that motive, and if Deputy Dillon wants to refer to personal attacks, all that he has to do is to read again the report of the Advisory Committee which he set up in 1951.  He will find in that report very serious references to some of the people whom he describes now as models in this industry.  Beyond that, I am not prepared to go.  I think that report speaks for itself.  Surely we cannot be accused of influencing what appeared in that report.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon makes an appeal to the Minister, when setting up the board, to get men of desirable qualifications. To that extent, I endorse his remarks and request the Minister&mdash;I am quite sure that our Minister can be depended on to do so&mdash;to get men who will be capable and efficient in representing the greyhound industry. I should like to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by Deputy O'Malley that all sections of the industry should be represented as far as possible, maybe not officially, but men who are capable of understanding the varied interests of the industry should be found for the board.  I think the Owners' and Breeders' Association, who can claim to represent a sizable proportion of the greyhound owners and breeders, deserve every consideration in relation to such appointments. An integral part of the whole industry are the bookmakers and I think they also deserve recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied that a good board will come from the various interests that make up this whole industry.  I have not the slightest doubt that the Minister will do a good job.  Deputy Dillon seems to doubt <Col N="1050" /> that this Party is capable of setting up a good board and it occurred to me that perhaps he would suggest his line-up for the board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The vendetta was carried on against the Irish Coursing Club.  It was smeared all over the place.  It is a kind of custom in the greyhound industry that all seem to smear one another, but the reason the Irish Coursing Club came in for most of the smearing was that they had warned people off from the time they had formed themselves into a body and from the time they had separated themselves from the English&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In particular, I wish to repudiate the suggestion which has been made by Deputy Lynch that the Fianna Fáil Government was deterred <Col N="1055" /> from taking action on the report of the Greyhound Advisory Tribunal because of certain pressures which had been brought to bear on them.  I should also like to correct the statement made by Deputy Dillon with reference to the time schedule of this Bill.  It is true that the Advisory Committee was set up by him, as he stated, on 21st February, 1951.  It is true that it did not report until the 18th January, 1952, when the Fianna Fáil Government had been in office for over eight months.  The report then presented was in typescript.  There was difficulty in having the report printed, as has been pointed out, and it was not actually printed and ready for circulation until November, 1953.  Early in 1953 consultations were opened with various interests and a submission was made to the Government.  After further discussion with the Irish Coursing Club final submissions were made to the Government at the end of 1953 and the drafting of a Bill was approved by the Fianna Fáil Government in February, 1954.  I hope the Deputy who hurled the charge across this House, a charge phrased in most disgraceful terms, implying that corrupt pressure, because that is what it would have been, had been brought to bear on the Fianna Fáil Government is now taking note of these dates.  In February, 1954, a Bill was approved for drafting and the draft Bill was received by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, very shortly after mid-summer of 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened between mid-summer, 1954, and July, 1955, when that draft Bill was introduced in the Dáil and circulated to Deputies?  That is quite a substantial time.  Who was bringing pressure to bear on the then Coalition Government?  Who was bringing pressure to bear upon the then Minister for Agriculture?  The Bill, which was in his hands, ready for circulation to this House in mid-summer 1954 was not circulated until 12 months later.  Of course, those who were bringing pressure to bear upon him were the members of the Irish Coursing Club with whom, I may say, Deputy Dillon had the greatest difficulty&mdash;just as great difficulty as his <Col N="1056" /> predecessor, the late Deputy Tom Walsh had.  But, whereas Deputy Walsh was not prepared to give way, was not prepared to surrender to the pressure of the Irish Coursing Club, Deputy Dillon was prepared to give way and did surrender.  And Deputy Dillon brought in a Bill here which was in many respects very acceptable to the Opposition but which in one respect was highly objectionable because the Bill proposed to hand over control of the greyhound industry to a body which had been very severely criticised&mdash;indeed I am understating it when I say very severely criticised&mdash; by Deputy Dillon's own Advisory Committee; and the vital point of difference between the Fianna Fáil Party in opposition to the Bill and Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture in charge of the Bill was as to whether the Greyhound Industry Board was to be controlled by the executive of the Irish Coursing Club, as it then was, or whether, instead of that, while the executive of the Irish Coursing Club would have adequate representation on the board, at least the majority of the members of the board would not be taken as nominees of that body.  Now that was a vital question of principle.</P>
    <P>There were other matters which were discussed at great length between us. In the course of the Committee Stage of the Bill, Deputy Dillon was not receptive to any suggestions that were made&mdash;perhaps that is an exaggeration: Deputy Dillon was loath to accept any suggestion&mdash;for the improvement of the Bill by those who were critical of the Bill and who were opposing it, until at the very end, when a general election was looming in the offing and there was an anxiety on his part to get the Bill through and get the appointment of the Advisory Board into his own hands, he brought in 20 amendments, all of them embodying the proposals of the Opposition. Those amendments are embodied in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Now that is the history of this Bill. Suggestions have been made about my personal attitude to certain people.  I shall not deal with these.  I shall not make any rejoinder to Deputy Dillon. I would have to sink to his depths in <Col N="1057" /> order to do so.  I do not propose, to do that.  I merely propose to echo the hopes which have been expressed by people on both sides, now that the Bill has got to this stage, that it will be shortly enacted and that, in consequence of the provisions of the Bill and of the control and supervision of the industry by the Greyhound Industry Board, the industry will in due course realise all the potentialities which most of us believe it holds for the economic benefit of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister placed in the Library since last week a copy of the Draft Memorandum and Articles of Association of the proposed company. I want to raise a couple of <Col N="1058" /> questions on the Articles of Association. In Article 71 there is a most unusual provision in sub-paragraph (f). It seems to me most likely, in relation to this body, that a small group of small registered tea traders might come together and select one of their number to represent them on the board of the company.  Because of being small in number they would be able to elect only one director.  Now, it is most unusual to provide in any Articles of Association that the office of director shall be vacated if a director is requested in writing by all his co-directors to resign.  In the circumstances in which this company is being set up that is a grossly improper provision. It is certainly a provision which will enable the larger traders to oust any representative of the smaller traders by a simple act done in the secrecy of a boardroom.  There is the normal course under Article 80 in which the company can by extraordinary resolution remove a director. That is perfectly proper.  That can only be done with the attendant publicity that a general meeting of the company requires.  If a director has so acted that it is not proper he should remain a director, in my view it would be perfectly right that he should be removed by the company in general meeting under the provisions of Article 80.  That is the normal procedure, a procedure which receives publicity and which would be proper for this type of company.  The other provision is one that, in my view, would be entirely inappropriate for a company of this nature&mdash;that a particular director could be removed merely because he is obnoxious to others on the board when, as very well may be the case, he represents a smaller and different class of tea trader than the classes that the other directors represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides in Section 2 that the Articles of Association cannot be amended without the consent of the Minister.  I would urge the Minister very strongly indeed to require that clause F of Article 71 would be deleted before the company is incorporated.  I am one of those people who feel very strongly that it is a great mistake to expect people to do work and not to <Col N="1059" /> pay them adequately for their work. But I do rather feel that the limitation on dividends included in the Bill is somewhat unreal in the light of the provisions which are included for payment of fees to directors, together with the provisions included for directors being able, under Article 73, to form subsidiary companies and to receive payment for membership of the boards of such subsidiary companies.</P>
    <P>Again that might be, and would be, a normal practice in ordinary cases. It is entirely improper for the case we are discussing under this Bill.  I would urge the Minister strongly to remove that article or at any rate, if it is to be retained, to provide in relation to it the same provisions as exist in the British Companies Acts, 1929 and 1948, that is to say that the parent company must on the face of its accounts disclose the remuneration received by directors of the company acting on any subsidiary of that parent company. At the very least that should be done in the special circumstances of this case and I think more should be done. Section 73 is, candidly, not appropriate.</P>
    <P>I am obliged to the Minister for the facilities he gave us to examine the draft of the memorandum and articles. I think the second point I raised is of importance, but the first point is absolutely vital.  I would press the Minister very strongly in relation to it. I am not quite clear exactly how one can cope with that on an amendment for the Report Stage but I trust that the Minister will see the force of the argument and insist on that clause being knocked out before the Report Stage.</P>
    <P>When we were discussing this Bill last week, before the adjournment we had a little badinage across the House. The Minister suggested on one or more occasions that I might read the Bill. I did read the Bill and I understood the meaning of Section 8.  The more I read the report of last week's debate, the more it becomes clear to me that the Minister does not understand the legal implications of Section 8.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed all this <Col N="1060" /> on the section.  It was the Minister who referred particularly to Section 8 the last time.  Discussion on the first definition is inevitable because the powers, duties and responsibilities of the company must be dependent on the incorporation of the company.  It was for that reason we asked for the draft memorandum on the last occasion and it was for that reason the discussion took place on this section rather than on the other sections.</P>
      <P>The function of an agent, as set out in this legislation, is quite clear.  If I become a registered tea trader and decide to buy tea in India, the agent goes to the auction, bids for the amount I suggest and, having bid at the auction, arranges for the tea to be exported from&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 relates only to acting as agents for importation, not for purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought from the Minister's argument the last day on financing that he was intending to make importation include purchase.  If that is not his interpretation, then I am very much stronger in the view I shall put to the House.  The tea is bought at an auction and arrangements have to be made for shipping, for the usual customs duties clearances in India and at this end, loading and unloading, delivery and so forth.  I understood the other day that the Minister meant that to include purchase. Apparently, he does not feel now that it does include purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Memorandum of Association provides, in No. 2, that the company is empowered to carry on business, financing and so on, but if the Minister will look at column 756 of last week's debate he will see that he committed himself on record as saying that the company would be bound to provide the finances for any registered tea trader who wished to import. There is nothing in this Bill, or in the provisions binding the company to act as an agent for importation, to bind the company to finance any purchase of tea by anyone other than that it can, of course, be bound to finance its own purchases.  That is where I think <Col N="1061" /> the Minister was most misleading to the House last week.</P>
    <P>Surely the company cannot be bound, by virtue of the terms of this Bill, to finance the purchase of tea by a person who is a registered tea trader but who is not solvent?  It could not be done.  Whether a registered tea trader buys or does not buy must depend, first of all, on his own personal solvency, and if the shipment that is coming is to be the security for the financing, then it must depend on the price at which he buys it.</P>
    <P>It would be utterly impossible for the company to be bound, to be obligated, to finance any individual purchase.  Certainly there is nothing in the Bill that does so obligate the company, and in my opinion it would not be practicable to include any such provision.  Once that is admitted&mdash;and I think it must be admitted&mdash;then the whole argument the Minister was making last week about the company being bound to finance the small trader if he wishes to import tea falls completely to the ground.</P>
    <P>One of the objections&mdash;although we need not go into it on this stage&mdash;to an obligatory purchase in the country of origin is that such a purchase, to be economic at all, means inevitably a very large purchase and, inevitably, when you restrict purchases to the country of origin, you are automatically, in practice, restricting purchases of tea to the large firms.</P>
    <P>Last week, the Minister tried to suggest that that argument is invalid because the company was bound to finance every registered tea trader and every individual purchase of tea.  I doubt very much whether anybody would consider that possible.  I am quite certain of one thing, that is, that if that is the correct interpretation of this Bill, it would never have got through anywhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I had some hesitation before deciding upon the wisdom of putting a copy of the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company in the Library because, as Deputies know, it is not uncommon to frame these documents on a very wide <Col N="1062" /> basis to provide for every possible contingency, no matter how remote, that may arise at any time for the company concerned.  I must make it clear that I am not taking any responsibility for these Articles, except in respect of the particular matters that are of concern to me as Minister in the administration of this Bill.</P>
      <P>It satisfies me that these documents have been accepted by the organisation of which the registered tea wholesalers of Ireland are members.  Presumably they discussed them in detail and have satisfied themselves as to the reasons for all the provisions in them.</P>
      <P>There is, however, one aspect of the matter to which Deputy Sweetman referred which should be stressed.  One of the conditions which I regard as essential and for which these Articles provide is that there shall be absolute equality between all the members of the company and that there shall be no possibility of a situation arising in which any section of the tea wholesalers, big or small, would be open to dominate the company in its own interest.  It is provided that a registered tea wholesaler may take a share in the company, and one only, and that all shares carry equal rights and that the election of the directors is made by the votes of all the shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>All the &ldquo;A&rdquo; shareholders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, so that the board of the company will be the people whom the registered tea wholesalers of Ireland will want to have. There is certainly no intention that it should be subject to influence or control in respect of its membership by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. What then has the company to do?  It is being set up for the purposes set out in the memorandum, primarily to act as importing agent for dealers in tea, and to take on the business of financing in respect of the importation of tea.  There are other objects stated in the memorandum but it will never have the resources to carry them out. Its primary purpose is to act as importing agents for dealers in tea.  It will, under the provisions of the Bill, be the sole importer of tea.  It will not be the <Col N="1063" /> sole buyer.  It will finance dealings in tea by individual registered tea wholesalers, if that facility is required by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister repeat the last sentence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It will finance the purchases of tea by registered tea dealers who require that facility from them.  The Bill provides that it must act as a shipping agent for the import of tea for any registered tea wholesaler. That provision must obviously be there, because it alone can import tea.  Therefore, any tea merchant who has purchased tea must be entitled, as of right, to that facility from the company.</P>
      <P>When one comes to consider the question of a corresponding provision relating to the financing of purchases, one will easily realise the impracticability of making it a statutory obligation on the company, because ordinary commercial considerations would require it to have regard to the creditworthiness of the merchant.  The point is that the company is being set up for that purpose.  It is the aim of its founders and the desire of the tea merchants of Ireland who are setting it up that it should proceed in that way.</P>
      <P>I will not attempt to answer the question why certain provisions relating to directors were put in.  I do not think they are important from our point of view.  If all the tea merchant members of the association regard these Articles as acceptable to them, I do not know why we should interfere with them, nor would I consider that the power taken in Section 2 to require ministerial consent to the amendment of the Articles should be used to prevent amendments to these purely machinery Articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference was made by Deputy Sweetman to Section 8 in connection with the matter of Section I which we are now discussing.  Perhaps we can discuss that section.  As I understand the Bill and the Articles of Association, the position is that the new tea organisation will be the only body permitted to import tea and that <Col N="1064" /> any tea trader in the country who so desires may purchase tea on his own account but must purchase in the country of origin.  Having purchased tea in the country of origin, he is entitled, under Section 8, to say to the new tea organisation: &ldquo;You get that tea imported here for me,&rdquo; and the new tea organisation, being the only organisation entitled to import tea, has a statutory obligation on it to act as the importing agent for the registered tea trader.  Is that not correct?</P>
      <P>It has no obligation to finance the tea trader for the reason that many people may hold themselves out as tea traders who would be quite uncreditworthy. The organisation itself is not debarred from financing and may finance the purchase of tea if the tea trader is a creditworthy person.  That is my interpretation of Section 8. Would the Minister say whether that is the interpretation he places on it and whether it is the general interpretation which we should get from this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite correct. Perhaps I should amplify what the Deputy has said.  He said any trader may purchase tea in the country of origin.  I would contemplate only registered traders purchasing tea and I do not contemplate this company purchasing tea at all&mdash;there will have to be some interim arrangement covering this year and perhaps next year&mdash;but the normal arrangement will be that this company will only arrange for the importation of tea purchased by the individual merchants, most of whom will probably finance their own transactions, and others of whom may seek the assistance of the company to purchase tea.  But the company will not ordinarily purchase tea on its own account.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;To meet the problem of the smaller trader who may not be able to get financial accommodation and ensure that he will be at no disadvantage whatever as compared with <Col N="1065" /> the larger traders, this company will be there to finance his purchases for him, if he requires that facility.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister whether in fact this Bill will give power to the company to be set up to get commission on every pound of tea they import here from the principals abroad from whom that tea is shipped? Is there any control on the commission and profit they can make by arrangement with the companies abroad, before the tea is sent in here at all?  Is there any danger that there would not be free and fair competition in connection with the importation of tea in the matter of arrangements between the proposed new company and the principals abroad?</P>

      <P>This company will not be buying tea abroad.  Tea will be bought by 50, 60 or 100 tea merchants. They will buy the tea.  This company will not be buying it at all.  Therefore, I do not see how the question of sharing a profit with people abroad will arise.  On the question of commission, this company is set up to perform this service for its members.  Presumably, for the members of the company, there shall be no question of commission.  I should imagine that if they perform the same service for a non-member, some commission will be charged, because, clearly, the non-member would have to contribute to the interest upon the money which was utilised for the transactions; but the <Col N="1070" /> purpose of the company is not to make profit and, in order to ensure that they will not have that purpose, the dividend limitation in the Articles of Association is an essential condition, from my point of view.</P>

      <P>The position is that anybody can register as a tea trader. Anybody can do it, and clearly the position as to whether any particular trader who wants to buy tea in the country of origin is worthy of the credit he is seeking from this company will be a matter for the company itself to decide.  There may be a misunderstanding here.  A great number of the tea merchants of Ireland, including many of the tea wholesalers, will not in fact buy tea in the country of origin at all.  They will buy unblended tea from the primary wholesalers.  They will blend this tea to the form we get it in the shop and wholesale or retail that tea.  Those merchants who are in the business in a comparatively small way will work, presumably, in that way in future as they have done in the past.  It is anticipated that there may be 50 merchants who will be dealing direct with the country of origin, buying tea, and it seems to me that, in relation to our community, that represents a very considerable number of such merchants.  There is, however, no limitation upon the number of people who can import tea.</P>

      <P>We are talking here about the small trader and so on.  The Minister says 50.  In practice, what will happen is that about 50 wholesalers will import the tea; they will in the normal way distribute it either directly to their own customers or to secondary wholesalers who buy tea after it has been blended by the primary wholesalers, or, alternatively, some people who blend it themselves will buy the different varieties they want and blend it.  In fact, the small tea trader, about whom there has been a lot of the talk here, will not go to India because he would not be buying in sufficiently large quantities to buy in the country of origin and will buy through the primary wholesalers, whatever number of them there may be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  If this company will set up a board of directors who will, presumably, carry on the business of the company, that board of directors will decide who, in their opinion, is creditworthy, if the buyer of tea wants to import through them, wants to be financed by the new company.

      <P>In trying to see what will happen, we are only speculating. We have had a situation for almost 20 years in which there has been only one centralised buyer of tea and no merchant has had any experience of buying tea, except from that company.  The tea trade themselves think this is going to work out as I have indicated, with all these merchants <Col N="1074" /> buying tea in the country of origin when they think it is to their advantage to do so and rebuying tea from other wholesalers when they think that is to their advantage, doing one thing one year and the other thing the next.  However, that is a matter entirely for themselves.  They may buy the tea in the country of origin, as much as they like of it, any variety, and they may change from one method to another if they think fit.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister can ride away quite so simply with the statement that he is not concerned with anything in the Articles of Association when he has incorporated this Section 2.  If this section were not in the Bill, the point the Minister made could be accepted without question. However, once Section 2 is in the Bill, the Minister must accept the validity of arguments in this House that what is not to be changed without his consent must be something with which he, the Minister, agrees.  Otherwise there is no meaning in the section.</P>

      <P>This company is not in existence yet and comments of that kind regarding the draft memorandum and articles can, therefore, fairly be made.  What will happen is that when the Bill is passed a register will be set up.  Anybody may get his name on that register provided he is a registered tea trader or qualifies as regards the Irish nationality condition.  Those who want to take shares in the company will have the opportunity of doing so and all those who do so will come together at a general meeting to adopt the articles and memorandum.</P>
      <P>There are a lot of purely machinery conditions in this connection with which I am not concerned and if there is a desire to change them there would be no objection on my part.  There is provision for dividend limitation, election to the board of directors on the basis of one vote per shareholder, one share per trader, and so forth, which are essential.  If there is a desire amongst the shareholders to change the other conditions in any respect, there does not seem to be any good reason why it might not be done.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £872,000 be granted to <Col N="1079" /> defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund (No. 14 of 1950 and No. 11 of 1952).</P>
    <P>The amount which is asked for in this Vote is no small sum.  I should like to point out that no portion of it, however, arises from any increase in unemployment in the year 1957-58 as compared with 1956-57.  In fact, the total number of persons claiming unemployment benefit has fallen from 55,236 at this time last year to a current 46,179.  I may say that this is in marked contrast to the trend of unemployment elsewhere, as shown by the figures in an article entitled &ldquo;World Unemployment Survey&rdquo; which appeared in the London <i>Times</i> for yesterday. Those figures show that in January-February of this year the number of unemployed workers was greater than at the corresponding date in 1957&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of Denmark, the figures which are given relate to December, 1956, and December, 1957.  The <i>Times</i> gives no figures for the Six Counties, but it is common knowledge that unemployment there has increased so substantially that recently the matter was specially referred to in the House of Commons. Unemployment elsewhere is on the increase; here it is on the decline. Though I say that, I do not wish it to be understood that our position leaves any ground for complacency.  Nevertheless, so that there may be no misunderstanding as to the position here <Col N="1080" /> and elsewhere, it is essential to realise the significance of the predominating factor, the world trend, in regard to employment.  I am justified, then, in repeating what I said at the outset, that the need for an additional £872,000 to supplement the original Vote of £3,620,000 is due, not to an increase in unemployment but to other causes, of which three are of major importance.</P>
      <P>The first of these was the virulent influenza epidemic which this country, in common with most of Europe and most of Asia, experienced last year. It is estimated to have increased by £120,000 the amount which normally would be required to meet claims for disability benefit.  Next, there was quite an unexpected and, indeed, incomprehensible increase in expenditure on disability benefit, arising otherwise than by reason of the epidemic to which I have referred.  This unexpected, abnormal factor imposed an additional charge on the Social Insurance Fund of no less than £153,000; and it therefore demands that a special reference be made to it, particularly as the circumstances in which this additional charge arose still require explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take at their face value&mdash;as, for the purpose of the social insurance code, the Department of Social Welfare as a rule must do&mdash;the medical certificates issued on which claims to disability benefit are passed, it would appear that after the 1st April last, in the experience of certain practitioners, there was an extraordinary increase, not in the number of insured persons falling ill but in the duration of incapability in very, very many cases.  Because of that, though the number of persons claiming benefit showed little, if any, increase, nevertheless by reason of the prolongation of the periods covered by medical certificates of so many individuals, there was a marked increase in the amount demanded from the Social Insurance Fund.  Examination of this position disclosed the significant fact that the increase in the duration of illness did not appear to be general.  It was not, in fact, a general increase, it was not spread over all certifiers but was traceable to the fact that, in or about that <Col N="1081" /> date, certain medical certifiers began to issue many more certificates than they formerly did.  So far, I have not succeeded in obtaining a satisfactory explanation of this peculiar development&mdash;though we shall continue to search for one.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, however, I wish to repeat what already has been conveyed to each medical officer, as follows. Insured persons who apply for medical certificates of incapacity for work must present themselves for examination in order that the certifier may determine whether they are incapable of work.  If they do not, medical certificates must not be issued in respect of them.  If a certifier has signed an agreement for general certification and an insured person is unable to attend at the certifier's surgery or dispensary for examination, the certifier must visit the insured person and examine him before issuing the certificate.</P>
    <P>No doubt, the greater number of medical certifiers fulfil their obligations in this matter conscientiously. Some, however, unfortunately do not. I trust that, now that they have been made aware of the seriousness of their obligations, we shall have no ground for complaint even in regard to them.</P>
    <P>The two matters which I have mentioned&mdash;the increase in the cost of disability benefit, which may properly be ascribable to the influenza epidemic and the increase in the claims for disability benefit arising out of the greater number of medical certificates having been issued in the circumstances which I have mentioned&mdash; account for £273,000, leaving £599,000 to be accounted for.  This figure can be split into three main items, as follows. The first is £143,000, arising out of overexpenditure on unemployment benefit.  The second, of £500,000, was occasioned by the fact that when the original Estimate was prepared towards the end of 1956 the contribution income of the Social Insurance Fund was overestimated to the extent of £500,000; and the third, of £48,000, was due to the fact that the amount drawn from the Exchequer to meet claims on the fund arising during the year which ended on the 31st March, <Col N="1082" /> 1957, was deficient by that sum.  These three items amount to £691,000, and with the £273,000 excess expenditure on disability benefit, the figure comes to £964,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>£143,000, overexpenditure on unemployment benefit arising from the fact that the Estimate prepared in the autumn of 1956 grievously underestimated the trend of unemployment notwithstanding the information which was then in the possession of the Coalition Government as to what that trend was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  The position is quite simple.  If we were there now, the figures would be different because we knew what we were about; the present Government does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall probably have an opportunity of hearing Deputy Sweetman expatiate on that theme. Let me come back to the three items which I mentioned first: overexpenditure arising out of underestimation of unemployment benefit, secondly, the deficiency in contribution income arising out of an over-optimistic estimation as to what the unemployment position would be in the year 1957-58, and, thirdly, an underdraw of £48,000 from the Exchequer to meet the charges from the Social Insurance Fund for the year ending 31st March, 1957.</P>
      <P>The then Minister for Finance reaped, I suppose, a retrospective advantage in so far as if that £48,000 had been drawn the deficit on his Budget for 1956-57 would have been £48,000 greater.  These three items, as I have said, come to £964,000.  As against this, certain savings on estimated expenditure together with increases from other sources of income to the fund amounting all told to £97,000, are offset to reduce the actual amount asked for to £867,000 which is the figure mentioned in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate moved by the Minister just now is one of a number he moved totalling over £6,000,000 and I just comment that that is a strange <Col N="1083" /> procedure for a Government which on the occasion of the Budget last May undertook that Supplementary Estimates this year would not exceed £2.9 million.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in introducing this Supplementary Estimate, availed of the opportunity to engage in some polemics on the subject of unemployment. He forgot that if he and his colleagues were true to the pledges they entered into in relation to unemployment, this Supplementary Estimate would not be necessary because the unemployment problem that they were elected to solve would, if they were true to the promises they made, have disappeared.  In fact, of course, nothing has been done with regard to that unemployment problem.  It is still there.  It still requires to be tackled, if not by the present Government certainly by the Government that succeeds it.</P>
      <P>If one is to judge correctly what the Minister says, he seemed to suggest that the unemployment position is now a happier one than it was twelve ago. I hope that the unemployed of this city and throughout the country will read very carefully what the Minister has said.  Apparently, the Minister is complacent with regard to the unemployment position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a misrepresentation. I disclaimed any complacency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>He told us here of his readings of periodicals published elsewhere and that apparently no matter how bad our position may be it is much better than that of other countries.  I wonder does the Minister think the people of this country live in some kind of a balloon.  Does he not realise that whatever slight reduction may exist in the unemployment figures now as compared with 12 months ago is largely due to the fact that those who were out of work 12 months ago found it impossible to wait for a Fianna Fáil Government to find them employment and emigrated elsewhere and that the slight fall in our unemployment figures is largely due to <Col N="1084" /> emigration?  It may be that the increase in unemployment figures in England may be contributed to by emigration from this country but certainly the unemployment position now does not and could not give any grounds for the complacent speech to which the Minister has treated us.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that the figures he has given here were largely due to 'flu, to the fact, in addition, that more insured persons have been certified as disabled and to an overexpenditure in relation to unemployment benefit The Minister also stated that £500,000 of the figure he requires now is due to an overestimation in the contribution income in relation to the fund.  In referring to these figures, the Minister availed of the opportunity to suggest that the original Estimate was based on some mistake or faulty estimation.  That is not so.  The original Estimate which was prepared by the previous Government and introduced by the Minister was an Estimate that was very carefully examined.  It was an Estimate based on the assumption that the previous Administration would remain in office and that the policy of the previous Administration would be implemented. If it had been implemented, no deficiency such as we have been told of to-day would have arisen.</P>
      <P>I do not think anything else requires to be said with regard to the Estimate, except again to remind the House that if the Minister and his colleagues were true to the trust which got them into office, this £800,000 odd would not be required, because, in fact, all the women who voted for the Minister and his colleagues, to get their husbands back to work, would now be enjoying the security which should be enjoyed arising from secure employment.  To the extent that the Government have failed in that respect, this money is obviously necessary and we cannot object to its being given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the Minister and the last speaker have said that this is no small sum of money, and, in view of the fact that there is an obligation <Col N="1085" /> on the Government to pay it to recipients of social insurance, I am sure nobody in the House will object to giving the Minister the appropriate sum.  I was rather interested in the manner in which the Minister introduced this Estimate.  His colleague and Parliamentary Secretary in introducing Estimates, as he has done, has given the details without any observations or without being, as the Minister appeared to be, on the defensive. The Minister has come in here in a half-apologetic and half-defensive mood.</P>
      <P>The arguments as to why this sum should be voted were rather amusing and I do not think the Minister was entirely correct.  I am not saying that I do not think he was entirely honest in alleging there was some rigging of the Estimates for 1957-58.  I might say that it is no consolation to workers to tell them that in New Zealand or the U.S.A. or Canada, the unemployment position is worse than it is over here. Fianna Fáil have always said we should have a self-sufficient country and that we should run our own affairs as we want them, and I do not think that the unemployed workers of this country should be told: &ldquo;You are not too badly off; there are 4,000,000 unemployed in America and a higher percentage in this country or in that country who are unemployed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think I accept the reasons the Minister gives for the necessity for this £872,000, either in respect of sickness benefit or in respect of unemployment benefit, because the £872,000 is to be devoted to these purposes.  The plain fact is that Fianna Fáil had an opportunity, if they wanted to, to adjust the Estimate, as they had in respect of other Estimates during Budget time.  There is no point in blaming either the previous Government or the previous Minister, if the figure was wrong.  I do not say it was wrong; I say it was correct.</P>

    <P>Having regard to what the present Government said about this time last year, what they should have done was to reduce the Estimate both for social insurance and social assistance.  The fact is that no matter what excuses the Minister might give, the reasons why <Col N="1086" /> we have to give him this sum is, firstly, that Fianna Fáil did not get cracking and, secondly, that the unfortunate women did not get their husbands back to work, or, if they did get them back to work, it was to work in England.</P>
    <P>The Minister has blamed Asian 'flu for increasing the sickness benefit. Granted it would take part of the increase, but I do not think that Asian 'flu swept across this country so much that we have to provide an additional £153,000.  My experience of the sickness benefit and the disability benefit at the present time is contrary to what the Minister says.  I may be open to correction, but I am only looking at the situation as a Deputy who has contact with his constituents and other people throughout the country.  The great difficulty is proving that a person is sufficiently ill or sufficiently disabled to qualify for sickness or disability benefit.</P>
    <P>I would say, and I say this without having anything to back it up, but my own experience with my constituents, that it is very difficult now in some cases to qualify for either of these benefits.  I do not know whether there have been instructions to the medical referees or the medical officials of the Department to the effect that the sum of money devoted to this purpose should be cut down, but I have complaints, week after week, from people who say it is impossible to prove sickness or disability to the medical referee, so far as workers are concerned.</P>
    <P>I was interested also in the allegation by the Minister&mdash;I thought he was going to mention certain areas&mdash;that there was fraudulent certification by members of the medical profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is true, it is serious; if it is incorrect, it is a serious allegation.  If any member of the profession willynilly hands out certificates saying that people are eligible for benefits, it is a very serious thing, and I think the Minister for Social <Col N="1087" /> Welfare or the Minister for Health, through the Irish Medical Association, should take some sort of action.  But here is the rub.  I remember&mdash;in 1953, I think&mdash;the then Minister for Social Welfare, now Minister for Finance, coming in here and asking for a colossal sum of money&mdash;an additional Estimate for Social Insurance&mdash;and this was one of the excuses he trotted out then.  His excuse for a Supplementary Estimate at that time was, in part, that doctors were not doing their duty, so far as the certification of disability and illness was concerned.  I should like the Minister to give examples in substantiation of the allegation he has made, and, if he can substantiate it, to take the necessary action.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell the Minister that the method of estimating social insurance for 1957-58 was the very same method as I am sure will be employed this year and as has been employed since the Department of Social Welfare was established.  The Estimates for social insurance were based on the experience of the 12 months of the year, from January to December of 1957, and the unemployment figures for those 12 months indicated an amount of expenditure as was shown in the Estimates for the years 1957 and 1958. There was not high unemployment at the beginning of the year 1957 and our forecast and our calculations entitled us to believe that the same trend would operate for the year 1958 or, if you like, for the financial year 1957-58.</P>
      <P>So far as I remember, there was no insistence by the Minister for Finance that that Estimate should be cut.  There was no insistence that the estimated income into the Insurance Fund should be jacked up to a level that it should not be.  The Estimates that were submitted to me by the officials in my Department were accepted by me at the time, were accepted by the Minister for Finance, and were accepted by the Government.  Despite what the Minister may think or allege, there was no attempt at &ldquo;hoofling&rdquo;, in connection with the Estimates for the Department of Social Welfare for the years 1957 and 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> That is all I want to say on this Estimate, except to add that the Minister, by his defensive attitude, clearly indicates that there is no defence by the Fianna Fáil Government or by the Minister for Social Welfare, in respect of this additional £872,000.  The plain fact is that they have not provided employment and cannot insist that people do not get sick and that sick people work.</P>

      <P>My only intervention, pending the Minister's reply to the speeches that have been or may be made, is in relation to Deputy Corish's reference to medical certification.  There has been a laxity, and great laxity, and the Minister is taking action about it with the Medical Association.  The vast majority of doctors are conscientious and do their work right, but the laxity of some of them is of such importance, and has such a bearing on the whole situation, that the Minister has to take action, has taken action, and that action is in course of operation.</P>
      <P>A question was asked since this session of the Dáil began&mdash;I cannot remember who the Deputy was who asked it&mdash;about certification over a period of years.  There has been a very steep rise in medical certification.  I have here certain figures in relation to went up to 558,843.  For the quarter ended 31st March, 1956, medical certifications numbered 539,850; in the corresponding quarter of 1957, they went up to 558,843.  For the quarter ended 30th June, 1956, they were 525,955, and for the corresponding quarter in 1957, 550,445.  In the quarter ended 30th September, 1956, they were 502,586, and, in September last, 545,020.</P>

      <P>That was September. I will finish the table now.  For the quarter ended 31st December, 1956, they were 528,865 and in the same quarter in 1957, they were 585,366. There has been no difficulty in getting certificates for illness and that is my experience as a rural Deputy.  I know this much, that, in certain cases, the son or daughter goes up to the doctor's <Col N="1089" /> house and gets a medical certificate without the patient appearing at all, and, in cases, the patient has been working.  I have on my table a couple of recent cases where disability benefit was drawn for weeks, while the recipients were working.  We had a particular case and, if justice obtained, the man should be struck off the role by the Medical Association altogether. That was in very recent times.  This medical certification is a very serious matter and steps are being taken in the Department, under the Minister's guidance, to put an end to that.  It is not right that it should exist.  That was the only thing upon which I wished to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the Minister's opening remarks when he compared the trends in regard to unemployment in this country with trends in some other countries outside it, a country in Europe and the United States of America.  I think those remarks might give a wrong impression because the countries he referred to have been passing through a long period of, if not over-employment, at least full employment.  It was not correct to take statistics of countries like Great Britain and America, and compare them with the unemployment we have in this country.</P>
      <P>In Great Britain, the rate of unemployment is only about 1½ per cent. and in the United States, where they have something like a major recession, it is around 6 per cent.  In this country, the rate fluctuates between 7 and 9 per cent.  Though the Minister says that the trend appears to be downward, I think the overall picture, compared with the countries he mentioned, is very far from encouraging.  In his reply, perhaps the Minister would give us some comparative statistics in regard to the percentage of unemployment in the countries concerned and the percentage here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real kernel of the thing is, as Deputy Corish and other speakers pointed out, that the Government plans for increasing employment have not come to pass.  Perhaps this is not a subject for general discussion at this stage, but that is the kernel of the <Col N="1090" /> whole thing.  The results which the Government anticipated, and which the electors put them into office to secure, have not been obtained.  Until that happens, I am satisfied that not alone will we go on each year supplying substantial sums for social welfare assurance and assistance, but we can also look forward to the Minister coming in looking for additional moneys each year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is an admission of failure on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government in providing employment for the people who were registered as unemployed last year. Very smugly, the Minister compared the figures last year to those for this year, but he carefully avoided any mention of the large-scale emigration which has taken place during last year. It is admitted in many quarters that the amount of emigration which took place during 1957 was the highest in any year since this State was established. Many public-spirited people are alarmed at the high figure of emigration at the present time.  This is a matter which I feel the Minister should have referred to when he came here with this Estimate, which I have described as an admission of failure on the part of the Government to provide employment for the people who expected it.</P>
      <P>The Minister carefully avoided mentioning the fact that there is more employment in Dublin City and county this year than there was last year.  In addition, there is a considerable degree of destitution and hunger amongst the unemployed, owing to the increased cost of bread and butter. The Minister should not have offered brazen excuses and comparisons to the House when trying to explain the reason for introducing this Supplementary Estimate.  When the Parliamentary Secretary was speaking I was hoping that he would try to justify the speech he made in County Westmeath when he alleged that millions of pounds were being fraudulently obtained from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what the Parliamentary Secretary did say and when he got up here to-day he should have tried to justify that statement instead of running away from it, as he did, and taking the opportunity, as he did, of abusing the medical profession for the manner in which certificates are issued.  Surely he will not say that the members of the medical profession issued certificates without being asked for them, but that seemed to be the general trend of the Minister's speech&mdash;the laxity in the manner in which medical certificates were issued, suggesting that they were being issued to people without being requested. I was surprised that the Minister did not tell us this evening that he had taken this matter up with the Irish Medical Association.  He did not say he had done that, but he blackened the profession in general by alleging laxity in the issue of certificates. If there was laxity, then the matter should have been taken up with the profession and the Minister should be in a position this evening to tell us about his discussions with the Irish Medical Association instead of accusing all and sundry.</P>
      <P>Finally, as I mentioned last week, we are indebted to the <i>Irish Independent</i> for statistics showing that there are, in fact, 2,000 fewer people engaged in industry this year as compared with last year, and industry is the productive side of employment. That is proof that the Government have failed completely in their undertaking. They have not kept their promises to the wives who were asked: &ldquo;Vote for Fianna Fáil and get your husbands back to work.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in introducing this Supplementary Estimate appeared to me to apologise for looking <Col N="1092" /> for the money necessary.  He made a point of attempting to prove that this money is due to anything rather than increased sickness numbers or increased unemployment numbers.  I consider it a good thing that we should be voting this money for people who are genuinely ill or people who are genuinely unemployed, if they have that misfortune.  I do not think any apology is needed.</P>
      <P>I have had a certain amount of experience as a national health agent over a long number of years and I am doubtful as to the validity of the claim that the fault lies in certification.  My experience has been quite the reverse. If I understood the Minister correctly, the cases he claims went on longer than before in April were obviously long-term sickness cases.  Surely people who are ill need more than just certification. It is dispensary doctors in the main who attend what might be called the national health cases and they do something more than just supply certificates. They treat the patients.  If a doctor is treating a patient he must visit that patient, so it is rather ridiculous to have an instruction issuing from the Department telling doctors they should see patients before they certify them.  I imagine any doctor would have to see the patient first in order to treat him.</P>
      <P>In the case of the chronically disabled and the chronically ill, there is not very much that can be done other than repeat the medicine already prescribed and certify.  In such cases I cannot understand how there can be any increased duration because these people are chronically ill all their lives.</P>
      <P>The explanation for the increase now being sought does not hold water.  It merely means that there are more claims and there is a very good reason for that.  The Asian 'flu may have contributed to it.  I do not remember any year in which there was not some kind of 'flu epidemic.  Very often this 'flu is an excuse for taking a few days off unofficially, but I do not think the Asian 'flu accounted for more than a slight increase on the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made some comparisons with other countries.  America, Canada <Col N="1093" /> and New Zealand.  Surely the Minister gives us the credit for having enough intelligence to know that these other countries do not suffer from the advantage, if you like to call it that, of emigration?  Ireland has that advantage, if one can call it an advantage. Those who were unemployed 12 months ago and two years ago have left the country.  They had no other choice.</P>
    <P>It might be interesting for the Minister to take note of the increase in sickness benefit in April.  In or around that time an Employment Period Order comes into operation and men are refused unemployment benefit in the labour exchanges.  While doctors can keep a check on certification in the case of serious illness, if a man who is going to be cut off unemployment benefit goes sick with a pain in his back it is very difficult for any doctor to say conscientiously that that man is not sick and the doctor must, therefore, issue a certain amount of certification.  I suggest that the increase in certification at that period arises simply because it is another way of getting unemployment money. In other words, the unemployment position is the real reason why this big increase takes place.  Let us face that situation.  I do not see any reason why the Minister should not have taken that attitude and clearly and honestly stated that.</P>

      <P>The House is faced this evening with yet another formidable Supplementary Estimate.  When the Minister for Finance was introducing his Budget last year, he stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government are resolved to resist any further additions to the year's commitments.  It would, however, be unwise to ignore the possibility of unforeseen contingencies arising.  The allowance made for such contingencies in each of the last four years has been £750,000 but it has never been adequate.  I am allotting a somewhat larger sum this year&mdash;£950,000&mdash;which, with the items I have already specified, entails a total supplementary provision for current services of £2,500,000 approximately.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the time we finish to-night, it is <Col N="1094" /> more than likely that the total of supplementaries passed will have exceeded £7,250,000.  This is the work of a Government resolved to resist any further additions to the year's commitments. There can, of course, be no question of opposing the Estimate that we are now discussing.  It has been pointed out that the Estimate would have been unnecessary had the Government lived up to the great expectations the people were led to hold would materialise from the election of a Fianna Fáil Government.  They celebrate to-day the first anniversary of their election by introducing this formidable Estimate to meet the charge on the Department of Social Welfare in assisting these people.  It has been pointed out, and rightly so, that assurance were given that employment would be afforded to those people in the community who were displaced.  Can we say that the results have been in any way gratifying?  Deputy Russell already referred to it.  Let me cross the floor to the Fianna Fáil ranks and see what reaction there is in the Fianna Fáil organisation itself.</P>
    <P>I am quoting from the <i>Guardian</i>, published in Nenagh, for Saturday, 1st March, in regard to a Fianna Fáil Convention for North Tipperary presided over by the Minister for Defence:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Rodge Williams (Cloughjordan) said last year they had Mr. Lemass in Nenagh and he told them the object of the Government was to relieve unemployment and said &lsquo;let us get cracking&rsquo;.  They had waited for the Government to get cracking and the results had been very poor. There were almost as many unemployed to-day as there were 13 months ago.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How many have emigrated in that time?  A few weeks ago, I took the opportunity here of referring to the fact that, in my own constituency of North Cork, we had emigration taking the people away at a faster rate than ever known before in that constituency.</P>

We have to find money here to-night for men displaced from employment because these men would not be of the age at which they could face for the boat as quickly as younger men.  We were told that the £250,000, which was spent in giving employment to 4,000 rural workers, was a saving to the Exchequer.  Is the saving reflected in this Supplementary Estimate?  We had a milling industry in the town of Mallow which has closed down completely in the past few months.  There is no provision here for a single £ to pay any of the 50 men displaced there, because there is not a man of them in this country to-night.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his passing reference, presented it as a text that really we should not grumble &mdash;things were worse elsewhere. &ldquo;Wives, get your husbands to work.&rdquo; Of course, the countries he referred to have not emigration to relieve their figures.  Consequently, they have to be reflected in their unemployment figures.  There is no other place in which they can be reflected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the only point in pointing out and bringing home to the Government that the discontent that exists in the Cloughjordan Fianna Fáil Cumann is prevalent throughout the country in relation to the Government's policy in getting cracking and <Col N="1097" /> in providing employment when there are 2,000 fewer employed in industrial concerns to-day than 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>In addition, this amount is not the only amount that has been devoted this year to facing up to these unemployment figures.  This Dáil was not long in session when we were told that there was a remission of £1,750,000 in the import levies, which, we were told, would have a wonderful effect upon employment.  Where are the results now of that remission?  With that remission, why is it necessary to devote such a sum here to meet the charge on the Department of Social Welfare?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickPGogan" hpid="Mr. Gogan Mr. Gogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not surprised when the Minister states there has been a large increase in the number of applications for sickness benefit.  I take it that the figure of £153,000 given by the Minister would, in the main, represent claims made in the Dublin area. I am not surprised, because it is quite evident, from the large numbers attending dispensaries, that there has been an increase in illness.  I agree with the Minister that a certain amount of laxity in certification does occur.  I do not attribute that in any way to culpable neglect by the doctors, but I do attribute it to the condition under which the doctors are working in the various dispensaries.</P>
      <P>The majority of certificates issued in Dublin are issued through dispensary doctors, and to some extent the Minister has the remedy in his own hands. The dispensary doctor is involved in work other than certification.  His time is involved in the registration of deaths, marriages and births.  If the Minister takes these functions away from the dispensary doctor, then the dispensary doctor can devote his entire time to the certification and examination of patients.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention is the extent to which the advantages at the disposal of dispensary doctors at St. Kevin's Hospital are availed of.  I think, from my experience, that they should be availed of to a greater degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the suggestion that there was wholesale fraud in claims for unemployment <Col N="1098" /> benefit, I should like to say that as far as Dublin is concerned that would hold no water.  The extent of any fraud which would occur in Dublin would extend to applicants signing for work on the same date.  In that connection, I should like to ask the Minister that, where such cases are held up, an expeditious investigation of the claim should be made and, if possible, the payment resumed.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that it happens that in quite a large number of cases people who go to seek employment after they have signed at the Labour Exchange are lucky enough to get it.  I came across a case where a claim was held up for three or four weeks before the payment was resumed.  I should like to ask the Minister to give that matter his attention.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in dividing up the Estimate into different categories, told the House that increased disability benefit, outside that attributed to the 'flu, accounted for £153,000 while he made an oblique reference to laxity in medical certification.  He did say that up to now he was unable to ascertain the reason for this increase.  But following on his heels the Parliamentary Secretary had no such inhibitions. Apparently there was no doubt at all in the mind of the Parliamentary Secretary that there is a well-founded and widespread conspiracy between the certifying doctors and the insured persons in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He appears to be thoroughly convinced that the insured person is malingering in very many instances and that he is getting the wholehearted co-operation of the certifying doctors in that connection.  He has not <Col N="1099" /> yet convinced the Minister that that is so.  He has not convinced Deputy Gogan and candidly I do not believe him.  Will anybody suggest that a person in employment just for the fun of it is going to pretend he is ill and thereby put himself on an income which is 20 or 25 per cent. of his normal earnings?  Will anybody suggest that most of the doctors in this country are not above such a conspiracy?</P>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary has been misled by somebody in his Department in this connection because, since he took over office, he appears to be obsessed with this idea.  We are told that special instructions have now been issued again to the doctors.  I hope that the manner in which this is being handled will not create a scare among doctors and scare them to such an extent that they may be very slow to certify cases they should certify.</P>
    <P>If you want to ascertain one reason at least for the increase in disability benefit payable over the past year you will have to go back to the Budget. Nobody can deny that the impositions of that Budget increased the cost of living and decreased the purchasing power of the ordinary working-class family.  The effect of that is quite obvious to everybody&mdash;further undernourishment for himself and his family. He is up against every kind of hardship regarding clothing and shelter.  I think the Minister would be well advised if he would even now consult the medical advisers of his Department and ask them for their opinions as to what effect the decreased purchasing power had on the increased incidence of disability amongst insured persons.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that there is a very definite connection in that regard.  The Department appear to have launched a campaign to view with suspicion everybody who claims either disability benefit or unemployment benefit. There seems to be an atmosphere growing at departmental level which has permeated right down through the usual channels to the local exchanges whereby anybody who makes any kind of claim for social welfare benefit is viewed with suspicion.  He is suspected of malingering and lying.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> The Department, on the other hand, have taken steps to ensure that the payment of benefit will be cut to a minimum.  I feel that to a large extent they have adopted what might be regarded as sharp practices in that respect.  We have a horde of special investigators round the country now checking up on people drawing disability benefit.  We even had cases in Cork where people in a certain category of unemployed persons were offered employment in Dublin, and because of the fact that it would be unsuitable for them and not possible for them to take up their usual employment 160 miles away from their homes their claims were held up.  I grant that, after pressure, the claims were paid.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should face realities and come into the House and say quite candidly that he needs these extra moneys because the policy that he and his colleagues put before the electorate was not carried out and not come in with a cock-and-bull story about Asian 'flu and a contradictory reference to disability benefit, which reason is not shared by the Parliamentary Secretary.  It would be more candid and honest and would get better support from the House if the Minister did as I suggest.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish appears to be somewhat sceptical in regard to the explanation I gave as to the reason why we had to ask for an additional sum because of the increase in the claims for disability benefit.  He went so far as to say that the reference to the 'flu epidemic last year was not justified.  I think he was followed in that line by Deputy Casey.  Deputy Corish said that so far as he was concerned the Estimate was prepared in September.  It was prepared in October, 1956.  He based it on the experience of the preceding year.  It is a recognised fact.  It is common knowledge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is an adept at that.  I listened to the Deputy with great attention and with a considerable amount of patience.  I wanted the Deputy to make his case because I thought it would have been an interesting case for us to hear.  The Estimate for 1957-58 was, according to my information, prepared in October, 1956.  There was not in October, 1956, or during the winter of 1956 any general illness comparable to that which was experienced last year in the particularly virulent type of epidemic which we experienced.  All I am saying in relation to that matter is that the expenditure on this disability benefit was underestimated when the Estimate was being prepared under Deputy Corish's aegis&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I was merely explaining what had happened.  It was a justification, a defence of the Deputy. I merely explained that the 'flu was one of the reasons why the Estimate which the Deputy made when he was Minister as to expenditure on the disability services was short by £273,000. I was not responsible for preparing the Estimate for social insurance for the year, 1957-58.  It was prepared, as the Deputy himself has accepted, in the autumn of 1956 when Deputy Corish was Minister for Social Welfare and all I came into this House to do was to explain what had happened to upset it. After all, Deputy Corish cannot be held responsible for the fact that there was an influenza epidemic which distorted, in fact, falsified his Estimate to the extent of £120,000.  And then, that of course, left the balance of £153,000 to be explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, it was Deputy Corish's figure and not mine that I was justifying, <Col N="1102" /> when I said that this £153,000 arose because of a trend which had begun to assert itself about March or April of last year.  It is a pity Deputy Casey is not in the House to hear that date. Then by reason of what appeared to be &mdash;and still is to me&mdash;an inexplicable prolongation of the duration of illness, the number of medical certificates issued was considerably more than had been anticipated by Deputy Corish when he was Minister for Social Welfare and responsible for framing the Estimate for 1957-58.  That is all I said.</P>
    <P>Deputy Casey has suggested that one of the reasons for this increase in the number of certificates issued, inexplicable as that number has been, was because of the Budget of May.  The trend had asserted itself before the Budget, before there had been any reduction in food subsidies and before there had been any increase in taxation. The trend had already asserted itself, and rather signally asserted itself, after there had been a change of Government and before any fiscal measures had been introduced by the Government.  That was the position and what I was saying was that to the extent of £273,000 Deputy Corish in respect of disability expenditure had been over-optimistic in estimating the charge which would come upon the Vote.</P>
    <P>The other cause to which I ascribe the fact that we now have to ask for an additional £872,000 is the over-optimistic estimate which had been framed in respect of the trend of employment during 1956-57.  I have been listening with some patience&mdash;I like to listen patiently when I think I have a bad case to refute&mdash;to the suggestion made by Deputy O'Sullivan that the House was faced with another formidable Supplementary Estimate because of the failure of the Government to implement its promises.  When I moved this Estimate I was fully aware of&mdash;at least I anticipated&mdash;the line which the Opposition, the Fine Gael Opposition mainly, would take in regard to it, and so I was at some pains to expose to the House the causes which had compelled us to come and ask for this £872,000.  I mentioned the influenza and the extraordinary increase in the number of <Col N="1103" /> medical certificates issued and then I came to the real kernel of the matter, the additional amount which was required in order to meet the uncovered claims for unemployment benefit.  I should say that for that purpose the sum is £143,000.  This has been due to the fact that expenditure from the fund was underestimated.  Furthermore, to the extent of £500,000, the contributions income to the fund was overestimated, leaving a deficit of £643,000 to be met out of this Vote.</P>
    <P>I also indicated that this failure of the Estimate to fulfil expectations was not due to any increase in the number of people claiming unemployment benefit.  I mentioned in passing that the latest reputable survey, not a document published in a periodical somewhere else but an analysis taken from official figures of the general world position in relation to unemployment, showed that in countries so far apart as Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and the United States there had been a marked increase in unemployment in the months of January and February of this year compared with the corresponding months of last year.  I only mentioned that in passing, not in any spirit of complacency, as Deputy Thomas O'Higgins said, but merely in order that we might get a reasonably accurate picture as to what in fact was happening in this country and elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am now dealing with claims for unemployment benefit. When I had done this in opening, <Col N="1104" /> Deputy Corish, told the Dáil that the estimate had been prepared on the basis of the experience of the previous 12 months.  In fact, the estimate, as I pointed out, was prepared in October, 1956.  Let us see what the trend was month by month over that 12-month period so far as claims for unemployment benefit are concerned.  I will take the earlier year, 1955, first.</P>
      <P>In April of 1955 the number of people claiming unemployment benefit was 35,348; in April of 1956, the number had risen to 37,839, an increase of 2,500 over the preceding year.  In May, the increase was 2,600 over the preceding May.  In June, 1956, it was 4,300 over the preceding June; in July, 1956, it was 5,200 over the preceding July; in August, it was 8,067 over the preceding August; in September, it was 9,167 over the preceding September; in October, it was 11,222 over the corresponding month in 1955; in November it was 12,112 over November of 1955; in December, it was 13,289 over the corresponding figure in 1955.  In January, before this Government came in, it was 15,609 higher than it had been in January, 1955, in February, it was 14,076 higher than the corresponding figure for 1955 and in March it was 7,237 higher than it had been in March of 1956.</P>
      <P>There is a continuous trend upwards, rising from 37,839 in April of 1956 to 51,000 in December of 1956 and then declining in number to 48,000 in March of 1957.  But, even though there was a decline from January to March, nevertheless, the figure for March, 1957, was no less than 7,237 higher than it had been for March of 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  Was there any provision made for that increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am coming to.  I am now dealing with the trend.  It has been alleged that I have misrepresented the position to the House.  I have shown the House now that the increase in unemployment between 1956-57 and 1955-56 had risen from 2,500 at the beginning of that period to 15,609 in January of last year, again, before there had been a change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> What then happened?  After the change the rate of increase had fallen from 7,200 in March of 1957 to a rate of increase of 6,093 in April.  The downward trend in rate of increase continued to 3,133 in May, 1,344 in June, 1158 in July.  Then, in August, the trend changed completely because, instead of there being a continuing increase in the claims for unemployment benefit, as there had been over almost the previous 18 months, this upward trend in claims for unemployment benefit, which had begun in April, 1956, and continued right through the remainder of that year on up until the end of July of 1957, was reversed.  The number of claims for the year 1957-58 began to be less than it had been in the year preceding, in this way: in August, as I have pointed out, it was 1,656 lower than in August of 1956; in September, 1957, it was 3,399 lower than in September of 1956; in October, 1957, it was 6,189 lower than in October, 1956; in November, 6,866 lower than it had been in the preceding November; in December of last year it was 9,819 lower than it had been in the corresponding month of the preceding year and in January, 1958, it was 9,242 lower than it had been in January of 1957. As I have pointed out here, for February last, the latest figure available, it is 9,107 lower than it was in February of 1957.</P>
    <P>That is what I said and there are the figures to show that the statement which I made at the outset was true that whereas the trend of unemployment elsewhere was upwards, the trend of unemployment in this country since the policy of this Government began to be effective has been downwards.</P>

Where did they go?  Perhaps the Deputy <Col N="1106" /> would think over the implications of his remark.</P>

There is less justification for it when you find that the Estimate was prepared under his aegis&mdash;and I am sure he scrutinised this Estimate as any responsible Minister should do&mdash;and satisfied himself there were good grounds for presenting it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is what I do know.  The total of the original Estimate for unemployment benefit plus the Supplementary Estimate for unemployment benefit came to £3,328,000 and the revised Estimate for 1957-58, as submitted to the Department of Finance, came to £3,140,000. That is to say, it was £188,000 less than the total of the original Estimate for 1956-57 and the Supplementary Estimate for 1956-57.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested here that there has been an increase in unemployment <Col N="1108" /> during the period the Government has been in office and that we have not fulfilled our obligations.  Let us see the sort of situation we inherited. The original Estimate for unemployment benefit, as it appeared in the Book of Estimates, 1956-57, was £1,919,000.  At the end of the year, a Supplementary Estimate of £1,409,000 had to be brought in.  That is to say, the original Estimate had to be increased by 70 per cent. in order to deal with the situation as it existed here when the Coalition left office in March, 1957.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that that trend had been manifested all the way through, the Minister sent for printing to the Department of Finance an Estimate for the year 1957-58 which was £188,000 less than the combined total of the original and Supplementary Estimates for which he was responsible. That is rather strange. For, mind you, the amount by which the claims for unemployment benefit have exceeded the amount provided for in the original Vote is £143,000. Is there not a very close correspondence between the two figures?</P>
    <P>These figures which I have cited were my justification for saying that the need for this Supplementary Estimate did not arise out of any increase in unemployment, but arose because of the fact that one of the Estimates for which my Coalition predecessor had been responsible had underestimated the claims which would be made on the social insurance fund in respect of unemployment benefit by £143,000.  The same thing happened again in respect of the contribution income of the fund.  That, again, was overestimated, in this case by £500,000.</P>
    <P>Again, let me say this.  I do not want to carry this matter farther than I legitimately may.  I suppose that when we are in a dark corner, many of us will incline to look on the bright side of things and will be inclined to say: &ldquo;Things are so bad now that they are bound to improve and bound rapidly to improve.&rdquo;  I will say that things have considerably improved as compared with what they were when the Estimate was prepared, as compared with what they were when our predecessors left office.  However, <Col N="1109" /> they have not improved to the extent which Deputy Corish, when he was Minister for Social Welfare, anticipated they would improve.  It is merely because his over-optimistic picture has not been realised that we have to come here and say: &ldquo;We have to find another £500,000, because the contributions to the Social Insurance fund have not realised our expectations up to that amount.  There is the case for the Estimate.</P>
    <P>I am not saying anything more than necessary.  So far as the increased requirement for disability benefit is concerned, no one could anticipate that we were going to have the severe epidemic which we experienced last year. I am not going to say for a moment that Deputy Corish or anyone else could have anticipated the very significant increase in the number of medical certificates issued.  I am prepared to say this, that if I had been in office I think that I would not have been as over-optimistic in regard to the trend of employment or as to the amount of contribution income as Deputy Corish was.  It all comes down to this in the end, that it was a failure to estimate more accurately and not an increase in unemployment claims that has made this Supplementary Estimate necessary. No one can be held very blameworthy for that in the circumstances; for none of us are prophets and none of us can foresee the future in that way. All I was concerned with, when opening this debate, was to make certain that the truth would be told to the public and that we would not have had the sort of speeches that Opposition Deputies indicated they were prepared to make if they thought they would get away with it.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £2,023,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958, for Old Age Pensions and Pensions to Blind Persons, Children's <Col N="1110" /> Allowances, Unemployment Assistance, Widows' and Orphans' Non-contributory Pensions, and for Sundry Miscellaneous Social Welfare Services, including Grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy) Michael Joseph Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for Social Assistance amounts to £2,023,000.  The need for this Estimate arises mainly from two Social Welfare Acts which were passed last year.  The Social Welfare Act, 1957, increased the rates of old age and blind pensions, widows' non-contributory pensions and unemployment assistance from mid-May, 1957.  The Social Welfare (Children's Allowances) Act, 1957, increased the rates of children's allowances from last May, also.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of these increases for a full year is about £2,250,000.  For the current financial year, however, the cost is calculated at £1,976,000, for which allowance to the extent of £1,950,000 was made in the Budget Statement last year.  The further sum of £47,000, making up the total Supplementary Estimate of £2,023,000, is the net amount required for variations in the original Estimate, apart from the increases I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>These variations include an excess of £67,000 on the original provision for unemployment assistance.  In the case of unemployment assistance, the excess is due to the number of recipients being somewhat greater than anticipated.  The saving on the provision for old age pensions is attributable to an unexpected decrease in the number of pensioners, due, in some measure, to the influenza epidemic.</P>
      <P>The variations also include additional sums totalling £39,000 required for grants to local authorities and for blind welfare.  The additional provisions for grants to local authorities comprise £6,500 for school meals and £18,000 for the fuel scheme.  This latter sum is required mainly because the numbers of recipients of cheap fuel were greater than estimated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional sum required for blind welfare arises from a decision to make a grant of £15,000 to the Board for the Employment of the Blind, which <Col N="1111" /> was set up last year to acquire and equip a workshop for the blind and be responsible for its management.  As there is an estimated saving of £500 on the original provision of £17,500 for welfare of the blind, the net additional sum now required for this service is £14,500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate, needless to remark, is not opposed; but it comes quite well after the allegations by the Minister for Social Welfare, who talks about &ldquo;super-optimism&rdquo; in respect of the social insurance Estimates, because the Parliamentary Secretary has listed some savings on the Estimate for 1957-58.  Incidentally, I think I heard him say that they were savings in respect of old age pensioners, because of the Asian 'flu&mdash;so both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary now want to use the Asian 'flu to their advantage and to the disadvantage of the former Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister chided me in respect of the last Vote for my super-optimism regarding employment; but surely I also can talk about the optimism of the Minister, if he imagines for one moment that the 1/- increase to the old age pensioner, to the widow and the orphan or the person &ldquo;on the dole&rdquo; is sufficient to defray the increased cost in the price of certain foodstuffs and other things since the last Budget.  I think that is the height of optimism, even so far as the Minister is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has noticed it or not, but there did not seem to be either over or under estimation about unemployment assistance. To provide for the unemployed who were not eligible for unemployment benefit, 10 per cent. extra was provided for the year 1957/58.  I think it is wrong and mischievous for the Minister to say that the previous Government, or that I, as Minister for Social Welfare, did not recognise the trend of unemployment and did not provide adequately for it.  As a matter of fact, in regard to social insurance, a sum of £1,500,000 extra was provided for those in receipt of unemployment benefit, disability benefit and contributory <Col N="1112" /> widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>
    <P>The Minister may play upon words and he may wriggle, as he did very effectively for the past half hour, in trying to excuse his Government for the lack of employment.  He talks about over-optimism and over-estimation in respect of the contributions to the Social Insurance Fund.  The reason why the Government have to provide this year an extra £500,000 is that there are not enough workers in the country to make up that £500,000, which now must be made up by the Exchequer. There may be less unemployment in the country at the present time, but alongside that, there is less employment, and that is the reason why the Government have to supplement this fund to the tune of £500,000.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I recognise in this country over recent times a sort of anti-social welfare attitude.  When the present Social Welfare Act was introduced, away back in 1951 or 1952, and passed eventually in 1952, many of us thought that this would be the basis for the assistance of needy people; but now, with talks of shortages, with talks of economies, with talks of stringency in financial policy, in my opinion, there is a dangerous attitude growing up amongst certain sections of the community and amongst certain members of this House.  A great deal of suspicion has been cast upon those people who are in receipt of social assistance especially.</P>
    <P>I do not refer to any remarks that may have been attributed to the present Parliamentary Secretary or, as he says himself, misconstrued, when I say there seems to be an attitude growing up in the country that the person in receipt of some form of social assistance is a &ldquo;chancer,&rdquo; a waster or a blackguard.  I do not think that is entirely fair and, above all, entirely correct.  Because there is no means test and because it is applied generally, there is no such attitude towards every one of us who is married and who has children in receipt of the children's allowances, and we should be prepared, at least I shall be prepared, to defend these people who are in receipt of widows' non-contributory pensions, unemployment <Col N="1113" /> assistance, the dole, or old-age pensions.</P>
    <P>One would imagine from the remarks of some people and the attitude of certain sections of our community that this was pure charity and that these people by some fraudulent device were given something that was not their due.  I raised a question with the Parliamentary Secretary here in order to publicise the matter.  I said I did agree with the Parliamentary Secretary, that possibly there were some people&mdash;I know there are some people &mdash;who received unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit and who were not legally entitled to it, but I did not think we should use these examples to condemn the unfortunate fellow who is on the dole and has a few shillings per week and who will now get the sum of 1/- per week to make up the increase resulting from the withdrawal of the food subsidies in the last Budget.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine what 1/- per week will do for these people and I would urge the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary to see that this will be further increased in the next Budget or in some other way.  There seems also to be an attitude adopted especially in this House and by various Ministers of State and Ministers for Social Welfare that where the State can provide the local authority will provide.  The local authorities have become very niggardly in the last few years.  The many people who are in receipt of State assistance by way of old age pensions, widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions or unemployment assistance are regarded by the local authorities as not being deserving of either home assistance or disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>The tendency of the local authorities &mdash;and we can see it even at their estimates meetings&mdash;is to cut down on all these things.  They still must maintain the same level of grants for certain agricultural undertakings.  The premium must be given for the mare, the foal, the boar and the bull, but they are cutting down every day on such things as home assistance, disabled person's maintenance allowance and <Col N="1114" /> the other types of assistance.  There is a legal obligation on these local authorities to assist people who need this little help but, over and above all that, there is a moral obligation on the local authorities or should I say on the ratepayers of the various countries to provide for people who cannot provide for themselves, but in my opinion the local authorities are falling down badly on that job.</P>

In conclusion, I want to insist again, despite the remarks of the Minister for Social Welfare, that last year as far as social insurance and social assistance were concerned I, in the last Government recognised the trend, accepted responsibility for the position at that time and provided under social insurance an extra £1,500,000 for the unemployed, and an extra £131,000 for those in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again we propose to add substantially to the list of supplementaries introduced by the Government. We shall now exceed by some £4,250,000 what the Minister for Finance said in his Budget statement would be a careful estimate.  This, of course, is a necessary Supplementary Estimate and one that the Government must get to meet the many and severe charges that rest to-day on the shoulders of old age pensioners, the recipients of children's allowances, unemployment assistance, widows' and orphans' pensions, and so on.  Why have they to face this additional expenditure? Partly because of the effect of last year's Budget, partly because of the withdrawal of food subsidies?  This is a contribution to compensate for the impact of the withdrawal of the food subsidies.  What was presented to the House and the country last year as a saving in that respect is dwindling rapidly as we have to provide for the sections of our people who cannot stand up to what they are asked to endure in consequence of the impact of the withdrawal of those subsidies. <Col N="1115" /> Where will it stop?  It has fired off a round of wage increases that has not yet and will not, for some time, be felt by those old age pensioners, by everybody who lives in this country.</P>
      <P>That is not all it has done.  We have the charges already on the Exchequer for C.I.E. We shall have continuing charges arising out of the increase in the cost of living deliberately brought about by governmental action at Budget time last year.  Perhaps in reply the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary would indicate the part of this supplementary which can be attributed to the direct consequences flowing from the initiation of that budgetary policy.  We do not contend that the miserable 1/- a week given at that time in compensation&mdash;and let me quote from the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

No doubt he will explain to the unemployed of Cork, and to the wives who were to get their husbands to work, how miserably his Government are failing in that respect.  It will be an interesting contribution when it comes and one that will be appreciated by the unfortunate people of Cork City who were duped this day 12 months into voting for him and his colleagues. No doubt he will explain how they failed to bring down the cost of living&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance speaking last year in introducing the Budget said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government recognise that there are certain sections of the community whom it would be unfair to expect to bear the full impact of the ending of the food subsidies, namely, those who are in receipt of unemployment assistance, blind pensioners, old age pensioners, widows and others in the social assistance categories.  Accordingly, the Government have decided that there should be a general increase of 1/- a week in social assistance payments, extending to adult dependents and one dependent child.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was one of the provisions that had to be made to cushion the weaker sections of the community against the impact of that increase in the cost of living.  The people in the community were led to believe that it was never said by the members of this Government that they would not withdraw the food subsidies.  The Taoiseach committed himself in Mayo in that respect, but the people did not realise it fully. <Col N="1117" /> There were some economists who could afford to hold the view and felt that it would be a good move to reduce expenditure in the country by the withdrawal of the food subsidies.  To-day can we say that that money has been saved?  Is it not true that there is reflected in the rates of every local authority in Ireland a charge in relation to the additional cost of maintaining our public institutions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise on this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is part of the complete picture which I am trying to paint.  What I am depicting is a series of charges which are being made on the national and local exchequers to meet the effects of the policy initiated by this Government when it introduced its first Budget last year.  This is a direct consequence of that financial policy and in it, remember, we do not go a fraction of the way to meeting what are the just needs of the old people, the people who are unemployed, the widows and orphans and the blind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a sheer impossibility for any Government to discover all individuals in the community who have been hit by that type of policy.  We would like to know where it is to stop and whether the Government have yet reached the point in expenditure where they would not have to find one additional penny in taxation by leaving subsidies untouched.  If they have not reached that point, they should certainly be drawing very close to it.  We have to find in this Estimate, for the assistance of those who are employed, £150,000&mdash;for the men who have been put out of work, who were gainfully engaged on operations under the Local Authorities Works Act.  £250,000 at £5 per week to meet the charges that a household has to bear to-day, gone by the board and substituted for by £3 ls. per week which entails an expenditure of £150,000.  And there are people to-day, some of our high-brow economists, who will say that that was a saving of £250,000 to the Exchequer. May God preserve this country from many more of these savings if we are to be presented periodically with the <Col N="1118" /> type of absolutely necessary Supplementary Estimate as this is, in order to cushion the impacts of this Government's policy on the section of the community least able to stand up to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickPGogan" hpid="Mr. Gogan Mr. Gogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am influenced in speaking to this Estimate by the hope that what I say may reach the ear of the Minister before he frames the Budget.  The figure of £10,500,000 mentioned in the leaflet for social assistance will surely give us serious thought in regard to the position that has arisen &mdash;that year by year a greater number of old people are becoming dependent on an ever-decreasing number of people who are able to earn.  The time has now come when some differentiation should be made in the old age pension given to those in rural areas and to pensioners living in cities like Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.</P>
      <P>Old age pensioners in the country who have largely got their pensions by surrendering their farms are certainly in a more advantageous position than the old age pensioners living in rooms in Dublin.  Certainly, they enjoy the advantage of cheaper food, while the old age pensioner living in the city has to pay the higher costs.  I wonder would the Minister give the House some estimate of what an increase in the old age pension to 30/- in the urban areas would involve.  The underlying principle of the Children's Allowances Act was, I understand, to promote the rearing of larger families and for the welfare of growing children.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that in Dublin this principle has been very seriously infringed. So far as the Health Act is concerned, children's allowances are being taken into consideration in the assessment of maternity grants and the general medical service card.  I wonder will the Minister do what I ask, that is, to preclude, by Order, the taking into account of children's allowances in those assessments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Estimate for widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions, I think it is time now that we ceased to penalise the widow who is willing to go to work and who, during her periods of unemployment, is penalised to the extent that her unemployment <Col N="1119" /> benefit is taken in as means. I would ask the Minister to consider with doing away with that provision in the Social Welfare Act.  The Minister will probably ask where is the additional money to come from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker has formulated a theory which I have heard put forward for the first time in this House&mdash;that pensioners in rural areas are not entitled to as high a rate of pension as those who live in cities and towns.  The reason he put forward was that, in most cases, the people in the rural areas had signed over their holdings to their sons in order to qualify for a pension.  I wonder does Deputy Gogan really know what is happening <Col N="1120" /> in the country.  Anybody familiar with conditions in the country at the present time is absolutely shocked at the flight from the land.  It is not so much the case of a father and mother, after rearing their family, signing over their place to get old-age pensions.  The trouble is to get one son to stay at home to inherit the old family place.  I, for one, could not possibly countenance a theory like that, which proposes a differentiation between old age pensioners in the country, on the one hand, and in the towns and cities, on the other.  I do not know if Deputy Gogan is speaking on behalf of his Party, or on behalf of the Government, but I am sure a proposal like that would meet with a very stormy reception in this House.</P>
      <P>There is a growing demand for an increase in old age pensions, in the country as well as in the towns and cities.  There are several sound reasons for that.  In the Six Counties, the old age pension is practically double what it is here and, instead of reducing old age pensions in the country, there is a demand for increasing them.  That demand would meet with the support of every Deputy who is in touch with his constituency and knows the true conditions at the present time.  One thing which has always occurred to me &mdash;and what I am going to say arises under unemployment assistance&mdash;is that every Government, not alone in this country but elsewhere, seems to be able to get money for every possible scheme imaginable.  Why then is it not possible to get money to put people into employment here?  We are not an over-developed country; we are sadly under-developed.  Development means employment and employment would mean less of a bill under the heading in the White Paper which the Minister has placed before us to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has certainly fallen down on its job.  This is the first time I have spoken on the question of unemployment since this Government took office almost a year ago to-day.  It will be a year in another 11 or 14 days. I want to ask were Fianna Fáil genuine in what they were saying in the spate of propaganda used in the <i>Irish Press</i><Col N="1121" /> and <i>Sunday Press</i> against our Government during the 12 months before we went out of office?  I wanted to give Deputy Lemass a chance to implement his promise to give jobs to 100,000 boys and girls and so keep them at home. Now I see after a year that it is time to speak and condemn the rotten tactics that were used by Fianna Fáil to get into power.</P>
    <P>It is a desperate thing when a Government Party, who were in office for quite a long time, can fool the people simply because they have two powerful organs of propaganda which they try to shove into homes all over the country.  They said in those organs: &ldquo;We will get cracking,&rdquo; and &ldquo;We have a plan to give 100,000 jobs to boys and girls to keep them at home.&rdquo;  It is time somebody raised his voice now after 12 months.  I want to confess that I deliberately kept silent.  I know no Government can work miracles overnight. They want time to do what they said they would do, but I see now through the whole sham by which the people were tricked in the last election.</P>
    <P>It is very bad leadership and creates a dangerous precedent when any Party goes out and makes promises which they know in their hearts they cannot fulfil.  I am not saying this for politics. I would make every allowance if it was a new Party which came in with big support.  I could understand their enthusiasm running ahead of them, and their making promises they would not be quite sure of; but Fianna Fáil, who had 16 unbroken years in office, and a further two or three years later, in the last general election deliberately fooled the people.  There is a very dangerous explosive feeling amonst many of the people throughout the country over the shameful way they have been tricked.  If we were a more dangerous type of people&mdash;fortunately we are a peace-loving people&mdash; I could see us taking very stern methods to show those who had tricked us that they could not do it again.  I could easily see people in other countries not taking that lying down as our people do.</P>
    <P>The unemployment position is rapidly getting out of hand.  In forestry, bunches of men are being thrown out <Col N="1122" /> of work.  There is no employment in the Land Commission.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act, under the county councils, is a complete dead letter and the building trade is practically closed.  It is impossible to get grants.  After years of urging farmers to produce, that production was the only salvation of this country, we find that the farmers have done what they were ask to do.  We find, according to the people over there, that overproduction of wheat, butter and bacon is evil.  According to them, it is evil that we have sufficient wheat, a surplus of butter and enough bacon. Another thing puzzling the people very much is that, with overproduction, though prices are naturally coming down, at the same time the cost of living on townspeople is soaring still higher.  That is contributing to unemployment.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of social assistance to which I want to direct the Minister's attention.  It is that every trick is being used at the present time to discourage the honest recipients of unemployment assistance, and to trick them out of what the law says they are entitled to.  I will not take it as a reply when the Minister mentions that some people are drawing unemployment assistance or benefit wrongly. Perhaps that is so, but I am talking about genuine cases who have no other means of livelihood and have barely enough to keep body and soul together. When they go to the local labour exchanges, they are laughed at and jeered at and told they are tricking.</P>
    <P>Another favourite method has come to my notice, not once but many times, that is, those who have stamped their cards are refused simply because they happen to be employed by a distant relative, a neighbour or someone like that.  What authority has any labour exchange manager to deem a person a rogue for claiming this money, alleging that he is claiming wrongfully?  Where do managers get that authority?  Is it from the Minister?  What directions are issued to them?</P>
    <P>I will not take it from the Minister that there are people drawing these moneys wrongfully.  That is not an answer.  If people are doing that, the <Col N="1123" /> Minister has the means of dealing with that problem.  I am talking about the genuine cases.  I can quote cases where those entitled to unemployment benefit have been refused benefit at the whim of a labour exchange manager who decides some people are rogues, while others are not.</P>
    <P>The unemployment problem has reached huge proportions.  I do not expect the Government to work a miracle overnight, but they should find some means of employment for our people.  There is plenty of room for development; there is plenty of work that could be done.  I do not know what figure the Minister would be asking from this House to-night if we did not have the huge volume of emigration, particularly in the past two and three months.  Hitherto, the pattern was for people to migrate, or emigrate, around March and April and return home in November and December. Now the reverse is happening.  Our people left in their thousands in the months of November, December and January.</P>
    <P>Another serious aspect is that the parents are leaving also.  Hitherto, it was the pattern that they remained at home with some members of the family.  Now whole families are tearing themselves up by the roots and moving <i>en bloc</i> to England.  Anybody who travels in the rural areas will see houses which were built only a few years ago with the doors locked and the windows shuttered.  Whole families have emigrated.  Yet, during election time the people were told by Deputy Lemass that he had 100,000 jobs in his pocket to keep our boys and girls at home.  Should there be another election in the morning, I suppose the <i>Irish Press</i> would headline another 100,000 jobs to fool the people again. That is a dangerous policy, because even a quiet people, such as ours, will tolerate fooling for a certain length of time but, once their tempers are roused, the situation will become serious and serious damage may be done to the nation before the situation can be redeemed.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary <Col N="1124" /> Estimate is some measure of the destitution which has been created amongst the poorer classes during the last 12 months, and particularly since the introduction of the Budget.  But it is not the real measure.  It is not the true measure.</P>
      <P>Mention was made that this £2,000,000 is more or less explained by the 1/- per week increase to the old age pensioners, the widows, the blind pensioners and others of the assistance classes in order to compensate them for the increase in prices, particularly the increase in the price of bread and butter.  At the time that 1/- was given the loaf cost approximately 1/1.  To-day the loaf costs practically 1/4.  Likewise butter was increased then to 4/2. It is now 4/4.  Yet, the assistance classes are expected to pay the increase of almost 6d. in the price of the loaf and 7d. in the price of the pound of butter with this 1/- per week. This is some measure of the destitution which has been created amongst the assistance classes at the moment.</P>
      <P>I should like an explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to the conduct of assistance officers throughout the country.  Has he given them specific instructions to go around to recipients of widows' pensions, old age pensions and so forth and cross-question them, for the purpose of finding out whether it may be possible to cut their pensions?

      <P>&mdash;being sent out no doubt by the Parliamentary Secretary. Deputy Gogan claimed here that old age pensions, widows' pensions, children's allowances and so forth were invented by Fianna Fáil.  The fact is Fianna Fáil were forced to bring in these social welfare benefits because of the measure of destitution they had created amongst many sections in the community by reason of the policies they implemented down through the years.  As Deputy Blowick said, the difficulties of the present time are directly the result of 20 years of Fianna Fáil administration&mdash;16 of those years being uninterrupted.</P>
      <P>To-day we have a situation wherein our people are emigrating as rapidly as possible; but social welfare recipients cannot, for the most part, emigrate.  They cannot go in search of employment because they are not physically fit to take on wage-earning jobs.  They must exist at home on the meagre allowances made available to them through the medium of social welfare benefits.  The Government has treated these people very meanly in giving them a meagre 1/- per week to compensate them for the heavy increase in the price of essential foodstuffs, particularly bread and butter, as a result of the last Budget.</P>
      <P>There is also in this Supplementary Estimate a sum payable under the 1930 Act, as amended, in respect of the cost of school meals.  This increase in cost is also directly the result of the increase in the price of bread and butter in relation to those schoolgoing children who qualify for school meals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy" hpid="Mr. J. Murphy Mr. J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in view of the great hardships which the high cost of living imposes on the unemployed, old age pensioners, the sick, and widows, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that all social welfare benefits should be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing this motion, I feel it should be discussed on its own merits without reference to previous controversies which were part of the last <Col N="1129" /> Budget debate.  I feel that Party affiliations and loyalties should have no part in assessing its worth.  I appeal to the House to realise that this motion cuts across, and indeed is even greater than, Party or Party policies.  The part of the motion which states that the high cost of living imposes great hardship on the unemployed, old age pensioners, the sick and the widows cannot be denied and should be agreed by all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Since the last Budget was introduced, there has been a sharp increase in the cost of living the effect of which, to a certain extent, has been offset in the case of those who are organised and relatively strong to defend their interests through price and wage increases.  This is not so in the case of the unemployed, the old age pensioners, the sick and widows, who have to depend on the goodwill of the Government for the maintenance of their standard of living.  It surely will not be denied that the community as a whole are responsible for the welfare and care of our aged and unemployed. I claim with justification that this is a vital test of our Christianity.  It is of little use to talk in pious terms of our spiritual empire and Christian State while tens of thousands of our people live on the border line of starvation and in abject poverty.</P>
    <P>The high cost of living, I claim, is a direct result of Government financial policy.  Nobody can deny the fact that these unfortunate people, through no fault of their own, suffer extreme hardship.  Present conditions it can be said are the result of misgovernment, not alone of one Party, but of every Party since the foundation of this much-lauded, Christian and democratic State.  I am convinced that no one present would like to live or support a family on the income allowed by the State to these unfortunate poor people.  In fact, I challenge any Deputy here to try it just for one week.</P>
    <P>Let us take a closer look at how, in practice, these allowances work out and see how an unemployed man, his wife and family really live.  Here is a household bill taken from an account, <Col N="1130" /> given to me and verified by me, of a man, his wife and six children at present living in Ballyfermot.  I want it on the records of the House, and, if needs be, to go forth to the world, as an indictment of the hypocrisy which has been a feature of all Irish Governments. This man's total income is £3 16s. 10½d. per week, which includes unemployment assistance and children's allowances.  Out of that, he pays rent, light, fuel, insurance and bus fares.  He is then left with £1 15s. 3½d. for food, clothing, school books and a dozen or so other little odds and ends to run a home.  In this case, the man has a young child preparing for first Holy Communion and another preparing for Confirmation.  There may be some in this House who do not know, but in the life of a working-class Christian family, this occasion should be one of joy for both parent and child.  Can that be so in this case?</P>
    <P>The weekly diet consists of bread, margarine and tea.  If anybody doubts me, I can show him hundreds of similar cases only a stone's throw from this very building.  He is left with £1 15s 3½d. for the week.  He buys bread, two loaves per day, which cost him 16/4 per week, leaving him 8/11½ to buy tea, margarine and sugar for the week.  Would anybody dare tell me that this is a good wholesome diet&mdash;two loaves a day, approximately ¼ lb. of tea, 1 lb. of sugar and ½ lb. of margarine among two adults and six young children for a week? This family, like thousands of other Irish families, do not taste Irish butter which is subsidised and exported daily. Neither do they taste foodstuffs like meat, fish, bacon and eggs.  I do not think it can be disputed that this diet is completely and absolutely inadequate.</P>
    <P>Here is a diet calculated to sustain working ability and health.  It is issued by the Canadian Medical Association and subscribed to by Sir John Boyd Orr who up to recently was head of the World Food Organisation.  The weekly diet for a man, his wife and only three children is as follows: milk, 38 pts.; cheese, 1½ lbs.; butter, 3½ lbs.; potatoes, 19 lbs.; fresh vegetables, 24 lbs.; dried vegetables, <Col N="1131" /> 1½ lbs.; fresh fruit, 8 lbs.; meat and fish, 8 lbs.; eggs, 1½ dozen; bread, 22½ lbs.; and flour cereals, 7 lbs.  The contrast, needless to say, is striking. The hunger and hardship suffered by our unemployed and aged people in particular during the recent spell of cold weather can only be imagined by most in this House.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of a single man drawing unemployment assistance of 19/6d. per week.  Can we say that is adequate to pay for rent, lodgings, food and clothing and, perhaps, a smoke, if he is entitled to a smoke?  At column 957 of the Official Debates for November 21, 1957, the Minister for Defence stated that the Army diet from 26th October, 1957, to 1st November, 1957, Dublin and Dún Laoghaire average retail prices, cost £1 13s. 7¼d. While this may be a good wholesome diet, it is not by any means a luxurious diet.  There are many here with Army experience who will tell you that many a young soldier could eat twice as much, if he got it.</P>
    <P>The sole increase for a single man on unemployment assistance is 1/- in a period of five and a half years.  This is expected to offset the cost of living which increased in that period by, roughly, 23 per cent., or 27 points.  Is it any wonder that our young people are fleeing from the shores of this country?  The young people who are left are faced with two things: either they must starve or steal.</P>
    <P>Finally, let us look at the old age pensioners whose weekly income at the moment is 25/-.  Our welfare workers report cases of real hardship amongst our aged people who helped to build this State but who are now left destitute.  Their married sons and daughters cannot help these unfortunate people because of three factors. Their sons and daughters cannot help them through the high cost of living, because they have emigrated or because they are unemployed.  The feeling of being forgotten or unwanted is not the least degradation which these poor unfortunate people suffer.  They are unable to maintain themselves in a proper condition of health, due to the lack of essential foodstuffs.  This <Col N="1132" /> in particular applies to the young children of the unemployed man.  The health of these young children is being impaired at the very stage in their lives when they require the means of healthy development to enable them to take their place in the future affairs of this nation.</P>
    <P>Can any Deputy say we cannot improve the lot of these unfortunate people?  Many millions of pounds are spent on hospitals and sanatoria to combat diseases such as tuberculosis, which in many cases is the result of undernourishment.  Would it not be far better policy for us to invest in the health of our youth?  The Minister may say that we have no money, that we cannot afford to give these men any more.  I have no doubt that the Irish people will consider that a downright lie.  Many millions of pounds are invested in British joint stock companies by Irish nationals.  I ask the Minister to tell the House why these patriotic investments are not taxed to the hilt.</P>
    <P>Every year our playboys spend many thousands of pounds abroad on holidays. Surely here again must be a fruitful field for taxation.  Why do we not tell these people that we have an economic crisis on our hands?  Why must the weaker sections be called upon to pull us out of each crisis which is the result of Government financial policy?  Why do we not tell those others that they have a duty to the community?</P>
    <P>Many local government bodies have written to me supporting this motion. Members of the Fianna Fáil Party have passed similar resolutions.  I hope to hear many members on the Fianna Fáil benches speaking to and supporting this measure.  They were very considerate about the unemployed and aged people during the last general election.  I hope they will support this motion now.  I challenge the Government to allow a free vote of the House on this issue.  I am quite confident that any Deputy would not face his constituents after voting against this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Murphy.  Deputy Murphy was elected by the people for whom he speaks, and I was likewise elected by the same class of people.  Therefore, I do not think there are any Deputies more fitted to speak on behalf of the people mentioned in the motion than ourselves.  The motion is something that everyone can accept&mdash;even the Minister.  If the motion specifically stated that we should give all those people an extra 10/-, or any amount, I could understand the motion being opposed, but the motion merely asks that some improvement be brought about.  That is all.  It could be 3d. or it could be 5/-.  No matter what we hope it is, there is nothing specified.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the motion can be accepted on principle and there is very little in it that the Minister or any member of the Government Party can object to.  It would be blatant hypocrisy if it were opposed, in view of the fact that at the election they claimed they would make things better.  Having been returned, they cannot vote against a motion which merely asks that these people should receive increased social benefits.  Prior to this generation, there was nothing in the nature of social benefits.  Perhaps people were very simple, satisfied with potatoes and salt and the poorhouse; but I am not certain they would now be satisfied with that.</P>
      <P>At some stage, it was decided there should be social benefits, but whatever yardstick was used then, no proper allowance was made for rising costs since it was decided to give those benefits.  It was decided that a certain amount was necessary to save people from dire want.  They could not expect to get enough to have a few points or a packet of cigarettes every day, but they should at least get enough to purchase the simple foods and perhaps a packet of cigarettes at the week-end. The minimum amount must have been laid down at one time and I would like to know if the increases that were given from time to time kept step with the increased cost of living.  That must not have happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past few months, we had the Dublin Corporation strike and <Col N="1134" /> threats of strike elsewhere by workers, who said that, in spite of a wage of £7 10s., they needed another 10/- a week to compensate them for the increased cost of living.  If they were serious in their claims, what must the unemployed require?</P>
    <P>A single man gets 19/- while, if working, he would get £8 now.  What then must his living conditions be like?  We are inviting these people to go about and steal.  It is a good thing, as has been mentioned, that we are not a very war-like people, or something would have happened.  Emigration saves us from that and I am not at all certain that the authorities do not connive at it and drink another &ldquo;half-one&rdquo; every time they hear of another boatload going out, because it averts the danger of a riot.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 19/-, the single man may get another 5/- from home assistance, but not much more.  That is only in the case of a man residing on his own, towards the cost of the house.  A man and his wife get 30/- and he may get an extra 10/&mdash;about the maximum&mdash;from home assistance. Compared with the man who is employed and getting £8, that man and his wife get 30/-.  Take the person with a large family.  The maximum allowance, if he has six, eight or ten children, is 45/- and he may get 15/- extra from home assistance; in other words, a maximum of about £3 to keep a family of ten.</P>
    <P>I know the arguments about the lack of exports, lack of production and money, but we must not forget the people now running the country are the &ldquo;know-alls&rdquo; who have been telling us: &ldquo;Put us into power and we will do what is needed.&rdquo;  They are the people who have the responsibility and it is their job to find the means to carry it out.</P>
    <P>We are being told that Partition will end&mdash;bunk!  Even though the nationalists still shout: &ldquo;Down with Partition&rdquo;, if it was put to them seriously to-morrow that they could come into the Twenty-Six Counties and have the same social benefits, I believe they would be insane to do it and would not, in fact, come in.</P>
    <P>In England, the average employed <Col N="1135" /> worker earns about £12 per week because of overtime and other considerations, while the average worker here gets £8 and generally no overtime. Yet the person with six or eight, or even 20 children will not get more than £3, including home assistance.</P>
    <P>When, in my maiden speech, I sneered at the miserable shilling granted as a result of the withdrawal of the food subsidies, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;Where could we get it?&rdquo;  They withdrew the subsidies.  If they did it to the employed worker, it would have been bad enough, but the subsidies were withdrawn for the unemployed man also.  How did it affect him?  He got one shilling extra.  I have investigated this matter and I have learned that a man will eat five loaves of bread a week&mdash;a poor man eats more bread than a well-to-do man who would have chicken and steak and so on.  The addition to the price of bread was 3d. and, on the basis of five loaves per week, cost him 1/3.  I have worked out that a man eats at least one pound of butter with five loaves and the cost of that pound of butter was increased by 7d.</P>
    <P>The price of tea was increased.  Then it came down a little, no thanks to the Government.  I have worked out that a poor person, who uses more tea than the well-to-do person, consumes at least 6 ozs. a week.  Taking the cheaper tea, that represents an extra 6d. a week as a result of the Budget.  I have worked out the cost of the withdrawal of subsidies at 2/4 to the poor person on the three items I have mentioned. By way of compensation he got one shilling.  Almost one-third of the community draw social benefits of one kind or another.  I am a member of Dublin Corporation and I am concerned with differential rents.  All the people who are tenants of the local authority were docked threepence out of that one shilling because the differential system is based on total income, irrespective of the source of income. These people got ninepence, not one shilling.</P>
    <P>Since then, prices have risen.  Bus fares are going up and all the firms that have been compelled to give an extra ten shillings in wages will put up <Col N="1136" /> the price of their commodities.  All those depending on social benefits will have to pay an extra threepence here and fourpence there and so on.  If the cost of the withdrawal of the subsidies was 2/4, it is no exaggeration to say that the other increases in the cost of services and commodities will amount to another 2/4.  I say that those on social benefits have had their cost of living increased by at least 4/8 since the present Government came into office.  The only compensation for that was the allowance of one shilling and, in the case of tenants of the local authority, ninepence.</P>
    <P>The motion does not specify that all social welfare benefits should be increased by 4/8d.  I think that should be done.  We are not specifying any particular amount but simply asking that these benefits should be increased. It would be hypocrisy to deny that an increase is justified.</P>
    <P>I am not particularly in favour of one Government as against the other, although I like to be fair.  The Coalition Government did not do so well either but they did not spin the tale as much as the Government in power.  They did not make such blatant promises.  They were unfairly treated because it cannot be denied that the unemployment position at the time of their defeat was due somewhat to their efforts to balance payments.  In trying to do that they were doing work of national importance, from which the Fianna Fáil Government benefited afterwards. While they did not do so well, at least they did not bluff or trick the people as much as the present Government did.  I maintain that the present Government have not kept their promises and certainly have made the position of those on social welfare benefits considerably worse.  I know that the argument will be that social services are costing more and cannot be increased.  There are various ways in which we can do what we want to do.</P>
    <P>We had a political revolution but we never had a social revolution.  That is one of the weaknesses of our system. We took over many things that a social revolution would have changed.  We took over a system based on imperialism, with all forms of vested interests <Col N="1137" /> financial and otherwise, and tried to carry on a Tom Thumb imperial State. We should have realised that there was a very big social problem and that we had to live according to our means. That applies to everyone from the President down, not merely to those at the bottom.  It is too often the practice of Governments when thinking in terms of economy to make the people at the bottom pay for it.  Before the French Revolution it was those who had little or nothing who were asked to pay taxes while the wealthy sections paid none.</P>
    <P>The vital question is: where will the money come from?  We have consular offices all over the world.  We have the Army.  I intend no reflection on the Army, but I say that it is organised on conventional lines and that I do not think we could ever make proper use of it.  To a large extent it is a waste of money.  There could be considerable saving on the Army.  There could be a saving in administration, which is top heavy.  For example, there was an advertisement in the Press for tenders for coal for Government Departments while we are asking the people to burn turf.</P>
    <P>Last week I asked a question as to why we are importing ammunition but did not get a satisfactory answer.  I was told that we could employ 1,000 men.  I shall have another question down to-morrow about it.  A business firm would change its system in order to make it pay, but our State is operating a Tom Thumb imperial system. Over the years many people have got into authority whose ability I personally doubt.  That was the result of nepotism and giving positions to people who had not ability.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is constantly lecturing industrialists about initiative and ability but in our set-up here do we always demand ability or is it a question of who you are?</P>
    <P>As an Old I.R.A. man, I could not be against the language, but I do say that there could be some economy in that matter at this stage.  We ought not to be in such a hurry.  The language is used as a red herring to cover up deficiencies. While I support the language and always will support it, I <Col N="1138" /> do not support it in the sense of giving responsible jobs to people who may know the language but who may be numskulls.  I want efficiency so that we can get the best possible results from our efforts.  If we try to do that, we may be able to get more out of the country and then give more.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting of the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation, a motion was passed providing that the rents of 20,000 corporation tenants shall be raised 3d. per room when the next rate is struck.  In other words, 20,000 corporation tenants will have their rent raised from 9d. to 1/3 within the next few weeks.  Do not forget that one-third of all corporation tenants are persons affected by this motion. Twenty thousand of them live in flat rent dwellings.  One-third of that 20,000 will be compelled to pay 9d. to 1/3 more for rent in addition to all the other increases that have taken place in living costs since the withdrawal of the subsidies.</P>
    <P>I should like the House to remember this also.  Three days after the last general election, the Dublin Corporation&mdash;which is controlled by political Parties&mdash;raised the rent of those houses by 3d. a room.  All these things have to be taken into consideration when considering this motion because one-third of the community is depending on social benefits and that one-third of the community is affected by every rise.  I think I have said enough.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister again that whether he agrees or disagrees with what I say or with what anybody else says he cannot object to the motion. If it specified a certain amount, he could object and say he could not do it.  I am asking him to take everything which I and other speakers have said into consideration and to give something decent to the people in question.  No matter how it is paid for, let it be paid for.  It must be done unless we are to have a continuation of emigration and unless we are to encourage them to steal.  If they are put to it, people will have no hesitation about revolting.  I appeal to the Minister to give these people a reasonable standard of living&mdash;enough to give them just the simple foods and, maybe, <Col N="1139" /> a packet of &ldquo;Woodbines&rdquo; on a Friday. I am not asking for much more.</P>
    <P>We must take into consideration all the rises that have occurred and all the rises that have yet to come.  As a result of increases, the prices of commodities will be advanced to the consumers. Do not take advantage of the fact that these people are not organised. They are not corporation workers. They do not belong to a union.  They cannot paralyse a city, leave the street lights on for days, and so on.  They are just unorganised old men who want a bare existence.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy MacEntee, who has just come into the House, was not present for my speech but I cannot repeat it now.  I would ask him to be good enough to read my speech and give those people a little consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this motion&mdash;not support it in the abstract on the question of the principle as to whether or not an increase is justified but rather in the sense of looking for a specific increase that will offset the increased cost of living, as has to be borne by the people mentioned in the motion, that is, the social welfare group in general.  Other speakers have said that the increases in the Budget have been compensated for, on the whole, by the organised group of workers securing for their members a 10/- per week increase. But, while this 10/- a week has been secured it is not suggested by the groups speaking on behalf of the organised workers that 10/- per week did compensate them for the increased cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was admitted by the trade union movement and accepted by the Employers' Federation and, in general, throughout the country it was looked upon as a fact that the 10/- per week compensated only for part of the increase and that the workers agreed to <Col N="1140" /> carry the other portion as their contribution towards the national effort in the interest of the economy of the country while the employers, on their side, agreed to pay the 10/- and, if and where possible, not to pass on the increase to the consumers.  There was an agreed policy and I understand it received the blessing and approval of the present Government.</P>
    <P>The 1/- increase that was granted at the time the Budget was introduced cannot in any way be considered as compensation for the increases that have occurred consequent upon it. Everyone who is a member of a local authority and who has had any experience of dealing with this particular group of people realises that, over and above the benefit they receive under the Department of Social Welfare, they have to be subsidised by the local authorities in the form of home assistance of one sort or another.  This home assistance is governed by a decision of the local authority which is usually a county council or a corporation.  It is really moving the burden from the backs of the taxpapers and placing it on the backs of the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>Whilst most local authorities are very conscious of the fact that these particular groups&mdash;the old, the widow, the sick and the unemployed, especially those on unemployment assistance&mdash;are in need of subsidisation in the form of home assistance, you will find that there is no uniformity throughout the country.  One local authority is more generous than another.  One local authority will provide, say, 10/- a week extra for an old age pensioner; another local authority may provide only 1/6 or 2/-.  I suggest that, instead of the local authorities being made to provide for these people &mdash;as they are&mdash;it is the responsibility of the Government, through the Department of Social Welfare, to provide an increase.</P>
    <P>The last speaker indicated strongly that an increase was needed and he did not put any limit on it.  I am told, and the Book of Estimates bears it out, that a 25 per cent. increase, say, for unemployed people&mdash;those in the unemployment assistance group, whom I consider the most needy&mdash;would come <Col N="1141" /> to about £250,000.  The man drawing on his stamps has a maximum of £3 1s. per week.  That is not big but it may be sufficient to tide him over a period of unemployment.  After drawing on his stamps for six months he goes on to unemployment assistance with a means test.  That varies from 19/- to a maximum of 45/- benefit.  I notice in the Book of Estimates that a 25 per cent. increase would cost only £250,000. Surely £250,000 can be found to give a 25 per cent. increase to these needy unemployed and their dependents? The figures can be found in the current Book of Estimates.  I am quite sure that in all the other various categories a similar increase could be granted.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary, representing a Government, will have to say to himself: &ldquo;That is all very well.  We all want to give an increase but where will the money come from?&rdquo;  I suggest that a luxury tax be imposed with these specific people in mind.  If necessary, an additional stamp could be put on the packet of cigarettes.  Let each carton or packet of cigarettes carry an additional stamp, the value being a 1d. or 2d. so that the smoker who gets his enjoyment from that habit or vice, whichever you call it, and who is addicted to it, may know that by smoking more and more he is contributing some specified sum to relieve the wants of this needy section of the community.</P>
    <P>Let us have it on the cinema seats or on other forms of entertainment; let us have it on drink, if possible; let us have it on luxury goods.  In my Party, although we are not anxious for taxation, we would welcome and agree with a denifite tax which was named and declared to be for an increase of benefit for the social welfare group.</P>
    <P>However, I suggest that even all that is not necessary.  Why was it that the master bakers were given a refund last year?  Could the money which was kept for them not have been used towards the social welfare increase?  I understand that it would give approximately a 25 per cent. increase to the unemployment assistance group.  I would <Col N="1142" /> suggest that the butter subsidy, which we are now paying&mdash;roughly 1/3 a lb. for export&mdash;would provide 3 lbs. of butter for the unemployed at the former subsidy of 5d. per lb.  In other words, butter could be used and eaten by the unemployed at a reduced cost, a cost cheaper than is being paid at present for other people outside the State to eat it.  Surely there was an opportunity in these two things alone to provide an increase for the unemployed, for the sick, for the widow and for the orphan.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party agree with this motion; we shall support it or any similar motion.  We shall do more&mdash;we shall go into the Lobby to support direct taxation, if it is earmarked to pay for such an increase as this motion calls for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kyne is to be congratulated on facing this motion in a realistic manner.  It was refreshing to hear increased taxation for a specific purpose advocated in the Dáil. As I listened to some of the other speakers, I wondered if they realised that anything the Government gives by way of increases or grants must be collected from the people.  Bearing that in mind, we must realise that this motion calls for increases which would involve a vast expenditure, in my opinion, if the increase is to be in any way useful to the people to whom it will be given.</P>
      <P>I remember when the present Uachtarán, Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh, introduced the widows' and orphans' pensions legislation here.  At that time, he said that the amount was small&mdash; it was 7/6, if I remember correctly&mdash; but he said that he hoped that, as the State advanced and the years passed, this benefit and other benefits of a similar kind would be increased, to deal with people of that description. He then had in his mind that what the State was able to provide was what should be provided.  We must bear that in mind now, when we are considering increases all round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that, when the Budget is being prepared, the Minister will have <Col N="1143" /> all these things in mind when he is considering the question of increases on the commodities Deputy Kyne mentioned. The Deputy promised his Party will support such increases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>For a certain purpose, for an earmarked purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a rather difficult thing, but it is an increase in taxation just the same.  When these increases are imposed on cigarettes, beer, spirits and cinemas, it is doubtful whether the amount realised in revenue will be increased.  We are told, and I believe there is some truth in it, that we have almost reached saturation point where taxation is concerned and that if we impose heavier taxes, even to give benefits to people who, we believe, deserve them, we might find ourselves getting less instead of more. We would, therefore, be able to give away less than the sum which we are able to provide now.</P>
      <P>I have the greatest sympathy with the people mentioned in this motion and I am sure the Minister has that sympathy also.  I am prepared to admit that Deputies on every side of the House would wish sincerely to have increases granted to all the people covered by this motion.  At the same time, we must bear in mind that we have only certain limited resources within the State and with these limited resources we must deal with the people involved to the best of our ability.  I have always in my mind the fact that whatever the Government gives, it collects from the people first. If we try to collect too much, we may get less and, therefore, the people whom these increases are supposed to benefit will get less.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that all these matters will be dealt with when the Estimates come up and when the Minister is preparing his Budget, I would not think that there should be a division on this motion.  I know that the Government will be very sympathetic regarding all the categories mentioned in the motion and that there will be ample opportunity for discussing them in the various Estimates as they crop up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I would compliment Deputy <Col N="1144" /> Kyne on his approach to the question. On this side of the House as well as on every other side, there is the fullest sympathy with the people involved in this motion.  I have no doubt that the Government will do everything possible to give all the benefits this State can afford to all the people mentioned in the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to be an extraordinary attitude on the part of the Government.  This is a motion put down to deal with a matter which, as I think the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will agree, is of considerable importance and, indeed, of vital importance to many sections of our people.  I realise and appreciate that from the Government point of view this motion may be a difficult one and that the questions which the motion poses for the Government are questions that may be very difficult of solution.  As far as a number of Deputies are concerned&mdash;and I believe I am one of them&mdash;I would like to approach this or any similar motion in a realistic way, assessing as far as I can the importance of the viewpoint put forward&mdash;and put forward in a moderate fashion&mdash;by Deputy Kyne on the one hand, and the arguments advanced on the other by Deputy Loughman.  What opportunities have Deputies of making that kind of assessment on a motion of this sort, if <Col N="1145" /> we are not to hear from the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of this motion?  This is essentially a motion where the viewpoint of the Government should be expressed&mdash;and expressed at an early stage in the discussion.</P>
      <P>At this time of the year, the Government and the individual Ministers and the various Departments over which they preside are, no doubt, examining the financial affairs of this country, the result of the taxation for the current year, and making up their minds as to what their budgetary proposals for the next 12 months are to be. It is not being too optimistic, therefore, to suggest that the questions posed by this motion are questions which must have been receiving some kind of examination by the Government and the various Departments. In view of that&mdash;and I think I am right in making that assertion&mdash;would it be too much to expect the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to give Deputies the benefit of their minds on this question?  Would it be too much to expect that the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us what are the difficulties, financial and otherwise, which are posed by a motion of this sort?</P>
      <P>I readily appreciate there must be difficulties.  Things are not so easy of solution that simply putting down a motion in this House calling for an increase in this, that or the other will solve them.  It would seem that, on the face of the words and the expressions contained in this motion, there is a strong case to be made to the Government for acceding to the request contained in the motion.  On the other hand, it is equally obvious that there is truth in the point of view expressed by Deputy Loughman and it is something that many of us have failed to realise for many years, that is, that no Government can get money from the treetops, that money does not come out of the air, that no Government has a hidden source of wealth which they can tap when they want money and that for practical purposes every penny piece the Government spend comes out of somebody's pocket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was, to put it briefly, the argument <Col N="1146" /> made by the only Government supporter&mdash;as far as I am aware; I have not been here all the time&mdash;who spoke to this motion.  It is not good enough that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary should sit down silently and leave it to a Government backbencher to contribute to this discussion. It is a motion in respect of which if it is to be dealt with on any kind of reasonably sound and realistic basis, facts and figures must be put before us by the Government.  It is easy to say&mdash;and, in saying this, I do not doubt for one moment the sincerity of Deputy Loughman's contribution&mdash; that we sympathise with the old age pensioners, the widows and the orphans and the unemployed, that all sides of the House sympathise with them and would like to see them get increases, if increases could be given. That is true, but it is also very easy to say.  The Government have the responsibility of taking decisions on these matters.  They are directly responsible for the very big increase in the cost of living.  They are responsible for the deliberate action which they took in their last Budget in removing the food subsidies and allowing the cost of living to rise.  This is the second time in recent years in the history of Fianna Fáil where, by deliberate positive Government action, the cost of living has been increased and, of course, when the cost of living increases, it bears hardest on the weakest section of the people, the unemployed, the old age pensioner, the widow and the orphan.</P>
    <P>We all know there are various commodities which are taken into the reckoning in calculating the cost of living index figure.  A number of those commodities might not make any great difference to some of the classes of people who are referred to in this motion, but the essentials of life, the essential foodstuffs, bread and butter, matter to everyone and when bread and butter are increased in price, the weakest section of the community who depend on those foodstuffs as their staple diet have to pay the increase as well as everyone else.  They cannot avoid paying it.  It does not matter to some of these people whether jams or biscuits are increased in price, but it <Col N="1147" /> does matter to them when bread and butter are increased in price and, twice, in 1952 and again in 1957, the Fianna Fáil Government, by positive Government budgetary action, increased the cost of living in these essential commodities.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government when they took office, in the very first Budget they introduced, caused a substantial increase in the cost of living and spiralled up the price of bread and butter.  That was done also by the previous Fianna Fáil Government, I think, led in Finance by the present Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee, when in 1952 the first inroad into the subsidies was made.  All of us will recollect the Fianna Fáil publicity campaign during the last general election when Fianna Fáil leaders invited the people to vote for Fianna Fáil, so that Fianna Fáil could &ldquo;get cracking&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It does, and the point I am going to make, and which I suggest to the Chair I am quite in order in making, is that the only notable way in which the Government &ldquo;got cracking&rdquo; was to crack at the food subsidies and to crack up the cost of living.  Fianna Fáil &ldquo;got cracking&rdquo; in their last Budget.  It is very easy for Fianna Fáil Deputies or Fianna Fáil supporters to give a horse laugh now when we refer to the poster: &ldquo;Let us get cracking,&rdquo; but I want to tell the Deputy who is trying to imitate the hyena that as long as I am in the House, I will do my best to remind them and to remind the people of the Fianna Fáil &ldquo;Let's get cracking&rdquo; poster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the Fianna Fáil appeal to the people in the general election. Fianna Fáil &ldquo;got cracking&rdquo; and the first crack of the whip was felt by the weakest sections of the community, the people for whom this motion pleads. <Col N="1148" /> The lash of the whip fell on their backs as soon as Fianna Fáil &ldquo;got cracking,&rdquo; and now we are discussing this motion here and so far we have not succeeded in getting either the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to let us know what the Government views are, what the Government propose to do or whether the Government have any plans in relation to the question posed in this motion.  One or other of those gentlemen should tell the Dáil what they propose to do.</P>
    <P>They should tell us what are the difficulties involved.  One might overlook their &ldquo;Let's get cracking&rdquo; poster, if it was not wedged in between the other posters which appeared during the general election&mdash;&ldquo;Wives, Get Your Husbands Out to Work&rdquo;, &ldquo;Unemployment Is the Test&rdquo;.  The unemployed are one section of the people dealt with in this motion and it is suggested that unemployment assistance should be increased, in view of the hardship which the high cost of living imposes on that section.  What has the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to say about that?  I take it that the Government and those supporting them will concede that the cost of living has risen, that the rise in the cost of living has caused hardship and that the greatest hardship has been caused to the sections referred to in this motion.</P>
    <P>As I said already, it is very easy for anyone, in Opposition particularly, to put down and support a motion like this.  The responsibility is on the Government.  The Party of which I have the honour to be a member contributed its share to the Government of this country on many occasions and was prepared to accept its responsibilities in forming the Government of the country.  I do appreciate the position of the Ministers and the Deputies supporting him.  I appreciate that he has got to face up to the responsibility of taking a decision on these questions. As I say, it is very easy for any Opposition Deputy to advocate wholesale increases in social welfare benefits. Can the Minister or the Government blame any Deputies doing that if they get no guidance from the Government on an important question like this?</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I am quite <Col N="1149" /> prepared to listen to whatever the Minister has to say on the matter.  I am quite prepared to weigh up and assess as best I can the pros and cons of a motion of this sort.  There is no doubt that, on the face of it, there is every justification for pressing the Minister to give some kind of special consideration to the classes of persons referred to.  There certainly seems to be a very sound argument as to why the Government should review the position of these social welfare benefits in relation to the increase which has taken place in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I want to know what have the Government to say about it.  Do the Government simply propose to say nothing, to let the Dáil vote on this motion in blinkers, without receiving any kind of official figures or any kind of guidance from the Minister or his adviser?  I do not think that is good enough.  I do not think the people would welcome the Dáil taking a decision on a matter of this importance in that kind of atmosphere.  I do not think the people would welcome an approach to a motion of this sort taken without weighty consideration and without the Dáil having before it all the relevant factors.</P>
    <P>There are many people, I believe, who are sick and tired of political fencing and so far as the Party to which I belong is concerned, we do not want to indulge in any kind of political fencing, or tilting even, on a matter of such vital importance, for the matter as of vital importance and I hope the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary appreciate that.  It is easy to treat a motion such as this as a cod motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, and it is still not answered.  Perhaps if Deputy Loughman squeezed down between the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, he might induce them to share in this discussion.  The motion, as I say is one which has to be faced by the <Col N="1151" /> Government.  The House is entitled to hear the Government's views before making up its mind as to its merits. On the face of it, it is quite clear that there are arguments in favour of it.  I appreciate that the Government may have their difficulties.  We want to hear what those difficulties are.  Whatever review is necessary is one which the Government must undertake.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned I genuinely want to hear what the Government have to say about this.  When we hear what the Government have to say possibly we shall know how the motion might best be approached.  Deputy Kyne in his contribution made some concrete proposals as to how money might be made available, and the purposes to which that money might be applied.  I assume the Government have given serious consideration to that proposal and again I invite the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to let us into their confidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We did expect that at least the Parliamentary Secretary might have intervened because, unlike the Minister, he has had an opportunity of listening to the speeches from every side of the House.  There have been two Independent speakers and a speaker from the Labour Party; a speaker from the Fine Gael Party has just made a speech lasting approximately 25 minutes, and we had a contribution from Deputy Loughman of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is a pity that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will not intervene at this stage.  The majority of the speeches which have been made have not been made in any vindictive way, nor have the Government been twitted with any promises they might have made in respect of this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne suggested a method by which all or some of the moneys could be raised for a reasonable increase in the social services.  Perhaps that method might not be acceptable to the Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil Parties but surely we are entitled to a comment on it?  As Deputy Kyne has pointed out the Book of Estimates will be published this week and the debate on the Vote on Account will start on Wednesday next.  This means that Private Members' time will not be resumed until October but I assume that in the meantime, on the 1st May, old age pensioners, widows and orphans and the sick will know their fate for the coming 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the last Government were concerned they had a reasonably good record where social welfare was concerned. We did make promises in respect of these particular categories and I think we fulfilled our promises in two Budgets.  I do not think it is unreasonable to expect that the <Col N="1153" /> present Government, and the Minister for Social Welfare, would continue that policy and give some increases in respect of some of the sections each year by at least trying to compensate them for increases in the cost of living since the last increases in assistance were given.  I think it must be admitted by nearly every member of the House that the 1/- given in the last Budget did not compensate those people for the increases consequent on the withdrawal of the food subsidies. Especially it cannot be maintained that those in receipt of unemployment assistance, and widows' and orphans' non-contributary pensions have been compensated for increases in the cost of living.  Deputy Kyne has pointed out that it would take something in the region of £500,000 to do so.</P>
    <P>I know it is quite a substantial amount of money to give an average of 5/- per week to those in receipt of unemployment assistance and to widows and orphans in receipt of non-contributary pensions.  It is true to say that an increase of 5/- per week for old age pensioners would cost at least £2,000,000.  I do not want to advocate increases for one section more than another but, as far as old age pensioners have been concerned, they were compensated by increases of 3/6 over the last two or three years.  However, nobody maintains that 25/- a week is enough to sustain them.  There are old age pensioners who can supplement that amount by other means, up to having an income of about £1 a week, but I think the Minister, and the Parliamentary Secretary, will appreciate that old age pensioners, especially in cities and in large and small towns, cannot supplement their income in any way.</P>
    <P>The motion says: &ldquo;In view of the great hardships which the high cost of living imposes on the unemployed, old age pensioners, the sick, and widows, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that all social welfare benefits should be increased.&rdquo; The House must agree that there has been an increase in the cost of living.  It does not make much difference whether that has been as the result of the last Budget or not. The last Budget is history; its implications <Col N="1154" /> are a fact.  What these people are concerned with is how the standard of living they had so many years ago can be restored.  The motion suggests that the Government make every effort to see that the money is forthcoming to give them that compensation.</P>
    <P>On the last Estimate, I made a suggestion mentioned by Deputy Kyne here to-night, that a special tax be raised in order to provide increases for the unemployed, old age pensioners, the sick and widows.  Like Deputy Kyne I do not think that the people of this country, particularly the workers, would grudge paying a certain amount by way of tax on certain commodities which Deputy Kyne has mentioned&mdash;beer, cigarettes and, in particular, luxury goods.  They would not deny old age pensioners an increase if they knew that a certain tax on luxury goods were to be devoted exclusively to old age pensioners, to those in receipt of unemployment assistance and to widows and orphans in receipt of non-contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, urge the Minister to continue the policy that was the policy of the last Government over three years.  I know it is a tremendous task to provide increases for all these people in the one year.  In 1956 there was a 25 per cent. increase given to those in receipt of unemployment benefits, sickness and disability benefits and to widows and orphans in receipt of contributary pensions.  That cost a fair amount of money, especially when one adds on to it the additional £1,000,000 provided to give increases to old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>The last Government were only in power long enough to introduce two Budgets.  I can honestly say that, if that Government had been in power for the 1957 Budget, the unemployment assistance and widows' and orphans' non-contributary pensions would undoubtedly have been increased.  As Deputy Kyne has pointed out it would take only a sum in the region of £500,000 and he has suggested ways and means of raising that money.  I would agree with the methods he has proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 13th of last month I asked the Minister for Local Government to give the reasons why he refused to see a deputation from the Kildare County Council, accompanied by the three Deputies from the constituency, in relation to the road grants affecting County Kildare and the position which had arisen, as a result of which no fewer than 50 men were being disemployed forthwith. From the replies which the Minister gave at the time it is quite clear, beyond all doubt, that the Minister did not understand and did not appreciate the points it was intended to put to him on the part of the Kildare County Council.  It is quite clear, as I shall show now, that the Minister did not realise the nature of the request that was to be made to him and, when he refused to see the deputation, he was in fact refusing to see a responsible body of opinion from County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I make it quite clear that the request that was made to the Minister was a request made, not by a majority vote of the Kildare County Council but by all the members of the county council, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour.  Subsequent to the Minister's refusal to see the members of the Kildare County Council, the Minister was approached by a Fianna Fáil Deputy for the constituency asking whether he would be prepared to see the three Deputies for that constituency&mdash;Deputy Norton, Deputy Dooley and myself. Again the Minister refused.  I am not aware of any case in which a Minister has ever refused to see all the Deputies from any constituency Neither am I, in fact, aware of any case in which any Minister ever refused to see a deputation from a <Col N="1156" /> responsible authority like the Kildare County Council when the request was made unanimously.  It seems to me that the refusal of the Minister in both these instances can only be described as discourteous&mdash;not to us because that does not matter in the least; from the present occupant of the Ministry of Local Government we expect that &mdash;to the people that we represent, and not only discourteous but churlish also in relation to the people that we and the members of the Kildare County Council have the honour to represent.</P>
    <P>Now, what is involved in the proposal that was put forward and that the members of the Kildare County Council desired to put in person to the Minister?  Some years ago, when it was considered desirable that there should be re-planning of certain main arterial roads, discussions took place between the officials of the Department of Local Government and the officials of the Kildare County Council, together with, I am sure, other county council officials and, by virtue of these discussions, an endeavour was made to make a plan by virtue of which such work could be carried out efficiently and with proper and reasonable continuity. This is not the occasion to discuss whether it is wise to have by-pass roads, whether the method of planning such roads is or is not the correct one but, irrespective of whether it is correct or wise, in any event everyone will agree that when it is intended to undertake work of that nature it should be undertaken in the most efficient possible way.  The efficiency of that work can be ensured only if, as we have so often heard in relation to forestry for example, there is a sufficiency of land available ahead to ensure that the work can be done and can be properly planned.</P>
    <P>The Kildare County Council in pursuance of that instruction from the Department of Local Government set out to acquire the land that would be necessary so that they could make a proper plan for their roads and so that, when they started on the work, they could carry it though with proper continuity and with reasonable efficiency. In the discussions the question of the payment of compensation arose naturally <Col N="1157" /> enough.  Compensation in relation to arterial roads, such as we are discussing to-night, is payable out of the Road Fund.  It was represented at that time, and correctly represented, that if it were necessary, as it was, to purchase land in advance before the roadworks had actually reached the land, one could easily have a situation in which all, or a substantial part of the grant money, would be paid in any one year with a consequent diminution in employment.</P>
    <P>The Kildare County Council suggested, and it was accepted by the Department of Local Government, that the proper way in which to pay for land which had to be acquired was to meet the compensation year by year out of the grant for the particular year in which the work was done on the land acquired.  That was the accepted practice.  It was the effective practice for years past, not merely when the inter-Party Government was in office but also during the period of office of the Fianna Fáil Government from 1951 to 1954.  It was a practice adopted because in that way, and only in that way, could there be reasonable and proper continuity in relation to the planning of roadworks.  The land could be paid for in any one year without taking for land purchase more than its proper proportion of the road grant leaving moneys otherwise available for employment.  That is what happened in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>A sum of £12,000 was paid by the Kildare County Council in pursuance of the arrangement made for efficient planning in the acquisition of lands, to be used not this year but next year and the ensuing two years.  It was because the Kildare County Council were forced by the arrangements made with the Department to purchase that land and to pay for it this year utilising those moneys which would, under the arrangements made previously, otherwise be available for the employment of the men concerned, that the Kildare County Council wished to make this arrangement.  It is not a new arrangement.  It is an arrangement by virtue of which the procedure which had been in operation previously would be carried into effect and the <Col N="1158" /> county council were, in fact, giving their quota to ensure that the livelihood of the men involved would not be affected by the county council agreeing that they, for their part, would pay the interest involved in putting up the purchase money for these lands acquired in a different way and meet the interest charge on that purchase money.</P>
    <P>That case could easily have been put to the Minister if he had seen the deputation. It is perfectly clear from his replies that he did not understand that that was the point at issue.  It is perfectly clear from his replies that he thought that what the Kildare County Council were trying to do was to anticipate employment grants for subsequent years.  That is exactly what the Kildare County Council were not doing.  They were merely anxious to provide a way by virtue of which the moneys that they had paid for the acquisition of land this year would not cause a diminution in employment this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister refused to see that deputation.  Then, when the matter was raised by me in the House, he had no defence to offer except to show that he did not understand the approach being made to him and to make a crack at me about the transfer of £500,000 from the Road Fund to the Exchequer.  Let me make quite clear why that transfer was made.  Let me make quite clear that I have no apology whatsoever to offer for it.  In certain circumstances it is highly desirable that drainage work should be done instead of road work.  Both give approximately the equivalent employment content, but drainage work assists production far more than road work in certain circumstances.  I was faced with the alternatives of choosing between drainage work and road work I chose to keep the drainage work and the Minister this year has chosen to eliminate the drainage work.  I am quite happy to be judged throughout the country by that choice.  Everyone throughout the country will agree I think, that if the choice was there, it was far better to consider something that would give an aid to production and by so doing to ensure we would <Col N="1159" /> be able to increase our national productivity and particularly the productivity of our major industry, agriculture.</P>
    <P>For whatever reason the Minister had in his own mind, he would not see the deputation.  Perhaps he was afraid to face them.  Be that as it may, when it was clear from the discussion in the House that the Minister did not understand the point of view and when it was clear that there was no other way in which the matter could be dealt with, after discussion with the local people concerned a representative meeting was called in my own parish. It was attended by Deputy Dooley, on behalf of Fianna Fáil and his Fianna Fáil supporters in the parish of Kill, where most of this unemployment has arisen.  The meeting was also attended by Deputy Norton and his Labour supporters in that area as well as by my own supporters.</P>
    <P>This representative meeting requested that the three Deputies concerned would approach the Minister for Local Government and would explain their point of view to him and the position as they saw it.  Again the Minister refused.  I do not know of any occasion ever before in the history of this House on which a Minister refused to see all the Deputies from any constituency, representing the electorate of that constituency.  I can only interpret such a refusal as being a deliberate insult to the people of County Kildare.  I do not mind the fact that the Minister refused to see an ex-Tánaiste and an ex-Minister.  That is entirely by the way, but it is in strong contrast with the courtesy and civility with which, I am glad to say, all the Ministers of the last Government received ex-Ministers of the previous Fianna Fáil Government and Fianna Fáil Deputies.  It will be in strong contrast with the civility that the Deputies and ex-Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Party will receive them when they go out of office, as surely they will, judging by their unpopularity in the country at present.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, it is not that question of churlishness, insolence or <Col N="1160" /> petty dictatorship that matters; it is the question of the livelihood of the men involved in which we are interested in Kildare and also, let me add, the insult given to the people by a responsible Minister of the Government, or by a Minister who should be responsible, in refusing to see the elected Deputies of all Parties.  It is as near an attempt at tyranny as one could bet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to travel over the ground covered by Deputy Sweetman but I do want to say that this whole matter has been handled by the Minister and his Department with a callousness and stupidity difficult to excuse.  I experienced no personal yearning for an interview with the Minister, nor do I feel I would derive any personal exhilaration from an interview with the Minister.  That is not the question at issue.  The question at issue is that a responsible and well-conducted local authority, the Kildare County Council, representative of the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour Parties, asked to see the Minister to make a proposition to him which, if he had received them and accepted their proposal, would have prevented 50 men being thrown out of employment and their wives and children compelled to suffer privation.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any justification for a Minister adopting an attitude of this kind towards the county council. But he was then approached by Deputy Dooley on behalf of Deputy Sweetman and myself and asked to receive the three Deputies so that they might explain the position to him.  Whatever kind of ministerial swelled head operates these days, the Minister in his omnipotence would not see even the three Deputies from the County of Kildare although a Deputy from his own Party sought the interview on behalf of all three Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had received the deputation, I am quite certain it would have been possible to convince him of the reasonableness of the claim which the Kildare County Council wanted to make.  As Deputy Sweetman said, they had paid compensation for the acquisition of land, not land they were using this year but land which they would <Col N="1161" /> use next year or the following year. But they paid all that in one lump sum by arrangement with the Department of Local Government.  Therefore, their ordinary funds for expenditure on the roads and for retaining people in employment fell short of what they needed.</P>
    <P>They wanted to go to the Minister and say: &ldquo;Look here.  We have paid this compensation for the acquisition of land by arrangement with your Department. We might, perhaps, if you had agreed, paid that compensation by instalments.  But you knew we were paying it out in one sum.  Now that the money has run out in regard to the matter of keeping people in employment, will you allow us to raise a loan from our own resources which we will pay back when we get our grants from the Road Fund in the new financial year commencing April, 1958, in the same way as we have got these grants from the Road Fund for the last 50 years?&rdquo;  That was a reasonable proposition, but the reasonableness of the whole thing has been vitiated by the fact that the Minister in his omnipotence would not agree even to receive the deputation.</P>
    <P>I want to say that I think it is rather a damned scandal in the circumstances of 1958 that 50 unfortunate workers, who could now be employed in useful work in the village in the neighbourhood of Kill, in County Kildare, should lose their employment because of this mulish attitude.  The propostion which the Kildare County Council proposed to put to the Minister for Local Government was a reasonable one. It is all very well for Ministers to sit there and feel they are like Pharaoh when requests for deputations are being received.  But I think it is a bit thick that a Minister paid to do the nation's work should be guilty of conduct of this type&mdash;a Minister paid by these unfortunate people now losing their jobs and finding themselves trying to exist on a miserable pittance from the employment exchange whereas, if the Minister had been sagacious and sympathetic in the matter, he could have received the deputation.  These 50 people would then be in employment <Col N="1162" /> to-day and their wives and children would be spared the harrowing suffering which the Minister's indifference has inflicted upon them.</P>

      <P>I should like to make it quite clear to the two Deputies crying for these unfortunate workers who have been disemployed, allegedly through any action or lack of action on my part, that the answer given on 13th February to Deputy Sweetman in regard to this matter was amply clear to the Deputy and to every Deputy in this House. The answer was that, as I did not have the money, I could not possibly discuss the giving of it to anybody.  That was then the position and it remained the position until a few days ago.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman said that I refused to see the deputation because I did not know what it was going to talk about.  I did not know what the deputation was going to talk about, it is quite true, but I do know what was submitted by the Kildare County Council in regard to what that deputation was to talk about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that submission from the county council, two proposals were made. One was that we should meet a deputation from the county council, including the Deputies for the constituency to discuss the giving of a special grant of £12,000 in order to continue the work on this road and keep in employment the 50 workers then employed. An alternative to that was that, instead of a special grant, £12,000 <Col N="1163" /> should be made available and a mortgage placed on next year's Road Fund grant to the Kildare County Council. On those two issues, and on no other issue, did I reply to the county council indicating that there did not appear to be any point in receiving a deputation to discuss either of these two proposals. That was followed by my reply in this House.</P>
    <P>Later, when asked by Deputy Sweetman why I did not receive the deputation from the county council the reply I gave was that, as both these proposals and all the proposals made by the county council entailed the giving of money which I had not then received, and in respect of which I had not received sanction from the Department of Finance, I was in no position to meet the people or do anything for them, and that, therefore, I would not receive their deputation.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the reply in this House, Deputy Dooley came to see me. I pointed out to Deputy Dooley, as I had pointed out earlier in my letters to the county council and in the House, that there was no point in my meeting a deputation from the Kildare County Council, or any other county council which might be seeking money out of next year's Road Fund grants, because I did not have the authority to give any such special consideration to any county council and had no authorisation to spend any of the money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dooley asked me would I see the three Deputies.  I said the position is as it was, that I had not got the money to give.  It was next year's Road Fund money that was in question and I had no authority to spend it, or allow it to be spent in advance. Deputy Dooley asked was there any other way in which they could raise money.  I said to him that there was no reason why the Kildare County Council should not raise a loan under their own steam but that I would not agree to allow it to be paid back by mortgaging future payments from the Road Fund grant to the Kildare County Council.  No action was subsequently taken by the county council.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dooley was asked if the Minister would give us that in writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I told Deputy Dooley that it was not for me, as Minister for Local Government, to initiate the spending of any of the moneys in the county council or the borrowing of moneys by any county council in regard to this matter, but that if the county council concerned wished to make a proposition to me, I would give it sympathetic consideration.  I think Deputy Dooley conveyed that to the Deputy or the Deputies in his own constituency. Nothing further was done about the matter by way of making any effort to raise this money out of their own treasury&mdash;none whatever.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman tried to gloss over the fact that we have not got as much money in the Road Fund for disposal this year as we would like to have.  One of the main reasons for that is his raid on the Road Fund, which I should like to say was not being used for drainage works.  That is the submission the Deputy makes in this House, that it was for drainage rather than for roads, and that if he had the choice to make again, he would do likewise. Does Deputy Sweetman seriously expect anybody in this House to take that statement for what it appears to be worth, in view of the fact that the estimate was made against the wishes of the advisers in the Department in the last financial year in which he was Minister for Finance?  The estimate made then as to the income expected from the Road Fund was £5,750,000. Subsequently, that estimate had to be written down to £5,250,000 and, later still, £500,000 was taken from it.  A sum of £5,000,000 was to be spent out of that £5,250,000 and only £4.9 million was ultimately collected, out of which £500,000 had already been taken, so that we had the position arising where £5,000,000 of commitments under the Road Fund grants throughout the country were being met by £4.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Deputy not now appreciate that in order that road grants and works might continue even as they have during the past 12 months, it was necessary to get a further advance from the Exchequer during the present <Col N="1165" /> financial year of £900,000, resulting directly from the raid on the Road Fund and the writing up of the Estimate against the express advice of his technical advisers and the advisers of the Department of Local Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not attacking anybody other than the Deputy.  I want to put this to the Deputy and those who want to read into it what they may. Is it not true that, in 1954, when Fianna Fáil left office, the outstanding commitments against the Road Fund amounted to £1.8 million?  Is it not also a fact that, three years later, when the Coalition Government baled out, the commitments against the Road Fund amounted to £4.5 million?  Can the people in the Opposition get away from the fact that they were committing money they did not have and that we are reaping the reward to-day?  We are trying to find money elsewhere to stop the gaps and potholes made by the irresponsible Ministers in the Coalition Government while they were last in office.</P>
      <P>Those are the facts and nothing they can say now will get away from the fact that money was being committed which they did not have, never expected to have and which they knew very well somebody else would have to find eventually.</P>

      <P>What has that got to do with the matter?  The Deputy knows quite well that he is chancing his arm, as he may have chanced his arm elsewhere.  The Deputy's intervention has recalled to my mind another matter.  Will all the Deputies on that side of the House add to the shame that should be felt by the ex-Minister for Finance in raiding the Road Fund of £500,000 and also add to it the fact that the ex-Minister for Local Government committed money and had money spent during the financial year, prior to its being collected? Will the Deputy, who was then Minister, honestly deny that that money was not made available to the local authorities, merely because there was the certainty of an election in the offing and that it was a bait held out in an effort to hold together the dwindling Opposition forces?  Deputy O'Donnell talks through his hat when he says I was backing him up on that I did not back him up then and I do not back him up now.</P>
      <P>The two ex-Ministers sitting in the Fine Gael Benches to-night should feel ashamed to talk about unemployment on the roads when they themselves were responsible to the tune of £900,000 in the past year.  They, and they alone, must accept responsibility for the unemployment created by virtue of the fact that £900,000 less was available for the roads.</P>
