      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the discussion on this motion took a distinctly Party line and I was unable to resist the temptation to follow it, but, in the calmer atmosphere of this morning, it is not possible for me to continue on that course.  I do not know that it <Col N="192" /> matters a great deal who is entitled to claim the major part of the credit for the successful development of the valuable mineral deposits at Avoca.  As far as I am concerned, what is happening there now is a vindication of a decision which I was responsible for having had taken ten years ago, when the whole process of exploration and development was begun.  The important thing is to ensure that the valuable national assets which these deposits represent are developed as satisfactorily as is possible.</P>
      <P>When this matter was being debated in the Dáil in 1956, the circumstances were very different from what they are now.  Deputies Sweetman and Norton referred to that debate during the course of their remarks here yesterday and their references did not suggest that they had recently referred to the Dáil record of it.  It might be useful for Deputies who are interested in that aspect of this question to go back over that debate.  If we had been able then to foresee the future&mdash;on the one hand, the very substantial fall in the world price of copper which has since taken place and, on the other hand, the unexpected difficulty of the Canadian interests to whom the mines have been leased in raising the funds needed to complete the development&mdash;probably everyone who took part in the discussion would have taken a somewhat different line.</P>
      <P>In 1956, on the basis of the then price of copper, it was obvious that not merely were the Avoca deposits a very attractive commercial proposition but that those who undertook their development were likely to make very substantial profits.  I certainly have no objection to people who invest their money in Irish resources making profits, even substantial profits; on the contrary, a few very successful enterprises of that kind would help to attract interest in other development possibilities within the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is still true to say, however, that these mines represent an attractive investment, even though the present world price of copper is such as to create a situation in which there are probably few, if any, copper mines in the world making profits.  Nevertheless, <Col N="193" /> the long-term indications are that the price of copper must recover.  In that connection, I may say that we have had access to the opinions of international experts of the highest order.</P>
    <P>They indicated that the price of copper over the next ten to 20 years is likely to average out at a price considerably higher than that now prevailing and certainly at a level which will put the Avoca enterprise in a position to work profitably.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that the price of copper is now at an exceptionally low level.  That, of course, has not yet affected the plans for Avoca development. The mine is not in production and it will not be in production until July next and it will be the price prevailing in July that will settle the policy of the company to whom the mine has been leased.  It is sincerely to be hoped that the price of copper will have recovered by then, at least to a point at which it will be possible to operate the mine without loss.  I should think there is a fair prospect that it will but it is not a subject upon which it is wise to attempt prophecy. What the situation may be if the price of copper remains at the present low level, or if it should fall lower, I could not forecast.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman said that I had the opportunity of revising the terms of the lease given to the Canadian company.  That is not correct.  During the recent election campaign there was a statement made that a change of Government would involve the closing down of the mines.  I thought that was an injudicious statement to make but because it was made I took the course, with the consent of my Party, of making a statement at Wicklow that the terms of this lease to the Canadian interests would be honoured in the spirit and in the letter, and I repeated that assurance to the representatives of the company subsequently. There has of course been some necessary modification of the conditions consequent on the negotiation of this loan which the Government is now proposing to guarantee but, fundamentally, the lease remains unaltered.</P>
    <P>I have always disliked seeing enterprises <Col N="194" /> of national value such as this being made the shuttlecocks of Party politics.  I do not think it does the country or the enterprises any good. So far as this enterprise is concerned, however, the mines have been leased to these Canadian interests, the terms of the lease have been settled and everything will proceed, so far as I am concerned, in accordance with the arrangements already made.  I said here during the course of a discussion in the Dáil a couple of years ago that while I had some personal disposition in favour of the development of these mines by Mianraí Teoranta, the State company responsible for the initial development programme, I recognised that it was extremely unlikely that any State company could be in a position to develop the mines on the scale which the Canadian interests have planned.  I want to say also that the various reports regarding the mine which have reached me have all testified to the skill with which the work of development was planned and is being carried out there.</P>
    <P>It is no doubt appreciated by Deputies that the planning of the method by which a large deposit of that kind can most usefully be exploited is a highly technical matter and a mistaken plan could add a great deal to the cost of the extraction of the ore.  It is clear that the method devised for the working of the Avoca ore is the result of highly competent work and all the external experts who investigated it have paid very high tribute to it.  There is every reason therefore to think that if the price of copper averages out at the level which is anticipated by the experts who are qualified to make forecasts in that respect, Avoca will be a very profitable undertaking.</P>
    <P>The copper price at which they hope to break even is quite low, much lower than that reported to operate at very many of the copper mines of the world.  The loan is for a period of 12 years but the first repayment of the principal is not due until 1960.  I mentioned yesterday that the proven volume of mineralised rock at Avoca would enable work to be continued there for 12 years on the basis of the <Col N="195" /> scale of operations planned by the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, western.  There is, however, very good reason to think that the ore body is substantially larger than has been proven and I believe that exploration work in the locality has justified expectations that a still larger volume of ore is there to be exploited.  In any event it is open to the company to plan its work there upon the scale that it thinks is justified by commercial considerations and by the resources available to it.  In consideration of the guarantee of a loan the Government is receiving a first charge on the assets of the company, present and future.  There was a prior charge in favour of Irish Copper Mines Incorporated, the Canadian company which is the parent of the St. Patrick's company.  Part of the money which was put into the development of the mine was invested in the form of equity shares, and part in the form of a loan to the St. Patrick's company.  Under the terms of the guaranteed agreement the loan charge in favour of Irish Copper Mines Incorporated will be transferred into ordinary shares and if, of course, the company default upon their repayment obligations then these ordinary shares will pass to the Government here.</P>

      <P>All the equity shares. I do not contemplate that situation arising.  As I mentioned, when introducing this motion, it would be far better from my point of view that this development in Avoca should proceed as already planned, and that there be no alteration in ownership, or that no change in these plans should arise. However, it is necessary that Dáil Éireann should know, in the event of default on the obligations, that the ownership of the mines will accrue to the Government.  As I pointed out, it will mean at the worst that we will obtain in return for guaranteeing borrowing to the extent of £1,300,000 an undertaking upon which £3,500,000 will have been spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is merely safeguarding the State against a contingency which we hope will never arise.  Deputy Sweetman queried the figure I gave of £3,500,000 as representing the total amount required to bring the mine into production.  He said that in his mind was the figure of £1,000,000 for the development of the deposit, and £750,000 for the construction of the concentration plant.  These figures represented the minimum amounts stated in the lease as the obligation of St. Patrick's Copper Mines.  They undertook to expend these amounts for those purposes as a minimum. In fact the Department of Industry and Commerce never were informed of what the actual anticipated expenditure was likely to be, and it is only now that these figures can be precisely stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> Deputy Norton referred to the possibility of erecting a smelter at some stage.  That is a matter in which I have a personal interest.  I discussed it with representatives of the company shortly after they started operations and had an opportunity of examining possibilities in that regard.  It was obvious, as stated by Deputy Russell, that the output of the Avoca mines would not be at all sufficient to supply the requirements of a smelter of economic size.  There was the possibility of a customs smelter being provided to handle the output from Avoca and ore from other sources but, with the substantial fall in copper prices, it is unlikely we could interest any group in the erection of a smelter at the present time.</P>
    <P>The capital investment in a smelter would be very considerably larger than the investment in the Avoca mines itself.  It is unlikely that any new investment in smelters will take place in any part of the copper world until the market position has recovered.  It is something we would very much like to see though, and I personally will be always receptive of any proposals which would involve development of that kind.  The economics of the Avoca mine are based on copper.  The ore yields an average of 1.2 per cent. of copper and it is on the price of that copper that the economics of the mine rest.  There is in the ore also a larger percentage of pyrites.  Deputy Norton may have misunderstood the position because he spoke of pyrites as a separate deposit.  That is not correct.  In the process of treating the ore both copper and pyrites are secured, and one of the problems facing the company is to secure a market for that pyrites.  It is assumed that when a market can be obtained the economics of the mine will improve.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that the aid given to St. Patrick's Copper Mines by this State guarantee of borrowings should be available to other mining undertakings. There is no proposal of a similar character at present before the Department.  It is quite clear if such a proposal were made at any time in the future it would have to be considered on its individual merits.  The <Col N="198" /> practice of giving State guarantees for loans raised for industrial purposes has been maintained under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts for many years.  I have certain views as to the future of that legislation and perhaps, in the course of the year some proposals may be made to the Dáil.  It would be clear the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts would not be an appropriate instrument to use where borrowings on this scale are involved.  Under the limits fixed by the Act the aggregate total for all the loans guaranteed would be exceeded.</P>
    <P>In the case of other mining undertakings it is always open to them to utilise the machinery of that Act, or whatever may replace that machinery in the future, but if very substantial borrowings, such as are involved here were necessary, very careful consideration would have to be given to it in the first instance and, secondly, the procedure of the Loans (Guarantee) Acts would not be appropriate.  The money which has actually been made available to the company has been procured from private sources.  It might be said, therefore, there is no problem as far as the Government is concerned in finding it but in practice, as we know, the pool of capital available for all purposes in the country is limited and to the extent that money is being made available for this purpose, even though it comes from private sources, the total availability for all purposes is diminished.  Nevertheless, having regard to the importance of this undertaking, the employment it gives and its export potential, the utilisation of these resources for that purpose is fully justified.  I think that view has been accepted by all the members who spoke, even though they had some controversial remarks to surround their indications of approval.  That is useful because it will be an assurance to the people concerned here that, whatever may have happened in the past, they are going ahead with their enterprise now in the knowledge that they have Government support given to them with the full approval of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little puzzled by the arrangement whereunder the <Col N="199" /> security for the guarantee takes the unusual form of a transfer of the equity in the event of the company defaulting on its loan.  Would not the ordinary procedure be that the Government as the guarantor would take a full mortgage on the assets of the company, because if the guarantee is that the company shall transfer its equity to the Government, they might transfer with their equity immense liabilities?  Suppose the company entered into huge liabilities quite apart from this guaranteed loan and then defaulted on the loan and transferred its equity to the Government, would the Government not become heir to their liabilities as distinct from the position in which the Government would be, as it were, the mortgagee of the assets of the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate my interest was to secure that in the event of circumstances arising which made it impossible for St. Patrick's Copper Mines to carry on the undertaking, the Government would be in a position to have it carried on and not merely in the position of having to put it up for auction in the hope of recovering the amount of the guarantee.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is unusual.  I explained yesterday that the company had negotiated for the amount they required with a Canadian issuing house on terms which I thought onerous, so onerous that I was not prepared to contemplate a Government guarantee attaching to them.  When the matter was being discussed here, it became obvious that the money could be secured on somewhat better terms.  In other respects the agreement between the lender here and St. Patrick's Copper Mines is similar to that which they themselves have negotiated with the Canadian issuing house.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Greyhound Industry Bill," RHead="1957&mdash;Second Stage">
    <Title>Greyhound Industry Bill, 1957&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill replaces the Greyhound Industry Bill, 1955, which was awaiting the Report Stage in the Dáil at the dissolution early in 1957. Accordingly, it perished with the then House.  Explanatory notes on the provisions of the Bill have been circulated for the convenience of Deputies, and the notes include particulars of the differences between the present Bill and its predecessor.</P>
      <P>The general purpose of the Bill is to improve the system of regulating the breeding, coursing and racing of greyhounds and to promote the quite important export trade in greyhounds. The position of the Irish Coursing Club is dealt with in the Bill.  I should explain that in its early years this organisation had to deal only with the regulation of breeding and coursing. The advent of greyhound racing introduced a growing commercial element which has shaped the industry as we know it to-day and which indeed has given rise to the major problems with which this Bill is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is perhaps generally known, the rapid expansion of greyhound racing in Britain created something of a boom in the industry here and a big increase took place in the export of greyhounds from this country.  These exports rose in value, for example, from about £77,000 in 1938 and £130,000 in 1942 to about £733,000 in 1945 and over £1,000,000 in each of the two following years.  With this rapid expansion events proved that the Irish Coursing Club was not providing, or <Col N="201" /> indeed was unable to provide, the degree of control necessary.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, an Advisory Committee on the Greyhound industry was appointed by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, on the 21st February, 1951, with terms of reference as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ascertain and report on the position respecting coursing, greyhound racing, greyhound breeding and other related activities and such measures, if any, as are considered desirable in the national interest for the better control and development thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Advisory Committee, which reported in 1952, summarised the position in the concluding section of its report&mdash;page 83, paragraph 188&mdash; as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have found that no branch of the industry as at present conducted is entirely free from criticism. In connection with breeding and coursing, many well-defined existing rules have not been enforced and have gradually come to be ignored, thus giving rise to irregularities and more or less serious abuses.  But it is in connection with greyhound racing that the most serious abuses have been practised with impunity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having said that, the committee went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The greyhound industry, in the absence of an export trade in greyhounds, cannot be regarded as an economic proposition.  It is, therefore, in the national interest that this trade should be encouraged and developed on a sound and reputable basis.  We believe, however, that the full potential of an export trade will not be attained on the basis of greyhound racing and allied activities as at present conducted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In paragraph 186, page 81, the Advisory Committee had previously stated that its report as a whole is based on the following main recommendations:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The reorganisation of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> (2)  The establishment of a control board.</P>
    <P>(3)  The transfer to the board from the Irish Coursing Club of control of greyhound racing.</P>
    <P>(4)  The installation of totalisators on city tracks and the imposition of a levy on the betting turnover thereon.</P>
    <P>(5)  The imposition of a levy on course betting on all tracks.</P>
    <P>(6)  Supervision by the control board of sales and exports of greyhounds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Provisions to give effect to these and other recommendations of the Advisory Committee are contained in the Bill. The two central features of the measure are the establishment of the Greyhound Industry Board and the reconstitution of the Irish Coursing Club to regulate in their respective spheres the various branches of the greyhound industry and to provide for its co-ordinated development on a sound basis.</P>
    <P>As regards the setting up of a board for the industry, the Advisory Committee's report stated in paragraph 136 on page 56:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have been impressed with the demand from practically all quarters for a control board to be established by an Act of the Oireachtas, somewhat on the lines of the Racing Board&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that is, under the 1945 Act for horse racing, and also:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...We were informed that the Irish Coursing Club is doubtful as to whether it is legally entitled to take the obvious steps to deal with certain abuses and gathered that the club, while naturally desirous of continuing more or less in its present form, would welcome the establishment of a control board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As regards the reorganisation of the Irish Coursing Club, the Advisory Committee reported in paragraph 126 as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With few exceptions, witnesses criticised in greater or lesser degree the administration of the Irish Coursing Club and the standing <Col N="203" /> committee.  The criticism was not confined to any particular interest, but that coming from representatives of greyhound breeders was definitely the most severe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report then went on to say in the next following paragraph&mdash;paragraph 127:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While we feel bound to agree that many of the criticisms directed against the Irish Coursing Club are well founded, we also feel that its faults have been largely due to the assumption of functions which were not anticipated by its founders and that the necessary reorganisation of the club did not keep pace with the newly assumed functions and increasing responsibilities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Finally, in paragraph 128, the committee said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We therefore propose the continuance of the Irish Coursing Club in a reorganised form which we deem to be more representative of the greyhound industry than has heretofore been the case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In respect of the existing organisation of the club, the criticisms of the Advisory Committee focussed on the preponderant influence exercised by a large block of permanent &ldquo;elected&rdquo; members, that is, members elected at general meetings from amongst consistent supporters of coursing, as compared with the &ldquo;representative&rdquo; members, that is, members comprising one member each appointed for three-year periods by the affiliated clubs and tracks; and the fact that the influence of persons directly connected with race tracks both in the general body of the club and on its standing committee had become disproportionate.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the reconstituted Irish Coursing Club is to concern itself primarily with the supervision of greyhound breeding and coursing, subject to the general authority of the Greyhound Industry Board, and the board itself will exercise direct responsibility in regard to the control of greyhound racing, training of greyhounds for reward, public sales of greyhounds, and certain matters relating to the export of greyhounds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> To come to the Bill itself, Part I of the Bill consists of some provisions of a general introductory character.  The only point I need mention in regard to them is that under sub-sections (4) and (5) of Section 5, every regulation made by the Greyhound Industry Board, and every rule made by the Irish Coursing Club relating to the racing or training of greyhounds, must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by either House.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Greyhound Industry Board makes regulations and the Coursing Club only make rules.  That distinction runs through the whole Bill and will enable members, if I happen to refer either to the rules or regulations, to identify the appropriate body concerned.  I should also point out that the rules and regulations must be laid before the House and may be annulled.  This provision should enable the House to scrutinise, if necessary, the operations of the board and the club.  It gives the House itself a great measure of control to ensure that the board and the club will operate within the terms and in the spirit of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the establishment and the general functioning of the Greyhound Industry Board.  I should like to say at this stage that, in accordance with the practice adopted under other Bills, it is proposed that a title in Irish should be substituted for the title &ldquo;Greyhound Industry Board&rdquo; which appears in the Bill.  I intend to table an amendment to deal with this matter on the Committee Stage.  The Bill differs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, as the explanatory notes circulated with it indicate, differs from the 1955 Bill in regard to the constitution of the board. This is covered by Section 9 of the present Bill which provides that three, but not more than three, of the seven members, that is, six ordinary members and the chairman, of the board, will be appointed from among the <Col N="205" /> members of the standing or executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club. The board, as thus constituted, will have considerably wider administrative functions than the Racing Board which was established under the Act of 1945 in connection with horse-racing. The Advisory Committee recommended that the chairman should be appointed by the Minister on a whole-time basis.  The ordinary members of the board will be appointed on a part-time basis, their normal term of office being five years.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the chairman and any officers of the board shall not themselves be beneficially interested in certain aspects of the greyhound industry and associated activities, with which the board would be directly concerned.  The board's annual report and accounts must be furnished to the Minister who must lay a copy before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Section 16 of the Bill sets out the purposes, conducive to the improvement and development of the various aspects of the greyhound industry, towards which the board may contribute out of its funds.  It is visualised that a fairly substantial part of these funds will in course of time come from the operation of totalisators by the board under the authority specified in Section 20 of the Bill.  In this connection the Advisory Committee expected that the board would install totalisators, first at the Dublin tracks and later at the Cork and Limerick tracks.  The other major source of income of the board, which I shall refer to later, will be, perhaps may be, a levy on course bets with bookmakers.</P>
      <P>I should also point out with particular reference to Section 20 that sub-section (2) of that section makes it obligatory for the Minister for Finance to attach to a totalisator licence granted to the board a condition prohibiting credit betting.  The provision will, I think, be recognised generally as a desirable one and I should say in regard to it that the Advisory Committee's report&mdash;paragraph 157, page 65&mdash;stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...the totalisator which we envisage would provide for cash <Col N="206" /> betting only and would therefore be entirely free from the evils associated with credit betting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the question of the licensing of greyhound tracks by the board and the making of regulations and rules in relation to the various aspects of greyhound racing.  Greyhound racing is at present established on the basis of the affiliation of tracks to the Irish Coursing Club and the conduct of racing according to rules drawn up by the club.  The licensing of tracks by the board was considered necessary by the Advisory Committee in order to give the board adequate powers to ensure the proper observation of standards in the conduct of racing and to decide in the interests of the industry as a whole what scope there may be for new tracks.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should point out that under Section 22 of the Bill the board will be obliged to grant an application for a licence in respect of a race track which was affiliated to the Irish Coursing Club in the year 1957.</P>
    <P>Under Section 25 of the Bill, the board will have wide powers to make regulations with respect to the construction and operation of greyhound race tracks and the conduct of greyhound racing.  The specific purposes enumerated in sub-section (2) of that section for which the board may provide in such regulations arise out of recommendations made by the Advisory Committee.</P>
    <P>Section 25 also provides that the Irish Coursing Club may make rules with respect to race tracks and the conduct of greyhound racing.  The rules made by the club will, under sub-section (5) of Section 26 in any event, require the consent of the board and will not, therefore, conflict with the board's regulations.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with the reconstitution of the Irish Coursing Club as set out in the proposed new constitution attached as a schedule to the Bill.  Subject to the general authority of the board the reconstituted Irish Coursing Club will be statutorily recognised as the controlling body for greyhound breeding and coursing <Col N="207" /> matters.  The lines of reconstitution of the club are largely based on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee. The fact that the constitution of the Irish Coursing Club is given statutory authority should, we feel, enable the club to deal drastically with the individuals who may have engaged in malpractices in the past or may engage in them in the future and should also enable the club to restore the good name of all those who are associated with the sport of greyhound racing and coursing.</P>
    <P>I should say that only representative members of clubs or tracks may be appointed to the executive committee of the club, which will replace the present standing committee, and the number appointed from each province must include a proportion of coursing club representatives not less than the proportion which the number of clubs in the province bears to the total number of clubs and tracks in the province.  In each province there will be a provincial committee consisting of the representative members of the club in the province and while co-opted members ordinarily resident in the province may attend meetings of the provincial committee I should emphasise that they will not have any voting powers.  It will be seen, therefore, that the co-opted members will not thus participate in the election of the future executive committee of the club, but may attend and vote at general meetings of the body.</P>
    <P>Article 8 of the new constitution of the Irish Coursing Club will provide for a finance sub-committee of the executive committee, which&mdash;and this is important&mdash;will have responsibility for keeping under review the financial affairs of the club and its subsidiary interests.</P>
    <P>Section 26, I should say, is concerned entirely with the reconstitution of the Irish Coursing Club and in sub-section (6) there is a provision that during the period of three years from the coming into operation of the new constitution appointments of members of the executive committee of the club shall be carried out subject to the supervision of the board.  This, again, is in <Col N="208" /> accordance with the recommendations of the Advisory Committee, which in paragraph 132, page 55, state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The control board should undertake the first setting up of provincial committees and a board representative should preside at the first meeting in each province.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure it will be agreed that it is most important that there should be full confidence in the arrangements for replacement of the present standing committee by the new executive committee during the transitional stage.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with the question of a levy on course bets for the purpose of helping to finance the board in its activities.  The board will, in this connection, have to be empowered to grant permits authorising licensed bookmakers to carry on their business at greyhound race meetings and coursing meetings.  These provisions, I may say, follow generally the provisions which, in the same connection, are embodied in the 1945 Act, relating to horse racing, except that under Section 31 of the present Bill the levy may be replaced at any time, if considered appropriate, by the collection for payment to the board of a specific amount as part of the admission charge for a bookmaker to a greyhound race track or coursing meeting.  I should say, in this connection, that it is believed that a levy on course bets cannot be avoided in the early years of the board if sufficient funds are to be available to enable the board to undertake its tasks satisfactorily. Regulations, however, by the board prescribing a levy on course bets will require the consent of the Minister and, as I have already pointed out, all such regulations must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. Under the definition of &ldquo;course bet&rdquo; in Section 2 of the Bill, all or any coursing meetings may be declared by the board to be exempted as respects levy.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with a number of miscellaneous matters, mostly arising out of recommendations made in the Report of the Advisory Committee.  I may perhaps refer to <Col N="209" /> one or two.  Section 36 gives the board power to make regulations in relation to coursing, but these are not as wide as the powers given under Section 25 in relation to greyhound racing, since coursing will be governed primarily by the rules of the Irish Coursing Club under Article 16 of the club's new constitution, and I should point out that these rules will require the board's consent under sub-section (5) of Section 26.</P>
    <P>Under Section 37, both the board and the club are empowered to provide for control of the training of greyhounds for reward.  The position in this respect is similar to that under Section 25 in relation to the control of greyhound racing, to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Section 38 empowers the board to control public sales of greyhounds and Sections 43 to 47 make provision for investigations by the board and Irish Coursing Club into suspected cases of wrongdoing and the taking of disciplinary action where considered necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 48 empowers the board to fix charges, primarily admission charges, in relation to greyhound race meetings, coursing meetings and public sales of greyhounds.  Under sub-section (2) of that section, maximum admission charges for bookmakers carrying on their business at meetings may not be fixed by the board at a level higher than five times the admission charges for ordinary members of the public, with this proviso, except with the consent of the Minister.  The level of five times was prescribed as a maximum in the same connection under the 1945 Act relating to horse-racing. The so-called &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; admission charges provided for in respect of bookmakers under sub-sections (5) and (9) of Section 48 are the specific amounts which it might be decided at any time to collect for payment to the board in place of a levy on course bets.</P>
    <P>Sections 50 and 51 provide facilities for recourse to an independent appeal committee against decisions by the board in regard to the grant, revocation, etc., of licences and permits, for <Col N="210" /> example, greyhound race track licences, bookmakers' permits and permits authorising officials functioning in certain capacities at greyhound race meetings.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Bill now before the House will be accepted by Deputies as providing a satisfactory basis on which regulation of the greyhound industry can be undertaken in a spirit of mutual co-operation for the benefit of the sport in general and the commercial aspects associated with it, in particular, the export trade in greyhounds. Whilst the extent of that trade has not latterly been as much as in the immediate post-war years, it nevertheless reached the very useful figure of £543,000 during the last year, excluding from that figure, of course, temporary exports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is substantially the same Bill as I brought in, which was argued at such exasperating length in the past by Deputy MacEntee, as he then was, Deputy Briscoe representing some interest and one or two others of the less significant members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am not really concerned to discuss this Bill because there is nothing in it of substance which constitutes a change, but I do want to emphasise that I think it is a revolting spectacle that the Minister for Health should be dredged up out of the Custom House for the purpose of venting some disgusting little personal spleen which he has against a man long dead, and I think for a man of the Minister's years to pursue some despicable personal vendetta beyond the grave is a revolting spectacle to decent people, more especially when he rambles in here with his satellites to bespatter the reputation of the dead, as I have no doubt he would like to do and as he did at great length in the course of the discussion of this Greyhound Bill when it was last before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to provide him with any occasion to renew that revolting spectacle, but it does, I think, degrade the procedures of this House that, with a Minister for Agriculture appointed by the Taoiseach and approved by the House, in whose Department this Bill was prepared, and on the <Col N="211" /> details of this Bill the officers of that Department are the advisory authority, the Minister for Health should be put forward as the Minister to recommend it to the House.  That is a degrading and shocking procedure, more especially when it is done in order to gratify the disedifying desire of the Minister for Health to conduct his, to me, quite disgusting contest with the dead.</P>
    <P>I have nothing of substance to add to that, Sir.  The Bill was discussed <i>ad nauseam</i> in the House before.  As submitted now, it incorporates the Committee Stage and Report Stage amendments that I had offered to the House.  There is only one distinction, which is typical of the attitude of the Minister.  When the new board was constituted, I desired to pay the same compliment to the Irish Coursing Club in this Bill as was paid to the Turf Club in a previous Bill, the Racing Bill, that is, to provide that in the initial stages there should be four out of seven members of the new administrative body drawn from the Irish Coursing Club and three from outside, but that was accompanied, as it is now accompanied in this Bill, by a proviso that over a two-and-a-half-year period, all these persons would retire and would depend for their continued tenure of office on popular election by the members of the greyhound racing industry so that it did not make any real difference at all; it was merely a matter of paying a compliment to a body of decent men who carried on this business under great difficulties up to this date.</P>
    <P>That was opposed in pursuit of this disgusting, degrading vendetta, to which I have already referred, by the Minister for Health and his adjutants. Some of the associates of the Fianna Fáil Party had the decency to be ashamed of him and walked out and left him to his dirty work when he was pursuing that vendetta, but there were a few sidekicks who stuck to him throughout, noticeably Deputy Briscoe, indeed.  I wish Deputy Briscoe and the Minister for Health joy of their operations.  They may enjoy them.  If they do, I hope they will do themselves no harm.  My experience has been that <Col N="212" /> those who hate can very rarely injure those they hate; they generally injure themselves.  It is high time the Minister for Health woke up to that fact at this stage of his life.  He has spent a good part of his life slanging his neighbours. He ought to make up his mind that, at least from henceforward, he will forbear from slanging the dead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that Deputy Dillon's contribution this morning, when it is read at some future date, will give great enlightenment on his peculiar approach to the greyhound industry as a whole to those who search for reasons attaching to the bringing in of legislation.  He said that some of us had certain interests in which we were concerned in this Bill.  I do not know to what extent it was in order on the Second Reading, but I take it, from what he has just said, that Deputy Dillon had one specific interest only and not the interests of the public or those engaged in the greyhound industry, from whatever aspect we may judge it.</P>
      <P>It is untrue to say that the Bill now before us is the Bill which the former Minister tried to force through this House.  It was only at the very latter stages, after a long and protracted series of arguments in this House that, on the Report Stage&mdash;possibly when he saw doom approaching him as a Minister and in order to try to get the Bill through&mdash;after all our suggested amendments, after hard work and hard argument for many months, the then Minister said &ldquo;all right&rdquo;.  That was because he wanted to preserve one thing only, on which I am glad he has failed, and that the majority of the board will not be his particular friends or those to whom he wishes to erect a monument&mdash;persons whom I do not know at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies now on the Opposition Benches are the greatest experts in slander in this country since its establishment as a free nation.  In writing and in spoken word, nobody could consider himself even an apprentice to them in matters of slander and the assassination of <Col N="213" /> people's characters.  It is about time they examined what they said in the past and apologised by better behaviour in matters of slander.  A Deputy on the Opposition Bench is pointing.  He should speak and not point.  One can understand speech but can easily misunderstand gestures of that nature.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I congratulate the Government on requesting the present Minister for Health to put it through the Dáil.  Nobody paid more attention to every detail of the Bill when it was discussed in the time of the last Coalition Government.  I am sure that all the interests concerned &mdash;greyhound breeders, the public and every section of those who are concerned with the greyhound industry&mdash; will be delighted that the Minister for Health is putting this Bill through the Dáil.  Deputy Dillon spoke as if this were a precedent, one Minister acting for another.  It has happened regularly in the Dáil, over a great number of years, that, for one reason or another, a Minister will pilot a Bill through the House for a colleague in the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the reason in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one section of this Bill on which I am not quite clear&mdash;I will not use the word &ldquo;dissatisfied&rdquo;.  I would ask the Minister to re-examine sub-section (2) of Section 48.  That is the section that seeks to regulate charges to bookmakers and their staffs when entering greyhound race tracks or coursing tracks to do their business.  The Bill says that the entrance charges shall not exceed five times the charge to the public, as a maximum.  I would point out that five times the charge to the public, unless there is a minimum, may not work out fairly&mdash;I have in mind race tracks in the provinces as distinct from the city area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already, by an arrangement for some time past, bookmakers themselves have been paying £1 where, possibly, the entrance charge may not have exceeded 2/6.  I do not think the bookmakers as an organisation or association are anxious to disturb that <Col N="214" /> arrangement because they want to see race tracks kept going.  On the other hand, when this Bill appeared originally, certain race tracks raised entrance charges to bookmakers in Dublin City from £1 to 32/6&mdash;hoping they would have established a fee which the Bill would not disturb and which would, of course, be far in excess of the five times entrance charge.</P>
    <P>I think the bookmakers themselves would be agreeable to inserting in the Bill that, if the five times charge has to be exceeded&mdash;apart from the protection there is from the laying of it on the Table of the House and the Minister's sanction being required to any excess charge&mdash;a maximum charge should be fixed; that, if this five times entrance fee has to be exceeded, then, at no time should it exceed a figure of £2.  There is a reason for that.  There are certain reasonable grounds for fears on the part of those who make their living as bookmakers and who employ quite a number of clerks and officials.</P>
    <P>The Minister may feel that there is adequate and sufficient protection in the section as it stands.  I have read it a number of times.  I have discussed it with people who say: &ldquo;This is satisfactory&rdquo;; I have discussed it with others who read into it other meanings. We all know that, once an Act of Parliament is passed, it is not the intention as expressed here that carries the day in a dispute: it is the exact interpretation of the language of the Act and possibly decided on judicially in that manner.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider &mdash;between now and the Committee Stage, whenever that will be&mdash;whether it may not be advisable, in the interest of making everybody quite satisfied about this particular item, to include maybe the few safeguarding words.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, Sir, I should like to say I am very happy to hear that there is now no difference between the members of the Opposition, and Deputy Dillon in particular, and those of us now on this side of the House, that the Bill will get a rapid clearance through the House, that there is nothing now of any great difference.  I should like to emphasise again that it is very easy <Col N="215" /> for Deputy Dillon now to say that this was his Bill.</P>

      <P>It was the scandal attaching to the greyhound industry generally, the circumstances and conditions in the industry, which forced this Bill into this House.  A board of inquiry was set up and brought in a report.  On the basis of that report, it was found necessary and imperative to bring in a Bill to control and regulate this industry.  Deputy Rooney has been hiding himself for a long while.  He is coming in now with new ideas.  I suggest to him that, before he speaks on this matter, he should go into the Library, read a couple of volumes of Dáil Debates, study what he is going to talk about and not again leave on the records of this House evidence of his incapacity to deal with these things, in the form of a lot of nonsense that will be recorded for all time against him.</P>

I desire to take <Col N="216" /> no part in the argument as to which side brought in the regulations.  To us in the Labour movement it is satisfactory to know that, as the need was there, it is about to be met.  My Party are prepared to support this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Briscoe has gone out, as I had a few matters to take up with him in regard to his remarks.  He invited me to read the volumes containing long speeches and the filibustering that took place in connection with this matter.  I have no intention of reading that tripe, which was designed only to prevent the previous Minister getting his Bill through.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe said the previous Minister brought in his Bill owing to scandals existing in the greyhound world.  Those scandals did not come overnight.  If they were scandals, he and his colleagues were watching them and tolerating them and doing nothing about them for years before this Bill was designed and introduced.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe began here to-day by referring to Deputy Dillon's speech on the Second Reading of this Bill. This Bill is almost identical, line for line, with the Greyhound Industry Bill, the Second Reading of which was taken on 14th December, 1955.  It was brought in at that time by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture.  Word for word and comma for comma, it was contested across the floor, to prevent what has been admitted now by the Minister for Health will be a very helpful and useful Bill.  The Fianna Fáil Government has now swallowed that Bill, hook, line and sinker, with a couple of minor amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delay in having this Bill brought into force has done great damage to the greyhound industry during that time.  I consider that it is two years late, so far as benefit to the industry is concerned.  Any benefit that is to come only begins to come now when the Bill goes into operation.  Those of us who are familiar with the greyhound industry know that there is a keen demand for Irish greyhounds in England.  We know the commercial setup in England, in providing dogs to <Col N="217" /> compete on the tracks.  It is an organised industry there from the commercial racing point of view.  I would mention at this stage that they are so interested in this type of racing contest that they went into the business of cat racing only last year.  It is on record now that cat racing in England in gaining some foothold.</P>

      <P>I feel that this Bill will bring great advantages to the greyhound industry.  It will encourage the breeding and rearing of greyhounds which in the long run will find their way across the Channel to complete on the racing tracks in England.  The dogs in this country are of very high quality, probably owing to the soil, with which our horse-racing successes are also associated.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to welcome this Bill and I am sorry that the Minister for Health did not adopt the attitude towards it two years ago which he has adopted to-day.  However, I welcome his conversion; I welcome the new attitude which he has adopted towards the greyhound industry in general.  I hope that when the Bill goes through the Dáil, there will be no delay on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government in ensuring that the ground lost owing to the hold up of two years will be regained, by making special efforts to bring to the greyhound industry the advantages the Bill was designed to give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rooney seems to be under the misapprehension that the Bill introduced here by the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, is&mdash;as he says himself in his own words&mdash;with a few minor amendments <Col N="218" /> the same Bill as the Minister is introducing now, line for line, comma for comma.  I have here the original Bill introduced by Deputy Dillon. There is very little resemblance between that measure, introduced on 14th December, 1955, and the Bill now before us.  Possibly there is a resemblance between some of the minor points in both Bills, but certainly the major sections in Deputy Dillon's Bill and the major sections in this Bill differ vitally; and therein lies the reason why we in our Party considered that we should oppose very rigidly certain of those sections.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, this debate should not take very long.  The kernel of the argument is contained in the section dealing with the composition of the board.  In the old Bill, the control of the industry was vested in the Irish Coursing Club and the existing club was to have four members out of seven on the new board.  When that Bill was being discussed we pointed out to the then Minister that in view of the report of the Advisory Committee set up by him, Deputy Dillon, to examine the industry, it would be disastrous to let a body such as the Irish Coursing Club have control of the new board.  You could not have controlling the new board a group of people who previously had not been able to carry out their work in a proper manner.  It was through these people and their negligence that the greyhound industry fell into the chaotic conditions in which the Advisory Committee found it when carrying out their investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that the Minister for Health should not have taken this Bill, that it would have been more appropriate for the Minister for Agriculture to have dealt with it in the House.  I am very glad the Minister for Health was able to snatch a few hours off from his precious time at the Custom House to deal with this matter because he has given a great deal of time, both in the House and outside, to studying the various measures necessary for the proper control of the industry.  Accordingly, it would not have been appropriate <Col N="219" /> for the Minister for Agriculture to take the Bill through the House because he may not be conversant with the various factors involved and it would have taken him quite a long time to acclimatise himself to the atmosphere surrounding the industry.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at the reference by Deputy Dillon to what he called the revolting attitude of the Minister for Health in exercising a personal spleen against the dead.  That should not go on record uncontradicted.  It was a completely untrue statement and for verification of the Minister's references when dealing with the Bill, one need only study the debates and have reference to the report of the Advisory Committee.  The Minister's references during the debate on the other Bill were not aimed at individuals as such: they were aimed at certain deals which took place, at mismanagements that occurred.  They contained certain warnings against transactions then envisaged by the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <P>Were it not for the vigilance of the Minister for Health, then Deputy MacEntee, speaking from the Opposition Benches, Powerstown Park, a valuable property, but listed among the assets of the Irish Coursing Club at £1, would have changed hands by this time.  For some reason, Deputy Briscoe was also attacked by Deputy Dillon. Both Deputy Dillon and Deputy MacEoin said that Deputy Briscoe was contributing to some standard or other. I wonder what standard Deputy MacEoin is referring to.  It would be interesting to have Deputy Briscoe contributing to <i>The Standard.</i>  It would be well worth reading.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the Turf Club was mentioned by Deputy Dillon.  He brings the composition of that board into his argument and says that, under the Racing Board Act of 1945, the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Committee were given control of the Racing Board, having a majority of its members.  That is so, but there is no analogy between that board and the board proposed to be established under this Bill.  The members of both the Irish Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Committee <Col N="220" /> were all people of the highest integrity.  Their work on behalf of Irish racing up to that time had been clean and above board.  On the other hand, the work of the Irish Coursing Club was a history of abuse and mismanagement by the various parties now having control of the greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>When the old Bill was introduced, it was our duty to point to this history of abuse and mismanagement referred to by the Advisory Committee set up by Deputy Dillon on 21st February, 1951.  The references we made were not my words, Deputy Briscoe's words or the words of the Minister for Health.  They were the impartial observations of the Advisory Committee. In their summary at the end of that report, the committee had the following remarks to make:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But it is in connection with greyhound racing that the most serious abuses have been practised with impunity and it is here that the unsavoury atmosphere has been created, but unfortunately and undeservedly it has come to be associated with the greyhound industry as a whole.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney also remarked that Deputy MacEntee or his colleagues had done very little down through the years about remedying these practices. In 1939, on the outbreak of war, greyhound racing was practically closed down.  There were not the same number of dogs in the country; the export of dogs to Britain had almost ceased.  After the war, various bodies made representations to the Minister and it was then that Deputy Dillon had this committee set up.</P>
    <P>The one unfortunate aspect of this unhappy Bill is that, having set up an Advisory Committee to investigate the industry, Deputy Dillon did not take their advice.  It was like a person employing a solicitor and refusing to accept his advice.  There are many people who pay for professional advice on various matters, but, having made up their minds on what course they will take, do not accept the advice.</P>
    <P>That was the attitude of Deputy Dillon.  He was labouring under some <Col N="221" /> appalling misapprehension that Deputy MacEntee was setting out, &ldquo;in a revolting fashion, to exercise his personal spleen on the dead&rdquo;.  I cannot reconcile those statements of Deputy Dillon with the debates on the old Bill. When the provision dealing with the composition of the new board comes into being through this Bill, everything, as far as I am concerned, falls into place, because once those people who could not carry out their own business have not the final say and the majority vote on this board, the underlying objection to the last Bill is removed.</P>
    <P>When I commenced to speak I pointed out to Deputy Rooney the great difference between the present Bill and that produced by the former Minister.  Amendments were brought in by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister, due to suggestions which he heard particularly from this side of the House because evidently his colleagues did not have the slightest interest in the greyhound industry.  There are sections dealing with other amendments and other suggestions made during the course of the debate and, in fact, there is very little comparison now between the two Bills except for the minor sections which went through without any real objection.</P>
    <P>There are, however, a few points which perhaps the Minister would look into before the Committee Stage. Section 48 is still, in my opinion, contentious. I appreciate that Deputy Briscoe is conversant with the grievances of the bookmakers but I fail to see the value of his suggestion that the maximum charge should be limited to £2.  Under Section 48 (1), the board may by regulations fix the maximum charges.  Under Section 5 (5) every regulation made by the board under the Act must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, and it could be annulled.  It is also stated in sub-section (2) of Section 48:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where regulations under sub-section (1) of this section fix, in relation to a greyhound race track or part thereof...the regulations shall require the consent of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If they require the consent of the <Col N="222" /> Minister why should they be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas? If the Minister consents will they be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and, if the Minister does not consent, are we to take it that they will still be laid before both Houses?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulations cannot be made unless the Minister consents to the making of them.  If the Deputy will read line 10, page 24, he will see: &ldquo;the regulations shall require the consent of the Minister.&rdquo;  If the Minister's consent is withheld there is no regulation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should still like something concrete stated in the Bill. It could happen that a future Minister for Agriculture might be a person with very little interest in bookmakers, greyhound racing or the greyhound industry as such, and might be guided possibly by certain of his officials who might have some prejudice for instance against bookmakers.  It was pointed out before that such a thing could arise.  If it happened that regulations concerning maximum charges were to be dealt with, there could be Ministers in this House who would not spend very much time on such a question. That is why I hope that in Section 48 the position will be rectified.</P>
      <P>Speaking on Section 48 previously, I pointed out a very serious mistake which the Advisory Committee had made notwithstanding the fact that they had the technical advice of those conversant with previous legislation. At paragraph 166, page 70, of the Report of the Advisory Committee of the Greyhound Industry, it is stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We assume that if our recommendations in regard to the installation of totalisators are approved, a licence to operate them would be granted only to the Control Board and in accordance with the terms of the Totalisator Act, 1929, of which sub-sections (5) and (6) of Section 3 are as follows&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They then quote, and the bookmakers <Col N="223" /> were quite satisfied that if the recommendations of the Advisory Committee were carried out many of their fears and anxieties would be allayed.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we had a State body set up by this House referring to a section under the Totalisator Act of 1929, Section 6, which had been repealed by the Racing Board and Racecourses Act, 1945.  One of the big snags of that Act is that right at the end of page 363 there is this provision under Section 26 (4):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sub-section (6) of Section 3 of the Totalisator Act, 1929 (No. 22 of 1929), is hereby amended by the deletion of all words from the words &lsquo;and the charge to any such licensed bookmaker&rsquo; to the end of the said sub-section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Between now and the next stage perhaps the Minister would consider whether that safeguard which was recommended and which the Advisory Committee assumed was in existence could be revived in Section 48.  Perhaps, we in the midst of these problems, can understand the legal phraseology and take a certain interpretation from it but I think the Minister will agree there is nothing better in legislation, particularly of this type, than to remove all ambiguity and doubts, and I hope that will be done in connection with this Bill which will possibly become law very shortly.  As Deputy Dillon has remarked, the bookmakers themselves have been the backbone of the whole industry down the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the people rearing the greyhounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly they are also contributors to the industry as a whole, but down through the years, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, the bookmakers have been the backbone of the industry.  Undoubtedly, they are now going to be hard hit by the introduction at Shelbourne Park this year or next year, of the tote, and then in Cork and Limerick.  It is calculated that they will lose 20 per cent. of their present turnover and that is taking into consideration that a new type of patron will be attracted.  The Advisory <Col N="224" /> Committee calculate that the net result for bookmakers will be that their present turnover will be reduced by 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>Again I would refer to this question of regulations, this question of laying regulations before the House.  I have not been here very long, but I have never heard of a regulation being suggested to annual a regulation.  I fear that it could happen that more important matters here before the House could mean that they were fobbed off or that the regulations might not get the attention which they deserve.</P>
      <P>To sum up, my anxiety is to have this written in without yea or nay, either say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  My suggestion before was right.  There are at the present time charges in excess of five times the maximum.  The maximum charges are in excess of what the public is charged.  Take Limerick.  It is half-a-crown for an ordinary member of the public to go in.  Five times that is 12/6 but bookmakers pay £1.  There is no greyhound race track where the charge is less than £1.  Deputy Dillon mentioned that possibly there were race tracks down the country that charged 1/-.  The minimum admission charge in Ireland is 2/6, and it is far in excess of that in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two other matters which I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister.  The Minister is probably aware that there are what are known as flapper tracks throughout the country.  Unfortunately, quite an amount of money has been invested in these tracks, these schooling tracks, and it is envisaged here&mdash;as a matter of fact, I am all against it; it was envisaged also but not in so much detail, in the Bill brought in by Deputy Dillon&mdash;that schooling tracks for reward would be done away with.  That means if you want to have a trial, it will be on a licensed track.  I, having purchased a dog, having trained him, fed him and walked him, bring him to Shelbourne Park or to Market Field in Limerick and Deputy Flanagan or Deputy Rooney can watch the trial with their own stop watches, and then what happens?  The race comes along <Col N="225" /> and the dog opens at five to two against, and Deputies Flanagan and Rooney can place bets on him.  Then if I want to back him, I have to back at six to four on.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is that I cannot have the private school even if I pay 5/-, to make my dog fit by the time for the official track.  I cannot school my dog.  Yet if I have horses in the Curragh or if I ran a horse at Mullingar the week before last, and if I do not enter him again until I enter him for Leopardstown next month, I can school my horse over hurdles, over fences and on the flat.  I admit I could be reported by the stipendiary steward to explain the difference in running, if, say, the horse ran more prominently, or won, on the next occasion.  To cut a long story short, I was never in favour of bringing in legislation which cannot be enforced and the Minister, I am sure, will agree with me when he recalls that the Advisory Committee in their recommendations stated that they were quite well aware that a private owner could not be debarred from having his own private track.</P>
    <P>Is that not tantamount to suggesting that the moneyed greyhound owner can have his own private track?  There is no suggestion that he is doing anything illegal because the very wording on page 4 of the definition of a greyhound race is that it &ldquo;means a greyhound race (including trial and schooling) in which an object propelled by mechanical means is pursued&rdquo;. Then it goes on to say that a greyhound race track &ldquo;means a greyhound race track on which greyhound races are held for reward&rdquo;.  The net result of all this is that flapper tracks and places where one brings a dog and pays 5/- for a trial, are out.  The person can be prosecuted and struck off by the disciplinary commission or whatever body is set up, but if I am a wealthy owner who keeps 20 or 30 dogs and if I have plenty of land down the country, I can have my own private track.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in this Bill to do away with that.  The Advisory Committee admit in their report that <Col N="226" /> they cannot prevent it.  I would also ask the Minister to give attention to that part of the matter between now and Committee Stage.  It is possible that the Minister could suggest or state that any school but the public trials should not be permissible; in other words, that a person cannot have a private track.  The Advisory Committee seem to be of the opinion that it would be impossible to find out if a man had a private track.  This is a very small country and particularly in greyhound racing if a person is being opposed by a certain owner, it will soon be brought to the attention of the powers that be that &ldquo;So-and-so has a private school&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to paragraph 68 of the Report of the Advisory Committee which states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The problem of providing a solution of the difficulties in connection with &lsquo;time-finding&rsquo; is aggravated by the existence of a large number of so-called &lsquo;schooling&rsquo; tracks, i.e., unlicensed tracks laid out on private grounds, the owners of which for a monetary consideration, afford facilities for &lsquo;schooling&rsquo; and for obtaining information regarding the potentialities of dogs destined to participate in the near future in graded races on licensed tracks.  The information, often very valuable, arising from such trials, would be available to the owner of the dog and his friends and normally only they would benefit by it.  We believe, however, that in many cases the owners of the &lsquo;schooling&rsquo; tracks benefit to a greater extent from the knowledge of form thus acquired, and indeed that the advantage so gained is a direct incentive to the establishment of unlicensed &lsquo;schooling&rsquo; tracks.  We realise that a greyhound owner cannot be debarred from providing a &lsquo;schooling&rsquo; track on his own grounds for his own dogs, but we are of opinion that unlicensed &lsquo;schooling&rsquo; tracks which operate for reward should be regarded in the same light as unlicensed racing tracks, and should be compelled by the Control Board in due course to cease operations. Mention was made of one racing track which operates without <Col N="227" /> a licence and also affords facilities for trials.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I presume Chapelizod will be closed as well, but I think the Minister will see that something should be done in this case.  There is quite an amount of anxiety.  They are very decent people who own these &ldquo;schooling&rdquo; tracks and they have invested considerable money in them.  They are doing nothing illegal, but, all of a sudden, under this Bill they will now be clamped down upon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel these details should be reserved for Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was only to bring to the Minister's attention what I had in mind to raise on Committee Stage that I spoke thus.  I will leave the matter at that, but I would stress to the Minister that there is grave anxiety.  There are 150 of these &ldquo;schooling&rdquo; tracks in the country and that represents a considerable capital expenditure.  Unfortunately, I have not got the figure for that capital expenditure on &ldquo;schooling&rdquo; tracks here, but I will give it to the Minister in due course.</P>
      <P>My suggestion to the Minister is to give the man without money the same right as the private owner with money and I would suggest to the Minister that &ldquo;schooling&rdquo; should not be prohibited. It is the luck of the game to be allowed to school one's own dog, to get him in the finest fettle and best condition possible, in order to get the best possible price when the time comes to run the dog.  There is no stipulation against that on the Curragh. They have scheduled and unscheduled gallops on the Curragh and it is a matter for their own convenience that the gallops will be kept in condition.  The only other matter I wish to raise in connection with this Bill can be left to the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister, when he is replying to some of the points, would let us know, if this Bill becomes law in this session, next week or the week after, will the tracks in Dublin be <Col N="228" /> allowed immediately to set up the totalisator or will they have to wait until the various manipulations in the appointment of the control board are gone through.  In other words, would it be possible to envisage the totalisator at Dublin tracks in 1958?  It has an important bearing from the point of view of track owners.  Could Cork and Limerick tracks proceed to that necessary step?</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay the House on this Bill with a long speech because the House has been delayed too long.  As a matter of fact, it has been delayed over a year now and during that time the price of wheat could be ventilated and the price of milk.  Everything can be ventilated, but nobody has yet mentioned the price of greyhounds.  Whenever the price of any commodity falls, the matter is complained of here, but nobody has made a complaint about the price of dogs.  People are selling dogs at £40 apiece which should realise £250.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is going to improve something, anyway.  It will encourage the people who are rearing the greyhounds when they look to the tracks and see that there are better stakes, that they will not be running their dogs for just a couple of pounds.  They are running them for the same stakes now as they ran them for in pre-war times.  So far as private schooling is concerned, unless the Minister recruits an army of 80,000 men he cannot stop schooling of dogs.  It does not matter whether the man is rich or poor, it will go on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">

      <P>The small farmer or the big farmer will have a school to try his own dog and he will not be adverse to taking a few shillings from a neighbour to try his dog.  I do not know how that is going to be stopped. It has been said that bookmakers will lose 20 per cent. of their turnover.  The only thing we have to go on in that <Col N="229" /> regard is the experience of horse racing.  I remember, before there was any totalisator at all, there used to be eight or nine bookmakers standing in Tramore.  When the totalisator came along, it was said that ruination was going to come to everybody, but when the tote did come, the prizes began to increase and more people came to the races.  More bookmakers were then called for, and that is what I think will come out of this.  When there are better prizes on the tracks, there will be better attractions for people to come and, instead of bookmakers being 20 per cent. down, they will be up because there will be more people there to bet.  I, and a great many of my friends, are definitely concerned with the prizes that have been offered in the years gone by.  We know when this Bill is in force and a reasonable time has elapsed, that the board will be able to improve the prizes.</P>
      <P>There is something else I would like to draw the Minister's attention to and it is this.  When we have a commodity to sell, no matter what it is, we take care that that commodity is as it is described and that it gets into the market in a proper condition.  We should do the same about greyhounds and about the marketing of greyhounds. We should make sure that when an Irish dog is on the block to be sold on an English track, the buyer can buy that dog with confidence on the papers with the dog.  It is most important.</P>
      <P>A good deal of the opposition to this Bill came from outside the House. Three of the greatest opponents of the Bill I met were warned-off men.  They seemed to be the people most vocal against this Bill.  They had a grudge. They came along with every venomous innuendo they could to every side of the House and tried to get their venom put over inside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is here now, and in spite of what Deputy Briscoe said, there is no difference between it and the one introduced by Deputy Dillon except in regard to the personnel.  I noticed that a lot of the champions and the great coursing experts who were over here when Deputy Dillon introduced his Bill were not here to-day.  We did not <Col N="230" /> see Deputy Vivion de Valera here with his three-and-a-half hours' speech.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill goes through quickly and that this board can go about its business in the same way as the Racing Board went about its business, that it will be able to put up the prizes, improve the tracks and bring more people to the tracks.  If it does so, everybody&mdash; even the bookmakers&mdash;will be satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a small point which concerns the headquarters of this board when it is set up.  My hope is that it will not be centred here in Dublin but that it will be centred in Clonmel which is traditionally the home of coursing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a great pity if we were again to make the headquarters of this new board in the city. We all complain&mdash;down the country at any rate&mdash;of the lack of decentralisation and the concentration of everything here in the city.  If the board is to have headquarters it should be in an area like Clonmel which has been associated with coursing as long as I can remember.  I say these few words to draw the Minister's attention to the claims which that area would have when headquarters for the board are being established.</P>

      <P>It is a bit like saying there is no difference between &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; without the Prince and &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; with the Prince.  There is not much difference; the only difference is one character.  But there is no point to the play if Hamlet is not in it.  Deputy Dillon is wont to accuse the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Industry and Commerce of brazen effrontery.  I think it is quite brazen to say&mdash;as he did in an aside last night and more <Col N="231" /> fully to-day&mdash;that there is no real difference between this Bill and the Bill Deputy Dillon introduced.  In fact, what he said last night was that we have introduced a Bill which is, line by line, the Bill which was introduced by him some time ago.</P>
      <P>That simply is not so.  Section 9, line 17, is the  line as far as the Bill is concerned.  The fact that many of the recommendations of the Advisory Board were included in the Bill as introduced by Deputy Dillon, and are included in it now, is partly because we had a very long and exhaustive debate here during which Deputy Dillon gave in on many of these points, very graciously on some but rather reluctantly on others.  He refused entirely to give in on the issue of the constitution of the board.</P>
      <P>This is an important point and it is the thing which we considered, and still consider, absolutely vital if the Bill is to have any purpose at all.  The abuses which everybody knew were in the greyhound industry existed under the management and control of the club as constituted and I think it would be farcical if the same club, similarly constituted, were to have control over the new Greyhound Industry Board.  It would simply be a waste of time.  That is not to say I do not appreciate what they have done in regard to the greyhound industry and its development over the years. They have done a great deal of useful work and they may not be to blame in many ways for the abuses that did creep in.  But the fact that they did creep in while the Irish Coursing Club were in control certainly seems to demonstrate that they should not have the control of the board to be set up to try to clean up the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not share Deputy O'Malley's fears about the results following the establishment of totalisators on race tracks throughout the country.  I share Deputy Lynch's view that, as a result of the establishment of these totalisators, with increased revenue and increased stake money, we shall have more people interested in going to greyhound racing, more people interested <Col N="232" /> in breeding greyhounds and consequently a more active and thriving industry.  That has been the experience of the Racing Board after the establishment of totalisators on horse racing tracks.  I share Deputy Lynch's view that that will also be the result in this case and that the bookmakers will not suffer.</P>
    <P>I do not very often go to greyhound racing or coursing but I do occasionally. I must say I always prefer to bet on the totalisator than with a bookmaker.  You do not have to get into an unruly scramble with a lot of other people and you have a better idea of where you stand.  You do not have to rush about from one bookmaker to another wondering what odds you will get.  The totalisator decides all these things for you.</P>
    <P>I wish to welcome this Bill and the statement by the Opposition that they do not propose to offer any serious opposition to it.  But again I say that I did not understand during the last prolonged debate why Deputy Dillon refused to change his stand about the membership of the Irish Greyhound Board.  I am glad that we now have the opportunity of bringing in a Bill which will give us a new board which will not be under the control of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <P>May I say, in conclusion, that I think any Bill in this or any other country will not succeed in removing completely the abuses that are attendant upon any form of racing, whether it be greyhounds or horses?  I believe, however, we can very substantially remove the opportunities for chicanery and corruption.  We can effectively eliminate certain types of corruption.  If we do that, we will have achieved our object because we do not expect to do what no other country can do and what cannot be done where unpredictable animals are concerned, that is to clear out all elements of human chance. Racing of any kind is a game of chance and so long as it is I think there will be room for a certain amount of abuse and sharp dealing.  Our object is to reduce that to a minimum and I believe this Bill will have that effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies who, like myself, <Col N="233" /> have only come into the House for the first time in the past year are probably somewhat at a disadvantage in speaking upon a measure of this kind as against those Deputies who were here during a former régime and had the opportunity of discussing the 1955 Bill in its various stages.  As far as discussion and consideration are concerned in relation to a measure of this kind, the Bill has got both.  For that reason, it is somewhat difficult to go over it now without being charged with repetition.</P>
      <P>I merely intend to refer to a few items upon which I feel it is desirable to address the House.  I happen to be a person who had a rather severe conflict with the Irish Coursing Club about 18 years ago as to my part-ownership of or interest in a greyhound racing schooling track in the town of Listowel, namely, Listowel Greyhound Racing Company, Limited.  Somebody referred here to a number of warned-off people from the Irish Coursing Club being against the introduction of this Bill. I happen to be in the opposite camp in so far as that is concerned.  I can congratulate myself to some extent and my then colleagues for setting up this local schooling track and for having at that time incurred the anger and disapproval, to put it mildly, of the Irish Coursing Club and for having then challenged the authority of the Irish Coursing Club as to their authority to refuse to license this track.  A number of similar schooling tracks were set up about that time, just immediately after the war, and the attitude that the Irish Coursing Club displayed towards them was not satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of that very attitude, breeders felt that the time had come when some steps should be taken to challenge the authority of the Irish Coursing Club, as it then operated. Out of that a very important organisation emerged, known as the Greyhound Owners' and Breeders' Association. First of all, I should like to say here publicly that the thanks of the greyhound breeding industry should go out to the organisation for the very businesslike way in which they handled an awkward situation at that time, and more particularly for the demands <Col N="234" /> they then made upon the Government to set up an independent inquiry to go into this whole situation.</P>
    <P>After some delay, perhaps understandable, the Minister at the time set up a board of inquiry composed of persons whom I regarded as very competent persons.  That board of inquiry set about a very difficult task and, I must say, they performed it in a most satisfactory manner.  I suggest that that body more than any other has been instrumental in no small way in bringing in this Bill before us to-day.</P>
    <P>Even though I am one of the people who had reason to be dissatisfied with a certain aspect of the administration of the Irish Coursing Club I would not say they were a very unworthy organisation.  Actually, I say no such thing.  The Irish Coursing Club started about 40 years ago.  At that time, they entered upon a very difficult task because greyhound breeding in this country was at a very low ebb.  The people then engaged in the breeding of greyhounds were not entirely as favourably disposed towards the sport as they are at the present day.  I think the Irish Coursing Club at that time handled a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>Prior to that period, as we know, the control&mdash;if you could call it such at all&mdash;of coursing was exercised in this country by an outside body.  I think it was very commendable, particularly during that period of our national resurgence, that a body of Irishmen and sportsmen came together and were able to exert pressure upon breeders to set up an organisation in the form of the Irish Coursing Club and maintain it since in the interests and for the good of the breeders.  I think these men, the founders of the Irish Coursing Club&mdash;many of them are dead now, I believe&mdash;did a very useful job. If abuses crept into the management and administration of their work, they should not be blamed for it.  It was due to the non-co-operation of the breeders and to the fact that a number of people tried to get rich quickly. As far as I can understand and as far as we can read from the various reports that have been made available to us, abuses did not creep into <Col N="235" /> coursing as such until after the introduction of the mechanical hare in this country about 1927.</P>
    <P>As far as I know from my limited knowledge of coursing, open coursing was always largely free from any such abuses.  As the previous speaker said, sport contains an element of chance. It is too much to expect to arrive at a stage when you will be completely free from abuses.  All we can do is to limit abuses to the minimum.  The House has now, in my opinion, set out to bring about that situation by the introduction of this Bill which provides for the setting up of a statutory board to control greyhound racing.</P>
    <P>The idea of the club organisation which the Bill provides for is still a very good idea.  There is no such club organisation in regard to horse breeding for the rank and file of people who breed racehorses.  Of course, since the number of horse racing people is comparatively small as against those who are engaged in greyhound racing, that is quite understandable.  I was very glad, when I read the Bill, to find that the local club organisation was still to be maintained.</P>
    <P>The only suggestion I should like to make&mdash;I hope it will be quite relevant to the work of the board&mdash;is that in the preservation of that club organisation, if the board had any influence with the Irish Coursing Club who would still naturally affiliate these clubs, it should see that the membership should be confined to breeders and that no people who were not breeders should be admitted to membership of the club. I think it is very wrong&mdash;it does not tend to make matters more efficient&mdash; to allow people into a club of that kind who have no direct interest.  They may have an indirect interest, but I think the membership should be more carefully screened.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest to the Minister that if it is not provided for in the Bill, and I think it is not, he should make a note of it and have a word with the new board, and suggest they might try to arrange with the Irish Coursing Club for a more conservative selection of club membership.  If the fabric, which <Col N="236" /> is the club, is good, then the structure itself will stand.  It is very satisfactory that the Bill does not interfere in the least with the principle of club organisation and I am glad that the Minister preserved that very special protection for the breeders.</P>
    <P>The Greyhound Breeders' Association is not specifically mentioned in the Bill but I think that that is an organisation that should be encouraged to continue doing very useful work because the Irish Coursing Club as such, even though it will still operate and possibly control certain aspects of this industry, is not in my opinion in the same strong position to protect the interests of the owners as a distinct association would be.  I think that association which has worked so hard in the past to bring about the desirable change which we are now facing in the greyhound industry should be encouraged and get recognition in due course by having some of its members considered for inclusion in the proposed board.  The set-up of the board is such that no particular interest is singled out for consideration.  I think that is a step in the right direction because, if we begin to take an attitude of that kind, other interests will come along and say that they are more entitled to be considered than some interest that was in fact considered.</P>
    <P>I think the fears expressed by some speakers in regard to bookmakers are somewhat unfounded.  It is no use to try to compare the situation likely to develop in the greyhound industry through the introduction of the tote with the situation which did develop in horse racing when the tote was introduced. I do not believe they are on a par.  First of all, there will be the difficulty of operating the tote successfully in certain forms of greyhound racing.  At the moment it operates on mechanical racing but has failed to operate and possibly never will operate, on what is known as open, flat-country coursing.</P>
    <P>I feel the greyhound industry is in a reasonably healthy state now, notwithstanding all the shocks, drawbacks and other things that came its way and one of the factors which contributed <Col N="237" /> to the present position in the industry, I think, is the bookmakers' co-operation.  In this greyhound industry this has been one of the most important factors helping to build it up.  Somebody might say the breeders were the principal people, that you had to start somewhere and that you had to start with the breeders, but I suggest that in the past at coursing meetings, either mechanical trials or open coursing meetings in the country, the bookmakers always played a very important role in the success of such meetings.  I believe this more especially in the case of flat coursing.  They always co-operated splendidly and in the case of mechanical coursing their co-operation has been very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>While we have to go with the times in most things, I think it would be a pity if we ran a little too far in this case and I sincerely hope that the policy of the board when established will be rather conservative with regard to replacing the existing bookmakers' organisation entirely with the tote. Undoubtedly, we cannot hold things as they are for all time and there is possibly some room for improvement in the betting market, but it would be a very serious state of affairs if that improvement were to bring certain benefits to a limited clientele and at the same time bring about a worsening of conditions for the bookmakers who have quite a lot of expense to meet such as the payment of licences, provision of transport, and employment of staffs.  As far as possible, I think any existing interest they have should be preserved.  They are good employers and have contributed significantly to the development of coursing in the past, certainly to open coursing.</P>
    <P>In my opinion a more serious aspect of this matter has been forgotten.  It is the fact that if you lay a bet with a bookmaker there is that personal touch about it that many people seem to like.  Even if they end up by getting smaller dividends from the bet I think they are generally more satisfied because the choice is wider and there is greater variety.  It would be disastrous if the personal touch should be removed now, or at least removed to an appreciable extent from the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> With regard to flapper tracks as they are called, they will probably assume a role of greater importance when this Bill becomes law.  In the past these organisations were termed unlicensed or even illegal tracks&mdash;I think that word was used&mdash;and in my opinion it seemed that they were regarded as very dangerous to society.  I feel it would be wrong to legislate so that the owner of a greyhound would be prohibited from having the right to have his dog tested in any place other than at a track licensed under the board, a track on which eventually the dog will run.  There is quite a lot to be said for private trials and an owner, in my opinion, is completely justified in taking his dog to a private trial or schooling track whether it is licensed or not.  Not only is he justified, but I think it is the more practical arrangement. There and then, he is entitled to have his dog tested in his own way. We know that race tracks have made a condition that before a dog is allowed to run he has to be tested&mdash;I think twice&mdash;on that track and that situation would still prevail.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I cannot see why there should be any objection to having the dog schooled previously at a local private track.  The record of the dog on that occasion does not matter at all to the public because, in any event, the dog is tested eventually on what is known as the official track.  His performance there is recorded and it is on that performance that the bookmakers will lay the odds.  I think we would be treading on very dangerous ground if we were to carry out what it is proposed to do&mdash;eliminate these schooling tracks.  They have been there for quite a time and have done good work and above all, their existence has established confidence amongst breeders which otherwise would be very difficult to create.</P>
    <P>Coming to the constitution of the board proper, I think the big objection to the original board was that it was then proposed to nominate four from the Irish Coursing Club to the board and thereby give an actual monopoly of the administration of the board to the Irish Coursing Club.  I understand that the previous Minister was not prepared <Col N="239" /> to reduce that Irish Coursing Club representation and I am glad that the present Minister has found it desirable and practicable to meet the wishes, particularly of the Greyhound Owners' and Breeders' Association, in that connection.  It would be entirely wrong in a statutory board of this kind that any particular interest should have a monopoly and I consider that both Ministers have met the Irish Coursing Club very, very fairly indeed by recognising that body and giving it block representation.</P>
    <P>I have some experience of the Racing Board and if the new board set up under this Bill can do its work nearly so perfectly as the Racing Board has done its work we will have a very good organisation.  We can look forward to the board doing a good job.  I know the work that the Racing Board is doing for racing in a number of provincial centres.  I happen to be a member of one of the executives and have very close contact with the executive of the Racing Board.  In that board there is a very good pattern for this new board and I sincerely hope that their work will be as satisfactory and as successful as that of the Racing Board.  The membership of the Racing Board is varied and, as far as I know, the members give their services voluntarily and without remuneration.  The same principle might very usefully be applied to the Greyhound Board.  With the exception of the chairman, whom it is proposed to pay, I hope the intention is that the members will act in a voluntary capacity.</P>
    <P>I wish now to make a point with regard to the machinery for appeal from decisions of the board, the granting of licences to tracks, the granting of licences to bookmakers. Whilst we can have a very high degree of confidence in the board, it is always advisable to take the usual and necessary precaution of providing machinery for appeal from decisions by a board. It is not that I fear that the decisions of this board will be wrong or too hastily considered but I think it is necessary to meet the ordinary man-in-the-street who likes to know that in <Col N="240" /> every aspect of administration there is provision for appeal.  In this case the matter is not as satisfactory as it might be.  The board can make a decision and in the ordinary course of events there does not seem to be any definite course open to an aggrieved party to bring his case to a higher and more competent authority.  That is a point that the Minister might take note of and perhaps he may be able to do something about it on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We, Irish people, pride ourselves on being a sporting people and for that reason I am sure that even the members of his own Party will deplore the exhibition of sportsmanship displayed by Deputy Dillon here this morning.  I do not worry about the allegations which he made against me.  They are so horrible that those who may have heard them, or who may read them, will find it hard to believe that they were not conceptions of a disordered imagination. They are so fantastic that they refute themselves and I am content to leave the matter at that.</P>
      <P>I am more than surprised, however, at Deputy Rooney's intervention.  It is clear from his remarks that he has not troubled either to read the present Bill or its predecessor, much less to compare them.  If he had studied the two Bills he would not have been so audacious in his disregard of the facts as he was this morning.  It may be that I am to blame to some extent in not stressing the fundamental differences between the provisions of the present Bill and the Bill of 1955.  Therefore, Deputy Rooney may have been lured into making the foolish speech to which we were compelled to listen this morning.  My only excuse is that I feared that some members of the Opposition&mdash;as, indeed, was shown&mdash;might be feeling sore and I refrained from rubbing salt into their wounds.  I was restrained, therefore, when referring to the important differences of principle between this Bill and that of 1955, though there are great differences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan has pointed out the outstanding difference, the change <Col N="241" /> in Section 9 of the Bill, the important difference between that section as it appears in this Bill and as it appeared in the Bill of 1955.  The important fact is that, whereas Deputy Dillon's Bill provided that the Irish Coursing Club would control the Greyhound Industry Board, under the present Bill that position will not obtain.  The club will not control the board and cannot control the board.  On the other hand, the reconstitution of the club will be carried out under the supervision of the board.</P>
    <P>In general, let me say this, that in this Bill we have endeavoured to give full effect to the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on the Greyhound Industry.  In the Bill of 1955 the Minister who was responsible for it tried to ignore those recommendations and to ignore the verdict of his own Advisory Committee.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that there are not important changes in the Bill.  I have referred to the fundamental change&mdash;the very different position which will be occupied in relation to the whole greyhound industry by the Greyhound Industry Board, as it is proposed to constitute it under this Bill.  The other difference is that the reconstitution of the Irish Coursing Club will be carried out under the general supervision of the Greyhound Industry Board.  Therefore, we may be satisfied that the defects in organisation, which were pleaded in extenuation of the failure of the Irish Coursing Club to prevent the growth, development and continuance of the malpractices which were so emphatically described in the Advisory Committee's Report, will no longer exist, will be rooted out.  We shall then have a statutory body controlling the sport of greyhound coursing and the breeding of greyhounds which will command general public confidence.  If, after a long fight against an obdurate and stubborn Minister, we have succeeded in bringing that position about, we shall have done a great public service.</P>
    <P>There are, however, other differences. Deputy Moloney has referred to those provisions in the Bill which provide for an appeal tribunal.  There was no such provision in the Bill as it <Col N="242" /> was introduced by Deputy Dillon.  It took almost two years of hard and concentrated controversy to extort that concession to justice and equality from him.  It is true that, in a last-minute attempt to get his Bill through, he conceded the right of appeal to those who might be aggrieved by the decisions of the board.  When the matter was being raised, as it was raised on the Second Reading of the Bill, he could have indicated his readiness to consider it in a reasonable way.  It was only when he could not get his own unreasonable way in regard to the reorganisation of this industry that, in a last, desperate attempt to get his Bill through, he gave what we, representing public opinion, had extorted from him.</P>
    <P>There are embodied in this Bill 16 amendments&mdash;most of them of substance&mdash;which were introduced only on report.  Will any Deputy say that a Bill which differs from its predecessor in two important matters of principle &mdash;with another matter of principle scarcely less important, that of the right to appeal&mdash;and these other 15 or 16 matters of administrative importance, does anybody say that a Bill which differs in these manifold respects from the Bill of 1955, is Deputy Dillon's Bill, is the Bill which those who are engaged in the industry, those who are concerned to see the sport clean and the industry flourish could have had two years ago?  Yes, they could have had it two years ago&mdash;let me emphasise that&mdash;if Deputy Dillon had been prepared to listen to the well-founded criticisms of those who were criticising the Bill when in opposition, if he had been prepared to give effect to the recommendations of the Advisory Committee which he himself had set up so long ago as February, 1951.</P>
    <P>There are some matters which arise for debate on the Committee State and which have been mentioned.  I think the fears of Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Briscoe in relation to the provisions of Section 48 are not well-founded. The section has been drafted in such a way as to provide for a degree of flexibility in fixing maximum and minimum charges which will make <Col N="243" /> that machinery adaptable to changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>In regard to this question of charges, maximum and minimum, we have to bear in mind always that the machinery of which they are the component parts is being set up to provide an alternative to the imposition of a levy upon bookmakers in respect of each particular bet.  It was argued here, when the 1955 Bill was under discussion, that the collection of such a levy would impose, perhaps, too great a strain upon the resources of the bookmaking fraternity and would lay a very onerous obligation on its members.  I thought myself, when I argued it, that it would be. However, if we are setting up a Greyhound Industry Board we have to give it the resources which will enable it to fulfil the duties which we impose upon it.  The board must get money from somewhere.  Pending the setting-up of the totalisators, it does not appear that it will have any other source of income but the income which will be derived from a levy that the bookmakers will have to collect in respect of each bet.</P>
    <P>When the totalisators are established, it may be possible for the board to relinquish the right to impose a levy, but they can relinquish that right only provided that they get from the bookmakers a reasonable income to replace that which they will lose in part.  It may well happen in the future&mdash;some years, perhaps, from now&mdash;that those who may be looking for an alteration in the maximum and the minimum charges&mdash;bear in mind that it is the minimum charge which is important so far as a change in the manner of deriving some revenue from bookmakers is concerned&mdash;will be the bookmakers themselves.  They may say: &ldquo;We would rather pay an admission charge which is x times that which the general public are called upon to pay than to have the unpleasant obligation of collecting a levy from each individual punter.&rdquo;  Therefore, the amounts of the maximum and minimum charges may become a matter of negotiation between the bookmakers and the board.</P>
    <P>It may be the bookmakers themselves <Col N="244" /> who may be looking for a change&mdash;a change, first of all, in the minimum charge and then, as a corollary to that, a change in the maximum charge. One must remember that it is the difference in the minimum charge as determined by the board and the maximum charge, which will represent the amount which will inure to the greyhound racing tracks for admitting the bookmakers and giving them the right to carry on their business on the tracks.</P>
    <P>All that, however, is subject to a great deal of control.  The first control is that the consent of the Minister must be obtained.  No Minister will lightly give his consent to any change which is likely to evoke criticism, unless he has the strongest grounds for being satisfied that the change is necessary and is just.  As a further control upon him, however, the provision exists in Section 5 that all regulations made must be laid before both Houses and if in either House a motion for annulment is carried then the regulation falls, is no longer binding, and has no effect.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out to Deputy O'Malley when he was speaking, the consent of the Minister is necessary to make any regulation and if that consent is withheld no regulation can be made.  Even when a regulation has been made, it has then to be laid before both Houses and if a motion of annulment is carried, again the regulation becomes null and void.  The Deputy said, I think, that he had never heard in his experience of a motion of annulment being carried or of a motion to annul a regulation being debated in this House.  I can assure him he will find on the records of this House many motions for annulment debated at length, many regulations which were the subject of very severe criticism here.  The power of annulment is a very great power, by which the House may control the operations of the Greyhound Industry Board, in order to ensure that the board will act in conformity with the provisions of the Act and with the general purposes which the House had in mind when the measure was being enacted.  That is a very important protection, since because of it bookmakers or any other interest which may <Col N="245" /> feel aggrieved by any regulation made by the board or any rule made by the club can have their grievance voiced here and debated here; for it is open to any private member to put down a motion here for the annulment of a regulation.  Therefore, the Deputy may rest assured that the board will not be able to act in the arbitrary way which he feared.</P>
    <P>With regard to the schooling tracks to which in his speech Deputy O'Malley also referred and to which Deputy Moloney later referred, I think that full justification for bringing these tracks under control is furnished by the paragraph of the report which he read and in which this important passage occurred:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The problem of providing a solution of the difficulties in connection with &lsquo;time-finding&rsquo; is aggravated by the existence of a large number of so called &lsquo;schooling&rsquo; tracks... for obtaining information regarding the potentialities of dogs destined to participate in the near future in graded races on licensed tracks.  The information, often very valuable, arising from such trials, would be available to the owner of the dog and his friends and normally only they would benefit by it.  We believe, however, that in many cases the owners of the &lsquo;schooling&rsquo; tracks benefit to a greater extent from the knowledge of form thus acquired, and indeed that the advantage so gained is a direct incentive to the establishment of unlicensed &lsquo;schooling&rsquo; tracks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All that the board can do is make regulations licensing tracks, if they are tracks where racing takes place for reward, so as to provide they are run <i>bona fide</i> and honestly.  In this connection, however, let us not forget, while listening to complaints from greyhound owners, that there have been very hectic and well-founded complaints from the general public attending these tracks.  If we do not clean up the sport, so far as it is humanly possible by an Act of Parliament to clean up anything, it will not be very long until the greyhound tracks will not be able to keep open, as people <Col N="246" /> will get tired going to them.  If we are to tackle this at all, we must make provision as far as we can to deal with every evil&mdash;those which we might be prepared to look leniently at, as well as those which by their very nature appal us.  We cannot have a choice of evils in this matter.  We must go out after every abuse and malpractice which would help people to defraud the general public.  That is what is fundamentally involved here.</P>
    <P>Moreover, we must bear in mind that we cannot do the work of the board here.  There is no use in setting up this board unless we are prepared to allow it and its members to deal with the problems which the Advisory Committee's report shows are clamouring for attention.  If, as Deputy O'Malley himself said, we are retaining a lawyer, we have to let him plead for us.  If we are setting up a board to do the job, we have to let them do it&mdash;and I am sure they will do it in a reasonable way.  When in due course they make regulations dealing with schooling tracks, racing tracks, and so on, and when these regulations come before this House, if there is anything in any regulation which we think too onerous or objectionable in any way, it can be debated here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the regulation. My main point was that the man with the money is still empowered to have his own schooling track.  He does not get any reward, he does not charge anything.  He has 20 or 30 dogs.  We do not prohibit him under the Bill.</P>

      <P>This is one of the circumstances in human life which there is no way of avoiding.  The man with the Rolls-Royce can, in certain circumstances, do a lot of things which a man who has not got a car just cannot do.  There are these inequalities in our circumstances which no legislation can obviate.  We had better make up our mind to do the best we can, in the circumstances as they exist.  Somebody may find a way of dealing with this inequality later on.  Some other way may be found of dealing with it but we do not see a solution for it now. The Advisory Committee has reported <Col N="247" /> in certain terms in relation to these tracks and we had better let the board try to deal with them as best it can, with the knowledge and resources available to it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Loughman suggested that the board would have its headquarters in Clonmel.  I shall inform the Minister for Agriculture of his desire in that matter and perhaps he will consider it.  The Deputy, I feel sure, will have an opportunity of discussing it with the Minister for Agriculture and maybe have his wishes granted.  I want to say finally that I am piloting the Bill through the House only because it happened that when my late colleague, Deputy Walsh, was taken suddenly away from us, I was entrusted with the general charge of the Bill.  As I am familiar with the implications of the Bill, I was asked to pilot it through the House, but once the Bill becomes law I will not have anything to do with it in any way&mdash;with its administration or with the constitution of the board.  All functions under the Act will then become the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main purpose of the Bill is to terminate the arrangements for tea importation which originated during the war while at the same time providing for a continuance of the policy of direct purchase and importation of the country's tea requirements from the countries in which the tea is grown. That policy of direct importation has been operated continuously since early in 1947 by Tea Importers, Limited, a State-sponsored, non-profit-making body established as an emergency measure during the second world war, which is financed by bank accommodation guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tea Importers, Limited, was and is <Col N="248" /> regarded as a purely emergency organisation and it was always my intention, as soon as circumstances permitted, to replace that temporary arrangement by a permanent measure, designed to ensure that the business of financing and importing the country's tea requirements would revert to individual merchants engaged in the trade, subject only to compliance with the policy of direct purchase and direct importation.</P>
    <P>I regard it also as a matter of prime importance that the permanent measure should provide that the smaller traders would not be in any more disadvantageous trading position <i>vis-a-vis</i> their richer competitors than was the case before the war when both operated on the London market.  This Bill is the outcome of discussions which were initiated as far back as 1953 with the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association of Ireland, an organisation which is fully representative of the trade. The association are taking steps to form and register a company which will be known as Tea Importers (1958) Limited and the terms of this Bill must be considered in relation to the memorandum and articles of association of that company.</P>
    <P>These documents provide that the new company will have a share capital of £250,000, divided into 100 shares of £2,500 each; one share only may be allotted to each shareholder and a share may not be allotted or transferred to any person unless he is a tea trader, registered under this Bill. These provisions are intended to ensure that the control of the company will be in the hands of Irish nationals. Another provision in the articles of association will restrict the amount of the dividend that may be paid to the shareholders.  That provision is designed to ensure that the company, which will serve both shareholders and non-shareholders, will not have an inducement to overcharge for its services, thus benefiting shareholders by returning the overcharges in the form of dividends to them.</P>
    <P>The articles and memorandum of association can, as Deputies are aware, normally be altered without any difficulty by a majority of the shareholders. <Col N="249" /> In order that the articles of the company to which I have referred may not be changed, it is proposed in the Bill to provide that the articles shall not be altered without the prior permission of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a register of tea traders, and admission to the register will be open to existing tea traders licensed as tea wholesalers under the Tea (Importation and Distribution) Act, 1956.</P>

      <P>About 90, I am told, but of course new entrants may also be registered provided they are Irish nationals and financed from sources within the State.  These provisions rule out the entry here of external wholesale concerns whose trading operations are carried on practically entirely from outside the State and who did not therefore operate a genuine wholesale tea business in this country and who, for that reason, were refused wholesale tea licences in 1947 when the policy of direct purchase and importation was first implemented.  It will not be necessary for a person to register as a tea trader unless he proposes to purchase tea in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It will also be observed that the Bill provides that the proposed company will act as an importing agent for any registered tea trader whether or not he is a shareholder of the company. The purpose of that provision is to safeguard the position of the smaller trader and to ensure that any trader, however small, will have the way open to him to purchase in and import from the producing countries whatever supplies of tea he will need to meet the requirements of his own business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, I think, necessary to say something in justification of maintaining the policy of direct importation and direct purchase in the producing countries.  The first important consideration is that that policy ensures that the trading stocks and the reserve stocks of tea are maintained in this country.  It is hardly necessary now to <Col N="250" /> go back over past history in that regard, but our situation during the war would have been a great deal easier if the normal trading stocks and any exceptional reserve stocks of tea had been within our jurisdiction instead of outside it.  Neither is it necessary to speculate on the prospects of the possibility of international conditions arising in the early future which would make it important for us to have these trading and reserve stocks within the country.  However, I am sure we would all feel a great deal easier in that regard if these stocks were normally held here.  Secondly, this policy of direct purchase retains for this country a very valuable handling trade, a trade which exceeds £5,000,000 a year in value, which was for such a very long time enjoyed in London.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the value of the trade in tea which this country engages in.</P>

      <P>The handling trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Thirdly, there is the question of employment.  Apart from the fairly considerable employment which is given by individual wholesalers in the process of opening, blending and packing teas in this country, there is also appreciable employment given in the storage and in the handling of the country's tea stocks.  That is mainly done in Dublin and the stocks are usually carried in the warehouses of the Dublin Port and Docks Board and I understand the number of workers employed by the board on that work averages 50 or 60 for the year and rises sometimes to over 100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, there is the important consideration that direct importation is advantageous to Irish insurance companies to which have been entrusted both the marine and general <Col N="251" /> insurance of the teas in transit as well as the insurance of stocks.  There is no statutory obligation contemplated in that regard but may I express the hope that the new company and individual importers will continue to place insurance business of that kind within the country?</P>
    <P>In recommending the Bill I feel I should stress confidence that the Irish tea trade, which is comprised of merchants of long and varied experience, can buy tea in the countries in which it is produced as advantageously as brokers of any other country.  In fact, the experience of Tea Importers, Limited, over a very long period has shown that the average landed costs at Dublin of teas purchased by that company and imported direct by them from the different producing countries compare very favourably with the average cost of teas imported into Great Britain during the same years.</P>
    <P>It is well known that a great many traders in various commodities operating in this country tend to import their supplies exclusively through external agents or middlemen and a similar tendency is noticeable in the case of many of our exporters.  The Department of Industry and Commerce has for a long time been trying to correct and eradicate that tendency. It is very desirable on various grounds that the business community should establish direct relations with their ultimate exporters in other countries unless there are very compelling reasons to the contrary.  In my view, there is no sufficient reason why our tea requirements should not be purchased and imported direct from the countries in which the tea is grown.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that this Bill was prepared in consultation and agreement with the Tea Wholesalers' Association. In the course of discussions with the association it was stated that many traders would not have the resources to enable them to operate the policy of direct importation because of the seasonal nature of the Indian tea market, and Deputies will be aware that the bulk of our requirements of tea are drawn from India.  The seasonal <Col N="252" /> character of that market involves purchasing and importing a whole year's requirements in a period of four or five months and the consequent holding within this country of very much larger stocks than was the case when the stocks were held in London and purchases were made on a day to day or week to week basis from there.</P>
    <P>To overcome that difficulty and in order also to ensure that the maximum banking accommodation would be available to the tea trade, the association proposed that this limited company with sole import rights should be formed, the effective control of which would be in the hands of Irish nationals.  The new company will be financed by the tea trade and will act as importing agent for each trader who would make the purchase of tea in the producing countries in accordance with the requirements of his own business.  Where necessary, the company will act as a financing agent.</P>
    <P>When the Bill has been enacted, the Government will no longer have any control of any sort over the tea trade, except to ensure that our requirements of tea will continue to be purchased in the countries in which it is grown and that new entrants to the trade will be confined to Irish nationals.  It it intended to wind up, as soon as possible, when the Bill is enacted, the existing State-sponsored body, Tea Importers Limited, which is now responsible for tea importation.  We had discussions with the association as to the possibility of developing here, at some future date, a tea market on the lines of the Mincing Lane market. Such a market could be developed within the provisions of this Bill, but the members of the association tell me it is a matter that will have to be considered over a reasonable period by all the interests which are likely to be affected.</P>
    <P>They have undertaken to keep that long term intention in mind and have assured me that the new company, when it is functioning, will examine, as soon as may be practicable, the question of establishing a tea auction market within the country.  One of the provisions of the Bill authorises the <Col N="253" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce to permit the proposed company to purchase tea elsewhere than in the producing country.  That provision is, I think, necessary to safeguard the supply position in the event of such contingency as a long strike in the producing country, or a threatened emergency situation which might point to the need of building up larger than normal reserve stocks as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I feel that I should not conclude my remarks on this Bill without expressing appreciation of what has been accomplished by both the directors and staff of Tea Importers Ltd. over a number of very difficult years.  Following the reduction&mdash;unheralded and unexpected &mdash;in 1941 in the allocation of tea which was made to this country by the British Ministry of Food, to 25 per cent. of pre-war purchases, Tea Importers Ltd. was formed to seek out supplies of tea to meet our requirements, in India or wherever else they could be procured.  Despite increasing difficulties during these war years, and particularly the very acute problems affecting shipping which arose then, the company succeeded in obtaining from various countries fairly substantial quantities of tea which were used to augment the meagre weekly tea ration of one half-ounce which was the British allocation to us during the emergency years.</P>
    <P>Since the company became responsible in 1947 for purchasing the country's full requirements of tea at origin, their operations have assumed very large dimensions, and, since the abolition of rationing in 1952, their average yearly sales of tea were 24 million pounds weight, to the value of £5½ millions.  In the period since 1947, the company succeeded in providing a continuity of supplies to the trade and to the consumers at reasonable and more or less stable prices, despite the frequent and violent changes in tea prices in world markets during that period.</P>
    <P>I am very sensible of the fact that the services which the directors of that company gave, and gave on an entirely voluntary basis, for a period of seven years, must have contributed substantially to the successful conducting <Col N="254" /> of the company's affairs.  It is intended that the new arrangements for purchasing and importing tea will come into operation on 1st July next.  I have dealt with the fact that the Bill which my predecessor presented to the Dáil in 1956, the Tea (Importation and Distribution) Act, 1956, which gives statutory effect to the present temporary arrangement, is due to expire on 31st March.  It would be undesirable to have a period of three months during which there would be no control on the import of tea.  Consequently, I have arranged to bring to the Dáil next week a Bill to continue the present temporary legislation in the 1956 Act, until 30th June, for a period of three months.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is necessary or possible to say anything further regarding the provisions of this Bill at this stage.  I think it is necessary to get our tea imports on a proper basis and I think this Bill provides for the best arrangement in our circumstances. Consequently, I would ask the House to give it favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have given this Bill very careful consideration.  We are utterly opposed to it.  From our experience, particularly over the last ten years, we regard this as a Bill designed to secure for our people poor tea at high prices, as opposed to free trade in tea which I believe would secure for our people, as it did in the past, good tea at relatively low prices.  I listened carefully to the Minister's speech and I wondered why are we departing from the well-established practice that has obtained in this country for over a century&mdash;that if a grocer set up in business in town or city, he could buy for his customers the best tea at the lowest price that he could get anywhere. He was free to buy his tea in Calcutta, or in London, in Amsterdam, Dublin or Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking from my own experience, I have bought tea and blended tea, some of which was bought in London, some in Dublin and some in Cork.  I have never bought tea in Calcutta. Why did I not buy tea in Calcutta? Because I could not afford it and that goes for 90 per cent. of the people <Col N="255" /> engaged in the tea trade in this country.  To buy in Calcutta, you must buy in quantity, which no ordinary tea wholesaler in this country would contemplate because of the warehousing and financing.  Let us pause for a moment and think what we are doing.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells me that at present there are 90 members of the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association. There is no reason why others should not join, but, presumably, anybody eligible to join has joined already.  I want to tell the House that of those 90 members of the wholesalers' association, I do not believe 20 would be in a position to import tea direct from Calcutta, Djakarta or Colombo.  What is ultimately going to happen?  The Bill does not provide this, but I am not interested in theoretical speculation of what the Bill hopes to achieve. I am interested in the pragmatic considerations of what my experience teaches me is going to happen under the Bill, or any other Bill designed to achieve the purpose which the Minister has in mind.</P>
    <P>Not more than 20 will engage in this operation of direct importation from the Orient.  Pause and think what that means.  There are 24,000,000 lb. of tea on an average coming into this country.  When you have been 25 years in the trade you may aspire to value any sample of tea down to 1d. per lb.; but, no matter how skilled you are, it is a pretty skilful operator who will value tea accurately to within 2d. per lb.  The average customer, buying tea per lb., will find it very difficult to differentiate between two samples offered to him at a difference of 4d. per lb.  Every 1d. per lb. means £100,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the average cost of tea landed in Ireland and said it compared favourably with the average cost of tea landed in Great Britain.  Anybody who knows anything about the tea trade knows that figure is utterly illusory because it has no significance if you do not know the quality of the tea delivered to Great Britain and Ireland, and every penny that is charged for tea in excess of its true value represents £100,000.  You <Col N="256" /> are going to commit into the hands of a body of persons of less than 20, in my judgement, the possibility of handling excess profits of anything from £100,000 to £400,000 per annum, levied on the tea of this country.</P>
    <P>How are you going to avoid that? There is only one way to avoid it. This group of gentlemen wants to buy tea from Calcutta.  Certainly, let them have every facility they want, but let the rest of us buy our tea from them or from anybody else we choose.  The only way we can ensure that the consuming public in Ireland will get value for their money in tea is to ensure that the enterprising tea retailers of this country can apply to Dublin, Cork or London wholesalers, or any other source, for samples and use their own judgement to choose from those samples those which will result in the best value in blend that can be offered to their customers&mdash;the best value that their money is fit to buy.  Unless we do that we are simply going to levy on the people of this country what, in the old days, used to be described in this House as a hard tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister will remember that in pre-war days we used to look on the taxation of tea and sugar, which in those days were a favourite source of raising revenue, as hard taxes, as opposed to the taxes levied on spirits and beer which were not regarded as essential commodities.  In Ireland we always regarded a tax on tea as a hard tax because it was a tax on the poor. Everybody in the country drinks tea and every penny that goes on the price of tea is paid by the people, irrespective of whether they are well-to-do or poor.  Therefore, I submit to the House that, in respect of a commodity like tea, we must do everything we can to ensure that the people will get the best value for their money. What is the best that Dáil Éireann can undertake in that regard?  Nothing. The best Dáil Éireann can do to that end is to get out of the business altogether and let every man operate it as he thinks best, as we have done for a century.</P>
    <P>The Minister says there are various advantages to be derived from this centralisation of tea purchasing.  To set <Col N="257" /> against the primary advantages to which he referred, I instanced bad tea at high prices.  I ask Deputies, whatever side they may sit upon, what have they heard from their own neighbours of the class of tea we have been called upon to drink over the past ten years? Nobody will complain of the kind of tea we had to drink during the war. The British gave us about 7,000,000 lbs. a year during the war years and we had to get the balance where we could. We had to take what we could get, what we could fetch and carry ourselves, but since the war was over, what have Deputies heard from their neighbours?  Is it that tea was never worse in quality and the price was never as high?</P>
    <P>I do not expect there is much we could do about the price but we could do a great deal about the quality.  The only way we could have got something done about the quality was to let experienced merchants compete with one another to draw custom.  The sole test of every customer housewife is in the teapot.  She cannot judge it as some of us might by looking at the leaf, smelling the aroma, or applying the test of the tea tasters.  All she can do is go to McInerney's shop on Monday and see afterwards, in the teapot, if she gets good value.  If she does not she will go into Kilduff's and buy there. It is the best judgment in the whole world, that of the experienced housewife brewing tea for her own family in her own teapot.  This Bill stops that because the man who seeks to suit his customers' tastes by searching the wide variety of markets available to him can no longer do so.  He is constrained to deal with this group of importers because there is nobody else with whom he can deal.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that there are 50 to 100 persons employed in warehousing of tea according to the season. I do not know what he means.  There come in annually 200,000 to 240,000 chests of tea.  In the name of Providence, what would 100 men be doing operating on 240,000 chests of tea? Wherever the tea comes from, whether it comes here through London or direct from Djakarta, Colombo, Calcutta or Bombay, it comes in chests and somebody has to handle them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> It is true it all comes in to 18 or 20 wholesalers located in Belfast, Cork, Dublin and Limerick and it is warehoused there.  It used to be warehoused on my premises.  It used to be warehoused in the large tea emporiums in a variety of rural towns.  Is there any special reason why it is advantageous to take what employment there is involved in that away from the country towns and put it in Dublin, when you remember that under the old dispensation the entire financing of £4,000,000 to £6,000,000 involved in the purchase of that tea was provided by the tea merchants of London who gave us four months' credit for tea?</P>
    <P>Now we are all talking about the difficulty of raising finances for urgent and necessary enterprises here.  There is a means by which we got, gladly, an interest free, permanent standing loan from the tea traders of London of from £4,000,000 to £6,000,000.  Just to satisfy this daft desire to deal directly with the Indians, the Ceylonese and the Indonesians, we seem to say we do not want that; that we will finance it, and that that £4,000,000 or £6,000,000 will come out of the Irish banks, who have plenty of useful employment for that money without taking that burden of credit off the back of the tea trade in London and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks of foreign agents handling tea.  Who will Tea Importers employ in Calcutta to buy for them?  Will they not have agents in Calcutta?  Who will those agents be?  I venture to say that every agent employed to purchase tea in Calcutta, Djakarta and Colombo will be agents whose head offices are in Mincing Lane.  There is nobody else.  The men who have been doing this trade down the ages are the agents who operate in these centres, 90 per cent. of whom are British agents.  They are the kind of men who understand the tea trade in these two islands.</P>
    <P>I have great affection for the Indian people and for the Indian State, but let nobody rest under the illusion that our zeal to buy direct from Calcutta evoked any corresponding gesture from the Indian Government, because the Indian Government put a substantial export tax on tea.  Nobody ever <Col N="259" /> suggested that they should forgo a couple of pence per lb. of their tax because of our buying of tea direct from Calcutta.  We paid the last farthing the same as everybody else.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with one thing only, that is, to ensure that the average woman&mdash;down the country particularly, because those are the conditions I best understand&mdash;will get the best tea for the least money.  I am certain that this Bill will result in her getting relatively bad tea for dear money.  Secondly, I see no reason for taking away the employment that was available in the handling of tea in rural areas and concentrating that employment in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  Thirdly, I am utterly at a loss to understand how anyone believes it is to our advantage to give up the £4,000,000 to £6,000,000 worth of free credit that we enjoyed from the tea market in London and require our own banks to provide it, bearing especially in mind that, under the Minister's plan, we will have to carry the tea for 12 months and finance it for all the time it is lying in our warehouses.  As the Minister rightly said, the bulk of tea is bought between September and January and is warehoused here for the remainder of the year until it passes into consumption.</P>
    <P>These things are extremely difficult adequately to debate in Dáil Éireann because those of us who are intimately familiar with them are inclined to forget that some of our colleagues do not know how the business operates at all.  I make no apology for explaining my opposition and our opposition to this Bill, and for recapitulating shortly to the House what the system of purchasing tea was prior to the emergency scheme brought in and which is to be given permanent form under this Bill.  I refer to the centralisation of buying through Tea Importers, Ltd.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1939, any grocer in rural Ireland of good credit standing received on his premises from 24th August to the end of the year two or three travellers per week who came in with their cases of samples of the new season's tea.  They submitted those <Col N="260" /> samples and were further eager to receive an invitation to send on samples from London of the stocks they were in a position to offer.  Every experienced tea buyer in rural Ireland would have five or six tea merchants with whom he habitually dealt.  It might be that there would be a couple in Dublin, a couple in Cork and four or six in London.  He knew what he wanted whether it was Assam, Darjeeling, Ceylon or Southern Indian tea. He knew the variety of tea he wanted; he knew approximately the quality of tea he wanted; and he would send a postcard to various suppliers asking them to submit samples of a certain kind within a certain price range.  The subdivisions were innumerable.  In Indian tea you had Pekoe, Orange Pekoe, Broken Orange Pekoe, Golden Pekoe, Fannings, and there were three or four other varieties of tea.  Remember that was in respect of each district.</P>
    <P>Those samples were submitted.  I have often had 200 samples set out on my table, and I was dealing with a microscopic business compared with other businesses.  I then proceeded to eliminate the manifestly least satisfactory samples.  When you had reduced the samples to manageable proportions, you took each section and you spent one day tasting to the best of your ability the samples in that section, comparing one with the other. You might buy 20 chests in London. On the next day, in the next section, you might find yourself buying 30 chests in Dublin.  The following day, if you were dealing with Darjeeling, you might buy in London again.  You bought wherever you got the best value, both in quality and in cost.  In due course, that tea was delivered to you from wherever it was warehoused. If it was delivered to you on 1st April, you were not asked to pay for it until 1st October.  Those were the terms of the trade.</P>
    <P>Under this arrangement, every tea buyer in Ireland will have 90 per cent. of that discretion withdrawn from him. Instead of examining the values of 200 samples, he will find himself comparing the values of perhaps ten or 11. Why?  What is the object of this procedure? <Col N="261" /> I cannot too strongly emphasise this and it must be borne in mind.  I am not making the case that a group of wholesalers should be prevented from combining to import from Calcutta.  Let them; I have no desire to interfere with them.  All I am asking is that those of us who cannot afford to participate in the import from Calcutta will be allowed to import from wherever else we can get the best value for the least money.</P>
    <P>Why are we trying to restrict everybody else?  I do not believe that a single one of the benefits which the Minister has read out as justification for this is really sustainable on close examination.  I do not know what he means when he says that considerable revenue can be derived from handling this tea in Ireland.  Will not 24 million lbs. of tea be handled whatever way it comes in?  You cannot distribute it if you do not handle it.</P>
    <P>I am sometimes bewildered by the way men's minds work.  I have been a free trader all my life and there was many a day when I felt I was the only free trader in Dáil Éireann.  Now everbody is talking about galloping into the Free Trade Area without even knowing what it is all about.  It is the red herring of public life to-day.  If you meet an unemployed man, you say to him: Think of the Free Trade Area; if you meet a man emigrating to Nagasaki, New York or Peru, you tell him we are going into the Free Trade Area. It is the universal alibi which Fianna Fáil has evolved.  At the same moment as we are being exhorted to romp into the Free Trade Area, where there will be a free for all, we are introducing a Bill where there will be no free trade in tea.</P>
    <P>How do you reconcile these things? If the whole future of Ireland is bound up with the success with which we enter into the Free Trade Area, what is the meaning of bringing in a Bill to withdraw freedom of trade in tea, which is a very modest and restricted claim?  Why are we legislating to prohibit any shopkeeper in Ireland from buying tea where he can get it cheapest and best?  Is there anyone who can tell me why?  What are we going to get out of it?  The Minister <Col N="262" /> is human.  None of us will expect him to be angelic, although he claims to have become angelic recently, but one can sympathise with him to a certain extent.  When you think of the circumstances in which the British found themselves during the war, it must be admitted they did not do too badly to send us 7,000,000 lbs. of tea per annum every year of the war.  They carted that half way round the world for us when we were neutral and they were fighting for their lives.  That was not so dusty.  I can sympathise with the Minister's feeling that if we did not have a stock on hands here, we would be dependent on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole difficulty for the past few years here in relation to tea is that it was dusty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is not justification for adopting proposals here such as the Minister puts before us now?  I think it was a reasonable enough attempt to give us tea in the actual emergency that existed then, but I do not think the tea trade had anything to do with it.  I believe it was the British Ministry of Food who made the allocation.  I think it is foolish to carry on a vendetta against the tea trade for some imagined injury they did us during the war.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with the interests of our own people.  I do not care one hoot where anybody buys tea, provided I am certain that those who supply our people with tea across the counter are left free to get for our people the best tea at the lowest money.  The House was shaken to its foundation yesterday when the Minister actually accepted an amendment which, at first glance, he was inclined to reject.  Admittedly, the amendment consisted of the insertion of the one word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; in a Bill.  Here is a matter which I cannot feel involves any great fundamental constitutional principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is directed towards settling a very simple matter&mdash;how we will buy our tea.  I think the case I make is unanswerable.  I would be glad to hear anybody who would argue against it. If the Minister is beginning to suspect that to be so, would there be any <Col N="263" /> chance of his saying that, for an experimental period, he would allow the two systems to work together?  Providentially, the old Act runs out on 31st March.  The Minister says that if this Bill is enacted, it cannot come into operation until 31st July. Would the Minister consider allowing the two systems to operate in parallel for an experimental period and see which works the best, and then come along to the House and say: &ldquo;We have all seen how things worked and we must proceed in accordance with the result of the experimental period&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I am perfectly certain that if that is done, this Bill will be as dead as a dodo.  I think the Minister will admit to me that it is somewhat significant that he is quite determined, so long as this Bill is his baby, to close the gap between 31st March and 31st July in order to prevent the two systems working in parallel.  I think the reason he is concerned to do that is that he knows that if the system envisaged in this Bill were allowed to function parallel with free trading, there would be nobody left but a few wholesalers to defend this device.</P>
    <P>Every penny in the price or in the quality of tea represents £100,000 per annum.  Does this House seriously mean to leave under the uncontrolled control of 15 or 20 people the means to levy anything from £100,000 to £400,000 per annum on the tea-consuming public of Ireland?  If they do, the bulk of that money will be taken from the pockets of the poor, and, though we may have an island of saints and scholars, I doubt if there is any community in the world who would leave to 15 or 20 members of society the right to levy taxes on that scale, without supervision, good, bad or indifferent.  There is no machinery you can set up effectively to supervise that except the housewife's teapot.  There is no expert in the Department of Industry and Commerce or in any Department of State, who can check the quality of tea against the experienced wholesalers who will constitute the importing authority under this Bill. They are the only experts and there is <Col N="264" /> only one censor who can control them, that is, the woman with the teapot.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in the unfortunate&mdash;or, perhaps, fortunate&mdash; position that whatever few points I had to make have already been made by Deputy Dillon in his very exhaustive statement in opposition to this Bill.  If the experience gained since the setting up of Tea Importers Ltd. is to be taken as a guide, there seems to be no difference in a general way between that body and the company now envisaged under this Bill.  Tea dealers are still being refused access to the biggest tea market, and the quality of the tea purchased by that company is likely to be just as bad as it has been, and the price will be just as high as in the past.  But the Irish housewife must put up with it.</P>
      <P>I do not see why full freedom should not be given to tea traders to purchase tea wherever they like, whether it be in London, Amsterdam, Calcutta or elsewhere.  After all, coal merchants may purchase coal anywhere they like in the world, with the result that there is a coal price war now in Cork and in the South which enables people to buy cheap coal.  In fact, there is full freedom of action by merchants in connection with the importation of all commodities to purchase in the best markets wherever they like.  I think this Bill is actually contrary to the Constitution because it restricts the freedom of the individual to live and carry on his business to the best advantage. It benefits only the few big operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a tradition in the West and in the South that the women buy only the best tea, and, while I cannot speak <Col N="265" /> for the Midlands and the eastern areas, it may be understood that the principal food of the people is bread, tea and butter, and, as Deputy Dillon said, the woman of the house is the best judge of the tea which will suit herself and her family.</P>
    <P>I presume it was necessary to set up Tea Importers, Limited during the war years and I will admit that the then Minister for Industry and Commerce did a good job to the best of his ability to maintain supplies, bad and all as they were; but now the emergency is over and there should be full freedom of action.  Individual tea traders or wholesalers, or a combination of these, should be allowed to purchase tea wherever they like so that they will obtain the best blend of tea at the lowest possible price.  Only in that way will the consumers and the traders be satisfied.</P>
    <P>If at a future date&mdash;though it does not seem likely for some years to come and we hope it will never come&mdash; another emergency arises, there will always be a Government to ensure, even at short notice, that supplies will be made available.  Even without this Bill, the Minister could have power to ensure that sufficient supplies were kept in reserve in the country to make provision for an emergency.  As the Bill stands I think it is unacceptable to this House and also to the people of the country.</P>

      <P>Deputies Dillon and Palmer admitted that what we have been getting is not of the desired standard.  Everybody has been complaining: many questions have been asked in this House during the ten years since the war ended regarding the quality of tea.  I think we all agree that the quality for the past ten years has deteriorated very considerably compared with that to which we were accustomed in pre-war days.  I do not know what has happened: we <Col N="266" /> might have suspicions that tea, as we know, loses its flavour; it will not hold indefinitely.  We know, too, that certain teas on the market are inferior and perhaps certain gentlemen who are entitled to purchase cheaper quality tea are putting it on the Irish market as good Indian tea.</P>
      <P>I am not so foolish as to think that we have not in this country men of sufficient ability that they could be described as good authorities on the quality of tea.  If I were to produce a dozen or more samples of inferior tea, I doubt very much if I could get Deputy Dillon to purchase it at a high price.  I do not think it would be easy to fool him or fool anybody in the trade.  They know perfectly well whether tea is good or not, when they get a look at it.  I am perfectly happy to believe that the experts who have been in the wholesale trade in this country for years are as good an authority on the quality of tea as any other experts.  Everybody should accept this Bill on the understanding that the position with regard to tea cannot be worse than it has been in this country.</P>

We ought to accept this Bill unanimously and stop grumbling.  If this company fails to give the desired remedy and the good commodity that I anticipate we will get, action can be taken.  I anticipate and am fully confident that our own people, given the necessary authority which this Bill gives them, which will be confined to <Col N="267" /> them absolutely, will bring about a change in the quality of tea which is one of the principal diets of the people of Ireland.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amazing how the Minister has been wedded to creating monopolies throughout his entire administration since he first became a Minister.  He is creating a monopoly in a matter of this kind which concerns every home in the country and acutely concerns the homes of the poor.  In every home, tea is used, but the poor people use nothing but tea, bread and jam and marmalade and butter.  If they had the sense to buy milk, it would be all right, but milk is too dear where there are many children to be fed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second objection to the Bill is that you cannot and will not get the right quality of tea at the right price under this Bill.  The tea trade is a highly technical trade, a trade for specialists and for keen competition. Deputy Dillon said that about ten samples of tea would be sent out by these people.  They would be selected by one man in the employment of this company.  Is he the only expert in tea and in buying tea, the only expert in blending tea to get the quality which suits the water in the various districts? One of the important things about the tea trade in every country is that, owing to the variation of the soils on which tea is grown, some tea does not suit the water in certain districts.  That is a specialised matter.  In this case, you have one company who will pack <Col N="268" /> the tea in packets or in chests and sell it to the merchants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>In my hat.  Tea is used by every home and particularly by the poor.  There are two things involved, as Deputy Dillon said, quality and price.  You cannot get those two things with a central monopolistic body in control.  This is a matter where you want the keenest competition among experts in order to give the public the value they should get.  We will not get it under this Bill.  The housewives and their families have endured enough.  There can be no calculation of the cost of tea.  It is not a question of what they pay for it.  If they got good tea at that price, it would be a different matter.  If any Deputy buys a chest or half a chest of tea and puts it through a sieve, he will be amazed at the amount of dust he will find.  The poor people are paying 7/6 a lb. for that amount of dust.</P>

      <P>That is the problem. The House would be lacking in its duty to the people and to the poor if they did not object to this Bill and reject it.  It will inflict untold hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill can be discussed at great length and Deputy Dillon has elaborated on it, but you cannot and will not get the two essential things with regard to tea, namely, quality and price, under it.  There is no use in Deputies coming back here two to five years hence to say that the people are being robbed in the quality of tea at the prevailing price.  Tea of a good quality can carry a good price, but bad tea is dear at any price, and it is the poor who are affected by that because they cannot afford to buy <Col N="269" /> expensive tea and have to buy at the cheaper price.  There should be competition amongst tea merchants so that the public can get the best quality at the keenest price.</P>
    <P>I regret that at this hour of the day the Minister is adopting this attitude with regard to a commodity that is consumed in every home in the country.  The Minister will regret it, if he is capable of having any regrets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this Bill on the same grounds as those expressed by previous speakers. Although the Minister has tried to deny it, this Bill will have the effect of creating a monopoly.  Tea Importers Limited did have a virtual monopoly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This new company will have a virtual monopoly.  There is no great difference.  In this case, there will be a register of tea traders.  The Minister has mentioned that there will be approximately 90 persons concerned. Among those 90, there will be persons who can command large amounts of money and raise huge loans for the purpose of importing large quantities of tea.  There will be others with very limited resources who will not be able to take advantage of large purchases.  The result is that the new proposal will bring advantage to a very limited number of those 90 persons estimated to be engaged in the tea trade at present.  It will have the effect of creating a vested interest for a small group and, when that position arises, there can be abuses, particularly in the manipulation of tea prices.  Deputy Dillon has mentioned that a penny in the price makes a difference of approximately £100,000.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

In addition, the houses in some cases are constructed by tenants or allottees themselves with financial assistance from the Land Commission.  Since 1945, about 1,800 dwelling-houses and 2,100 out-offices have been erected by or with assistance from the Land Commission. There is no evidence to justify the statement that these buildings were badly constructed.  Complaints received are very few in number and generally relate to minor defects which are remedied by the Land Commission except where it is obvious that they are due to lack of maintenance by the tenants.  I know of only one serious complaint which arose in County Wexford and, in that instance, the materials were supplied during the emergency and proved to be not up to standard.

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether, in the national interest, he will have the Land Acts amended in so far as they concern land division and land resumption, in view <Col N="283" /> of the exploitation of many of the large holdings in the country by foreigners and others; and if he will make a statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Land Commission's powers of acquisition and resumption are concerned the same considerations apply to nonnationals as in the case of native owners.  If a non-national purchases land in this country and fails to use it in a manner suited to national production needs, the existing powers of the Land Commission can be effectively used to acquire the land from him and to apply it towards the relief of congestion. The necessity for amending the Land Acts as suggested by the Deputy does not therefore arise.</P>

      <P>I am quite willing to meet deputations from local authorities on any occasion when there is a prospect that some benefit would accrue from an exchange of views.

The effect of the Minister's action in declining to see representatives of the Kildare County Council has been that 50 men, who would normally be working at present, as they were working last year at this time, are now being sent to the Employment Exchange to draw unemployment benefit, whereas if the Minister had brought this in in a tactful way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is that I cannot possibly agree to the spending of money from grants that are not yet determined and about which I have no authorisation to give to the local authority concerned.  I have not said at any stage that the local authority would be unable to borrow from their own treasurers for this purpose, but I will not go so far as to say that if there are funds so borrowed the amount will be taken out of grants in future years.  I should like further to point out that the unemployment resulting in County Kildare and other counties is the legacy that has resulted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get this across, even if we are to sit until five o'clock <Col N="294" /> this afternoon.  The legacy is resulting from the action that was taken this time last year, in allowing local authorities to spend money in advance of getting their grants and it is accentuated this year because of that &mdash;and that was pointed out by myself over Radio Eireann at that time, before the election.</P>

It is in that respect that the extension of the automatic system has been virtually suspended.  In the light of the capital shortage, schemes for automatic working are now confined broadly to catering for new subscribers in existing automatic areas.  In a few cases, also, we are converting to automatic working manual exchanges which are on the fringe of an automatic area or in which conversion otherwise offers substantial advantage.</P>

    <Title>Tea (Purchase and Importation) Bill, 1957&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the debate before Question Time, I was complaining that this Bill would have the effect of creating a virtual monopoly, replacing an absolute monopoly which existed under Tea Importers Limited.  This provides an opportunity for abuses at the expense of the public and particularly in relation to the poorer section of our people, amongst whom tea and bread are the staple diet.  I feel that there should be free trading in tea and that tea traders should not have to be by registered as they will have to be by this Bill, if they wish to deal in the purchase and importation of tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of free competition because it would ensure a better quality of tea at more competitive prices amongst the traders.  Everybody knows that people deplored the low quality tea which was available during the war years.  It was probably the <Col N="306" /> best available at the time and it was obtainable in very limited quantities; but since the war, and since Tea Importers Limited have been carrying on, the public are complaining very bitterly regarding the inferior tea which is on the market.  There appear to be different grades of tea at different prices, but there is no certainty that the tea which is sold at the dearer prices will be of better quality.  Frequently, a householder who is accustomed to paying a certain price for a certain blend of tea from one week to another, has reason to complain regarding the quality of the tea.  There is an abnormal amount of dust and rubbish in one week's tea compared with another.</P>
    <P>I feel that where a monopoly is concerned, such as this Bill proposes, we will have a situation where the general public will not have the flexibility and freedom in the buying of tea which they would otherwise have amongst various grocers and tea traders.  It is stated that the existing regulations under which Tea Importers Limited ensure the existing supply of tea will expire on 31st March and that the proposals contained in this Bill will not come into effect until 1st July. In the meantime, I feel that some investigation should be made to prove that this Bill is neither justified nor necessary during peacetime.</P>
    <P>We could have an arrangement whereby a State body, such as this, if you wish, could ensure that at a time of emergency or in anticipation of an emergency, a quantity of tea could be purchased for storing, but at a time when we are looking forward to peace rather than war, and planning for peace rather than war, we should give the advantages of peacetime to the purchasing public whereby they will get an opportunity of purchasing their tea from dealers who have got their supplies in ordinary free competition and on the basis of their own business ability to obtain a decent quality of tea at a fair price.</P>
    <P>An example of that is that during the war we had wartime bread and flour.  We had restrictions which applied at that time.  People were obliged to eat a kind of dark coloured bread.  But since the war efforts have <Col N="307" /> been made to improve the quality of bread and flour available to the public. We have not insisted upon the people tolerating a continuance of the rough type of bread which was available during the war but this Bill, which is taking the place of Tea Importers Limited does not in its terms promise to the public that they will be sure of getting a better quality tea than the quality available to them during the last ten years since the war ended.  I think the only function of the Government should be to ensure that adequate tea supplies would be available in the event of an emergency, or during war time, and a monopoly of this character is not justified at present.</P>
    <P>We must consider the people who are interested in getting a decent cup of tea.  Apart from English people, I believe Irish people are the greatest tea drinkers in the world and are most sensitive to the taste and quality of tea.  If I were satisfied this Bill would ensure that there would be a better quality of tea available to the public, I would accept it, but I do not feel there is anything in the Bill which will satisfy the public that the change in this arrangement is going to give a better quality tea to the public at competitive prices.</P>
    <P>There should be free and fair competition amongst traders in the matter of quality and price of tea.  The proposed Bill will cut out that competition and the public, in the main, will be obliged to accept what they get from this combine.  It will be a combine which will be set up by this Bill, a combine on which there will be a register of traders.  It will be confined to those people and they will be obliged to make their purchases as defined by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Individual traders will not be given the opportunity to purchase whenever and wherever they wish.  They must accept the quantity of tea available from the pool which will be purchased through the machinery of this Bill.  I feel there is a move in this Bill to control imports of tea, but why should we control imports of tea? Surely we should permit traders, in the ordinary operation of their business, to import quantities of tea <Col N="308" /> directly from wherever they wish themselves.</P>
    <P>I want to say finally that though the Minister has pointed out that there will be a difference in the working of the machinery which will be set up by this Bill, compared with Tea Importers Limited, I am satisfied in the long run it will become a monopoly, and will perpetuate the system whereby people are being left with a very limited choice.  Though there is a very large number and variety of blends of tea this new combine, naturally, will confine itself to a rather limited number of blends of tea.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy McMenamin say that the tea brewed on water in various districts tastes differently.  That is where the housewife comes in.  She knows what any particular blend of tea will taste like when it is brewed on water in the area where the tea is made.  That is very important.  I believe, under this Bill, the combine which will be set up will not have the local knowledge which the people resident in various areas will have, regarding the taste resulting from the brewing of a certain blend of tea on the water in any particular locality, and that is why I am in favour of giving trading freedom to traders and tea dealers.</P>
    <P>I should like the position to be brought back to that which obtained before it was necessary to bring in regulations during the war.  Everybody who can remember the tea available before the war will remember there was a range of prices, and there was also a better quality of tea available than there has been since the war. Many people are inclined to blame Tea Importers Limited, for the lack of variety in relation to the range of qualities available since the war.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the introduction of a Bill of this nature and allow the restoration of free trading in tea to the position obtaining before the war.  As housewives can remember, very good quality tea was available before the war; if they paid a dearer price they could get a better quality.  Instead of a monopoly we should allow freedom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Deputy Rooney, according to his remarks, misunderstands the purpose of this Bill and misunderstands the new marketing system.  As I see the Bill, it is a piece of legislation designed to promote the organised purchase of tea in the country in which it has grown.  For that purpose it creates a kind of co-operative organisation&mdash;one might even call it a vocational organisation.  I am not terribly impressed by vocational organisations in the sense in which they have been talked about in this country in recent years, but this does promote a co-operative organisation. Anybody who wants to put down their money may buy shares in it and the share dividends are controlled.  Of course, anybody can buy from this organisation without being a shareholder. One can buy any class of tea or quantity one likes.  You place your order with this organisation and they then put through your order to India, a tea-growing country, from which we take virtually 95 per cent. of our tea imports.  The Bill does no more than that.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to describe it as a combine&mdash;a group of people coming together, with the approval of the State, for the purpose of organising the purchase of tea in a tea-growing country and distributing that tea to anybody engaged in the tea trade in this country.  Everybody engaged in the tea trade can register with this body for the purchase of tea, and that body is obliged to put through their orders for purchases.  Deputy Rooney thinks something has happened to the tea plantations since the commencement of the last war.  Tea is an annual crop and all the varieties of tea grown 50 years ago are grown to-day.  In addition, there are new varieties of tea grown to-day, so that the choice is greater than it was ever before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If complaints are made about the quality of tea I think it is due to the fact that, because of the increases in the price of tea in India, the tendency now is to consume the cheaper qualities of tea.  The tea which was sold pre-1939, at pre-1939 prices, is no longer available.  Since then, India has <Col N="310" /> secured her independence and the tea workers are a lot more willing to work than they had been for the miserable pittances for which they were compelled to work by the tea planters in the years before the last war.  They now rightly aspire to a better standard of living; they are able to enforce their claim for a better standard of living.  They feel that an independent India should not mean for them a continuance of the exploitation they suffered at the hands of the tea planters in the days when they were a subjugated nation.  The result is that the growth and handling of tea in India has increased and the remuneration of the workers in the tea trade has also increased; but the costs have increased, too, with the result that the tea now exported from India costs substantially more than it did in prewar days.  But without doubt a tea trader can get any variety of tea he wants, so long as he is prepared to pay the price.</P>
    <P>The opponents of the Bill take the view that it is better to let our tea traders deal in the Mincing Lane market.  I do not agree that they should be allowed to deal in the Mincing Lane market.  What appears to be, on first sight, a simple claim to allow traders to go to the Mincing Lane market is an over-simplification of the whole position.  If traders are allowed to go to the Mincing Lane market, for a time, they may get preferential rates, but only until Mincing Lane is able to kill the notion that this country should buy in the country of origin.  If they succeed in killing that notion, once we are out of the Indian market, they will make up for what they lost in their efforts to wean us away from the Indian market.</P>
    <P>I put this consideration to Deputies who are opposed to this Bill.  Surely it is possible for us to buy tea in the country of origin rather than to buy it from traders who have bought that tea in the country of origin and are trying to make some profit on selling it to us.  These people are living between the producers of tea and the consumers or importers of tea.  They are going to get something for their <Col N="311" /> service and in the past some of them have been able to get substantial sums for that service, which in fact is really unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I cannot see anything in the plea that you can buy cheaper in Mincing Lane, where tea is not grown, than you can buy in the tea plantations or in the tea auctions in India.  It may happen that occasionally you can get a package of tea in Mincing Lane or in Amsterdam cheaper than at the auctions in India.  That is due to the fact that it is the previous year's crop or that it is an inferior grade that somebody has too much of, that he wants to cut down on that grade so he can release his money and buy another grade for which there is greater demand.</P>
    <P>But are there not obvious advantages in buying in the country of origin?  If we continue to buy tea in Mincing Lane, then Mincing Lane will buy the tea for us in India.  Mincing Lane and those associated with it will place the insurance on the freight from the tea auctions in India to London.  They will get the insurance from London to Dublin as well.  They will charge for the storage of the tea in the London warehouses.  They will probably make up the tea in packages, buy the packaging in England and English workers will be employed in packaging the tea.  In addition, the blending of the tea will be done in England instead of here.</P>
    <P>When buying the tea in India gives the opportunity of carrying the transit insurance to our own insurance companies, provides employment by blending it here, provides employment by opening it here, provides employment by packaging it, provides employment by ordering the packaging here, provides employment by storing it in warehouses here, I cannot see why we should not do something which would keep all that work here, as it will be kept under this Bill.  Whereas, if you continue to buy in Mincing Lane, all that work will be done in England and we will have the privilege of paying for that work which is done in England and of being charged a higher price for the tea which we buy from Mincing Lane.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> I do not know how the opponents of this Bill can argue against that contention. I think it is sound business to organise the purchase of tea on the Indian market where the tea is available. The very fact that such a valuable amount of employment is provided in the opening, blending, packaging and storage of tea here ought to encourage us to arrange our tea purchases in such a way that that employment will be provided for our own people here.</P>
    <P>At the moment the Dublin Port and Docks Board is warehousing about 120,000 chests of tea.  Probably 50, 60, 70 and sometimes up to 100 people will be employed, according to the season, in packing the tea, storing it and handling it generally.  If you allow people to buy in Mincing Lane, then the bulk of that work will be done in London and the Irish tea consumer will pay for its being done there because the London merchants will not do that free of charge when they can recoup themselves by higher prices for tea.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am in favour of this Bill, not just on sentimental grounds at all. I think it is a sensible Bill.  I introduced a Bill in 1956 to continue Tea Importers Ltd. until such time as we had worked out a scheme of this kind for the purchase of tea.  This is the type of Bill which I discussed at the time.  This is the type of Bill which I intended to introduce at the time.  It is not a question of sentiment, a question of prejudice against Mincing Lane, or anything like that.  It seems to me to be a sensible arrangement to purchase tea in the country of origin and therefore I am strongly in favour of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any arguments against the Bill.  I certainly cannot see any arguments against it from the point of view of the Irish tea trader.  I could see arguments against it, if I wanted to see them, from the point of view of the manufacturers' agents and from the point of view of the person who wants to sit in an office in Dublin with his telephone, take an order for tea, ring up his parent company in London and say, &ldquo;Send a certain quantity of tea to Mr. X&rdquo;, any place along the western seaboard.  I cannot see the <Col N="313" /> consumer objecting to a Bill of this kind, nor can I see any objection coming from a responsible tea trader here. I think the Bill has everything to commend it and I do not see any argument against it whatever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this Bill is a very good illustration of the danger of assuming control of any commodity.  I do not think it is being considered as a Party measure in any way, but I think it does illustrate what happens when the State decides to act as a grandmother, if you like, and to assume responsibilities which are not the normal responsibility of a Government. Tea Importers Limited, was set up at a time of emergency when there was no other way in which we could get an adequate supply of tea. During those initial years and during the emergency period generally, the directors and staff of that company did a magnificent job, every bit as good as anybody could have hoped for and possibly better than many believed possible.  The situation now is that in certain quarters&mdash;I am not quite sure what the quarters are&mdash;there is a feeling gaining ground that once you let control off, some frightful disaster will take place, quite ignoring the fact that for literally hundreds of years before 1939, there was no control over the import of tea into this country and everything went on reasonably well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not keen on restrictive trade practices.  I believe that this restriction on entering into the tea trade is a restrictive trade practice.  I am not keen either on centralised buying of supplies by those who are not directly responsible for selling them to the consumer.  I do not believe centralised buying will ever be properly done because the real incentive to good buying is the knowledge that whatever you buy, you yourself will have to sell. You know your customers.  You know what your customers want, and, consequently, you only buy what your customers want; but once you set up a virtual monopoly in respect of the import of tea by a company which does not only act as an importing agent but also as a buyer in its own right, I am afraid you will find that <Col N="314" /> the standard of selective buying will drop.</P>
    <P>I do not think we need consider our neighbours at all in this case.  We have to consider only our own larder and our own experience that the present standard of tea in the Twenty-Six Counties is bad.  Those of us who travel frequently across the Border know that, immediately you cross the Border, you notice a higher quality of tea.  I regard that as being due to the fact that the tea trade is open.  It is highly competitive and people buy only the sort of tea which their customers want to drink.</P>
    <P>This Bill appears to me to be planning for another emergency.  I can see that it might be wise to reserve the power to bring it in at a later date, but at the moment I am open to conviction on the point.  I do not see the necessity for it.  I would ask the Minister to consider deferring the date of the implementation of this Bill.  I would very much like to see what would happen if the previous Act were allowed to lapse and this Bill was not brought forward to take its place. Even if free trading in the tea business were allowed for a period of six to 12 months, I might then be more convinced than I am at the moment of the necessity for it.  I hope the Minister will at least consider letting us try free trading for a limited period before going further with this Bill.</P>
    <P>I maintain that the best control of price and quality is free choice in an open market.  The consumer has not got free choice in an open market at present.  I am afraid that Tea Importers Limited are losing the good reputation which they built up during the emergency period.  To be quite frank, I am not frightened about the bogey of Mincing Lane which Deputy Norton apparently is so greatly concerned about.  I do not know anything about the tea market and I am speaking, therefore, completely without the knowledge which possibly Deputy Norton has, but I cannot believe that there is anything sinister about the activities of the market in London. Even if there is something sinister there, surely our own traders are perfectly able on their own, without <Col N="315" /> Government support, to enter into direct trading negotiations with the country of origin if they wish to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton describes the proposed company of Tea Importers (1958) Limited as a sort of co-operative society.  I must say that I see no evidence of that in the Bill, as it is before us now.  Deputy Norton says that anyone can join this company, can buy shares in the company, but there is nothing in the Bill that I can see to show that.  Possibly the Minister can help us in that when he is concluding, but I cannot see anything to show that the shares will be put on the open market and that anyone who wishes to join this company as a shareholder can do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>He may, but at the same time this company may buy on its own. I am concerned about the trend of legislation of the State interfering in trade and in business, because I do not believe that has been proved successful. There are exceptions, such as the sugar company, where there was not an existing company, but State interference in an existing trade organisation has not, to my mind, proved successful in this country, Great Britain or in any other country abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Civil Service organisation, set-up and approach is completely inappropriate for a trading organisation.  Again, I am open to conviction on this matter, but I would feel that Tea Importers (1958) Limited would become and would act very much more like a Civil Service department than a co-operative society or a normal limited liability company.  If it is so good to buy in the country of origin, I cannot see why our tea importers are not doing it already, or would not be <Col N="316" /> prepared to do it, if they are given the freedom to do it and if it is as good a thing as Deputy Norton says it is. If it is as good a thing as he says it is, I assume the tea traders will do it on their own.</P>
    <P>I also assume&mdash;and I think rightly&mdash; that tea importers or wholesalers are very concerned about price.  All business people will agree that if you can reduce your price, you should be able to increase your turnover. Business people are always accused of keeping up prices artificially.  That is nonsense.  Any business man who has any business ability will cut his price to the minimum, not out of sheer goodwill towards his customers&mdash;I say that because of the smile on Deputy Larkin's face&mdash;but because it is good business to cut prices to the lowest level in the hope of increasing turnover. The wholesalers, the importers or whoever they may be, are the people, therefore, most concerned about the price.  They are the people most concerned about turnover because they are the people most concerned about their own profits.  They believe, as any businessman believes, that the secret of good business is maximum turnover.</P>
    <P>I am speaking with hardly any preparation on this Bill because this is a matter into which I have made very little inquiry up to now but, in general, I am concerned about it because it seems to me that we are getting State interference in business which will be very hard to relax subsequently and which may be good or may be bad.  I would much prefer if possible that we should try free open trading in the tea market; let our own people do their job and see what happens.  It will be time enough then to implement this Bill if we find that the quality of tea is deteriorating or that the price of tea is going up without proper justification. But interference in ordinary business transactions like this is to my mind very dangerous and something which I cannot see to be fully justified at the moment.  I am sure the Minister will deal with the point and I look forward to hearing him further on it but I am not yet convinced that it is necessary and I would ask him to <Col N="317" /> consider seriously having a trial period of free trade to see whether we get better and cheaper tea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not absolutely certain that the provisions of this Bill are justified.  Certainly from what I know up to the present, I do not know that it will be desirable from the consumers' point of view, and I should like to discuss the matter from that point of view.  I am one of the few speakers concerned, not with the trade or the wholesaler, but simply with the consumer.  Certainly there has been no public demand for this Bill that I am aware of.  The Minister may be aware of it.</P>
      <P>I want to make clear that I am completely opposed to the suggestion that we should be restricted in any way in buying our tea in Mincing Lane.  I completely approve of the suggestion that we should buy our tea in the country of origin.  That is such an obvious thing that it hardly seems to need defence: it should be clear that the more people there are handling the tea between the country of origin and the consumer the more the consumer will pay.  That is the real point.</P>
      <P>It is of no use for Deputy Booth to say that our buyers will not buy in Mincing Lane unless they can get a better price.  Of course they can afford to buy in Mincing Lane if they can pass on the unnecessarily high price to the consumer which is what they have done in the past.  If, as happens in most cases, the tea trade is riddled with restrictive practices and monopolies of all kinds it is clear the consumer has no choice but to buy from a central wholesaler who sells through the retailers and as we know, if you go into different shops you will still pay the same price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The important thing is that the consumer pays in the end.  On the general principle of winding up Tea Importers Limited, I should like the Minister to throw some light on this point.  Tea Importers Limited, is a State company established in 1941 under very difficult conditions when Mincing Lane or the British Government, <Col N="318" /> or whoever it was, cut our supplies to 25 per cent. of the pre-war total.  Tea Importers Limited came into the market after a time and I would like to draw the attention of the House to the remarkably fine job which this State company has done in providing tea at reasonable prices over the years while operating in difficult circumstances.  Nobody will contest that.  We have it on the word of the Minister in his tribute to the company when he said&mdash;and I mention it for Deputy Booth's edification&mdash;that this State company over the years had provided continuity of supplies to the trade and to consumers at reasonable and more or less stable prices, despite fluctuations and frequent and violent changes in world markets.  That is not a bad job for a State company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>They were selling very dearly for a long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason why this company should not be maintained even though it is run, admittedly, by voluntary workers.  I believe they should be paid.  It is a non-profit-making organisation and it has a very big turnover of some £4,500,000 or £5,000,000.</P>
      <P>It seems to me the private wholesaler wants to get his hands on some of that and that is why they are anxious to take it over.  As Deputy Booth told us, these businessmen do not go into business for the love of it but for what they can get out of it.  I believe the wholesalers want to get all they can out of this new company, the establishment of which we are authorising. Subsequently they will be given a complete monopoly.  Deputy Dillon mentioned the numbers involved including 20 or 30 larger importers who will probably control the greater part of this business.  At the moment we have the position in which a non-profit-making company is controlling the tea industry.  We have a number of businessmen who intend to make a profit on the importing business and it would seem, because of the cost of maintaining business organisations, that any profit they choose to make will be added on to the price of tea to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what I am concerned with.  I <Col N="319" /> do not see the advantages of what the Minister has decided to do.  It may be said we already have a monopoly but it is a State monopoly and the virtue of that is that any profit goes towards reducing the price to the consumers and not towards feathering the nests of a small group of wealthy men.  It is a very good general principle that if a profit is to be made it should be spent in trying to reduce the cost as much as possible to the consumers.  I do not have to defend the merits of State enterprise to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the face of attacks made on it by Deputy Booth. We have the magnificent examples, most of them attributable to the Minister during his time in office, of Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, the E.S.B., Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and Irish Steel Holdings&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a wonder the Deputy did not remember that when he was attacking the personnel of these bodies earlier this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right.  I am perfectly prepared to deal with it.  It is vitally important that they be properly run, not run subject to patronage and jobbery but competently and efficiently run.  I am interested in the principle of State enterprise being vindicated and it is in that way that it is undermined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to agree with Deputy Norton who suggests that this is one wonderful co-operative of wholesalers. It seems to me that it is sullying the whole conception of the co-operative movement to suggest that a ring, a monopoly, of 90 traders&mdash; somebody talked here about 20 men, but 90 at the very most, according to the Minister&mdash;who will control the main intake for the whole tea trade in this country, to be consumed by the best part of 3,000,000 people, could be called a co-operative organisation.  It is a common or garden trade ring or monopoly to whom we are handing over, lock, stock and barrel, all responsibility for the ultimate price of the consumer's pound of tea.  It seems to me that we are handing it back to a group of people of private enterprise, merchants, traders, whose <Col N="320" /> record in the past was to concentrate all their trade in Mincing Lane and make no attempt to buy in the country of origin.  As far as I am aware, they made no attempt to by-pass Mincing Lane.</P>
    <P>Because of that possibility, likelihood or tendency on the part of these people, could the Minister clarify for me Section 7 (3) (b) and tell me what he means by &ldquo;imports it under and in accordance with an authorisation given by the Minister&rdquo;?  Could the Minister say what conditions he has in mind, under what conditions he would permit imports from countries other than the country of origin?</P>
    <P>Knowing the record of these people in the past in the matter of buying tea, it seems to me that it is very important that it should be made quite clear that only in an exceptional emergency would they be permitted to buy other than in the country of origin because it is clear that, if we do establish a monopoly of private businessmen, if they choose to go to Mincing Lane without a valid reason, we have no control over them whatsoever.  The Minister may suggest that there is some control here but I see none other than a very simple directive that they may not go to anywhere other than the country of origin except in exceptional circumstances of emergency.</P>
    <P>Do we, the consumers or people who represent the consumers, have any say in the company?  Do we have any nominee at all in the company?  It appears to me that in the Bill the company is to be entirely composed of the members of the trade.  Will the Minister take any steps to try to see that the consumer is represented on this board?  Has he a nominee?</P>
    <P>In respect of the tea auction, does he really believe that, although they say that they have accepted as a long-term objective the establishment of an auction mart on the lines of Mincing Lane, that is likely to occur here?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither do I, and I suggest neither does&mdash;however, he can answer for himself.  It seems to me it would be an advantageous thing were it to happen but I gather from <Col N="321" /> the Minister's statement that he could get no undertaking that it would be entertained by the wholesalers in anything but a long-term, rather nebulous sort of way.</P>
      <P>The main point with which I am concerned is, why is the Minister, as it seems to me, back-tracking on an excellent principle?  He had Tea Importers Limited, which has done a really magnificent&mdash;a very good&mdash;job since it was established.  Surely it should be possible to maintain that company, pay its directors and carry on in the way that has been so well justified in respect of other matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that there are two aspects only on which I can speak on this Bill.  First of all, there is the aspect of the ordinary family in the areas with which I am familiar and the areas that I represent. My immediate consideration of the matter is whether this Bill is likely to affect the position of the ordinary Dublin housewife when it comes to purchasing tea.  During the period that Tea Importers Limited operated, they operated as a non-profit-making concern but I do not think that the people engaged in distributing or selling tea to the general public were denied a profit.  Therefore, I do not think there is any substantial change except in so far as this Bill appears to be mainly for the purpose of ensuring, as far as possible, that tea will be purchased directly from the country of origin and that it will be purchased by the company on behalf of recognised and registered tea traders.  I do not think that the purchase of tea in that particular way should reflect an increased price to the consumers just because of that particular operation.  Therefore, on that aspect, I personally feel that this Bill would be a much more desirable way of dealing with the importation and purchase of tea than the line suggested by Deputy Dillon on one side and by Deputy Booth on the other, which would be a complete reversion to the original method of dealing with tea and which I understand consisted to a great extent of purchasing our requirements from the London tea market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second consideration that arises <Col N="322" /> and which, from my point of view, is also important, is whether operating in accordance with the general principles outlined in this Bill will affect the employment of those engaged in the handling, warehousing, sorting, blending and distribution of tea in the country to-day.  It appears to me that the Bill as it stands would give much more protection for continued employment of workers engaged in all aspects of the tea trade in Dublin and Ireland generally than would be afforded if we were to revert to the earlier system whereunder for many years tea was imported almost in packet form.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the Minister power under certain circumstances to relieve the company of the duty of purchasing in the country of origin.  Nevertheless, it aims principally at the importation of tea directly from the country of origin and thereby I trust, would cut out certain middlemen interests that can operate so that buying in a market like Mincing Lane would become the regular practice again.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is given a Second Reading and if the result of the Bill is not to the detriment of those who buy tea or of the ordinary housewife, I certainly would support it.  When I speak of the ordinary housewife, I am not talking of the housewife in the South or West of Ireland, who purchases at all times high grade tea, but of the ordinary housewife in the City of Dublin, particularly the working-class woman, to whom the difference of a copper or two in the price of a quarter of a pound of tea is very important. If their interests are protected by the Bill and if the employment now being afforded to our people is also protected, I would certainly support the Bill as against the point of view expressed by Deputies opposing the Bill to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>If this Bill contained a provision about registered tea drinkers, I would claim to be absolutely qualified, coming from that part of the country where, not alone do we drink the best tea and have always drunk it but drink an awful lot of it. Tea as part of the diet of the people of this country, and a very substantial part of it, particularly of the less well-off <Col N="323" /> sections of our community, is a very vital factor in the economic life of the people and, as such, any legislation purporting to deal with it, either in the manner outlined in this Bill or in any other manner, should be approached on a very broad and essentially non-contentious basis.  It is in that spirit that I get up at this stage to speak to this Bill, not necessarily to oppose it, until such time as I have heard the Minister in reply covering the points that have been raised by the various speakers.</P>
      <P>If I might say so at the outset, I see no reason to quarrel with the principles outlined by Deputy Booth in what must be regarded as a very frank speech on a Second Reading of a Bill introduced by a member of the Government of his own Party.  There is a great deal to be said for that and, while it may not have been his motive or one of the motives underlying the type of speech that he made, I certainly must ascribe to it that sort of motive which is important, that is, approach on a non-contentious basis.</P>
      <P>There are things that require to be known, not alone by the House but by the country at large, before legislation of this kind can be agreed to or proceeded with, not alone in relation to tea but in relation to all or any of the commodities which we have to import from outside countries.  The first objection which I see to this is that competition as we know it in business, in the wholesale distribution of tea, will be eliminated.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Competition is going to be restored.  Every registered tea importer will be entitled to purchase for himself in the country of origin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly, I do not see how, but perhaps at a later stage the Minister may be able to give a fuller and more detailed explanation as to how, under the provisions of this Bill, competition in the wholesale tea trade will be restored.  I will also want to know if the company envisaged <Col N="324" /> in this Bill and the existing tea wholesalers and the persons who qualify under Section 4 will be what might be described as heirs in perpetuity in the wholesale tea trade in this country and, quite frankly, having regard to the definition of the company and the definition of tea traders and registered tea traders, I really do not see where any incentive will be held out to anybody else to enter or to attempt to enter this register under the provisions of Section 4.</P>
      <P>I should like an assurance from the Minister that within the provisions of this Bill it will be impossible to manipulate a price ring.  I want him also to show the necessity for this Bill at all. Why not&mdash;as Deputy Booth has said and as, I think, Deputy Dr. Browne has said&mdash;allow us to revert to what was the position prior to the last war, when certainly I think it will be conceded on all sides that the quality of the tea was better than that which we have now?  I have heard it described in my part of the country as dross and when people refer to it as dross, it is very bad.</P>
      <P>With a company such as is envisaged in this Bill, there will be three types of profits.  There must essentially be three ranges of profits.  There is, first of all, the profits of the company itself. While it can be described as a non-profit making company, there necessarily must be profits to cover their own expenses.  There would then be the profit by the wholesaler on his sale to the retailer; and the profits taken by the retailer on the sale to the consumer.  If the retailer were allowed under this Bill that freedom of action which he had prior to the last war, I cannot see any reason why this margin of profit would not be considerably reduced.  I want to know, too, why this legislation is being confined to tea only.  There are other commodities which we get from outside countries&mdash;coffee, rice, dried fruits, oranges, wines, spirits, timber, cotton piece goods and rayon yarns.  Why are these commodities not being made the subject matter of legislation that restricts their purchase by a company here to their country of origin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does this Bill or any of the provisions <Col N="325" /> of it give any guarantee to the tea drinking population of this country that this company, or the tea traders purchasing through it as their agents, will continue to buy in the best market and at the best possible price?  Will they buy from the best shippers?  I understand that the shippers who ship tea have their own relevant recognition value, the same as the shippers who ship wines.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not say, I think, who will select the members of this company. I presume, of course, it will be the Minister.</P>

I cannot see that in the provision of this Bill, though I have been reading it rather assiduously.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> I want to put another objection to the Minister, and I mean it in no offensive way.  There is a phrase of the Minister's well known to all of us&mdash;&ldquo;competition is the only effective control of prices and profits.&rdquo;  How can he reconcile that statement&mdash;that true statement, which I accept fully&mdash;with the provisions of this Bill which he is recommending to the House?</P>

Moreover, in this type of legislation, there is a tendency to damage the integrity of the State itself, because nothing can be more damaging than the suspicion attaching to monopoly. I am satisfied that the principle of monopoly premeates this whole Bill. I am satisfied that price rings are capable of being manipulated within its provisions.  I am satisfied now&mdash; subject to what the Minister has to say and subject to its being cogently said&mdash;that this Bill does not promote competition but will stifle it, and leave us with the kind of tea we are having at the moment, and possibly worse.</P>
