      <P>The purpose of the loan as set out in the statement presented to the Oireachtas in January, 1957, was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To assist in the carrying out by Plaster and Gypsum, Limited, Kingscourt, County Cavan, of the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The purchase of Greenore port and railway station, the transfer of machinery and equipment from the factory of Weatherwell, Limited, at Clondalkin to Greenore, the manufacture of plaster board at Greenore, the development of a gypsum mine at Kingscourt and the provision of working capital.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As it was not feasible to arrange immediately for the transfer of the plaster board manufacture to Greenore, approval was subsequently given for an alteration in the purposes of the guaranteed loan, the effect of which was to delete from the purposes already approved:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the transfer of machinery and equipment from the factory of Weatherwell, Limited, at Clondalkin to Greenore and the manufacture of plaster board at Greenore&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that it is the intention to undertake plaster board manufacture in due course at Greenore, but the Deputy will appreciate that to go into any further detail would involve a disclosure of the affairs of a private commercial <Col N="584" /> concern.

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the terms for the settlement of the recent shipping dispute, which were published in full in the public Press on 20th February, 1958, and which were accepted by the three parties to the dispute.  The terms included specific provisions for (1) the filling of casual vacancies arising while a ship is in port outside Ireland and (2) the due termination of the employment of foreign seamen and others first employed after 1st December, 1957.</P>
      <P>The parties concerned appreciate that a considerable number of Irish seamen obtain employment on ships of other than Irish nationality and that an unduly restrictive policy in regard to the recruitment of crews for Irish ships might have reactions to the detriment of Irish seamen generally.</P>

Particulars of occupants of county homes are not available in the same form in respect of any subsequent date, but the following are the numbers of persons resident in county homes on 22nd February, 1958 (unmarried mothers and children as on 30th September, 1957) classified in the manner in which the information is available:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Included under the heading &ldquo;aged and infirm, other than chronic sick or mentally defective&rdquo; are 404 persons accommodated in special homes for old people established in Dublin during the past four years in pursuance of a programme for the transfer to more suitable accommodation of old people <Col N="590" /> formerly accommodated in St. Kevin's Hospitals.  Under the same programme separate accommodation has been provided for &ldquo;casuals&rdquo; who were also formerly accommodated in St. Kevin's Hospitals.</P>
    <P>The great majority of the persons described as &ldquo;mentally infirm and defective&rdquo; are senile persons or mental defectives above the age for which accommodation in special institutions for mental defectives would be suitable.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that the number of unmarried mothers in county homes is now less than a quarter of the number in 1950 and that the number of children is only about 30 per cent. of the number in 1950.  This is in accordance with the policy set out in the White Paper.  Efforts to reduce these numbers still further are continuing.  A considerable number of the children were only temporarily accommodated in county homes pending boarding out or transfer to more suitable institutions.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state, arising out of the Report on County Homes, 1951, (a) the number and names of those local authorities which have submitted detailed proposals to deal with the segregation of those classes which it was intended should no longer be provided for in county homes, (b) the date on which such proposals were submitted to him and (c) the number of such proposals which have been approved by him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schemes for the improvement or reconstruction <Col N="591" /> of county homes on the lines recommended in the White Paper of 1951 were submitted by virtually every health authority concerned, and various proposals for securing segregation of certain classes were received from a number of such authorities. These proposals in many cases were submitted in sections so that it is not possible, in such cases, to indicate any particular date which might be taken as the date on which comprehensive proposals were received.  Moreover, proposals in some cases were only in the earlier stages while in other cases the proposals were much more developed.</P>
    <P>Only in one such case, that of St. Kevin's Hospital, Dublin, was a completely comprehensive scheme approved and carried through.  In that case two separate institutions were adapted and equipped and provision was made elsewhere for casuals.</P>
    <P>In a number of other instances, adaptations and improvements of greater or lesser extent were approved and carried through, e.g., Limerick City Home and Hospital, Kilkenny County Home.  In another instance, a proposal for the establishment of a separate institution to cater for unmarried mothers and children from a group of counties was approved and carried through.  Apart from St. Kevin's, Dublin, however, no completely comprehensive scheme had been approved before it was necessary, in the summer of 1956, to limit borrowing for such purposes.  Despite this, however, work is in progress or should commence shortly on schemes which, while not comprehensive, will improve conditions considerably in anticipation of more extensive reconstruction, when adequate funds are available later.</P>
    <P>The cost of carrying out a comprehensive scheme of replacement of county homes or their renovation was estimated tentatively at the time of the issue of the White Paper at £5,000,000.  No more reliable up-to-date estimate is available.</P>
    <P>In regard to (c) in Question No. 18, no proposal aimed at improved segregation has been turned down and, apart <Col N="592" /> from specific proposals, developments in other directions have made it possible, as I have indicated in this reply, to improve the position considerably even in the absence of proposals for specific measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, there was a deficit on current account last year of £5.88 million.  Table I of the Tables in connection with the Financial Statement compares the outturn with the budget estimates.  On the revenue side the estimation was close, but expenditure far outran the budget figure.  The Central Fund Services required an additional £610,000, mainly because of higher interest charges on the public debt, but most of the excess expenditure was incurred on the non-capital Supply Services and agricultural subsidies were mainly responsible.</P>
      <P>But for the need to provide for exceptionally heavy losses on the disposal of butter, bacon and wheat, the sum of £950,000 which I set aside last year for unforeseen Supplementary Estimates would nearly have been enough.  The Estimates for 1958-59 should cover the commitments arising in respect of agricultural price supports&mdash;the provision is almost £3 million&mdash;and we may reasonably hope to avoid a repetition of last year's experience in regard to Supplementaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount of savings, specific and general, for which credit was taken at budget time last year was £10.6 million, including £7.1 million on food subsidies.  The savings actually realised came to £9.45 million a sum which, though short of the Estimate by £1.15 million, was in itself substantial.  The shortfall arose on the allowance of £3 million for general overestimation.  Taken as a whole, the specific savings&mdash;on Food Subsidies, <Col N="600" /> the Civil Service, Land Commission, Health Services and Defence&mdash;were realised but this, of course, had the incidental effect of narrowing the field from which general savings could be drawn.</P>
    <P Just="Center">II.  CAPITAL ACCOUNT, 1957-58.</P>
    <P>The outturn on capital account last year is shown in Table II.  It will be seen that the capital requirements of the State and other public authorities came to £36.33 million as compared with the Budget Estimate of £40.99 million.  Housing, sanitary services, hospitals, schools and other building accounted for £15.6 million.</P>
    <P>To the borrowing which the Exchequer had to incur on capital account must be added the deficit which arose on the current budget and a small amount to make good the revenue deficiency involved in accepting National Loan stock in settlement of death duties.  The total amount borrowed was £30.98 million, as against the original Estimate of £31.38 million.</P>
    <P>The sources of this borrowing are set out in Table III.  A sum of £1½ million was obtained from the commercial banks whose deposits increased considerably during the financial year. The remainder was obtained direct from the public in various ways&mdash;by the State through small savings, Exchequer Bills, Prize Bonds, the sale of existing Irish Government securities and the issue of a new National Loan, and by the Electricity Supply Board through a public issue of stock.  The financing of public capital needs was made less difficult last year by the gratifying increase in total savings.</P>
    <P>Prize Bonds continue to be popular. Total net receipts in the year, allowing for encashments, were £6.79 million. The support given to the bonds was not without effect on small savings in the form of Savings Bank deposits and Savings Certificates, the receipt from which was a net £640,000.  There is no way of telling how much went into the bonds which would otherwise have gone into small savings.  It is known, however, that a sum of over £1/2 million already invested in small savings was withdrawn for reinvestment in the bonds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> The traditional forms of small saving suffered also from transfers into the National Loan last November and into the recent public issue by the Electricity Supply Board.  Reinvestment in these issues and withdrawals to purchase Prize Bonds account for the small savings total being so low last year.  Nevertheless, Prize Bonds, Savings Certificates and the Savings Banks between them brought in £7.4 million of new savings.</P>
    <P>An innovation since the last Budget was the issue of Exchequer Bills to the public.  The support received in June, 1957, encouraged us to raise the amount of the quarterly issue from the original £2 million to £3 million and we are still experiencing oversubscription. A noteworthy feature of these issues is the close correspondence between the average discount rate and that of British Treasury Bills.  For instance, the average rate for the last issue was £5 11s. 10½d. per cent. as compared with the contemporary Treasury Bill rate of £5 10s. 5½d. per cent.  Apart from the consideration of borrowing successfully at competitive rates for Exchequer purposes, the position is satisfactory also in providing evidence of widespread confidence in the soundness of our financial structure.</P>
    <P>Exchequer Bills, of course, are not a substitute for long-term borrowing. Their main purpose is to tide the Exchequer over seasonal fluctuations in revenue intake.  Their temporary help in financing public investment may be welcomed but, in principle, capital development should be financed on a more long-term basis, principally by way of National Loans and other stock issues.</P>
    <P Just="Center">III. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND.</P>
    <P>Before turning to 1958-59 I should say a few words about the economic background to this year's Budget.</P>
    <P>While the economy is still faced with serious problems, it is stronger now than it was a year ago.  Production is higher both in agriculture and in industry. The national income has gone up in real as well as in money terms.  In the calendar year 1957 a surplus was <Col N="602" /> achieved in the balance of external payments for the first time since 1946. This was the result of a substantial expansion in exports which reached a record total of £131 million.  The principal increases compared with 1956 were in live cattle, meat and other foodstuffs and in manufactured goods, mainly textiles, clothing and vehicles. Imports declined in volume but were slightly greater in value because of higher prices.</P>
    <P>The substantial increase in agricultural exports and the larger acreage under crops point to a significant rise in agricultural output.  Preliminary estimates show an increase of about 10 per cent. in the value and of 3 to 4 per cent. in the volume of gross output. There were marked increases in the output of livestock and livestock products, wheat, barley and beet.</P>
    <P>In the third quarter of 1957 industrial activity began to revive and there was a notable recovery in the closing months of the year.  In manufacturing industries the volume of output in the December quarter was almost 9 per cent. greater than in the corresponding quarter of 1956.  The recovery was most marked in the motor assembly, electrical equipment, fertiliser, footwear and furniture industries.  Production was stimulated both by increased export demand and by higher internal demand resulting from increased incomes, particularly among the farming community.  Industrial employment also recovered somewhat but it is clear that the pace of industrial expansion will need to be quickened considerably.  The unemployment figure is still too high although it is several thousands less than a year ago.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the country's external balance has done much to restore confidence and it provides the firm basis necessary for expansion. Looking to the future, one must recognise, first that the upward trend in exports, which was responsible for last year's favourable outturn, halted towards the end of the year.  The exceptionally heavy sales of cattle last year have made an inroad on saleable stocks.  In the first three months of 1958 cattle exports were over £3 million less than in the corresponding period <Col N="603" /> of 1957.  It must also be noted that imports were restrained for the greater part of 1957 by the restrictive measures introduced in 1956 and by the slackness of business activity generally. They increased, however, towards the end of the year&mdash;following the relaxation of the special import levies and the recovery of industrial production &mdash;and in the six months ended March, 1958, they were over £6 million higher than in the corresponding period a year earlier.  The further increase in industrial activity, for which we hope, will lead to a further rise in imports of raw materials.</P>
    <P>We must be very careful to avoid a return to the conditions of 1955 and 1956 when difficulties in external payments necessitated a series of corrective measures which, though successful in restoring an external balance, reacted unfavourably on employment and production.  Every effort must, therefore, be made to keep all three moving forward together&mdash;production and employment increasing and the balance of payments rising to a higher equilibrium level.  This cannot be achieved unless there is restraint in relation to claims for increased money incomes.  Real incomes can rise only as fast as our national output rises. Fortunately it has been rising well in recent months and this is tending to make good in real terms the increases which have taken place in money incomes.</P>
    <P>An unwelcome factor, however, was the worsening of the terms of trade in 1957.  Import prices increased by 5½ per cent. a against an increase in export prices of less than 2 per cent.  This means that we have to work harder, or more efficiently, even to maintain our standard of living and that the increase in productivity required to improve that standard is all the greater.  A reduction in costs arising from an increase in productive efficiency would improve our competitive power in world markets and enable higher expenditure on imports to be sustained.  We should not deny ourselves this solid advantage by being too quick to press for higher money incomes.  Increased wage and salary costs may result in <Col N="604" /> less employment unless they are offset by greater and more efficient production.</P>
    <P>The primary aim of policy in the present conditions of this country must be to secure as much productive employment as possible while at the same time restraining inflationary forces so as to avoid balance of payments difficulties. Various factors are likely to impose a strain on the balance of payments in the coming year and it is appropriate that financial policy should tend to relieve that strain.  The tax incentives and other aids available for increased production for export, both in industry and in agriculture, will help in that direction; so also will a net reduction in public borrowing.</P>
    <P>There are many grounds for uncertainty about the course of economic affairs over the next year or so.  Not all of these are internal or within our control.  Indeed, one of the major uncertainties is whether the American recession will become any wider or deeper.  It is our earnest hope that it will not.  It will, however, be necessary to watch the balance of payments trend very carefully as the year progresses so that measures may be taken in time to correct any tendency towards an unduly large deficit.  When corrective measures are applied in time they need not be so harsh or cause so much upset to industrial output, trade and employment as when action is delayed until the situation has become critical.</P>
    <P>On the whole, however, there is reason to hope that we may get through 1958-59 without the upturn in production and employment being checked and without any serious setback in external payments.</P>
    <P Just="Center">IV. CURRENT ACCOUNT, 1958-59.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EXPENDITURE.</P>
    <P>Exchequer issues last year for the non-capital Supply Services amounted to £101.26 million.  The Estimates as published for this year total £98.26 million.  Having regard to the limits imposed by statutory and other commitments, the reduction of £3 million indicates some success in curtailing current expenditure.  It was never contemplated that the Exchequer would <Col N="605" /> gain, in full, the cost of the food subsidies because, from the outset, compensatory increases in social assistance were conceded.  At the maximum the net saving by comparison with 1956-57 expenditure would have been £6.5 million.  That it is, in fact, less is due to increased requirements for other services.  Support for agricultural prices alone is estimated this year to cost £2.5 million more than in 1956-57. Córas Iompair Éireann, contributions to loan charges and grants to health authorities are amongst the other heads of increase.  The nature of these items illustrates the difficulty in the way of reducing expenditure.</P>
    <P>In relation to Central Fund Services there is not even the limited scope for reducing expenditure that exists in the case of the Supply Services.  This year the Central Fund Services are estimated to cost £21.1 million, or £1.7 million more than last year.  Over 90 per cent. of the expenditure is required to service the public debt and the recent downturn in interest rates has been allowed for in framing the estimate.  But even if interest rates generally should fall further, there is no early prospect of avoiding an upward trend in the Exchequer charge for the service of debt.  Borrowing for public capital purposes cannot be stopped without also arresting national development.  We can, however, do more than in the past to offset the inevitable increase in interest charges by securing a higher revenue from State assets.  This in turn depends on arranging that a higher proportion of public capital outlay will be of a directly productive character.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REVENUE.</P>
    <P>The figure of £95.78 million which appears in the White Paper as the expected revenue from taxes (other than road tax and special import levy) shows an increase of £1.3 million over the actual revenue in 1957-58.  In comparing the figures it should be borne in mind that the estimate for 1958-59 includes £600,000 from the customs duties which have recently been substituted for special import levies.  As against this, however, I have had to forego revenue of the order of £600,000 because of the reliefs announced in last year's Budget. <Col N="606" /> I have also allowed for revenue balances being reduced to the standard level of £2 million.</P>
    <P>The revenue from road tax is estimated at £5.4 million&mdash;only a little less than the quite exceptional intake of 1957-58, a financial year which benefited from the aftermath of the Suez incident.  The uncertainty about petrol supplies in early 1957 caused many individuals and firms to tax their vehicles only for a quarter, rather than for the usual twelve months.  This left the revenue of the financial year 1956-57 rather light but, when the uncertainty lifted, the receipts of 1957-58 were correspondingly swollen by the taxing of these vehicles for the remaining nine months of the calendar year.  In the current financial year we can expect only a normal intake but it reflects the renewed upward trend in motor vehicle registrations.</P>
    <P>Non-tax revenue admits of close estimation, as the outturn for 1957-58 shows.  The estimate for the current year at £21.825 million is £1½ million more than the actual yield in 1957-58 mainly because increased receipts are expected from State assets, from the Post Office and from the Central Bank.</P>
    <P Just="Center">OPENING GAP.</P>
    <P>We have, therefore, an opening position on current account as follows: tax and non-tax revenue is expected to amount to £123.005 million, whereas estimated current expenditure totals £124.758 million.  The budgetary gap with which I am faced at the outset is, therefore, £1.753 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REMUNERATION.</P>
    <P>I have also to take account of the recent decision regarding pay increases for civil servants and others whose remuneration is borne on public funds. It is not difficult to imagine the problem which faces the Government when it comes to deciding whether a general wage increase in outside occupations should be applied to public employees.  Cognisance must be taken of a number of important points.  On the one hand, it cannot be ignored that the cost of administration is one of the factors tending to raise the level of taxation.  On the other hand, <Col N="607" /> the Government has to ensure that the relationship between the remuneration of persons in State and in outside employment does not get completely out of line&mdash;particularly as the conditions of public employees may be adversely affected by higher costs due to wage increases granted to outside workers.</P>
    <P>When claims for increased pay were presented last autumn it was already clear that the financial position precluded any consideration being given to them in the year 1957-58.  The claims were such as would entail extra taxation on a scale which, if feasible at all, would be gravely harmful to the economy.  In these circumstances the associations representing the Civil Service and the teachers were told that if the claims were pressed to arbitration it would be necessary to move for the rejection by the Dáil of any arbitration award.</P>
    <P>When the budget for this year came to be framed the pattern of increases in outside occupations had become so widely established that I felt bound in equity to see how far, without damage to the economy, I could go to meet the claims of those paid from the Exchequer.  Having carefully studied the financial and economic position, I felt I should, in effect, agree to extend the National Wages Agreement to the arbitrable groups in the civil service and also to teachers, the Garda Síochána and the Army.  The civil service groups concerned have accepted a settlement on this basis, which is being extended to the Garda Síochána and the Army.  I am including the relevant provision for teachers in the budget. The total required is £1,450,000, including roughly £640,000 for the civil service, £350,000 for the three categories of teachers, £165,000 for the Garda Síochána and £190,000 for the Army. The remainder will be available to the Minister for Health to recoup health authorities half the amount of any increased remuneration they may concede.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ADMINISTRATIVE ECONOMY.</P>
    <P>This is the appropriate point at which to mention what has been <Col N="608" /> happening in regard to structural reorganisation and the reduction of posts in the civil service.  I referred last year in my budget statement to an examination which I proposed to have made of the possibility of simplifying the rather elaborate system of civil service grades.  Heads of Departments have before them proposals for a radical alteration in the present structure. Once their views have been received and considered I intend to have the proposed changes discussed under the conciliation machinery for the civil service.  It is, of course, necessary to afford the staff an opportunity of expressing their views on a major change of this kind.  I am confident that substantial progress will be made in this matter during the present financial year.</P>
    <P>With the co-operation of Departments, recruitment has been reduced so that the preliminary figures for serving staff at 1 January, 1958, show a reduction of 400 compared with the previous January.  The filling of vacancies occurring as a result of retirements and deaths is rigorously scrutinised in every instance and no opportunity of suppressing posts is omitted.</P>
    <P>I would like here to express my appreciation of the active co-operation of all grades of the civil service in the pursuit of administrative economy.</P>
    <P>The provision for increased pay adds £1.45 million to my opening deficit, making it £3.203 million.  Faced with this substantial deficit I was compelled to explore the possibility of finding more revenue or reducing expenditure or perhaps of taking a contribution from both.  It will be appreciated that the Estimates were all most carefully examined and in many cases rigorously pruned before they were released for publication.  On re-examination I could find no single item or group of items on which a saving of the required magnitude could be made without undue hardship and serious loss of services.  Neither could I satisfy myself that it would be wise or consistent with our economic objectives to attempt to close the gap by imposing increased taxation.  A net <Col N="609" /> allowance could properly be made for general savings and overestimation&mdash;I will return to this later&mdash;but a large gap would still remain.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SPECIAL IMPORT LEVIES.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances it was necessary to consider the position with regard to the revenue from the special import levies.  It is clear that the levies still play an important part in keeping our external payments in order.  They have a deterrent effect on imports and are conducive to saving.  No less important is their psychological effect.  Their removal would have an influence out of proportion to the direct effect on the particular imports concerned.  The recent review, therefore, is as far as we can safely go for the present in the direction of relaxation.  The assistance which the levies afford in financing the capital programme has already been greatly reduced; the changes made since March of last year have taken away roughly two-thirds of the income of the Capital Fund.  The need to apply the proceeds of the levies to capital purposes is still diminishing. Current savings have been increasing, while public borrowing is being kept in check.  I am satisfied, therefore, that no harm will be done by applying the remaining revenue from the levies to current purposes.  The Finance Bill will contain a clause removing the statutory requirement that the proceeds of the levies be paid into the Capital Fund.  This will increase the current income of the Exchequer by £1.778 million this year, reducing the gap on current account to £1.425 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NET ALLOWANCE FOR OVER-ESTIMATION.</P>
    <P>For a number of years it has been the practice at budget time to make some provision for unforeseen expenditure but, on the other hand, to take credit for general over-estimation.  The credit taken for savings has usually exceeded the allowance made for additional expenditure, with the result that the net deduction from the expenditure <Col N="610" /> side has been as follows in recent budgets:&mdash;</P>

    </table>
    <P>The tendency has been to reduce the credit taken for general over-estimation and to increase the provision for unforeseen expenditure.  Experience underlines the need for a further step in this direction and I do not feel I would be justified this year in making a net deduction of more than £1½ million.</P>
    <P>This leaves a small balance of £75,000.  Every year about this time the Minister for Finance is faced with the rather distressing duty of having to listen to the many groups and organisations who feel that they have a good case for some form of relief under the budget.  Many of them have impressed me with their arguments, supported by figures.  The amount I have to distribute, however, is small, so small that those whose need is substantial in amount have to be passed over&mdash;irrespective of their merits.  Of the many remaining deserving cases I have selected two where, I think, the greatest benefit can be expected from a small amount of relief.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CINEMAS AND PATENT THEATRES.</P>
    <P>First, I feel obliged to do something to help to preserve both the revenue from cinemas and theatres and the employment which they afford.  As in other countries, the cinemas have been suffering from the competition of other ways of enjoying leisure, with the result that attendances have fallen and receipts from entertainments duty are contracting.  Last year's revenue from cinemas was 7½ per cent less than the year before.  The time has come to lighten the tax burden on cinema entertainments but with the limited amount of money available to me this year I can go no further than removing the customs duty on films.  I propose also to give some relief from 1 August next to cine-variety in patent theatres by increasing the entertainments duty rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. These minor concessions will cost a net £50,000 this year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="611" /> EXPORT PROMOTION (WHISKEY).</P>
    <P>The sum of £25,000 which remains ought, I feel, to be applied to increasing the grant-in-aid to Córas Tráchtála Teoranta for the promotion of exports.  The provision for the grant-in-aid to this body has already been increased from £125,000 for 1957-58 to £135,000 for the current year.  The additional amount of £25,000 will enable Córas Tráchtála to expand its activities further and, in particular, to give greater support to the campaign for promoting sales of Irish whiskey abroad.  The distilling industry is an old-established one based almost entirely on native raw materials, and it has a large unrealised export potential.  I hope that the increased provision will prove a good investment, encouraging increased effort on the part of all concerned and leading to a sustained expansion in exports.</P>
    <P>That disposes of the financial aspects of the Current Budget.  It would, of course, have been open to me to propose some increase in indirect taxation in order to give certain reliefs in direct taxation&mdash;particularly in relation to income tax, sur-tax and death duties&mdash; which are all, for different reasons, desirable.  I decided against this course.  For two years in succession increased taxes have been put on tobacco and petrol.  The tax on beer was raised only last year.  The prices of tobacco and beer were increased recently without any benefit to public revenue.  Whiskey will bear no more at present.  Indeed, all the principal players on the customs and excise side need a rest if they are to recover their old vigour and resilience.  After the big changes made in recent years, it is well that increased taxation, for any purpose, should be avoided this year.</P>
    <P>I shall now mention briefly some proposals which do not affect the balance of this year's budget but which will be included in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>NEW OR INCREASED EXPORTS&mdash; EXTENSION OF TAX EXEMPTION.</P>
    <P>To give an added impetus to the expansion of exports and a further encouragement to both home and foreign industrialists to build, extend <Col N="612" /> and equip factories within the next few years to manufacture for export, I propose to lengthen from five to ten years the maximum period of the 100 per cent. tax exemption granted for new or increased exports.  This relief will not, however, be afforded in any case for a year subsequent to 1969-70.</P>
    <P>TAX RELIEF FOR ANNUITY CONTRIBUTIONS BY SELF-EMPLOYED.</P>
    <P>I shall also introduce provisions enabling a self-employed person or a non-pensionable employee to obtain a measure of relief from tax on payments made to secure a life annuity for himself in his old age or to secure, after his death, an annuity to his widow or dependant.  An adjustment of the law as to the assessment of assurance companies will be involved.</P>
    <P Just="Center">OTHER TAX CHANGES.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill will contain a series of sections concerning the treatment, for tax purposes, of husband and wife. To a large extent these will simply codify the law, but there will be new provisions to authorise collection from a wife of tax on her income which was assessed on her husband.</P>
    <P>Tax may be avoided by means of superannuation schemes, the benefits under which are either excessive by generally accepted standards or are given in non-taxable form.  The remedy I propose is that, where a scheme does not satisfy certain conditions, the cost to the employer of providing the benefits will for tax purposes be treated as income of the director or employee.</P>
    <P>Where benefits in kind are given by employers to directors or other employees, tax cannot as a rule be charged upon the recipients, although the employers would normally get relief for the expenditure.  Similarly, where the benefit consists of an excessive expense allowance, it may not be possible to tax the element of disguised remuneration.  I propose to bring in legislation to put these matters right.</P>
    <P>I propose to secure that duty payable in a foreign country on a death, in respect of property situate there, shall not, if double taxation relief arrangements <Col N="613" /> subsist between Ireland and that foreign country, be deductible from the value of the property for purposes of estate duty assessment.</P>
    <P>I propose to abolish as from 1 July next the additional duty chargeable on tobacco dealers' licences under Section 26 of the Finance Act, 1932.  The yield from this duty does not justify the cost of collecting it.</P>
    <P>The six last-mentioned proposals require Financial Resolutions, which I shall move to-day with the resolution regarding the duty on films and the usual income tax and general resolutions.</P>
    <P>When a comprehensive arrangement is entered into with a foreign country for relief of double tax, the only available method of giving it the force of law has been to schedule both it and the requisite technical rules to the next Finance Bill after the conclusion of the arrangement.  I am proposing that the Government should be enabled, subject to the prior approval of Dáil Éireann, to give effect to such arrangements by Order as is done with conventions in relation to profits from the business of sea or air transport.</P>
    <P>Among the other matters to be included in the Finance Bill are provisions to facilitate the collection of tax.</P>
    <P>QUESTION OF SINGLE RETURN FOR INCOME TAX AND SUR-TAX.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been revived in recent years that the same form of return of income should suffice for sur-tax as well as for income tax.  This has been investigated departmentally and I am satisfied that it is feasible only if sur-tax is decentralised&mdash;a matter which is now being considered.</P>
    <P Just="Center">P.A.Y.E.</P>
    <P>I have also had representations for the introduction here of the Pay As You Earn system in relation to income tax.  This is an important matter of considerable administrative complexity on which I await the views and advice of the Income Taxation Commission.  I would prefer not to come to a decision on it at this stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity <Col N="614" /> to thank the members of the Commission, who have undertaken a comprehensive examination of our system of income taxation, a far-reaching task which has not been attempted before and one which must make heavy inroads upon their time.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SHANNON AIRPORT.</P>
    <P>While it will be a matter for a special Bill, I should add that, with a view to encouraging the use of Shannon Airport as an international distributing centre, the Government are considering the complete exemption from taxation for a twenty-five year period of profits derived from new bona fide export businesses using air freight and established within the confines of the Free Airport area.</P>
    <P Just="Center">V. CAPITAL ACCOUNT, 1958-59.</P>
    <P>The particulars of the Capital Budget for 1958-59 in Table IV take into account the decision to apply the special import levies to current purposes. The capital requirements of the State and various public bodies are estimated at £36¼ million which is the same as was actually required last year.  A substantial part of the capital provided in 1957-58 was earmarked to discharge outstanding bank or other indebtedness, much more than is the case this year.  A total of approximately £3 million was needed last year for this purpose by the Electricity Supply Board, Córas Iompair Éireann and local authorities.  The comparable figure this year will not be much more than the £1.4 million which the Industrial Credit Company will use to repay existing overdraft accommodation.  This means that the public capital programme should afford at least the same volume of employment as last year.</P>
    <P>The 1957-58 provision of £14.88 million for local authorities included, moreover, £900,000 for an advance to the Road Fund.  This advance was made to ensure that the maintenance of a satisfactory volume of road works and employment would not be jeopardised by the arrears of payments due to local authorities in respect of previous years.  Because of the upward trend in Road Fund income from motor taxation, it has been possible to <Col N="615" /> make the same grant allocations this year as were made last year without supplementing the resources of the Fund.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Road Fund advance, £13.98 million was provided for local authorities in last year's budget.  This was later increased to allow greater access to finance for housing and schools.  In the event, local authorities found that they did not need to borrow more than £12.85 million and out of this they discharged abnormal bank and other indebtedness of about £1 million.  It will be seen, therefore, that the estimate of £11.49 million for the current year provides for a continuation of local building and kindred activities at roughly last year's level.</P>
    <P>There will, of course, from now on be a tendency for social investment to fall, not because of any curtailment of capital but because the arrears of housing and other social needs are being overtaken.  The housing problem which once appeared almost insoluble is now well on the way to solution. Sanitary services have been greatly improved.  General hospitals are almost adequate to requirements.  Numerous schools have been built or reconditioned&mdash;although admittedly there is much leeway still to be made up.  In addition, there are now ample power resources, the supply of domestic fuel is large and growing, and transport in all forms has been modernised.</P>
    <P>The activity under all these heads in the past has, one might say, laid the basis for positive economic expansion. Some reduction in the scale of investment under many of the heads I have mentioned is inevitable and may be welcomed because of the opportunity it will afford to apply more of our development resources and energies to immediately productive purposes.</P>
    <P>As I said last year, the remedy for the related problems of emigration and unemployment is through the provision of productive occupations.  The approaching satisfaction of social development needs means that more of the nation's savings can be applied to productive development, private and public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> In this budget I have held the line against increased taxation.  I have not, in general, been able to afford reliefs beyond those which came into effect this month as a result of last year's Finance Act.  I have made provision for increased State aid for industrial development so as to facilitate the expansion which the recent taxation reliefs are intended to stimulate.  My intention is that no industrial project with worthwhile prospects, particularly export prospects, should be frustrated by lack of capital.  The substantial provision made for agriculture and for tourist development is apparent from the Estimates Volume.</P>
    <P>I spoke last year of the need to apply our capital resources along lines to be settled after considering the best objective advice available, both from home and extern sources.  Since then, legislative authority to join the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank has been obtained.  We are now members of these bodies.  An International Monetary Fund mission has already visited this country and has been briefed with up-to-date information about our economy.  This information will be available to the World Bank and we have in mind that the Bank, with its expert knowledge and world-wide experience, will give us advice and assistance towards increasing the proportion of directly productive capital expenditure by the State and other public authorities and generally ensuring that our economic development programme is on sound lines.</P>
    <P>The second report of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee, which deals with housing, will shortly be published and I understand that the Committee is now at work on a general report dealing with the principles on which future development should be based.  Apart from this, my Department, with the cooperation of other Government Departments and State bodies, is engaged in a study of how best our economic deficiencies might be remedied and our development opportunities realised.  This study, together with the general report expected from the Capital Investment Advisory Committee, will form the <Col N="617" /> basis of discussions with representatives of the World Bank which will begin in June.</P>
    <P>I think it important that the public should be aware that much constructive thought is being given to ensuring that our plans for national development are realistic and progressive.  I do not wish to be understood as suggesting that a spectacular improvement in our position can be achieved overnight. This is clearly impossible.  At the same time, there is no need for despondency. Our economy is sound and will be developed to yield a steady improvement in national production and employment.</P>

      <P>The manner in which the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance was received by his own Deputies is clearly an indication of the manner in which it will be received by the country to-morrow morning.  I venture to suggest that, with the exception of the <i>Irish Press</i>, nobody could describe this Budget as being anything except unimaginative in the extreme, pedestrian and perhaps even stagnatory.</P>
      <P>There has rarely been an opportunity for a Minister for Finance to plan his internal tax and revenue and expenditure arrangements such as was given on this occasion to the Minister.  No Minister for Finance rising as the Minister for Finance rose to-day to introduce a financial statement was able to do so in the years since the war in the same position as regards our external account.  Every Budget, no matter how small may be its scope for manoeuvre, must, if it is to qualify for the term Budget at all, be an instrument of policy.  It is quite clear that the first consideration we had to give in recent years to policy on financial account had to be in regard to our external balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, the Minister for Finance was in a far more happy situation than any of his predecessors on any side of the House ever were.  He was in that situation, as he himself admitted, not this year but last year, because in the year 1956-57 we balanced on external <Col N="618" /> account and this year we had a surplus.  He was in that situation for one reason and one reason alone, because the Government of which I had the honour to be a member faced up to their responsibilities&mdash;you can laugh because you are getting the benefit now&mdash;and this Government have done nothing whatever to alleviate the position except what has been done in the past year to harm it, as I shall show in a few minutes.</P>
    <P>We realised at that time and we knew absolutely that the measures I took on behalf of the Government would not be popular, but we were prepared, no matter how unpopular they might be, to put the country before the interests of our Party.  The general election came and Fianna Fáil were put in power, and Fianna Fáil in the past 12 months have failed miserably to rise to the occasion of putting the country above Party. Instead, they have put Party before country.</P>
    <P>There was one thing necessary during the past 12 months, once we had achieved the balance we did achieve in 1956-57 on external account.  That was a firm announcement by whoever might be sitting in that seat over there that the measures adopted in 1956 had been successful in achieving their end. If that announcement had been given, then one would have got the resurgence of the confidence that was necessary on all sides to increase production and employment.  But because Fianna Fáil were not prepared to give to their predecessors any credit whatever for those measures, because they preferred to take the narrow Party line of attacking everything that had been done by us, they thought that would bring them some Party advantage, notwithstanding the fact that their action in that regard, and the action particularly of that Front Bench in that regard, has been one of the cogent and compelling reasons why, having achieved a balance on external account, we have not moved forward.  This Minister when he rose to-day had no immediate worries on that front.</P>
    <P>In the Budget speech we have just listened to, the Minister failed to give us any indication of what has been <Col N="619" /> described more than once as the greatest secret of modern times&mdash;the policy of Fianna Fáil.  Last year, and even as late as the Vote on Account, whenever Fianna Fáil were challenged as to policy, we were told it was to produce a balance on current account. The Minister for Finance slid through his report of last year and the manner in which his prognostications and his work for last year failed so miserably. He ended up last year with a balance on the wrong side of £5,882,000.  If all the things that Fianna Fáil say they want to do end as miserably as that, the country will get an adequate opportunity of judging their value as a Government.</P>
    <P>This Budget which has been produced for this coming year is a miserable affair.  It shows no sign of imagination, no sign of appreciation of the internal problems with which we are faced.  It shows no sign of ensuring that there will be that increase in production on the agricultural and industrial fronts which is vitally needed.  It shows no sign of plans for any improvement in the employment situation.  It shows nothing which could in any way ensure that there will be a halting or even a lessening of the drain of the flower of our manhood going away in emigration, as they have gone in the last year.  It does not give the people of this country any ray of hope at all for the future.</P>
    <P>There are three or four fiddling changes and one in regard to which I could imagine the Minister for Health, if I had made it, making the welkin ring.  Time and time again when I was on that side of the House, I was challenged that I proposed to turn the levies from capital account into current account.  I made it clear beyond doubt I would not do so.  I made it clear that I regarded the levies as a means of dealing with a temporary balance of payments difficult situation and that I would not have them turned into the permanent revenue producing law of the country.  My bona fides in that respect were challenged.  It is rather significant that the people who challenged them are the people one of whose first actions was to switch part of the levies and who now have completed that switch in this Budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> Last April, the present Government transferred part of the temporary duties, that should have come off by now having regard to our improved situation on external account, into permanent taxation to the extent of £692,000.  A fortnight ago the Minister continued on the same line and added another £600,000 to the permanent customs duties and now he has added £1,778,000.  Three million pounds of temporary measures for the purpose of achieving a balance in our external payments have now been built by this Government into the permanent tax structure of the country and that from the Government and from the Deputies who before the last general election never lost any opportunity, in private or in public, of talking, as the Minister for External Affairs was so fond of talking, of the 94 taxes that had been put on in those levies.</P>
    <P>Does anyone want to go through the list in the Order that was made the other day, the list of the number of levies that have now been made permanent taxes by Fianna Fáil?  Does anyone want to stand up, as they stood up 14 months ago, and say that these were unjust impositions?  The plain fact of the matter is that in this switch by the Minister to-day he has written another epitaph on the dishonesty of Fianna Fáil during the General Election of 1957.</P>
    <P>Ministers and Deputies over there can laugh.  They know that all they are interested in is getting into their jobs on that side of the House.  They fooled the public and they now laugh cynically and without reason.</P>
    <P>That is not the only aspect in respect of which I would describe this Budget as a complete fraud on what they put to the people last year.  One of the things they said in their official pamphlet issued during one of the elections was this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For this purpose and to provide a stimulus for the recovery and expansion of private business activity Fianna Fáil will increase the amount of capital expenditure by the State and local authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Anyone who cares to look at the tables <Col N="621" /> issued with the Budget this year and the Budget last year can see the manner in which that promise has been kept.  Far from being kept, there is, in fact, a change in the other direction of some £11,000,000 on the face of the table, a figure which requires adjustment in certain respects, but even so it shows a clear repudiation of the promise that was made to the electorate at that time.  This was a promise that was made to the electorate under the photograph of the man who had the impertinence to preach to us some short time ago about honour and honesty in public life.</P>
    <P>So far as the actual small tax changes in this Budget are concerned, they will not achieve anything that will benefit the ordinary people either in employment or anything else.  The changes are so trifling as not really to merit any account.  It would not have been necessary even to do the switch of levy that the Minister indicated if he had been able, for example, to hold his position on last year.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking here on the Vote on Account, I quoted certain figures as to the position of revenue and expenditure on 1st March last. These figures were challenged by the Taoiseach but subsequently it was proved that my figures were right as of the 1st March last.  But the national accounts went wrong during March. Why?  Because the Minister for Finance, in March, 1958, paid out £7.7 million more than was ever paid out in any March in the history of this country.  In the three previous years it always ran round about £18,000,000 in that month.  This year it ran £25.9 million.  If the Minister for Finance had been keeping the proper rein and had been doing his job, we would not have been faced with the deficit at the end of last year with which we were faced and we would have a more satisfactory position in the coming year.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear the Minister for Finance saying that there were some 400 civil servants fewer than last year.  I can tell him where he gets 157 out of that straightway.  He gets it because the new Gaeltacht Company <Col N="622" /> has been set up and because the people working for that company are no longer civil servants in the Book of Estimates.  The matter is dealt with in that book by a Grant-in-Aid to the company.  If the Minister thinks that that is an honest way of redeeming his statement that he would reduce the Civil Service, then I make him a present of his reduction.</P>
    <P>We are in a situation now in which, after 14 months of Fianna Fáil Government, prices have risen substantially as a result of direct governmental action.  We have had an increase in the price of bread, an increase in the price of butter, an increase of nine points, from 135 to 144, in the cost of living.  We have had that even though the Taoiseach, apparently, three or four days before the last February announcement, did not know that the cost of living was increasing.  We have got that in a situation in which the small farmers up and down the country can see for themselves no way of meeting the increases which they have to meet day in and day out.  Instead of being able to see a method of meeting those increases, they are now being asked by this Government to accept less for their wheat, less for their barley, less for their milk and less in other aspects, for example, for pigs.  The action of the Minister for Agriculture in dealing with our pig trade may well mean the disappearance of the item of £4,000,000 odd that there is in the 1957 figures for exports of bacon and ham.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Budget to show that the Minister for Finance appreciates the seriousness of the situation internally or the difficulties with which the people are faced on all sides&mdash;nothing at all, except what Deputy MacEntee, when he was on this side of the House, described as putting one's hand into the till to raid the till money.  That is the high light of a Budget that will get us nowhere and that will merely create despondency instead of enabling our people to go forward with confidence, now that the predecessors of this Government put our accounts properly into external balance.  Let this Government not destroy that balance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why the <Col N="623" /> Minister for Finance went to the trouble of writing this 31 page speech and calling it a Budget document because, in the whole of the 31 pages, there is virtually no change in the position as we see it to-day.  As a document, it is labelled secret and confidential, but it could have been posted on the streets of this city a couple of months ago, so far as its contents and its effects on the ordinary people are concerned.  It is a dreary, colourless Budget and I think the half-hearted applause, which some of the heroes on the Government Benches sought to bestow on it, is a clear indication that, in their minds and hearts, the boys know it is not good stuff for the crossroads and after-Mass meeting.  Will somebody now tell us where is the &ldquo;get-cracking&rdquo; policy which Fianna Fáil had during the last election?  Did anybody ever imagine that &ldquo;get-cracking&rdquo; would be embodied by the Government Front Bench in a miserable, cemetery-like document of that kind?  Is that what &ldquo;get-cracking&rdquo; means when it comes down to dealing with the basic economic problems of the country?</P>
      <P>I could understand this Budget, if it were presented in a country where there was full employment, where there was a scarcity of men for the jobs available and in conditions in which nobody had to leave the country to get work, but this Budget has to be read against a background in which we have an unemployment and emigration problem without parallel in Western Europe to-day.  Can anybody imagine that this sickly document will do anything to arrest the flood tide of emigration?  Can anybody imagine there will be more people in employment during the coming year, when this document is read and when its full import is realised by the people in the next few days?  Why all this complacency about our economic situation? Why all this complacency about the basic difficulties which confront the country to-day and which, in very large measure, have been characteristic of our economic development over the past 35 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have never used our powers of <Col N="624" /> Government to deal seriously with our unemployment problem and to deal seriously with our emigration problem. They are the result of years and years of neglect.  Let us face up to that and take the responsibility for it.  We have to-day an unemployment problem and emigration problem which bears no comparison with the situation in any other democratic country in Europe. Look at the position.  According to the Government figures issued by the office under the control of the Taoiseach, the Central Statistics Office, there were 77,300 people unemployed on 12th April.  It is true that that figure is 4,600 less than on the same date last year, but it is also true, by an examination of passenger movements, that we had more emigration last year than we had in 1956, or even in 1955.  The figure, therefore, has been got down artificially by only 4,600, and was got down because emigration increased substantially during the past year.</P>
    <P>Many of our people who read last year's Budget in Irish papers, in Irish homes, will read it this year in English papers in some part of England because they have been driven out of the country, due to the acute unemployment position which has operated with special force during the past year.  The 1958 figures of 77,300 are, in fact, up by 9,000 on the unemployment figures on the same date in 1956, and this is the Government which was to get cracking! Women were invited to vote Fianna Fáil so as to put their husbands back to work.  They are sadder to-day, but they are wiser to-day. They know they have been spoofed by a Party which has no intention whatsoever, as its actions show, to do anything to relieve this serious unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Look at the employment position in relation to the Government who were to get cracking.  I have before me here the March issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal.</i>  On page 38, there is set out a statement of the numbers of persons employed in manufacturing industries, and engaged in the manufacture of all kinds of transportable goods.  If we take the total figures for the four quarters of 1956 and compare <Col N="625" /> them with the four quarters of 1957, the number of people employed in 1956 was greater than the number employed in 1957.  This is an official publication issued under the authority of the Taoiseach's Department.</P>
    <P>Let us come to prices.  The people will remember the brutal Budget imposed upon them by a Party that promised to maintain food subsidies and control prices.  Again, I quote from an official document to compare the cost-of-living index figures for the four quarters of 1956, when the interParty Government were in office, and the figures for the four quarters of last year.  In 1956, the mid-February cost-of-living index figure was 132.  It was 134 in mid-May, 135 in mid-August and 134 in mid-November.  In other words, over a period of 12 months, the cost-of-living index figure increased by two points in 1956.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at 1957 when our friends had responsibility for Government. The mid-February figure was 135.  It increased to 138 in mid-May, to 143 in mid-August and to 142 in mid-November and is now 144.  The index figure has gone up by nine points in 12 months under Fianna Fáil, as compared with two points when the inter-Party Government were in office and, as everybody knows, price control has been abandoned.  Anybody who wants to charge anything he likes can do so. The Government have washed their hands of price-control.  The Government's general attitude is: &ldquo;You can charge what you like and we are not terribly worried about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us look at the comfortable picture which the Minister for Finance sought to draw on the last page of his speech:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our economy is sound and will be developed to yield a steady improvement in national production and employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have fewer people employed to-day than we had 12 months ago.  There are 40 per cent. fewer people employed building houses to-day than there were 12 months ago.  There are fewer people employed on road works than there were 12 months ago.  Nobody is employed on drainage work under the <Col N="626" /> Local Authorities (Works) Act, where thousands were employed last year.  The number employed on forestry works has been reduced and, to-day, the Minister for Industry and Commerce admitted that the number employed on electrification work is down.  How are we to get steady progress while people who got jobs in these useful activities in the past are not able to get them to-day? I see no justification in the Minister's speech for that statement made against the background of circumstances in which there is a fall in the number of people employed on these schemes of national development.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he felt constrained by the equity of the case to grant increases in pay to the Civil Service, to teachers, Gárda and Army personnel, so as to put them in relatively the same position as workers in outside employment. Those increases are now being awarded, thanks to the action taken by organised workers during the last 12 months.  The organised workers have been able to secure some compensation for the increase in the cost of living imposed upon them by the Budget last year, but when we come to the social welfare classes, to the poor unfortunates trying to live on old age pensions, to persons trying to live on non-contributory widows' pensions, and on unemployment assistance, and compare the rates they are now being paid with the cost of living to-day, one can easily understand why the Minister felt he should not even mention their names in his 31-page statement.  Let us make some attempt to shield those people from the wintry blasts which are blowing against them in these days of increased prices.</P>
    <P>Similarly, one felt that the Minister might have done something to relieve some part of increased taxes for a large number of persons.  Single men and single women whose lower rate of pay before the war did not make them liable for income-tax&mdash;although their purchasing power to-day is no greater than it was in 1938-39&mdash;are now being compelled to pay income-tax on rates of wages which have no greater purchasing power than their rates of wages in 1938-39.  The Minister might have found some opportunity of providing relief for <Col N="627" /> these classes, especially when he reflected on the excessively generous manner in which he acted towards the master bakers during the year which has just left us.</P>
    <P>This is not really a Budget at all.  It is a kind of Standstill Order by the Minister for Finance or the Government to the effect that we will not change anything, that everything will be as it was.  We are in the rôle of Wilkins Micawber&mdash;waiting for something to turn up.  We are waiting to see how things will turn out and how the American recession gets on.  In present circumstances, the country needs a tonic Budget, a Budget which shows courage and vision.  The country needs a Budget which indicates that the Government are prepared to tackle in a vigorous and a radical way the basic evils which have long confronted it and which still exact a heavy toll from the economic fabric of the State and in social misery from the masses of the people who still remain in Ireland.  Instead of getting that tonic Budget, we get this colourless ersatz production which the Minister dignifies with the title of &ldquo;Budget&rdquo;, but which is quite unworthy of any such a classification.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that Budgets were for the purpose of directing economic expansion.  I have always believed that Budgets were an instrument in relation to financial and economic policy.  I have always believed that a Budget, properly conceived and applied, could give the country not merely a tonic but could guide its development in a manner calculated to produce satisfactory results for the people.  Tested against that requirement and that possibility, this Budget does nothing of the kind.  It will bring only bleakness into the minds of the people who were expecting a radical and constructive approach to the nation's basic problems.</P>
    <P>I can foresee, as a result of this Budget that, from to-day, 23rd April, 1958, the emigrant ships will continue to carry their quota of Irishmen and Irishwomen to work elsewhere and that the employment exchanges will <Col N="628" /> be as busy in 1958 as they were in 1957.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most colourless Budget which has been presented to this House for very many years and certainly during my time as a member of this House.  Like the last speaker, I have always considered&mdash;and the country expects&mdash;that the Budget is a time for a review of the affairs of the country.  Furthermore, people who are oppressed in the country look forward to some measure of relief in the Budget.  The outstanding fact is that the Minister's method of finding money is new and novel, for all the good it was.  The Minister need not have made that long speech in introducing the Budget because the whole method of finding money was determined as far back as January last.  That was when the new method of finding money was devised by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>Last year, Fianna Fáil decided to increase the cost of living.  They blistered, in particular, the people who had to buy bread and butter.  They made those who eat bread and butter contribute £9,000,000.  This year, they have hit on a new way.  They determined to find the money by cutting the Estimates for the different Departments and it is noticeable that the only sub-heads cut in the Estimates are those in relation to the provision of work for the ordinary man.  I need mention just a few.  The principal sub-head in Forestry was cut from £482,300 to £334,150, representing a cut of £148,000 in one sub-head alone.  The Minister took good care not to tell us how he got £148,000 of his money.  It was got by reducing the amount of money available to provide work for the working man up and down the country, in relation to forestry.</P>
      <P>A sum of £20,000 has been cut in respect of sub-head I of the Land Commission Vote&mdash;a sub-head that gives employment to ordinary working men, not to officials, and not involving expenditure of any kind, except for the one purpose of providing work for ordinary working men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment content for arterial drainage is down.  At Question Time, to-day, Deputy Norton extracted from the Minister for Finance the information <Col N="629" /> that the rural electrification scheme has been cut down to practically nothing and is virtually at a standstill. All rural employment under the Local Authorities (Works) Act is completely cut out; not a single penny is being granted this year to any local authority under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Minor relief schemes are at a standstill.  The rural improvements scheme has been manipulated so that the contribution demanded from the beneficiaries is such that, while £200,000 is provided in the Vote for rural improvements, I do not believe 25 per cent. of that amount of money will be availed of.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a great song and dance about taking the tax off cinema films.  I am sure it will be a great help to people all over the country to know that the tax on cinema films coming into the country is being reduced.</P>
    <P>Farmers, big and small, and small farmers in particular, comprise the only section of the people who have got absolutely nothing.  Instead of getting any relief from last year's sledge hammer blows on this day, they have been asked to contribute still further in the form of reduced prices for wheat and milk.  The Minister for Agriculture has virtually put the bacon industry out of commission. Eggs have gone down in price.  Were it not for the agreement signed in 1948 by the Minister for Agriculture in the inter-Party Government, the one bright spot in this country at the present time&mdash;the cattle trade&mdash;would definitely be in the same position as our other agricultural products.  There has been absolutely no relief whatever for what is regarded as the backbone of the country.  The Minister did not mention the agricultural industry during his speech and did not say a single word about the farmers.</P>
    <P>Where are the 100,000 jobs and the spending of the £100,000,000 which we heard about from Deputy Lemass, as he was then?  We have been waiting 14 months for all that now and it is high time something came of those promises. Instead of giving some relief for the excess of taxes imposed on the poor people of the country this time last year, I notice that the Minister has no <Col N="630" /> word about the £1,000,000 for the Tánaiste's new jet runway.  I wonder what incentive that is to increased production&mdash;the fact that people are being denied grants for cowsheds and that other grants are being cut down, while money is provided for a jet runway. I wonder how they will view this new jet runway or how the Government hope to fit that project into the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>Another method of saving is the new Gestapo released by the Department of Social Welfare on people throughout the country for the purpose of withholding unemployment benefit from people who, in most cases, are genuine applicants.  A regular torture system has been let loose within the past couple of months for the purpose of saving.</P>

      <P>All of these are sources of revenue to the Minister for Finance. As he chose to inflict these impositions on the people, he might have had the graciousness to mention them in his speech to-day.  I suppose he would not have received the half-hearted clap he got from his supporters if he had mentioned the new method of raising money by depriving people of employment. My guess is that at least 600 forestry workers will be deprived of their livelihood this coming year in order that the Minister for Finance may save £148,000.  I fear that from 200 to 300 Land Commission workers will be left at home during the coming year because the Minister for Finance wants £20,000.  That represents a hidden form of taxation within the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Budget was framed at the time of the framing of the Estimates&mdash;last November, December and January.  I regret to say that the Minister's speech, to-day, was just a waste of time.  The only other remark I wish to make at this stage is that, as far as I can see, the only thing the people of the country can take from the Minister's Budget statement is that there is another hard, gloomy, grinding year ahead with no promise of relief from the blows which the Government struck last year <Col N="631" /> under the present Minister for Finance.  There is not a single ray of brightness in the whole outlook.  Those youngsters who were anticipating employment can realise now that the sooner they get a train and boat ticket to England the better.  Those who are out of employment can remain out of employment because it is quite clear that the Minister, instead of decreasing the number of unemployed, means to put more people into their company. There is no outlook for the country but just this harsh, grinding year ahead, as a result of this Budget.</P>

      <P>As the law stands, an employer provides benefits either for a director or an employee of the company which are not readily converted into cash and is not bound to make a return of them&mdash;for instance, the use of a car, the use of an employee in his garden, or matters of that kind.  There is a good deal of that going on&mdash;and it is on the increase&mdash; where directors of a company, or fairly highly paid employees, are getting benefits but they are not returned in their personal remuneration.  The idea is that they must all be returned and then expenses will be allowed where justified.</P>

      <P>That liability to income tax (including sur-tax) shall be imposed where benefits (including benefits which are to be enjoyed only on the happening of particular contingencies) are or are to be procured or provided by bodies for or in respect of persons who, as directors or otherwise, are taking part or are to take part or have taken part in the management of their affairs, or by such bodies for or in respect of persons who are or are to be or have been their employees.</P>
      <P>This is another case where an employer or a company provides for money to be paid to a person either by way of an annuity or a lump sum at some future time.  If there is any condition attached, it is impossible for the Revenue Commissioners to take it into account in a person's income.  For instance, the condition might be that as long as the person remains in employment he will get it at some future date.  That would make it impossible for the Revenue Commissioners to assess.  It is, of course, in the employer's statement of expenses, expenditure and so on but if that money is paid out, when the person retires, by way of lump sum, there is no tax liability.  If it was paid out by way of annuity, it would be subject to tax, and this provision is intended also to make the law right on that particular item.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in the case of persons carrying on the business of granting annuities&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  where provision is made by the Act giving effect to this Resolution for relieving from income tax in whole or in part the income of part of any such person's annuity fund (being a provision having reference to annuity contracts designed to secure superannuation benefits or other provision for a person's old age or retirement), there shall be authorised such charges to income tax as may result in particular cases from treating that part of the fund and the remainder thereof, and the annuity contracts and annuity business to which each is referable, separately for tax purposes, including, in particular, the purpose of determining how far any annuities are to be treated as paid out of profits or gains brought into charge to tax, and</P>
      <P>(b)  where any such person is not charged to tax under Case I of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act, 1918, in respect of the annuity business carried on by him, provision shall be made for charging to income tax the profits arising to him from that business or from any part of that business treated separately as aforesaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter with which, I am sure, my predecessor is quite familiar, as it has been before the Minister for Finance a long time.  A self-employed person has not the same facilities to provide himself with a pension in his old age as an employed person has. As Deputies know, big employers usually have a superannuation scheme whereby employee and employer both make contributions not subject to income-tax.  The employers' and the employees' money goes into that fund and the employees eventually get a pension from the fund.  As the law stands, a self-employed person has not that facility, because if he goes to an insurance company and makes an arrangement with them to get an <Col N="637" /> annuity at the age of 60 or 70, he gets only a partial remission of income-tax on the amount paid in.</P>
    <P>The provision to be made here will enable a self-employed person to get tax terms as good as if he were in a scheme where he was working for an employer.  In other words, if the scheme is approved&mdash;there will be certain safeguards; for instance, he will be allowed to go only to a certain proportion of his salary&mdash;the amount that is paid for this purpose will be exempt from income-tax and the fund that will be created by the insurance company for this purpose will be to a great extent free.  Of course they will have to pay on profits&mdash;that is what this Resolution deals with&mdash;but the yield from the fund will be exempt from income-tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the extent and incidence of income tax (including sur-tax) shall be varied so as to give effect to provisions&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  defining the cases in which, the purposes for which and the extent to which, sums which would otherwise be treated as income of a woman are to be treated as her husband's income, and</P>
      <P>(b)  rendering a woman, her trustee, guardian, curator or committee, or her executors or administrators, liable in certain cases for amounts of unpaid income tax or sur-tax assessed on her husband, his trustee, guardian, curator or committee, or his executors or administrators.</P>
      <P>As the law stands, if a husband and wife make an application, they may get separate assessment, but if they make no application, the husband is assessed and must pay.  I think he would be assessed in any case, but he must pay. There are difficulties in that, because sometimes the husband may have very little, and if the husband says: &ldquo;I have no money; I cannot pay,&rdquo; we are out.  Also, if the wife dies leaving a fairly substantial estate and there is an amount owing by the husband, at the moment, he must pay, even though her estate goes to somebody else.  These two matters are being made right in the Finance Bill.  That means the Revenue Commissioners will assess the husband as they have been doing, but they may proceed against the wife, if they find out the husband has no goods and that the wife has.  Secondly, it will enable the husband, if his wife is dead, to direct that the bill be sent on to the wife's estate and then he will have no more to do with it.</P>

      <P>May I raise one matter, in the hope that the Minister may be able to say something on it between now and the Finance Bill?  For quite <Col N="639" /> a considerable time, there has been agitation, which was apparently successful in England recently, dealing with the problem of where a man and wife travelling together are involved in an accident, for instance.  Under the man's will, the wife is the beneficiary. Say they are both killed in the accident. When the man is killed the estate automatically passes to his wife.  The wife is also injured in the accident and she dies on the following day.  Under the present income-tax code, income-tax can be levied on his estate.  He is dead, but under his will his property passes to his widow, but the widow having dies the following day, her estate has to pay also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement in the paragraph in which he deals with cinemas and patent theatres, is that he feels &ldquo;obliged to do something to help to preserve both the revenue from cinemas and theatres and the employment which they afford&rdquo; and he has given a concession which amounts to £50,000.  It is given by reducing the customs duty on films and by increasing the rebate on cine-variety in patent theatres.  The Minister says he wants to preserve both the revenue and the employment which these establishments provide.  I presume he has met the people from the cinemas and cine-theatres who are advocating this and perhaps he could say at this stage if they made any proposals as to how they intend to increase audiences, because if it is merely a question of this £50,000 being paid over to the cinemas and cine-theatres, the Minister will certainly not achieve the object for which this Resolution is designed, the preservation of revenue and employment?

      <P>The Minister will recall that some weeks ago I asked him a question in connection with the evasion of tax by exhibitors or cinema people where we had cases in the last few months of Irish films being shown by some cinemas down the country for months on end.  We discovered that the same films were being shown night after night because the cinema people had found in that a means by which they could evade duty.  In my opinion, that was a form of cheating on the part of the cinema owners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of course, it does. It arises from the fact that the Minister agreed with me in the House that evasion was taking place.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled at this stage to voice my disagreement with the Financial Resolution.  I suggest that the film industry in this country is in the hands of certain combines and these combines are controlled exclusively from outside the State.  We have no say whatever with regard to the type of film shown in the country. We have no say with regard to the control of these films.  At the same time arguments are put forward in this House that it is necessary to give certain favours to those outside this country who direct films on the basis that if we do not give them this remission there will be unemployment amongst the ushers and the employees in the various cinemas.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to show us how that unemployment position is likely to arise.  He referred to other countries in his opening remarks.  I presume he was referring specifically to Britain where the subject was discussed recently and where a certain reduction in taxation and so forth was given to the cinema people there on the grounds that television had interfered seriously with the cinemas and that the attendance at cinemas had been reduced through people watching television shows at home.  The same argument seems to be put forward in this House, that the reduction in the attendance at cinemas has come about through the attraction of other forms of amusement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only form of amusement that has come into this country recently which I can think of is television and, so far, television should not be a recognised factor in the State because we have no television service of our own.  I maintain, therefore, that it is premature at this stage to allow any reliefs to the cinema people on the basis of the argument that television has reduced the audiences at cinemas.  If and when television is formally recognised <Col N="642" /> in the State and set up as such in our country, then, and only then, are the cinema people entitled to put forward their case for certain reliefs through the Budget.  At the moment I do not see how they can put forward any case in relation to television over which we have no control.</P>

They will get films cheaper than they got them before.  The case made to me was that not only should this import levy be reduced but that there should also be a very big reduction in the entertainment tax.  We could not afford that.  We could only give them this concession.  This will enable them to select better films in future and thereby give better entertainment and get bigger houses.  If it has that effect we shall gain by way of revenue.  It went down 7½ per cent. last year which meant a loss of £100,000 and it will be good business even to get back the 7½ per cent.  It would be impossible to pass this on to the patrons.  I think that they take in £5,000,000 approximately in a year and £50,000 could not possibly give them any advantage in that respect.  It may be accepted, therefore, as being a method to enable the cinema owners to provide better entertainment.</P>

      <P>I should imagine <Col N="644" /> that this will have the effect of having tobacco and cigarettes sold on a much wider front than before.  Tobacco now provides about 26 or 27 per cent. of our revenue.  It is more than a substantial slice of it.  What is the present amount of the licence fee?

      <P>The licence fee before 1932 was 5/3.  In 1932, there were representations from those who called themselves tobacco traders and nothing else. There are very few of those now.  They said it was unfair that hotels and so forth should sell tobacco.  It was brought in at that time and there was added 1 per cent. of the valuation over £10.  There are 36,000 tobacco dealers in this country and you can imagine the trouble it is to the Revenue Commissioners. They must make sure of the valuation of the house and they must check up any change.  There is no doubt that they are losing money.</P>

      <P>There seems to be an element of both retrospection and <Col N="646" /> retroaction in this Resolution, but it is rather a technical matter.  In respect of sub-paragraph (1) that is clearly a matter for the future, but so far as sub-paragraph (2) is concerned, it deems that the relief shall never have been allowed.  That seems to be going too far, though honestly I do not understand exactly how this will operate.  I think it would be perfectly fair to say that in respect of any case that has been dealt with and closed it could not be reopened.  If this arose because something new had been found there would be a spate of refunds, and I would not object to that being prevented.  However, where it happens, as here, that a case is pending, you cut it in the middle and say that the law by virtue of which you are entitled to take this allowance before is now to be changed with retrospective effect to the death of a person who died some years ago.

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The prime purpose of this Bill is the provision of funds and of facilities that are needed to bring about the full economic development of the inland fisheries industry.  The salmon industry may be taken as typical of inland fisheries generally.  In its present state it has been capable of yielding over the past ten years exports valued at an average of some £560,000 a year.  I am confident that this figure can be materially stepped up by the provision of improved protection services and by the building up of stocks in a number of rivers which are under-developed.  On the sport side we can at present count on about 16,000 visiting anglers.  This it is reckoned can be brought up to 50,000 by the improvement of amenities resulting from the five-year fisheries development plan being undertaken by Bord Fáilte Eireann and the Inland Fisheries Trust.  At a conservative estimate this target would represent an annual spending of some £2,500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This valuable industry cannot be expected to make its full potential contribution to the national economy if it continues to be starved of finance for the essential work of protection and development.  The resources available to boards of conservators for their vitally important work may seem to have increased considerably in recent years but the apparent increase of total incomes of the boards from £28,500 in 1939 to close on £70,000 in 1957 vanishes when the figures are adjusted to allow for the change in cost of living and purchasing power of money between the two years.  The charges levied by way of licence duty have remained unchanged since 1925 when the price of salmon stood at one-fourth of the present-day figure.  The income from fishery rates has lagged by about 5 per cent. behind what would be needed to <Col N="648" /> offset the fall in real money values.  In the result the increase in State subventions and the yield from the salmon export levy had largely been swallowed up in making good these deficiencies.</P>
    <P>The old machinery for providing the conservators with income for protection purposes must, therefore, be overhauled if the services they render are to be modernised and put on an effective footing.  A start has been made in recent years with reorganisation of waterkeeping staff in some districts, but in many places there is still an insufficient number of whole-time keepers.  Much has yet to be done by way of modernising means of transport and communication: the river staff must try to keep a move ahead of the poacher in this respect.</P>
    <P>On the development side there is already in progress a survey of salmon stocks in all major river systems and of the spawning areas serving them.  In addition, I am arranging for an engineering study of the number of rivers in which barriers to the free movement of fish leave large areas for the breeding of salmon unused as spawning grounds.  The works required to deal with such problems would in general be costly; but it seems reasonable to expect that the cost would be amortised within 15 years considering the benefits from increased runs of salmon which would accrue to commercial and to sporting interests.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill deals with only five main subjects the provisions which have to be made are somewhat complex due to the amount of revision of the extensive fishery code which they entail.  The arrangement of sections adopted in drafting follows that of the subject matter in the draft Fisheries (Consolidation) Bill which it is hoped to reintroduce at an early date.  The result of this arrangement is that provisions relating to a given subject in the present Bill do not follow consecutively. There has accordingly been circulated with the text of the Bill a memorandum indicating in respect of each main provision what are the consequential provisions relating to it.</P>
    <P>As regards the five subjects referred to in the explanatory memorandum, <Col N="649" /> Section 5 of the Bill which provides for the issue of fish culture licences is designed to facilitate the undertaking of fish farming and to provide for necessary controls.  Fish which are reared and kept in captivity do not require the same protection by way of close season regulation as is afforded to wild fish.  Once the brood stock of the farm is maintained and renewed from time to time by captures of wild fish in season no limitation need be put on the times at which the produce is cropped.  The effect of the licence will be to enable the fish farmer to net his fish for market at any time or season. It is intended by Section 23 of the Bill to bring rainbow trout, a popular product of fish farms, within the scope of the 1925 Act licensing provisions so that dealings in rainbow trout will be the subject of records similar to those kept for salmon and brown trout.</P>
    <P>Section 15 and Parts I and II of the Second Schedule comprise a re-enactment in general of the ordinary licence duties on fishing engines at the existing rates.  Licence duties of £1 on seven-day and £1 10s. on 21-day salmon rod ordinary licences are provided in lieu of present provisions for short term licences which are available in district of issue only, and provision is made for increase by Order of the licence duties on any particular class of engine subject to a maximum of twice the existing scheduled duty, any such new rate of duty to be operative on and after 1st January next following the making of the Order.  It is intended that the rod licence duties should be increased by Order after enactment of this Bill and become operative as from 1st January, 1959, the duties for whole season and for 21-day licences being increased by 100 per cent., the duty for the seven-day licence to remain for the present at £1.  The rod licence duties in the 1959 season would therefore be full season £4, seven-day £1, and 21-day £3.  It will be necessary to increase the supplementary licence duty for Foyle area licence holders to £2 10s.</P>
    <P>All salmon rod licences proposed in this Bill will be available in all fishery districts throughout the State.  This will be a substantial improvement on <Col N="650" /> the present system whereby the £2 full season licence can be availed of in any district after the district of issue only on payment of an endorsement fee of 10/- for each district, and the special term licences for 14 days or after 1st July are available in the district of issue only.  Nowadays there must be few salmon anglers whose appetite for the sport can be satisfied by fishing in his home district only and in many cases the payment of £4 for a licence with countrywide availability will represent a saving on current outlay in obtaining endorsements on the basic licence.  The new arrangement will be particularly attractive to visiting anglers who will be saved the inconvenience of searching out a licence distributor in perhaps half a dozen districts which they may easily enter in the course of a comparatively short fishing holiday.</P>
    <P>To meet the case of persons mainly interested in sea trout fishing I propose to bring in an amendment at the Committee Stage providing for the issue of licences after 1st July in each year at a fee of £1 10s., these licences to be available for use in all fishery districts and subject also to increase up to £3 under Section 15.</P>
    <P>The amount of additional duty which the proposed increases will realise &mdash; estimated at between £9,000 and £10,000 per annum&mdash;will go to the credit of the Salmon Conservancy Fund.</P>
    <P>No increase is at present proposed in licence duties on engines other than rod and line as such can be regarded as for the time being sufficiently under contribution in the form of the levy at present payable on salmon exports.</P>
    <P>It has been considered desirable to extend the provisions of the Salmon Conservancy Fund Act, 1954, to enable moneys from the fund maintained under that Act to be made available for the costs of approved inland fisheries improvement schemes, in addition to the existing provision enabling payment of moneys from the fund to supplement the income of boards of conservators.  It has been further deemed necessary to incorporate the Salmon Conservancy Fund Act, 1954, with the Fisheries Acts and <Col N="651" /> the Act is therefore being repealed and its provisions as extended included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As to the eel fishery provisions (Sections 19, 20, 21 and 22), the state of our eel fishing industry cannot be regarded as satisfactory.  Over the past three years exports of eels are returned as averaging only 2,200 cwt. valued at £28,000 a year.  I shall be very surprised if these figures cannot be materially increased by the employment of more efficient methods of capture and of fishery management generally.</P>
    <P>With a view to promoting development of eel fishing on proper lines, I am arranging for an officer to visit the Netherlands next month and Italy later in the year to study eel fishing techniques and handling and storage methods.  This study tour will rank as a technical assistance project the cost of which will be recouped out of Grant Counterpart Funds.</P>
    <P>I find that before I took up office some consideration had been given to the possibility of lifting the restrictions imposed on the use of certain eel weirs by Sections 33 and 34 of the Fisheries Act, 1939.  So far as I have been able to ascertain these restrictions cannot have had a very significant effect on the country's total catch of eels.  The restrictions were in the first instance an integral part of the 1939 Act scheme for acquisition of all were fisheries and of certain other exclusive fisheries in tidal waters.  It is not my present intention to bring that scheme into operation but if it should be found necessary to implement it at some future date the position regarding the eel weirs can I am satisfied be safeguarded in another way.  I accordingly propose to take power to modify the prohibition on erection of eel weirs by means of Orders under Section 20 of the Bill and the restriction on operation of certain weirs by means of authorisations under Section 21.  Section 19 of the Bill provides for a consequential relaxation of the restriction imposed by Section 35 of the 1939 Act on netting for eels in public fisheries.</P>
    <P>Finally in Section 22 it is proposed <Col N="652" /> to make a realistic approach to the problem of free gaps in eel weirs.  The Fisheries Acts require that there shall be a free gap in every fishing weir. This has been interpreted as applying to eel weirs equally with salmon weirs, but in practice to insist on putting a statutory free gap in an eel weir could hopelessly impair its catching power. This section will make it possible to grant an Order for the operation of an eel weir without a free gap subject to conditions which will enable the Minister to ensure that satisfactory arrangements are made for the free passage of salmon.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides in Section 26 for the imposition of a licence duty of £2 (subject, however, to increase as provided under Section 15) on engines used for oyster fishing and in Section 24 for penalties for taking oysters unless by means of a licensed oyster fishing engine.</P>
    <P>I may add that an amendment of the Long Title will be moved on the Committee Stage to delete the words &ldquo;certain public&rdquo; which appear before the words &ldquo;oyster fisheries&rdquo;.  This course is being adopted here and in Section 24 of the Bill as on reconsideration it is felt that if effective protection were to be provided for selected public oyster fisheries only, then the remaining fisheries, whether public or private, would be marked out for the attentions of the poachers. In the circumstances, it has been decided to bring all oyster fishing without exception under the new licensing arrangement and to require conservators to provide the necessary protection for public and private oyster beds alike.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Bill as indicated in the explanatory memorandum is comprised of amendments of the existing fishery law consequential on the foregoing main provisions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should again mention the long delayed Consolidation Bill which will be reintroduced in Seanad Eireann following enactment of the present measure.  By the time the Consolidation Bill becomes law, work will be in progress on an amending measure of a more general nature <Col N="653" /> than the present one.  The introduction of such a measure will provide the opportunity of dealing with a variety of pressing problems about which boards of conservators and other bodies have for some time been seeking amending legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be admitted by all that the laws connected with fisheries are very numerous and, not alone are they very numerous, but they are entirely out of date and far from being in keeping with modern times or modern methods.  I thought that the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1957, would cover most of the varied problems with which boards of conservators are faced in their everyday activities but I note from the Minister's speech now that it is proposed to introduce further legislation at a later date.</P>
      <P>The great difficulty over the years with regard to fishery legislation was the fact that so many different Acts were passed down through the years. The job was to codify that body of legislation and in that codification to remove the objectionable out-of-date sections and replace them by legislation of a more up-to-date character and more in keeping with the times in which we live.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us is designed for the most part for two purposes: to increase the rod licences and to bring into permanent legislation the levy of 2d. per lb. imposed, on every lb. of salmon exported, by the Fianna Fáil Government under the Salmon Conservancy Fund Act.  The inter-Party Government, after due consideration, decided to remove that levy because we believed that the levy was unreasonable. It was part of our policy not to impose a levy on any exports, particularly exports of an agricultural character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A levy on the export of cattle, butter, cheese and eggs would be unjustifiable. The reason the Government introduced the levy on salmon was, in my opinion, that it could be used as a lever later on.  By imposing a levy on an important export item such as salmon, they could say there was nothing to prevent them from imposing levies on eggs, <Col N="654" /> butter, cheese, cattle, live stock or any agricultural export.  We felt that was wrong and we removed the levy.</P>
    <P>We were told that the reason for imposing the levy was to provide funds for the various boards of conservators in order to provide more protection for the fisheries.  But that was not the case.  We found that the levy was designed to relieve the Exchequer.  The boards of conservators had a very difficult job because they had to take on additional staff and pay increases to inspectors and water-keepers.  When the levy was put into operation, it did not mean that 100 per cent. of the money would be devoted to the protection of the fisheries by way of substantial grants to the boards of conservators.</P>
    <P>During the years of the inter-Party Government, the boards of conservators received larger grants than ever before. Yet there was still a saving to the Exchequer, because the grants which had to be paid would have been paid from the Central Fund one way or another.  Therefore, the Salmon Conservancy Fund was saving the Exchequer.  I feel it is wrong that the Exchequer should be saved by imposing an unnecessary levy on any export.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister for Lands has lived up to an undertaking which I gave to the boards of conservators and various fishery interests that, before there would be any new fishery legislation, all parties concerned in the fishing industry would be consulted so that their views might be obtained on various aspects of new legislation?  I remember giving that undertaking to the Federation of Salmon Anglers, the Trout Anglers' Association and various boards of conservators, including the boards in Waterford, Kerry and, I think, Galway.</P>
    <P>The Minister must agree that as far as the boards of conservators are concerned, there is no such thing as unanimity in regard to the salmon levy.  Resolutions passed by various boards of conservators are on record in the Minister's Department, protesting and asking for the removal of the export levy on salmon.  It is quite wrong therefore that this levy should be made part of a permanent Fisheries <Col N="655" /> Act.  The Minister should make a clear admission that the main purpose of imposing the levy was to relieve the Exchequer.  I believe the levy is wrong and very unreasonable.  I objected to it in the past and my views on it have not altered in any way.</P>
    <P>The whole question of inland fisheries is of the greatest public importance. I agree entirely with the Minister when he says that our fisheries are one of the greatest attractions we have for tourists.  We can boast of having the finest fisheries in the world. The main difficulty is that they do not appear to get sufficient publicity abroad.  I do not know the reason for this&mdash;whether it is lack of funds, lack of initiative or neglect on the part of our representatives abroad.  They do not seem to concentrate sufficiently in giving our fisheries the publicity they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>The Minister claims that something like 15,000 angling tourists come here every year; but as I say, we have the best fisheries in the world and they should be capable of attracting, not 15,000 angling tourists, but something in the region of 70,000 or 80,000 angling tourists.  I want to say this in regard to the funds that are to be taken now in the form of the salmon levy and in the form of the additional increased charges on salmon rod licences.  If these were to go entirely to boards of conservators for the protection and maintenance of fisheries, it would be quite all right, but we know from past experience that it has gone considerably to relieve the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The previous Government, particularly the then Minister for Agriculture, refused to increase the rod licence.  One of the reasons was that we had attractive fisheries and wanted to encourage tourists and to prove to them that we had, not only the best fisheries in the world, but the cheapest. It was with the intention of encouraging angling tourists to avail of the great facilities here that we refused, as I think, rightly, to increase the rod licence.</P>
    <P>If inland fisheries are to be improved and developed, funds must be available for that purpose.  The Inland Fisheries <Col N="656" /> Trust, which has done outstanding work, has not got the support from the angling public to which it is entitled. I cannot recall exactly what the present membership is, but the membership fee is very modest and reasonable, and I fail to see why every angler in the country is not associated with the trust and why there has not been more financial support from the fishing public.  I do not understand why there has not been a greater measure of support from the hotels throughout the country, or why there has not been a greater measure of co-operation between the trust and An Bord Fáilte.  I hope the Minister has considered this matter and that anything that can be done to secure a greater measure of co-operation with the trust, particularly from hotel managements, is being done.</P>
    <P>It is only right that inland fisheries should be developed to the greatest possible extent and that every possible attraction should be offered to angling tourists.  Angling tourists are a most important source of national income. The angling tourist is, perhaps, the best spender and, perhaps, the most useful type of visitor that we could have.  Hoteliers in important fishing districts like to see the angling tourist because he is out all day fishing, comes in in the evening and goes out fishing again and spends a considerable amount of time discussing the day's catch and comparing notes with other anglers.  He is regarded as being easily catered for and easily managed.  While the Inland Fisheries Trust and the Fisheries Branch in general have played no small part in making conditions attractive for such good tourists, the hoteliers and others concerned have not played the part they should have played in that connection.</P>
    <P>An increase in the rod licence does not make fishing more attractive to tourists.  I do agree with the Bill and consider that it is a common-sense line of action that a person who has taken out a rod licence can fish, when this Bill becomes law, in any area.</P>

      <P>The increase in the rod licence is not an encouragement. Rod licences have not been increased since 1925, but, for the sake of the amount that will be taken in as a result of the increase, it would be better to leave the licences as they are as an encouragement to the angling tourist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who benefit by the development of inland fisheries should be asked to contribute towards their development.  Hotel owners, angling clubs and others who benefit by angling tourists should become members of the Inland Fisheries Trust. The trust has spent wisely and well <Col N="658" /> and has generally improved the standard of inlaid fisheries.  There are well stocked rivers and wonderful improvements have been carried out. A fish farm was established at Fanure near Roscrea, coarse fish have been removed from certain lakes and the fishing in most lakes has been improved. The trust has done outstanding work and I hope it will continue.  It is worthy of more financial support from the public than it has got.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that boards of conservators should be in a position to have sufficient staff to provide proper protection.  The great difficulty with many boards of conservators appears to that they have a number of water-keepers who are not properly paid and who are expected to cover too extensive an area.  The most effective way of improving fishery protection would be to reduce the number of underpaid water-keepers, to provide proper travelling facilities and have well paid, whole-time, permanent water-keepers.  That would mean more efficient protection services. I have known cases where water-keepers, on very low rates of pay, had to use ordinary bicycles to cover long distances and were not provided by the board with rubber boots and protective clothing.</P>
    <P>Boards of conservators have the grave responsibility of maintaining protection, but it is regrettable that wholesale poaching has gone on in many areas where the protection is not adequate.  I am sure the Minister has many instances of it.  To get to the root of the problem, one must ask where the outlet is for the fish that is poached.  I have known many cases where the best customer for the poacher was the hotel.  I am sure the Minister is aware that evidence has been given time and again in cases where there were convictions that there was a ready market for the poacher's illegal catch.  It is bad public spirit and wrong that salmon caught illegally should be purchased by hotels.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact I view this with such seriousness that I think, if there are licensed salmon dealers who purchase illegallycaught salmon, that the Minister should, in the interest and <Col N="659" /> the protection of salmon fisheries, revoke such licences and take them from them.  No encouragement whatever should be held out to provide an easy outlet for catches of salmon taken illegally by poachers.  It is well known that in many areas the poaching of our fisheries is conducted by organised gangs.  They have ample transport available and have a ready market for their catches.  I am well aware of the fact also that there are lists in the Department of Fisheries of important hoteliers and hotel managements throughout the country which take in and deal in salmon of that kind.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, when he is introducing further legislation, as promised, will bear that in mind and that a stop will be put to the marketing and purchasing of illegally caught fish.  It would be very easy to protect fisheries and give greater co-operation to boards of conservators if the root cause of the problem were solved, and the ready market available were abolished.  The schools, the clergy and the Garda could play a more important part than they have done in the past in regard to the protection of our fisheries.  May I say it is only right and proper that a fishery fine should be something in the charge of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries?  He should have the final and last word on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister in all seriousness not to pass the buck to the Minister for Justice. When new legislation is introduced there should be some way of ending for all time the controversial correspondence and expressions of view that take place, and have taken place in the past, between the Fishery Department and the Department of Justice, with regard to the mitigation of fines and dealing with offences under the Fisheries Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, even at this late stage, to consider the insertion of a section in this Bill which will enable him to decide on fines as he wishes, and to dispose of fines on poachers, and fines for all manner of <Col N="660" /> fishery offences.  There can be many fishery offences apart entirely from poaching.  There can be dealing and selling of salmon in the close season, as well as many other illegal practices in connection with fisheries, that should be dealt with by the Minister responsible for the Department.  It may be all right to say that the Minister for Justice is responsible for the courts and for fines and the mitigation of fines, but the Minister for Fisheries is responsible for the protection of fisheries and is responsible, through the boards of conservators, for the maintenance of fisheries.  It should be in his discretion to say if a fine is to be mitigated, wiped out completely, or if it is to stand.</P>
    <P>My experience in the past has been that boards of conservators have been very much displeased with the present method.  Only recently I read a report of a long discussion at a meeting of the Limerick Board of Conservators on this subject and I think I directed a letter, or a parliamentary question&mdash;I cannot say which&mdash;to the Minister directing his attention to that meeting. It was stated at the meeting that the Department of Fisheries was giving no co-operation whatever on the question of fines for illegal fishing.  There should be discussions between the two Departments towards securing that the Minister for Fisheries would take on the responsibility of deciding on fishery fines.  I say this in the best interests of our fisheries because I feel that in the past poachers have been too leniently dealt with.</P>
    <P>I have known of one very serious offence which involved the Department of Fisheries.  It concerned a fisherman who was the holder of a salmon dealer's licence.  He declared publicly that no matter what the District Court might decide, and no matter what fine was imposed, he would get out of it. He did get out of it and he pinned a notice from the Department of Fisheries mitigating his fine, with four drawing-pins, on a wall in his shop and told each and every one of his customers about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not of recent date?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not of recent date, but if the Minister consults with the officers of his Department he will find that there was such a case.  There ought not to be such a case; it was entirely against the rules of the Fishery Department that such a mitigation was granted.  There is no use in giving the boards of conservators lip sympathy.  Lip sympathy is what they have been getting in the past.  It is only right when we have new fishery legislation that all aspects of the problem should be covered.  I think the Minister for Lands ought to be the final arbiter to be consulted with regard to fishery fines and, if he does not see his way to implementing that in the present Bill, I trust, in the further amending legislation which he hopes to introduce at an early date, that point will be satisfactorily covered.</P>
      <P>I have already dealt with the effect of the levy on the export of salmon and with the increase on rod licences. There does not appear to be anything else of a controversial nature in this Bill.  It was designed only to rake in more out of the pockets of English visitors by increasing the rod licences. It confirms the levy of 2d. a lb. on salmon exports which I note was by Order of the Minister, and which can be increased from 2d. a lb. to any sum the Minister desires.  We have opposed that in the past and we oppose it now.  It is wrong that there should be a levy of that kind imposed on salmon exports.  There is no levy on the export of eggs, bacon, cattle and live stock and, therefore, it is entirely wrong to have a levy imposed on such exports as these.  I am strongly opposed to the continuance of the export levy on salmon.  I feel it is no encouragement to the angling tourist to have his salmon rod licence increased but I do think it is common sense to extend the licence to every fishery authority in the State.  That will be to the advantage of the tourist and of the salmon angler.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope and trust that the Minister will not bring in the other aspects of legislation which he promised in the conclusion of his speech too hastily.  I hope he will bring them in only after consultation with boards of conservators, <Col N="662" /> the Federation of Salmon Anglers, the Federation of Trout Anglers and all other fishery interests. A volume of useful, helpful and practical information can be had from such voluntary associations.  I feel that their views on the activities in which they have been engaged over the years can bring forth a volume of very useful and helpful information in the formation of fishery laws.</P>
    <P>Up-to-date fishery laws have been promised for many years.  I hope every effort will be made to consult those people who have a practical and intimate knowledge of fisheries, who know where the faults lie and who can recommend certain proposals for the betterment and improvement of our laws.  Voluntary organisations such as the federations to which I have referred would, I feel, be the best people with whom to enter into consultations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the move which I noticed recently in relation to the setting-up of a central body of fishery conservators. It is a wise and a good move. I hope the Minister will take note of any recommendation they may have to make with regard to bringing our fishery laws up-to-date.</P>
    <P>There are only two important aspects of this Bill.  The first relates to the increase in the cost of rod licences, with which I disagree, and the second is the continuance of the levy on the export of salmon with which, also, I disagree.  I feel they were originally designed by Fianna Fáil to relieve the Exchequer and not for the purpose of assisting boards of conservators in maintaining, keeping and improving the services so necessary for the preservation of the high standard of fisheries which will be a greater attraction not to 15,000 angling tourists but to 80,000 angling tourists to whom we are quite capable of offering fine sport.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to make arrangements with our offices abroad, particularly in England, to provide publicity for our fishing attractions.  It has been noticed that in the past three or four years more British anglers have been coming over here than for many years previously.  Through Bord Fáilte <Col N="663" /> or through our embassy in London, we should endeavour to get in touch with voluntary angling organisations in Great Britain and to circulate full details of what we have to offer to these sportsmen.  I am sure we have more facilities to offer to the angling tourist than any other country.  All we require is more propaganda and a greater drive abroad to encourage those people to come to our country.</P>
    <P>When such tourists visit us, we expect that they will not be rooked. We want to see them treated hospitably and as they deserve to be treated.  We should provide for them, as we can and did provide for them up to now, the cheapest sport and the cheapest fishing facilities in the world. It is quite true that there could be a greater measure of co-operation between the hotels but there again lies the need for greater co-operation between the Inland Fisheries Trust, the Department, Bord Fáilte and other interests who can solve many problems which are likely to arise in this regard.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to be cautious in relation to his future fisheries legislation.  I urge him to consult all the fisheries interests in advance.  If he does that, I have no doubt that when he brings in future fisheries amending legislation, it will meet with the entire approval of those who are already in a position to give a fund of guiding knowledge to him which will be a real advantage in our efforts to make our fisheries the best and most attractive in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>When we see local anglers' associations, development committees, hotels, and so on, doing very useful work to provide facilities for visiting anglers and local anglers, it is good to note that our Department is also moving on and helping inland fisheries.  I welcome this Bill as another step towards the improvement of salmon and trout fishing facilities in this country.  We hope that more steps will be taken in time to come, because, all over the world, rod fishing has become a popular pastime.  It is popular amongst workers who, at <Col N="664" /> the present time, are inclined to go abroad for their holidays.  Those people should be attracted to this country because we have something to offer them in the way of rod fishing that cannot be got elsewhere.  Whether it be trout and salmon fishing or sea fishing, they have here a wide and excellent choice.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte deserves credit for the amount of attention they give to the fishing angle in their publicity campaign for our tourist industry.  Of course, more can be done locally.  I am sure this Bill will be an encouragement to local associations to strive for and achieve better results.  Recently, in my county, I heard publicly some criticism of visiting anglers.  As a matter of fact, it was suggested that anglers from the Six-County area should not have licences issued to them in this country.  I am completely and totally against any such interference. I maintain that we should not erect a border in angling.  Possibly these complaints&mdash;I am sure they were &mdash;were voiced because of the fact that poachers cross the Border and it is difficult to get them.  Very strict measures should be taken against these people.  The Guards should be given more powers to deal with them. However, it is going much too far to suggest that the fisherman who comes in for a day's pastime should not have available to him the licences which our own anglers have.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Minister is anxious to get extra funds to do the work envisaged by this Bill.  I am sorry he has not looked around to see if there is some way of getting these funds other than the continued imposition of the levy on the export of salmon.  I say that for the reason, first of all, of the amount of difficulty it involves, the amount of form filling it entails for the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to point out that on one of our important rivers, the Foyle, it is not helpful to have such a levy, because fish caught in the Foyle can be landed on the other side, whereas, if the levy were done away with, the inducement to do so would not exist.  However, that is a small local matter.  I think that every <Col N="665" /> avenue of likely revenue should be looked into, with a view to easing this levy position and its final abolition.</P>

      <P>When fisheries which are in the hands of people who are not natives, who do not live in this country come up for sale, assistance should be given to local development committees to purchase them.  It was often suggested that the Land Commission should acquire some of these fishing properties.  That would be ideal, but the Minister well knows how difficult that would be.  In this era of co-operation, local development committees of one kind or another are doing excellent work in other fields.  I know that some of them are anxious and willing to purchase, on a co-operative basis, some of these small fisheries.  They are finding it difficult to get the funds and a small assistance in some cases from the Minister's Department would enable such a valuable asset to find its way into the hands of co-operative societies or local development committees.</P>
      <P>That would have the effect that whereas at the moment such a fishery, whether a river or other fishery, is in the hands of the type of person I mentioned, and those people, from an historical point of view, have no interest in preserving it for the Irish people, if it were owned by the local people, they would have a pride in its development and its protection.  Not alone would it improve the fishery, but it would provide us with a national asset from which revenue would be available to the Department.  I should like to see a Minister give such assistance.</P>
      <P>I did not quite catch what the Minister said about the special Foyle area licences.  There is not very much in the explanatory memorandum about it.  I would be very grateful if he would mention it in his closing speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not present for the Minister's opening speech on this Bill, but, reading through the Bill, I gather that it is very narrow in its scope and more or less extends only to river fishing throughout the <Col N="666" /> country.  Time and again, I have mentioned one matter here relative to fisheries.  On a number of occasions, I have asked the present Minister&mdash; and the past Minister, Deputy Dillon, who is in the House&mdash;to give some explanation of this item, but without success.  I note that in this Bill no mention whatever is made&mdash;good, bad or indifferent&mdash;of this item.</P>
      <P>Before I go any further, I think it is quite true to say that there is little originality in this Bill.  The information I have sought from this House is this: how in the world does it so happen that, since we established native government, no Government has yet taken steps to acquire the fishery rights of the country and give to the citizens an equal right to fish wherever they so desire?  The present Minister, speaking on the Estimate last year, mentioned that that would be the very same as acquiring a person's private property.  I maintain here that the rivers are not private property, that they are public property, owned by the people, as are the lakes.  We notice from time to time stretches of river, here, there and everywhere, whereon the fishing rights are for sale.  Surely Dáil Éireann has sufficient power to acquire all those reservations and place them at the disposal of the citizens?  I have made many inquiries about this question and I have found it peculiar that fishing rights which were handed over to citizens under charters made during the reign of Charles II or James I, or some other English king, are now a binding factor in legislation in this country, and neither Deputy Dillon nor the present Minister, Deputy Childers, has made a move to change that position.</P>
      <P>During my period in this House, I have referred again and again to this matter and I have hoped that when a Bill would be introduced, it would cover it and we would get some enlightenment, but no such enlightenment has come on this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an example of what is happening as a result of these pieces of fishing legislation, we need not go beyond a daily paper of this date.  In it, we find <Col N="667" /> it shown that an English visitor&mdash;and I am not against English visitors&mdash;is in the happy position that she had a catch of five salmon, one of 17½ lb. and four of 12 lb. each, taken from the River Blackwater in a reserve belonging to a gentleman whom I do not think it is right to mention.  We have several of these photographs of these fortunate people who are able to come across here to their friends, as a result of our legislation, and come into a stretch of river and take away five salmon in one day.  That is not the position with those who are earning their livelihood from salmon fishing.</P>
    <P>I shall be entirely against the fishery laws until such time as some Minister is strong enough to change this rotten piece of legislation which allows these reserved fisheries to remain in the ownership of these people, the majority of whom, it is no misstatement to say, are not of Irish origin.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister has made no mention of this question and another peculiar fact is that when we mention this matter on the annual Estimate, we are told that it is not relevant and naturally the Ceann Comhairle invokes the powers conferred on him and tells us that we must refrain from mentioning it.  Now we have a chance to mention it to-day in relevant form.</P>

      <P>I should like Deputy Dillon to inform us further, through the Chair, when he contributes to this debate &mdash; if he has not already made his contribution &mdash; and to explain the position and how £ s.d. enters into the question seeing that the present Minister is too reluctant to give us any explanation.  What can we assume?  The only reasonable assumption is that these people are able to exert a great influence on Governments of this country and their influence is so strong that they have precluded all Governments from taking steps to withdraw these rights which they do not justly own.  I am the last Deputy to stand up and advocate interference with private property, but I say to-day that I am on very solid ground.</P>
      <P>Recently I got some information regarding fisheries.  We had one extended stretch of river in Cork, and we found that it was held under a charter granted by Charles II when he was King of England and when this country was subject to him.  I believe that was some 300 years ago.  Surely that charter is not, or should not be, legally or morally binding on any Government of this country to-day.  I assume that if similar inquiries were made regarding all the other reservations, be they stretches of river or lakes, it would be found that the same position obtains&mdash;that in years gone by, possibly hundreds of years ago, the English royalty gave to their loyal subjects in this country certain rights to which they were not entitled and which one would have hoped would have been wiped out as soon as we got charge of our own affairs, seeing that they have no legal basis whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That briefly is the case I have to make, and that is the reason I am making this contribution to the debate, because there is not very much more in this measure.  I ask the Minister: does he intend to give a detailed statement on this question?  He avoided the issue last year on the ground that it was irrelevant to discuss it on the <Col N="669" /> annual Estimate.  Now that it is no longer irrelevant, will he tell us what is behind all this?</P>

      <P>Yes, the Minister would like to assume the powers of the Ceann Comhairle and to say that it is irrelevant, because he does not like a discussion on this matter. He would like to bypass any discussion on it, and I am asking him again in what way is it irrelevant?  In the course of this debate, are we supposed to refer only to rivers which are in the ownership of the State and not to rivers in the ownership of foreigners?</P>

      <P>I submit that, in view of the Minister's statement that my remarks are irrelevant, this Bill must be divided into two parts, and the part relevant to this discussion is on rivers and lakes publicly-owned, where every citizen who obtains the necessary licence has a right to fish. Do we assume that fisheries reserved to the landed gentry, and other such people, are not the subject matter of any debate?  It is peculiar that under our Constitution, and under the guiding rules of Dáil Éireann, whether on a Fisheries Bill or on the Estimate, we are told that it is irrelevant.  When, then, will it become relevant?</P>

      <P>The punishment for breaches of the fishery laws is dealt with in this Bill at reasonable length.  It is an unfortunate position that the majority of people in this country have not &mdash; should I use the term?&mdash;a great respect for the licensing laws.  It is not because the people wish to break the laws or to ignore the laws laid down by this Parliament but because they believe the laws are not in order and that proper fishery legislation has not been enacted by this House.  While these private reservations are allowed to continue, I am afraid disrespect for the fishery laws will also continue.  That is my opinion on that question.</P>
      <P>We have, time and again, the Minister, in his weekly dissertations all over the country, advising people about the observance of the fishery laws and threatening them with severe punishments if they break them, and saying that they are not behaving as respectable citizens in breaking these laws.  Mark you, the answer to that is that we cannot get people to accept these fishery laws laid down here as fair and just with this rotten system in being.</P>
      <P>I shall not delay the House any longer, for there is no need to labour any more this little sample taken from to-day's paper.  It should be sufficient to bring home to the Minister the gravity of this position.  Imagine a struggling fisherman dependent on fishing for his livelihood reading about the fortunate person who can take out salmon &mdash; I do not know the value of it, but I am sure it is worth several pounds &mdash; in one day.  Surely that is not an incentive to him to carry out the law.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to tell us the case for not changing the law and I am asking the previous Minister, Deputy Dillon, who dodged the question &mdash; I think the word &ldquo;dodged&rdquo; is not out of place&mdash;to explain how £ s.d. is a relevant factor in this vital matter for many people.  I am most anxious to get some information from the Minister or the Government on these points.</P>

      <P>I remained here during all the debate except for about five minutes when I found it necessary to leave the House.  Apart from that, I should like to say a word about Deputy Murphy's statement.  When he talks of people owning private fisheries, he must include a number of Irish farmers who also own private fisheries. He must realise also that every citizen has equal rights and it is on that basis that I look upon the owners of fisheries, whether gentry or farmers.  If we are to get anywhere, we must give all the people their rights as citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened very carefully to Deputy O. J. Flanagan and, in the main, I agreed with him, and where I differed from him, I allow there was a case for argument.  He was very concerned about the levy on salmon and while I <Col N="672" /> agree that could be argued, I also believe that since the moneys accruing from that source are used to develop, help and provide for the fishing industry, I do not see why the salmon fisherman should object to it.  It is not a very heavy impost and, as far as I know, salmon fishermen have made no very strenuous objection to it.  A great industry such as the salmon industry, in view of the facilities offered, should be, to some extent, self-supporting, and I support the idea of the Minister in maintaining the levy on salmon fisheries, on the understanding that the moneys from that source are made available to fishery conservators.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with Deputy O.J. Flanagan that the keepers &mdash; in the old days, we called them water bailiffs &mdash; should be well paid for a number of reasons, not least of them the fact that when I lived near a river which was an excellent fishing river, the water bailiffs were the biggest poachers.  I have plenty of evidence of that.  I think the Gardaí should not be asked to preserve the rivers; the fisheries themselves should be able to provide their own police to ensure that fishery laws are carried out meticulously &mdash; I put it that way.</P>
    <P>As far as fines are concerned, it may interest Deputy O.J. Flanagan to know that some months ago, at the request of a number of people, I approached the Department of Justice with a view to having rather heavy fines inflicted down in my county mitigated. I was met by a point-blank refusal and I found, so far as fishery fines are concerned, the Department of Justice was inflexible.  I do not know if other people meet with a more favourable response, but while I was sorry for the people fined, I had to agree with the Department of Justice in that regard.</P>
    <P>I did not agree with Deputy O.J. Flanagan when he objected to an increase in licences and when he said we should give to the people who recognised that our fisheries were amongst the best in the world the cheapest fishing in the world.  I do not see why we should offer these people abroad such cheap fishing.  If our fisheries are worth the money, if they are among <Col N="673" /> the best, the people should pay for them.</P>
    <P>Regarding angling associations and their impact on tourist development for fishery purposes, I believe that anglers, when they control portions of a river, are not over-anxious to let people from outside fish in those portions. In places that I know, the associations would be the last people who would wish to see anglers from abroad coming in.  Rather would they prevent them coming in because it would mean they themselves would have worse fishing, due to the extra people coming in.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of preserving rivers, but I should like to see that the associations would not preserve rivers solely for themselves, but rather in the interests of the country, so that people coming here could, in certain conditions, use the fisheries over which the associations have control.  I should like to see the State acquire certain of our fisheries which could be let to people at home and from abroad.  It is interesting to note that farmers in, we shall say, fresh water sections of the rivers, in the old days when there was net fishing, let their portions above the tidal waters to the net fishermen.  The sum of money they now get from individuals and anglers' associations is several times greater than that which they got from the ordinary net fishermen away back before the 1939 Act was introduced.  I think the people who own these fisheries along the rivers should be under some kind of an obligation to keep not only the rivers but also the river banks in good condition.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I might say I was a member of the Committee of the Seanad which was occupied with the preparation of the Consolidation Bill.  We spent several months on it. That is some years ago.  It involved an immense amount of work going back over fishery laws which extended well over 100 years.  When the Bill is completed, it will do much to help people to get some reasonable grasp of the various complicated laws passed in this country over 100 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy M.P. Murphy spoke trenchantly to-day on the mystifications <Col N="674" /> that have been raised by successive Ministers for Fisheries about the ownership of fishing rights on the rivers of Ireland and he wondered if anything had been done to reverse grants in the reigns of Charles II and James I.  There is no mystery about the matter.  There was a comprehensive Fishery Act passed by this House many years ago.  I think that under Section 5 of that Act every Minister for Fisheries has full power to acquire all the fisheries on every river in Ireland provided he pay for it.  I think it is not an underestimate to say that to buy these fisheries at a fair and honest price would cost some millions.  It has been believed by successive Governments that there is such urgent need of capital for investment in urgent projects that the acquisition of these fisheries by the State must take its place in the appropriate hierarchy of urgencies and await the availability of money to give it effect.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy professes to see in this some sinister results of ulterior interests.  I must acquit my successor in this case because there are no sinister influences at work at all.  There is nothing strange in a civilised and Christian State in providing that the citizens' property will not be expropriated without compensation.  I believe that if anybody tried to do that, the provisions of the Constitution would protect the individual from whom it was proposed to take the property. Nor should Deputy Murphy think this anything very remarkable because I think Deputy Murphy is himself a farmer and presumably owns land.  He probably bought his land under the Land Commission but if he will go to the Land Commission they will show him the original title deeds and Deputy Murphy to his horror may discover that he is paying for land that somebody held under a deed of gift made by Queen Elizabeth if it is situated in County Cork and that the annuity which Deputy Murphy is paying to-day is being used or was being used to discharge the claim of some respectable citizen whose title derived ultimately from a grant made by a British king.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> It is important to remember that in the intervening 300 or 400 years the Murphys, Mulcahys, O'Reillys and even Dillons have paid their hard-earned money to buy in good faith the titles created by these ancient deeds. If Deputy Murphy is buying his land under the Land Commission, he is paying off the money that the Land Commission paid to a man named O'Shaughnessy in respect of land which Mr. O'Shaughnessy had bought from various other parties until you trace back the original title to the source under the feudal system which existed in the sovereign.</P>
    <P>Would it not be very nice if we could undo the story of history?  Unfortunately, history is there and if property created and transferred is to be acquired in our time it must be acquired on the basis of equity and justice.  The only basis upon which we can acquire fishery rights is the same basis as that on which you acquire any other property and that is by paying the owner a fair compensation for it. There is full power in this Minister, and, I think, in every other Minister since 1939, to acquire all the fisheries.</P>
    <P>I think the error into which Deputy Murphy further falls is this.  He imagines it likely that if the State acquired all these fisheries all and sundry would be free to fish.  That would be a very happy state but who will pay the millions, and the interest on the millions, invested in the purchase of these fisheries?  If we reach a state of affluence at which we can purchase them and present them to the community as an amenity to be enjoyed free, gratis and for nothing, that will be a very happy day but in our existing circumstances it is very much more likely, if we acquire these fisheries and compensate the owners, that there will have to be levied on each individual who catches a salmon a fee very much the same as that at present charged by the existing owners.</P>
    <P>Some day, perhaps in the lifetime of Deputy Murphy's grandchildren and my grandchildren we shall reach a stage at which we can restore this agreeable amenity on the public gratis. I think it is right to sound this note <Col N="676" /> of warning.  If we proclaimed in the rivers and lakes of Ireland free fishing for salmon and sea trout they would not be in the rivers long because the country would be invaded by anglers who would catch the salmon.  If the present price of salmon obtained, they would have a very prosperous time sweeping the rivers of this country clean of all the fish in it.  I think nobody would seriously suggest that we should invite all and sundry to draw from the rivers salmon which to-day are worth from £4 to £15 a piece for no greater exertion than fishing with rod, line and fly.</P>
    <P>I have gone into this matter at some length because I think it a pity that Deputy Murphy should labour under the illusion that successive Ministers for Fisheries, including myself and Deputy Flanagan, who was a Parliamentary Secretary, have been influenced by dark and sinister powers because, if that belief were widespread, it would do very material harm to the institutions of the State.  I think Deputy McQuillan was bursting to get to his feet to join his voice to that of Deputy M.P. Murphy in this protest. It might be well for the present Minister not to overlook this kind of illusion because, strangely enough, I think that Deputy Murphy honestly believes that there is some foundation for the suspicion which he entertains, and it is the kind of thing that causes a good deal of public malaise if it is not dealt with categorically and explained, if necessary, again and again.</P>
    <P>I venture to say that this matter has been discussed exhaustively and entirely relevantly on the Estimate almost every year for the last 20 years. Every year it was perfectly relevant on the Estimate to ask the Minister why he did not use the powers he had in the course of the last year to acquire a fishery.  Certainly I was asked that question every year I was directly responsible for fisheries and I believe Deputy Oliver Flanagan was asked that question when he was responsible as Parliamentary Secretary to the House.  On each occasion we explained the matter in great detail but I do not <Col N="677" /> want that fact to discourage the present Minister from taking the same trouble.  It is the kind of thing that crops up continually but it is the kind of thing that should not be left unanswered because it can cause a great deal of unhappiness if people believe that the doubts that Deputy M.P. Murphy has mentioned have any foundation in fact.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Loughman does not understand why the levy on the export of salmon is injurious why does he not ask his colleague, Deputy Cunningharm? Deputy Cunningham represents Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish he would bend his mind to this matter.  What happened was that in 1953 Deputy Bartley, who was then Parliamentary Secretary, gave birth to this notion of a levy on salmon exports and he operated it for one year.  I pointed out to the House that prior to that, during the period when I was Minister for Fisheries and during the first two years of the subsequent Fianna Fáil Administration of <Col N="678" /> 1951 and 1952, there was provided by the Exchequer annually a sum of approximately £10,000 or £12,000 to increase the resources of the boards of conservators whose income from licence and rates was not sufficient to enable them adequately to protect the fisheries.  When the levy had operated for a year and had yielded approximately £10,000 or £11,000 it emerged that the boards of conservators did not get one penny more than they had been getting heretofore.  What happened was that the sum appropriated in the Fisheries Vote out of Exchequer funds was reduced to a token sum of £5 and every penny of the levy was in relief of the liability which the Exchequer was carrying in respect of the deficiencies of the boards of conservators.</P>
      <P>When we came into office in 1954 I argued with the Government that the whole principle of imposing levies on agricultural or fishery exports was bad and that, far from imposing levies on exports, we ought to lay it down as an absolutely iron rule that Oireachtas Éireann would never consent to impose levies on exports.  The Government of which I was a member shared that view and we cancelled the levy but no board of conservators received one penny piece less as a result of that decision.  On the contrary, we paid them 50 per cent. more and our aim during the period from 1954 to 1957 was to try to get all the boards of conservators on to a clean sheet, to wipe out all their arrears and make them self-supporting.</P>
      <P>When this infernal levy principle was introduced before, I said to this House: &ldquo;Watch what you are doing. If you consent to this principle of levying in respect of fishery exports it will be extended to agricultural exports.&rdquo; Who was right?  Is that not what is happening?</P>

      <P>People will ask: &ldquo;What is a levy of 2d. per lb. on salmon, the export price of which is 10/- per lb.?&rdquo; But it is no longer 10/- per lb.  It is 8/- per lb.  It is not so much the amount of the levy, however, that is of consequence; it is not primarily the amount.  What is my primary concern in regard to this is the principle that, simply because you get a profitable market for an agricultural or fishery product, instantly the decision is made to put a levy on it: these fellows are making too much! If you get a profitable market for an industrial product, there is a banquet given in the Gresham Hotel, and the Minister goes down and brings two or three Parliamentary Secretaries with him, and there is a scene of rejoicing and everyone drinks the exporter's health in champagne and says: &ldquo;A most remarkable man!&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Deputy ought to cease these irrelevancies.  He is discussing a levy, or an alleged levy, on agricultural products, while there is no levy on industrial products.  He is clearly discussing this matter on a levy for salmon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Leave out the agricultural levies.  Does this House think it is fair that we should have a levy on exports of fish, salmon, because there is a profitable market for them <Col N="681" /> and because they are the produce of the fishermen around our coast and, at the same time, accept as an incontrovertible principle that there should not be a levy on industrial products?  Does the House think it is fair that, simply because the ordinary fishermen without any ta-rara-boom-de-ay find a profitable market, our reaction ought to be at once: &ldquo;They are getting too much. Let us take some of it from them&rdquo;? But if the manufacturer of boots, or bottles, or any other industrial commodity succeeds in getting an external market, it is made a cause of demonstration and excitement.  The fishermen never send anybody to America to look for a profitable market.  The exporters of fish have never availed of the services of the Industrial Development Authority or Córas Tráchtála Teo.  They have been able to establish, maintain and develop this market, without any of these adventitious aids.  Why does the House think that we should put a levy on them, when, at the same time, we are copiously subsidising anybody who makes even an effort to secure an outlet for industrial exports?  I see no equity in that; I think it is grossly unfair.  I think, further, that it is pregnant of great evil in a much wider field.</P>
      <P>I want to direct Deputy Loughman's attention to this: quite apart from the 2d. per lb., or whatever the levy is, there is all the annoyance&mdash;it is a very great annoyance&mdash;of filling up forms and there is the element of delay which is a perennial nightmare to those who are concerned to get salmon to the London market in a fresh condition. Deputy Cunningham knows all about that.  He did not know it when this levy was first introduced, because he voted for it.  But it has been gradually borne in on him against his own belief and I suggest to Deputy Loughman now that he ought to have a chat with Deputy Cunningham.  Deputy Cunningham is in contact with the fishermen every day.  Deputy Loughman is simply looking at them, as it were, theoretically.</P>

There was a time when Deputy Cunningham shared the view, with a number of his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party, that there should be a levy on exports of salmon.  He no longer shares that view.  The Minister in charge of this Bill says he has received no protests.  Did he hear the protest made here to-day by his colleague, Deputy Cunningham?  What <Col N="684" /> is he going to do about it?

      <P>Courage, courage.  If Deputy Cunningham gets behind the Minister, he might actually get the Minister to stand up to his colleagues in the Government and we might get this matter put right.  The Minister's last intervention was eloquent and pregnant in meaning.  Could I trust Deputy Moher to tell his colleague, Deputy Cunningham, who has now gone, how hopeful the situation is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second thing this Bill makes provision for is the doubling of the salmon rod licence.  That is calculated to bring in £9,000 or £10,000.  I think that is thoroughly bad policy.  That proposal has been excogitated by Ministers for Fisheries for the past ten years.  Deputy Flanagan and I turned it down for this reason.  The most optimistic calculation is that it will earn £9,000 or £10,000.  It was represented to me that a great many people who are themselves salmon fishermen would welcome it.  Mark that &mdash; it is important.  I asked this question: &ldquo;When you say they would welcome it, <Col N="685" /> would you tell me why?&rdquo; The answer was: &ldquo;Because it will reduce the number of rods on the rivers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Every salmon fisherman wants to reduce competition on the rivers, as far as he can.  Those who can afford to pay £4 rejoice at the prospect of that licence fee being charged because it knocks out a certain percentage of persons who could afford £2, but could not afford £4.  From the point of view of the matter referred to by Deputy M. P. Murphy, that we should try to make the amenities of our rivers available to as wide a public as it is within our power to do, and secondly, from the point of view mentioned by Deputy O. J. Flanagan that it is in our interest to proclaim to the world that we have the best and the cheapest fishing available in the world, surely it is a silly economy to relieve the Exchequer to the tune of £9,000 or £10,000 at the expense of doubling the cost of a salmon licence in this country?</P>
    <P>The Minister is right in making one licence operative for the whole country.  From that point of view, I welcome the procedure envisaged in this Bill of drawing all the fees into a common pool and then paying them out to the boards of conservators thereafter. But I am certain he is making a grave mistake by doubling the cost of the salmon licence.  I am sure it was very good publicity for the fishing amenities of this country in our tourist literature that we were charging only £2 for a salmon licence.</P>
    <P>Mark you, I think I am right in saying if you wish to fish for sea trout in the early part of the year, you must have a salmon licence; you cannot catch sea trout without a salmon licence.  I see the Minister has made provision for those who fish only for the autumn run of sea trout, but there are rivers where the sea trout runs in June or earlier.  If you wish to fish for sea trout or salmon, you must have a salmon licence.  I know it is possible to buy a licence for a week or for an intermediate period, but the fact that these qualifications of the basic charge exist reinforces the view that the publicity of having salmon fishing available in this country at a licence fee of £2 is worth infinitely more than the <Col N="686" /> revenue which it is hoped to derive from the increase in the salmon licence.  I strongly advise the Minister, even if he gets the power conferred by this Bill, not to increase the rod licence fee.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I want to endorse what Deputy O.J. Flanagan has said about the buyer of illegally caught salmon. I do not want to particularise too precisely, but the truth is that the preservation of salmon is so important and the preservation of game fish generally is so important to this country that it is not an exaggeration to compare the buyer of illegally caught fish with the receiver of stolen goods.  I have always believed it was profoundly true that if there were no receivers of stolen goods, there would be comparatively few thieves.  It is the receiver who begets the thief; it is the trader in illegally caught salmon who begets the poacher.</P>
    <P>This has to be borne in mind.  I tried to emphasise it when I was Minister and I commend to the present Minister the desirability of doing it now.  There is all the difference in the world &mdash; and I hope I will not shock anybody by saying it&mdash;in my judgment, between the moral quality of the act of a man who goes in on preserved waters with a rod, line and salmon fly and in the process of trespass catches a salmon in respect of which he ought to have paid a day's rent to the proprietor of the fishery&mdash;in my judgment, it is the business of the owner of the fishery to catch that fellow and exact his fee, if he is fit to do so &mdash; and the act of a man who goes out by night to stroke-haul, to throw explosives into a river or poison a river for the purpose of stunning fish and taking them illegally.</P>
    <P>It is the latter category of persons who, I believe, are encouraged and whose activities are promoted by the individuals, be they dealers or hotel proprietors, who are prepared to deal in illegally caught fish.  It is the latter category of persons upon whom, I have always felt, the full rigour of the law should be visited.  Unless we are prepared to face the fact that there is a fundamental difference in the moral quality of these two parallel offences, we will not get the public sympathy <Col N="687" /> and support or full effective enforcement of the law.  I believe that 90 per cent. of the people are prepared cordially to support the enforcement of any law against explosives, poisoning, stroke-hauling or illegitimate engines for the capture of sporting fish, but not 5 per cent. of the population are prepared to support the employment of the forces of boards of conservators or of the Garda to enforce the title of proprietors to the fish in their proprietary waters.</P>
    <P>The general feeling is that that is an offence partaking more of the quality of trespass than poaching in the evil sense of the word and I made it perfectly clear, when Minister for Fisheries, that I was not much interested in the vindication of these proprietary rights, although I fully recognised the right of the proprietor to enforce his right in the courts of civil law, but that I was prepared to justify the fullest possible rigour of the law in connection with the illegitimate form of capturing fish.</P>
    <P>It has to be borne in mind that it is one of the great difficulties, that there are people, frequently resident in extremely remote parts of the country, up at the head of rivers where salmon go to spawn, who will capture salmon which to the normal kind of person appears to be virtually uneatable.  Yet they will go to the greatest rounds to go over and capture them at the spawning bed, completely indifferent to the consequences not only of the capture of the fish itself but of the havoc that is wrought upon the spawning bed disturbed.  Nothing can check that but careful supervision of the rivers by adequately paid keepers.</P>
    <P>Serious as is the damage that such persons do, it is relatively insignificant compared to the activities of the organised poachers who are, or were until recently, in my experience, using fleets of motor cars very frequently, and ultimately reaching a stage in certain areas in which their resources far outstripped the resources of the officers of the boards of conservators to grapple with them.  Such persons should be harried and pursued with all the resources that the law disposes of <Col N="688" /> because in certain cases they were assuming the guise and practice for which the word &ldquo;gangsterism&rdquo; is not too strong.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Oliver Flanagan is right to draw the attention of the House to a most extraordinary dichotomy that exists in the enforcement of fishery laws, that is, that when the district justice or the appropriate court convicts for a fishery offence and imposes a penalty, if the person penalised seeks clemency he is entitled to appeal to the Minister for Justice. The practice is that the Minister for Justice consults the Minister for Fisheries but, unfortunately, the practice has become established that the Minister for Justice does not feel himself bound by the recommendation of the Minister for Fisheries.</P>
    <P>There have been cases where the Minister for Fisheries has strongly urged that there should be no remission of the penalty but, his advice notwithstanding, the penalty has been remitted, on certain occasions to the great scandal of the general public who were not aware of all the circumstances of the case.  Without going into further and better particulars, I can only confirm what Deputy Oliver Flanagan said in respect of one peculiarly glaring case of which I believe the Minister has knowledge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it did not happen during that period but it is illustrative of the deplorable dichotomy that exists in regard to this matter.  Interestingly enough, I think, with regard to sea fishery offences, it is the Minister for Fisheries who is the final authority because I remember refusing to return gear to aggrieved persons who had been captured within our fishery limits and from that decision I do not think there was any further reference but, in regard to poaching offences, the other situation obtains and I think it ought to be put right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> If you do succeed in eliminating that dichotomy, you will not withhold clemency from certain offenders because, no matter how resolved you may be firmly and resolutely to maintain a uniform rule that there shall be no remission of penalties in any circumstances, experience teaches that a case will turn up where the hardship of the full penalty being visited in the special circumstances of some defendant is so wildly disproportionate that it is the duty of a conscientious Minister to invoke the clemency which it is in his power to bestow.</P>
    <P>I have very little doubt that it would be a great improvement if the final responsibility were put on the Minister for Fisheries because at the present time it is very often difficult to determine on whose shoulders the responsibility should lie for such remissions as are made available.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to refer to is the position with regard to the Owenea river.  I know how difficult this problem is.  I assume the Minister accepts the general principle which was established in the Department of Fisheries by myself, or somebody, that where there are two competitive tenders for a fishery in the possession of the Department of Fisheries or the Land Commission, one coming from a local body of anglers and the other coming from any individual or group of individuals other than a group of local anglers, preference is given to the group of local anglers.  That creates a difficulty because groups of local anglers are not always as public-spirited as they might be.</P>
    <P>In one year they readily concede that a fair rent for a fishery is £800 and they know, perhaps, that somebody else has bid £900 but, operating the rule of preference for the local men, they are given the fishery for £800. The following year the fishery is put up for tender again and this time the local boys bid £500 and they announce that they are now the sitting tenants and, if anybody comes in now to become grabbers of their property, they will know the reason why.  If they get away with that, the following year they will offer £300, until eventually they will offer a token sum.</P>
    <P>Of course, the easy thing is for the <Col N="690" /> Minister to make himself popular with the local boys.  It does not matter to the Minister, personally, whether the fishery is let for 6d. or £1,000, but the Minister has a public duty; he is the custodian of private property and has a duty imposed upon him to get a fair price for it.  There is no way of getting a fair price for it except by putting it up to tender and the Minister would be wrong to give it to anyone other than the highest bidder if he did not come to the House, as I think I did on more than one occasion and asked in my Estimate for the approval of the general principle that I should have discretion, which I was entitled to exercise within reasonable limits, in favour of a local angling association rather than a private individual.  That discretion can be made inoperative if the local angling association is not prepared to act reasonably.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that with regard to the Owenea river the local angling association was not prepared to act reasonably.  They were prepared to act reasonably when they were prepared to offer £500 a year for this fishery.  The Minister wanted £800 and, when they failed to arrive at an agreement, the Minister, in discharge of what he believed to be his duty, said: &ldquo;Very well; I will retain the fishery and rent it to individual rods.&rdquo; The result is that the income of the fishery is probably substantially less than the £500 which the local anglers' association were prepared to give.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any point on this.  I do not want to suggest that the Minister was guilty of any nefarious conspiracy.  I think, however, he would have acted fairly, if he had said to the local anglers' association: &ldquo;I am prepared to give you the fishery for £500 a year for a term of years, with a clear understanding that I will not renew it for less and, if you are not prepared to meet me, then, I have a duty to the public purse and, even though I get more or less, I would have to let it out to individual rods.&rdquo;  This again would prevent the rent of a valuable fishery of that kind being beaten down by local pressure.  If the Minister had made such an offer, he would have given full and fair effect to the principle <Col N="691" /> that the local anglers' associations should have some preference, but not a right of coercive power over the Minister for Lands in the discharge of his public duty.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, suggest to the Minister that he might reconsider the whole situation with regard to the Owenea river.  I have some experience of the problem of letting it on a satisfactory basis and the Minister, I think, should make an offer something on the lines I now suggest, so that nobody may be left under a sense of grievance and, in the meantime, the Minister may derive from the river something approximating a fair and adequate return.</P>

      <P>With reference to Deputy Dillon's comment on rod licences, once a visiting angler secures one, the next question is where he is to use the rod, and that is where the trouble comes in.  I had hoped, when I heard that a new fishery law was to be passed here with regard to inland fisheries, that the law would come to fundamentals and remove the injustices.  We cannot expect any law which is built on injustice to be respected anywhere.  On the borders of my constituency there is a gentleman known as the Duke of Devonshire who got a charter from Queen Elizabeth, handing a whole stretch of water over to himself.  His descendants carried on with the game and I wonder if the Minister ever inquired, or if he could tell us, the number of hundreds of salmon lifted with a four-pronged fork out of that gentle-man's fishing trap during a season.</P>

      <P>I would also like to know, considering the number of years we are supposed to have freedom here, how a gentleman holding a charter from Queen Elizabeth of England, is <Col N="692" /> entitled to come down into the town of Youghal and extract from the ordinary fishermen there, on foot of that charter, anything from £12 to £16 per licence to enable those Republican fishermen to earn their livelihoods in Irish Republican waters?  Those are the things I should like to have removed. We got freedom from the landlords by land legislation and we think we should now get rid of that type of landlordism.  The Minister need not expect, and nobody in this country need expect, that there will be any respect for the law that protects such a gentleman in the levying of tribute on Irish Republican fishermen for fishing in Irish Republican waters.</P>
      <P>In another part of my constituency, in Fermoy, we have another extraordinary condition of affairs.  We have men who purchased land under the Land Acts paying rates and annuities for the bed of a river in which they are not allowed to fish, while that same joker, Lord So-and-So, has a right to walk along the bank, which must be kept clear of briars so that he can walk along it to take out fish.  I was a member of a deputation that waited on Deputy Blowick, when he was Minister for Lands, in connection with that.  I know there have been three Supreme Court cases in connection with it, but the injustice is still there. I know, if it were on my land, they would not get the golliwog that swims on a boggy hole in Deputy Flanagan's constituency, and I make no bones about it.  So long as you seek to implement unjust laws in this country, so long will you fail.</P>
      <P>The valuation of holdings in that neighbourhood is something around 35/- a statute acre.  A farmer pays 38/- in the £ on that and he pays 38/- a £ on the bed of that river in which Lord So-and-So across the water fishes, or sells to another Lord So-and-So. Deputy Dillon is very anxious that nobody should get a salmon from such a man and I hope the Minister will deal with this in legislation.</P>

      <P>I say it is a waste of time and public money to introduce legislation here from time to time in an endeavour to protect injustice, because injustice cannot be protected. You have to come to the fundamentals first.  You have to get rid of the Duke of Devonshire.  In the town of Lismore, there is a fish trap into which the unfortunate salmon go.  Every morning, the Duke's fisherman comes along, not with rod and line, but with a four-pronged fork, and he forks them out for export.  That is the law for one man.  For the other man, if he goes out with a strocáil to get a bit of fish for his Friday dinner, the length and breadth of the law is applied to him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon seemed to be indignant because the Minister for Justice had not consulted him before he reduced fishery fines.  Let us see where we stand in relation to this matter.  Let us see if we are going to protect those whom we ought to protect.  So long as you have laws in this country protecting those other people, these laws will be treated with contempt and I clap the man on the back who treats them with contempt.  A few years ago, I happened to be called down by the Youghal fishermen in connection with this matter.  The Duke's&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, that is what I am doing.  I am telling the Minister what, in my opinion, should be in the Bill. Some few years ago, I was called to a meeting of unfortunate fishermen in Youghal.  The noble Duke had increased their licence leavy or the tribute they had to pay.  I asked the fishermen what would happen if they refused to pay.  They told me they had wives and children and were depending for their livelihood on the few months' fishing and that if they did not get the licence, they could not fish.  Unfortunately, they did not give me much time to consider the matter because they were meeting the Duke's agent the following morning.  I went with two of the fishermen the following morning, accompanied by the former Senator O'Gorman.  I explained my position.  I said I was a Deputy in a Republican Parliament.  I pointed out that this was a Republic and that I could not recognise any charter of Queen Elizabeth giving any gentleman a right to collect a tribute from Irish Republican fishermen for fishing in Irish Republican waters.  &ldquo;However,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;since this damn thing must be done to-day, I am prepared to give way this much.  We will give you last year's money.&rdquo; That was £12.  The Duke's agent replied that his instructions were to take £17.</P>

      <P>These are the mistakes that are made.  Unfortunately, Minister for Fisheries after Minister for Fisheries has come in here and started to build up laws for the protection of fish on an unjust fundamental law that already exists.  The first thing that must be done, before we waste time discussing these things, is to amend the fundamental law.  So long as you leave that unjust law there, you might as well be idle as bring in Bills of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do you mean to tell me that any man born and reared in this country will look on and view as just a law by which one man is prosecuted because he is found with a rod fishing for salmon without a licence, whilst at the same time another gentleman has a right, by the same law, to fork out that salmon with a fork and pike? That is what is wrong with laws in this country.  We got rid of the landlord. Here is a worse landlord still&mdash; a man who can come along at the start of the year and say: &ldquo;You paid me £20 last year.  Pay me £40 this year or you will not fish.&rdquo;  The unfortunate man has no alternative, no court, no redress whatever, except to pay the £40 to that blasted highlander or get out.  Where is the basis of justice and honesty in <Col N="696" /> all that?  These are the things which I think should first be brought in here by any Minister for Fisheries if he wants to get at the root of the problem and have our fishery laws respected. You cannot have respect for a law of that type.  Consider the case of the unfortunate man who has a farm in Carey's Glen, Fermoy.  He is paying 38/- in the £ on a valuation of 30/- or 35/- an acre for four acres of the very river in which he has no right to fish.</P>

      <P>I should like Deputy Corry to sit and listen for two minutes while I tell him a little story.  He protested &mdash; rightly, in my opinion &mdash; against the owners of several fisheries and the owners of private fisheries increasing the rental to the local man who wants to fish.  I am in full agreement with him.  However, I want to tell a story about his colleague, the present Minister for Lands.  The State owns a river in County Donegal called the Owenea river.  They rent that river annually. Some years ago, I persuaded &mdash; with the assistance of Deputy Breslin and Deputy J. Brennan &mdash; the then Minister, Deputy Dillon, to let that river to the local anglers' association.  Deputy Dillon did so, and he charged the local anglers' association a rental of £400 per year.</P>

What was the reply they received from the Minister for Fisheries?  &ldquo;Not one penny less than £800 will I accept fo it&rdquo;&mdash;with the result that he did not give them the river this year.</P>

He is so disgusted that he will leave the House, but if the Minister cracks his fingers or if I demand a division, Deputy Corry would very soon come to heel, come back and support him. That is a little story which bears repetition; I did not intend to mention it, were it not that Deputy Corry drew me.  That is what the present Minister did to the local anglers in a town in my part of the county.</P>
      <P>I had no intention of intervening in this debate, were it not for the Minister's remarks on the export levy on salmon.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, in 1953 the then Minister for Fisheries imposed a levy of 2d. per lb. on the export of salmon during the year up to the 1st June and 1d. per lb. thereafter.  Salmon and agriculture are the only things on which we pay levies on their exportation.  As Deputy Dillon also pointed out, if we wish to procure a market for the exportation of some industrial product, we get up and cheer and congratulate each other and send ambassadors abroad to find such markets.  The fishermen have no person to send abroad to find markets for their fish, but when they have found a very good market &mdash; as they have in Britain to-day&mdash;we clamp down an export bounty on salmon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1953 it was explained to us by the person then in charge of this Vote that the reason this export bounty was being imposed was to add to the funds of the local boards of conservators and that, by increasing the funds available to those boards, we would improve the fisheries.  At that time, the State contributed approximately £10,000 or £12,000 a year to assist local boards of conservators whose funds were depleted.  In the first year this export bounty was imposed, a sum of approximately between £10,000 and £12,000 was collected under it.  Did that go to supplement the State contribution to the boards?  No.  Immediately that sum was available, the Minister withdrew the State Grant-in-Aid to the boards and the only contribution they received in that year was the money <Col N="698" /> subscribed by the poor unfortunate fishermen by way of export bounty.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dillon became Minister for Fisheries in June, 1954, he immediately abolished that export bounty and again made the State contribute, to aid this valuable industry, a sum of £10,000 or £12,000 to the boards of conservators.  Immediately the present Minister came into office, he reimposed this export duty on salmon.  To-day, when Deputy Dillon mentioned that fact, the Minister interjected that he received no protest whatever from any person against this abominable imposition on fishermen.  I protested on four different occasions in this House and now, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I want to protest again on behalf of the fishermen of West Donegal.</P>
    <P>I invite my colleagues, Deputy Brennan and Deputy Breslin, to come in here and support me in protesting to the Minister against this imposition of 2d. per lb. on salmon.  I know that I have my colleagues behind me.  I am aware that I have my colleagues, Deputies Brennan and Breslin, behind me and all I ask them to do is to come in here and raise their voices on this matter.  The Minister apparently has an open mind on it.  He says that he has received no protest and he indicated that it was not his special view that this levy should be imposed.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that he got no protest.  Perhaps if my colleagues join me in protest we may persuade the Minister to drop his levy and go back to the Cabinet and persuade them to make the contribution to the conservators' funds which we are asking these unfortunate fishermen to make.  I invite not only my colleagues in West Donegal but my colleagues from East Donegal&mdash;my colleagues who represent the fishermen of Downings. I also invite Deputy Corry, who represents the fishermen of Youghal, to join with me in protesting to the Minister against this imposition and this levy imposed on these unfortunate drift net fishermen and draft fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind the gentlemen referred <Col N="699" /> to by Deputy Corry, the gentlemen who procure their fish with a four-pronged fork.  I do not mind the Minister imposing an export levy of 6d. or 1/- a lb. on the gentlemen who use traps on the river, who use what the Minister gave to the E.S.B. on the River Erne, permission to use a trap without even a gap in it.  I do not mind the levy being imposed on them.  I object, and object vehemently, to a levy being imposed on poor unfortunate drift net fishermen of 2d. per lb. I know I am speaking for my colleagues and I know they will come in and support me in protesting to the Minister against this levy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in this debate.  First, I want to congratulate the Minister on introducing this measure.  At the same time, I should like to say that I am somewhat disappointed that the measure he has produced is not more comprehensive.  I had expected that provision would have been made in this amending legislation for many deficiencies in the existing fishery code. However, I understand that the Bill now introduced is only the forerunner of a number of other measures to come before us in due course.  For what it is worth, and as it deals with a limited part of the fishery industry, I welcome the Bill.</P>
      <P>This measure in itself will be very useful, particularly in the early part of the fishing season; but, of course, I take it that it will not be law before the end of the present season.  I am particularly glad that the Minister has changed the system of licensing and has made provision now for short period licences&mdash;for periods of a week, a month and part-season.  Now that these licences are being issued at a very nominal rate of duty, they will be very useful and should be of great assistance to our tourist industry. Heretofore, I understand that some boards of conservators did manage to issue part-time licences, but on the whole the arrangement was not sufficiently widespread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another difficulty which existed in the past&mdash;I am glad to see that it has now been removed&mdash;is the fact that <Col N="700" /> licences issued by a board of conservators, at the full rate, can now be used in any other area under the jurisdiction of other boards in the State.  That is a very good arrangement and one that will be appreciated very much by tourists coming in here to exploit the fishing potentialities of our rivers.  The increase in the licence duty, under all headings, is nominal and I am quite sure that there will be very little cause for complaint by licensed anglers and any other interests associated with the fishing industry, in so far as that part of the Bill is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided in the Bill for the setting up of a Salmon Conservancy Fund.  As I understand it, that proposal is similar to the levy that we have heard discussed by previous speakers.  Evidently, the levy was first introduced in 1953 and was on all salmon exported, at the rate of 2d. per lb.  At a later period, that levy was removed by the succeeding Government, and we are told that the money necessary to feed the fund, that the levy was intended for, came from another source.</P>
    <P>I can say that I am in a position to vouch for what the Minister has stated with regard to the proposed levy so far as my part of the country is concerned. I represent an area that has a very great interest in inland fishing, as well as in deep-sea fishing, and I can state, without fear of contradiction, that there is no protest forthcoming from any of the interests involved in that area with regard to the introduction of the proposed salmon levy.  In fact, the contrary is the case and a number of boards of conservators have actually recommended the introduction of this levy.  I am rather inclined to think that the board of conservators which administers the affairs of the Limerick area&mdash;it extends to the Feale and its tributaries&mdash;did actually recommend the levy to the Minister.</P>
    <P>We all know that at present there is a great need for salmon hatcheries. These hatcheries are being initiated, controlled and generally maintained by voluntary organisations in the form of hatchery associations.  I think it is far too much to expect voluntary bodies of that kind to continue indefinitely to <Col N="701" /> maintain hatcheries.  I feel that now it will be possible for those organisations to get substantial assistance from this fund.  I hope the Minister will preserve the fund as a separate entity and will ensure that all the moneys that go into it from the levies will go back into the industry to generally improve our fisheries, particularly the fisheries of the inland waters from which a substantial portion of the fund will be derived.</P>
    <P>In recent years, we have been fortunate in getting our fishermen to become more public-spirited than they were in years gone by and in every district now you will find anglers' associations representative of the angling interests in the area and, apart from that, you will also find a number of hatchery development associations. Both bodies are very important to the fishing industry, which, as we know, has come to the forefront in recent years and particularly during the past 12 months.  They are voluntary organisations and, in their own way, are doing very useful and important work on behalf of the industry.  I feel, however, that eventually it will prove difficult for those organisations to work as unincorporated bodies.  The Minister should provide, either in this measure by way of amendment, or alternatively, by separate legislation, assistance for the operation of these bodies.</P>
    <P>There are many ways the Minister could assist them.  Whilst I would not for a moment suggest that anything should be done which would discourage the voluntary spirit that exists amongst the members of these associations, I feel that steps should be taken now to try to have the relative associations registered as companies limited by guarantee.  Encouragement should be given to those bodies on somewhat similar lines to that which An Bord Fáilte gives to tourist development associations where important work is to be done in a district in connection with the provision of social amenities or the extension of certain tourist activities.</P>
    <P>A number of people are facilitated to come together by An Bord Fáilte and in so far as the costs of initiating the limited liability company are <Col N="702" /> usually paid by the board, it is, in my opinion, very helpful.  It provides for the continuity of these local organisations. It is much easier for an organisation that is registered in that way, and which has certain statutory responsibilities placed on it, to continue. Our experience of all these voluntary organisation is that they start off with very good intentions and when they have got a lot of important work to do, they work very well.  In due course, however, when the important work that they have in hands usually comes to an end they find themselves in the position of not being able to carry on very easily.  I was hoping that the Minister might give some recognition to those bodies on the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>There is no provision made in the Bill with regard to the election of boards of conservators.  I take it that, in the legislation that is to follow, the Minister will keep that matter in mind, because the present system is very lopsided, very ineffective and generally unsatisfactory.  That has proved so particularly in recent years.  I have received a large number of complaints about the abuses and imperfections of the arrangements for the election of boards of conservators; I think that, now that these bodies are expected to do so much, and are charged with extra responsibility, it is desirable that adequate steps should be taken to regularise the position regarding their election.  I hope when the Minister comes to deal with that part of the fishery code he will bear in mind the remarks I have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of speaking on this Bill, but when I heard my Kerry colleague state that he had heard no protest against the 2d. per lb. export levy on salmon, I thought it was about time I rose to contradict that.  I now protest against it, just as Deputy O'Donnell has previously protested.  It may be true that no protest was made by way of meetings and so forth, because, in the ordinary way, when a Bill is introduced in this House and some reference is made to it in the Press, the ordinary fisherman never knows the contents of that Bill, nor does he take very much interest <Col N="703" /> in it.  It is, therefore, the duty of the representatives of the people to express their views here and to state that if the people of North Kerry did not protest against the 2d. per lb. salmon levy, I can assure the House that the fishermen of South Kerry have done so.</P>
      <P>It is rather strange that this levy which was first imposed&mdash;in 1952 or 1953, I think&mdash;by the Minister for Agriculture and abolished by the new Minister in 1954, should now be brought in in a Bill so that in the future it will require an amending Bill to remove it.  Deputy Moloney said boards of conservators are in its favour: I do not doubt that.  I am not speaking on their behalf, but on behalf of the fishermen because anyone can realise that the 2d. per lb. levy on salmon exported will be imposed on fishermen.  Those who purchase salmon for export will reduce the price of salmon to that extent.  That is a very serious matter for those who have to make their living by fishing.  It is also a very serious matter for many to have rod licences increased.  There may be some good point there, such as having rod licences for a fortnight or a month for people on holidays, but the increase means a great deal to a man who tries to make his living by fishing in that way.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why it is, having had our own Government for almost 40 years, that no steps have been taken to ensure that our fisheries will belong to the people of the country and not to foreigners, because that is really the position.  It is an impossible position, of which I shall give an instance.  There is a river in Kerry called the Inny, one of the best fishing rivers in the country. It is near Waterville.  Probably because of the position of landlordism long ago, the farmers and landowners on one bank of the river own fishing rights.  They can fish the river themselves or let fishing rights to the hotels in Waterville or to anybody else.  The landowners on the other side of the river cannot fish; the rights belong to the landlord, wherever he may be.  The rights belong to foreigners and is that not a most peculiar position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> Possibly in other parts of the country similar situations may exist, but it is about time some steps were taken by the Government to ensure that the fishing rights, the inland fisheries, belong to the people of the country. When the landlords sold their estates, some of them gave the fishing rights to the people and some of them withheld those rights.  One way of dealing with the matter would be, where the rights were withheld, to introduce legislation giving the rights back to the people.  Another way would be to nationalise the whole fishing industry, to bring it under State ownership, although I do not like nationalisation. Something should be done to rectify the matter because it is a kind of mixum-gatherum scheme, this whole inland fisheries business.  If we have rights to the fisheries within the territorial waters, why should we not also have rights to all inland fisheries within the State?</P>
    <P>While I protest against the levy on salmon and against the increase in salmon rod licences, I hold this sort of legislation is only a makeshift, and it is time some Government got down to the whole business of the inland fisheries and brought in a comprehensive Bill by which the fishing rights of the country will be brought into the ownership of the people of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate started in reasonable calm and then we had some&mdash;I think&mdash;entirely unjustifiable explosive outbursts against the proposals in the Bill.  I must admit that Deputy O.J. Flanagan on rather rare occasions does speak moderately and he described the Bill as one that was not extreme in any sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I should like to deal with the question of the reason for continuing the salmon levy and increasing the rod licence fees.  I am very anxious that those concerned in this vital industry, which is largely administered by boards of conservators who are, more or less, co-operative organisations, consisting of rodsmen and netsmen and owners, should work together for the protection of their fisheries, should be as far as possible free from the whim of the Minister for Finance from year to year.  I am very <Col N="705" /> keen that they should have for themselves certain basic revenues coming from the industry, revenues which will be sufficient to support their expenses, leaving the Minister for Finance to provide any extra sums required for long-term development here by way of grant or loan.</P>
    <P>I felt that an industry in which the price of the product had increased four times since before the last World War and which had a certain sale for the product available could provide basic revenue through increased rod licence fees and through salmon export levies, so that at least we could ensure that the money available was sufficient for adequate protection.  I should make it clear to the House that, in spite of the increase in rates, if one were to take the actual value of money at the present time as compared with 1939, we would still need, on the basis of 1957 expenditure by boards, another £2,000 in order to recoup the fall in the value of money.  It is perfectly obvious that a great many boards require permanent aid in the form of increased revenues, not simply revenue for particular purposes or for development. They need more money for their ordinary administration and ordinary protection.  I want to reiterate that there has been no noticeable protest against the salmon levy since it was introduced some months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Boards of conservators have not in a general way protested and I have been going back in my mind in regard to the matter.  I can say definitely that there has been no substantial protest against the reintroduction of the export levy.  Part of the reason is that the amount is a very modest one of 2d. per lb.  The average price for salmon in the year 1957 was 6/1.  That is not an enormous impost having regard to the price of salmon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of salmon is going down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very high in the early part of the season.  There <Col N="706" /> was a fall in the price last year, due to the sudden importation of large quantities of frozen Japanese salmon on the British market, but its effect was not very prolonged.  I want to make clear to the House the fact that the whole of the proceeds of the salmon levy and rod licences will go to the boards of conservators.  In addition, I hope the Minister for Finance will make available some subvention whenever possible.  This year the Minister for Finance is making £6,000 available from State funds in addition to the proceeds from the Salmon Conservancy Fund.  Next year, I hope, if I can prove the need for additional assistance, he will provide further funds.</P>
      <P>I should make it clear that the total grants to boards have increased in recent years.  In the year 1955-56, for example, the total amount paid out of the various resources of the State was £13,250.  This year, the total amount made available will be £21,000, which should go a long way towards assisting boards of conservators in their work of protection.  It would be difficult to find any case outside the industry where a Government is expected to compensate very largely for the fall in the value of money which has taken place since 1939.  I am trying to stabilise the position and ensure that boards of conservators will have a constant revenue in the future.  With salmon 6/1 per lb. on an average, in 1957, as compared with 1/8 in 1939, I do not think the increase in rod licence fees is excessive.</P>
      <P>The next thing I want to make clear is that I am perfectly certain that, even after these rod licences have been increased, not only will the fishing be excellent in this country but it will still be relatively cheap.  In regard to fishermen's expenses, the amounts he may have to pay if he rents a bank from a private owner and adding in the increase in the rod licence, it will still be relatively inexpensive fishing compared with that to be found in Great Britain or other countries where there are salmon fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have come to the aid of both coarse and game fishermen by providing a total of £20,000 more through Bord Fáilte and the Inland <Col N="707" /> Fisheries Trust for the development of our inland fisheries.  Although it is true that a proportion of that money is being spent on coarse fishing development, a very considerable amount is being spent on game fishing. Boards of conservators will benefit indirectly from the work of Bord Fáilte and the Inland Fisheries Trust.</P>
    <P>If anyone says that the Minister for Finance or the Government are deserting the cause of the inland fishermen, I can only say that the increase in the amount available from Bord Fáilte and the Inland Fisheries Trust shows the contrary to be the case.  Apart from that, Deputy O.J. Flanagan made some observations on the Inland Fisheries Trust in which I heartily concur.  I hope more anglers will join the trust.  There are some 2,800 members who pay 7/6 a year and 7/6 is not an excessive sum.  The larger the membership, the more work can be done to develop salmon fisheries, trout, coarse fisheries and the rest.  The whole industry will get strong and advance in every way.  I should make it clear that the Inland Fisheries Trust is co-operating with Bord Fáilte and is in complete harmony with them for the improvement of salmon fishing.</P>
    <P>References were also made in the course of the debate to the necessity for support by hotels.  I should like to call upon the hotel industry, those of them who have not given support, to contribute more to the work of the trust and contribute more in coordinating the efforts of all the local associations in developing the salmon industry.  As everyone knows, and as Deputy O.J. Flanagan said, publicity is the life of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>A number of excellent anglers' guides have been prepared by local associations.  More are required. Above all, we need information as to the kind of fishing available, access to fisheries, the charges made, the exact location of the fisheries, hotel, boarding house and guest house accommodation, the availability of bait and so on. All that information needs to be coordinated if the full value is to be obtained from what is being done by the Inland Fisheries Trust, the boards <Col N="708" /> of conservators and the anglers associations in developing the salmon industry and the rest of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I should say again, to justify the increases in rod licences and the continuation of the salmon levy, that more publicity is being undertaken abroad. Deputy O.J. Flanagan and some other Deputies suggested that was essential. A new edition of the <i>Angling Guide</i> has been published with maps and is available at a very moderate price to the public.  Teams of anglers have been brought over this year in greater numbers than ever.  During the year, films will be produced which will be shown abroad.  Every step possible is being taken to draw more angling tourists to this country.  As I said before, I feel that our fishing facilities are improving and the total charges made, even after the payment of the increased rod licences, will be found to be very reasonable compared with those elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with what a number of Deputies said about poaching.  I agree that co-operation by the whole community is essential.  I am examining the question of penalties in connection with the second Fisheries Bill which will come along later.  I have taken an absolute tough attitude in regard to the mitigation of penalties. I will continue that.  In that connection, I feel that the Minister for Justice and myself are reasonably of one mind on the subject.  I have no reason to feel that there is any divergence of opinion on the necessity for preventing poaching because the salmon industry is a vital national industry, with a large export potential.  If it is properly developed and the spawn stocks are preserved, it should give a very good deal of direct and indirect employment in the future and bring a good deal of money to the country.</P>
    <P>Even at the moment, there are 5,000 persons employed in the inland fishing industry in various capacities.  I speak of the industry as a whole because every type of fishing is of importance to the life of the State and one simply cannot have a sentimental attitude towards poaching.  I am told by certain people that poaching is a traditionally Irish thing.  I find that poaching <Col N="709" /> is infinitely worse in a great many other countries.  It is run by organised criminal gangs in countries that should know better.  The suggestion that there is something peculiarly Irish about poaching is absolute nonsense.  It is a universal form of theft of people's private property, and as it can deplete vital stocks required to ensure a growth in the numbers of the salmon in the rivers we must take a stern attitude towards it.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the need for consultation in connection with the Bill which we shall be bringing before the House and in which we intend to make other changes which will be of advantage to the administration of the boards of conservators.  I should say that we intend to invite proposals from the board of conservators and we may have discussions with them, if necessary, in order that we can see what is required.  There is a considerable amount of controversy in regard to a great deal of legislation affecting boards of conservators and a great many arguments can be produced on both sides.  One small example is that some people will say that one should have a postal ballot for the election of members; other people will say that that would not be fair.  That is a typical example of the difficulties of formulating proposals of this kind, but every effort will be made to prepare the further Bill as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The River Owenea in Donegal was mentioned.  I feel that the State should not be allowed to lose money on the operation of the only salmon fishery we have in the Department.  We made arrangements to issue individual tickets for fishing on the river and I think the results will be satisfactory. I do not believe there will be any source of complaint by anybody.</P>

      <P>In connection with the provision of licences for fish farms, I am glad to inform the House that a company has already purchased land and intends to start the first large-scale commercial trout farm in this country.  With that example and the example of the State fish farm at Roscrea, I hope there will begin a new era in which money can be made by farmers through trout farming.  This is an industry which has been found to be highly profitable in countries where the weather is worse, where the water conditions are not so satisfactory and where exports of fish farm trout can rise to the figure of 1,500,000 in a year.</P>
      <P>This is an industry which involves technical knowledge.  It involves a certain amount of co-operation, but at least a start has been made with the proposed establishment of one private commercial fish farm.  That is why we have inserted a provision in respect of licences to collect trout from farms out of season, and with the further example of the Roscrea fish farm, which should be open on April 28th, I think we can make progress in that industry.  It should be a very useful sideline for farmers living on rivers where the water conditions are suitable and where the conditions are suitable for bringing the fish for deep freezing and consequential export.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Deputy it is not on the Barrow.  I think I have dealt with every other item except the questions raised by Deputy Michael Murphy and Deputy Corry in which they attacked the private ownership of salmon fisheries.  I should not need to stand up in this House to inform Deputies in regard to the wording of <Col N="711" /> the Constitution and its implications. Deputy Dillon himself gave a full account of the picture as it has been regarded by successive Ministers in charge of Fisheries, but the actual position is that the Fishery Acts take no account of whether land was owned privately before 1921 or after 1921.  The right of ownership of a salmon fishery will only be taken away by full compensation being paid to the owner no matter when he originally received the rights.  That was clearly expressed in the Constitution in which the conception was laid down that we started completely afresh as an independent nation and we wished everyone to have equal rights and privileges as citizens.</P>
      <P>Some of the observations made by Deputy Corry and Deputy Murphy were directly contrary to the Proclamation of the Republic in 1916 and I utterly abhor them and all they said in regard to having prejudicial interests against persons whose origin differed from that of other persons.  I would ask Deputy Corry and Deputy Murphy to read the 1916 Proclamation and see what was said about the matter there.</P>
      <P>It is true we have rights under the present Fishery Acts to acquire all the inland fisheries of the country.  However, I see no point in acquiring, unless I could be certain that, first of all, we can afford the capital outlay.  This is a time when capital is difficult to procure as has been recognised by every Party in the House.  Secondly, I would not believe in making any change unless I was quite sure the result would be to the ultimate benefit of the people as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that if the private fisheries were purchased, the people who intended to exercise their new rights would have to be very strictly and sternly controlled by whatever authority was set up or they might remove every salmon from the river. <Col N="712" /> They would also have to pay richly for repaying the capital cost of acquiring the fishery.  I can see in many respects the State involved in what might turn into a gigantic home assistance administration in regard to which we would have to set up all sorts of controls at a very high cost because everything the State does is at a higher cost than when it is undertaken by the private individual.</P>
    <P>It is preferable, in my opinion, that we should endeavour to develop the salmon fisheries through the boards of conservators so that everyone would benefit thereby.  There are enormous stretches of rivers in which the fishing rights are owned by many different sorts of people including people with quite a small interest in a particular stretch of river.  The idea that all the fishing rights along rivers are owned by people of enormous wealth is grossly exaggerated and I should make it clear that the poaching of rivers where private owners have a very special interest will be regarded as far as I am concerned in exactly the same way as poaching anywhere else.  In actual fact, salmon fishing is fairly freely available throughout the country. There are places where salmon fishing is free.  I do not believe the State should undertake any form of production, unless it is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>Looking at the whole pattern of salmon river development, I believe we can proceed without having to start another State company to do another job.  I think the boards of conservators, when they work efficiently, can themselves do a very good job for the country both in enabling an increase in salmon exports on a commercial basis and in bringing tourists into the country.  Under present circumstances I think that is the best way in which development should proceed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>My main concern is arterial drainage.  Very important work has been carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act.  Various schemes and surveys have been completed, including the Boyne and Blackwater, in County Meath, with which I am particularly concerned.  I should like to impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary the urgency of carrying out this drainage.  From Trim to Drogheda, the Boyne is completely closed in and nothing has been done <Col N="715" /> with it since the year one.  During periods of heavy flooding very severe damage has been caused, particularly around Trim and Navan.  This work would give very valuable employment in an area where there is unemployment at present.</P>
      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us an assurance that this will be the next big scheme to be carried out.  We in Meath thought it would be carried out some years ago but other areas received priority, perhaps justly so, but I think, since the survey was carried out a couple of years ago, we have come to the stage where this scheme should receive priority.</P>
      <P>Employment on these schemes is not what it would have been had the schemes been done some years ago.  A number of people who look forward to getting work on these scheme will be disappointed because the advent of huge machinery to this country has displaced a great number of men who would otherwise receive employment.  I often wonder have we gone too far with mechanisation in this country?  Were it not for these machines the unemployment figure here would not be what it is to-day.  It is a matter beyond our control but some day the powers that be will have to take serious cognisance of the importation of huge machines such as have been employed in large drainage schemes here.  Is it economic to import these machines at tremendous expense to the State and displace so many men who would be employed had those machines not been put into operation?  The very minimum amount of machinery should be imported so that the maximum amount of employment would be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention is the lack of coordination between the various Departments of State directly or indirectly concerned with drainage.  Land reclamation schemes carried out with the assistance of the Department of Agriculture have been negatived because of the lack of proper drainage on the main arteries.  There has been a very substantial amount of drainage <Col N="716" /> carried out in Meath, but the Boyne and the Blackwater have remained choked up.  It is not good economics to begin at the wrong end.  While the main arteries are left as they are, the value of the productive work done has been greatly decreased.  If there were co-ordination between the different Departments of State, all those difficulties might be eliminated.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the maintenance charge imposed when drainage work is carried out.  The county council, who will be responsible for the collection of this money, should be notified before the work is commenced what the maintenance charge will be.  The amount levied on County Meath for part of the Glyde and Dee drainage between Meath and Navan in respect of the Meath part was, I think, £6,000.  If that is correct, the amount of maintenance on the Boyne when completed will be very much greater. While many of our people are anxious to see this work completed, I feel they will be complaining when they have to meet the maintenance charge imposed on them.  It would be as well if local authorities could be notified before the work is commenced so that the people will know what bill they will have to face when it is concluded.</P>
    <P>I am rather surprised and dissatisfied that the amount in the Estimate for employment and emergency schemes has been reduced, particularly for schemes in urban areas.</P>

      <P>I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to see that the Boyne scheme will be put into operation as soon as possible and not returned to the pigeon hole, as has been done before, while other schemes were given priority.  The River Boyne in places, between Trim and Navan particularly, has been practically closed in and nothing has ever been done with it.  If there were a few dry seasons, it would completely close over. Now is the hour and now is the opportunity <Col N="717" /> and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to speed up the matter as much as possible.</P>

      <P>I shall take the matter up again.  I should like to take the opportunity of paying tribute to the engineers on the Corrib scheme in Galway.  They have worked there under very unfavourable conditions and have carried out work of which we can be justly proud.  Their skill is unsurpassed. Is it the intention of the Office of Public Works to grant an increase in wages to workers employed on the Corrib?  There has been a steep rise in the cost of living over the last 12 months.  These men work under very tough conditions and are entitled to an improvement in wages.  I could describe their conditions of work as coolie conditions.</P>
      <P>Some time ago we asked for a marine survey of the pier at Kilronan, Aran.  This is a very important matter. We hope to see an increased number of trawlers based off the West coast. Under unfavourable weather conditions, trawlers costing £12,000 to £14,000 could be damaged at the pier in Kilronan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the policy now of the Office of <Col N="718" /> Public Works to try to hand over maintenance of piers to the local authority concerned immediately on their completion. Any contractor is responsible for a maintenance period in respect of work he carries out and that should apply to the Office of Public Works. There are different sets of engineers. On some occasions the county council engineer is not prepared to accept the type of work carried out.  I am not casting any reflection on the work. Some fine work has been carried out. Nevertheless, there may be cases where the county council engineer would not be too happy about accepting another engineer's &ldquo;baby&rdquo;, as it were.</P>
    <P>There was a millrace committee in Galway which for many years has not functioned.  Their function formerly was to look after tailrace, river banks and sluices in Galway City.  That body is defunct.  The tailraces are in grave danger of collapsing.  It seems that it is nobody's business to attend to this matter.  While the Corrib scheme is in progress, attention should be directed to the position further down the river because an enormous amount of expenditure will be involved very shortly unless the necessary repairs are carried out by the Department.</P>
    <P>In respect of national monuments, there is a figure of £7,000 in the Estimate. Some time ago the Galway Corporation referred the question of an historical wall, known as the Lion's Tower, in Galway, to the Office of Public Works, asking that it should be put into proper condition.  In their reply, the Office of Public Works said that the walls were not of any historical interest.  I have been informed on good authority that they are not only of immediate importance to the locals but are of national importance. I should like those dealing with national monuments to get in touch immediately with the Galway Corporation, who may enlighten them as to things that have come to the surface of late.  Seeing that they did not bother themselves to find out what the interest was, whether it was local or national, I would ask them to look for that information right away and they will find they will get information that might open their eyes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on the drainage question.  I wonder has the Parliamentary Secretary any information about what is to be done, arising out of the report of the American engineer who came over here, Mr. Riddell.  I must say I was very pleased indeed that the previous Government were wise enough to bring in an outside engineer to examine the Shannon drainage problem, because, with all respect to the engineers of the Board of Works, I am inclined to think they are rather backward in these matters.</P>
      <P>I remember attending a drainage meeting in Banagher in 1954, after the floods, when it was stated that there was to be an inquiry into the whole question of the Shannon drainage. I appealed to the members of the Government present to make sure that the possibility of eliminating this flooding by flood control would be fully investigated. I was in the happy position of knowing a most eminent foreign engineer who was living here during the war.  He had nothing to do and he spent all of six years studying drainage problems here, and I think he worked out a scheme for the Shannon that deserved more consideration than it got.</P>
      <P>I was a member of the Government in 1951 and the Taoiseach asked me to hand that engineer's report over to the Board of Works for investigation.  To tell the truth, I hesitated to do so, because I feared the reception it would get, and it did get the reception I anticipated.  I was glad, however, to see in the report of Mr. Riddell that he had an opportunity of studying this report I mention.  He has actually referred to a memorandum which I submitted on the subject.  It was not my idea to pose as a drainage engineer, but I think what he said about the Shannon was common sense.  The main problem was not so much to drain the bed of the river as to control the tributaries and this engineer, who had a European reputation, actually planned three dams on the River Suck. He suggested there should be a dam on the River Inny and also on the River Brosna.  In other words, he planned that river flooding should be controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> I thoroughly agreed with what the reverend chairman said at the Banagher meeting, that the Brosna scheme should not have been done because it let more water into a river that was already over-full.  I was glad to see that this engineer, who had great experience of flood control in the United States, has recommended that this whole problem of flood control and power development should be thoroughly investigated.  It may be a costly business, but I think something could be done under the technical development assistance programme organised by the United Nations for under-developed countries.  We should get expert surveys, not alone for the Shannon, but for other rivers in the country, because the modern technique is quite different from the old one.  It is not a question of ploughing up the bed of the river but rather one of holding back the water by suitable dams, and letting the water out when it is required.</P>
    <P>This engineer, to whom I have referred, was quite certain that if we did what he suggested on the Rivers Suck, Inny and Brosna, the level of Lough Ree could be lowered by two feet, and a reservoir of water could be maintained in the new lake that would be made which would ensure a proper supply at Ardnacrusha.  It must be remembered that the power station there has practically to shut down because of lack of water at certain times.  I congratulate the previous Government for going outside our own staff and having an outside engineer make a report, and I hope the Government will now get some engineer with experience of flood control under the technical development assistance programme of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words on Shannon navigation.  Anybody who travels along the roads will notice enormous petrol lorries travelling to depots in different parts of the country. Eight-wheeled vehicles tow large trailers behind them and it must be remembered that many of our roads pass over bogs.  Some of the best roads we have are being destroyed by these heavy vehicles.  I think the Government should ask oil companies to investigate the possibility of operating <Col N="721" /> a small fleet of tankers on the Shannon.  If there was a central depot at Foynes, such tankers could distribute the oil and petrol to smaller depots in the towns along the Shannon. Years ago, canals were able to carry 25 tons on barges, but 25 tons being carried along a road is a considerable weight.  It would not be so very much on a river and I would not be surprised if the Shannon could take up to 50 tons.  A small tug could pull containers up the river to the various depots as far as Boyle, and thus relieve the roads of the heavy traffic being placed upon them, which is involving the State in considerable expenditure in maintaining them.  Most of the roads in Roscommon pass over bog and the new road down to Portlaoise is becoming &ldquo;wavy&rdquo;.</P>

I conclude by impressing upon the Parliamentary Secretary the urgency of having something done on this question of flood control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of Public Works Estimate usually draws a long and interesting debate from Deputies.  The principal point which I had intended to raise was raised by the last speaker.  I was principally concerned with the River Shannon, but now it is hardly necessary for me to repeat what has already been so ably said by Deputy Boland with regard to the expert advice which was obtained by the previous Government. Shannon flooding, and the complaints relating thereto, have been under debate in this House for very many years, and it would be interesting to know if the Office of Public Works has <Col N="722" /> any concrete proposals that are likely to supply a remedy.  Nobody knows better than the Deputies representing the constituencies affected by Shannon flooding that this is a problem which has existed for many years, but it cannot be allowed to exist for ever. It is a problem on which an outside expert was asked to express an opinion.  He did express an opinion and I feel, just as Deputy Boland feels, that the decision to obtain the best advice in the world was a practical one.</P>
      <P>Whilst I do not claim to criticise the skill, ability or efficiency of our own engineers I feel it is no harm to obtain the advice we have obtained.  Now that a certain amount of advice has been given and a report has been made, we should be interested to know what action the Office of Public Works propose to take.  We should be glad to know if the engineering staff of the Office of Public Works have had an opportunity of studying in detail all aspects of the report submitted by the American expert.  We should also be glad to know what action, if any, they propose to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people living on the banks of the River Shannon in Offaly, Westmeath, Roscommon and other affected areas are anxiously awaiting a development of some kind.  If the Office of Public Works or their engineering staff tell the people that the flooding must continue year after year and that the only alternative is to leave the district and go elsewhere I assure the House that that is something which the people are not prepared to do.  There is an old saying that the savage loves his native land.  I do not wish to describe the people living along the Shannon in that fashion but it is true that they have the same love for the moist and marshy land surrounded by the Shannon as the savage has for his native land.  It would be unfair and unreasonable that the county councils concerned should ask them to pay rent and rates on land which is flooded practically eight or nine months of the year and, in the few summer months, the grazing on it is not up to any kind of standard.  It is well known from the reports of agricultural instructors in those areas that live stock there <Col N="723" /> suffer from fluke and other diseases caused by water-logged lands.  The people in those areas have suffered unknown inconvenience.  For us to express lip sympathy here with them for a week every 12 months is little or no solution for them.</P>
    <P>The question is: has this House confidence in the Office of Public Works? If we are to criticise the Office of Public Works, let us have some foundation for our criticism.  I remember that, during the years when I was a Parliamentary Secretary in the inter-Party Government and applications were made for piers, break-waters and other facilities required by fishermen, the applications were referred to the Office of Public Works for reports.  The engineering staff of the Office of Public Works was never able to submit a detailed report within any reasonable time.  The explanation always given was that the engineering staff were kept busy elsewhere, that some of the engineering staff had either retired or died and that more of them were examining proposals submitted to them some years previously.</P>
    <P>I should like some details of the full extent of the engineering staff of the Office of Public Works&mdash;the number of engineers; the length of time, if any, the Office of Public Works give their engineering staff to submit a report; whether the procedure is that they are given a particular job and told to come back when it is done or whether they are told to do it within a certain time. People who are not engineers are not qualified to go into the pros and cons of an engineer's report.  You will be told immediately that it is a profession that carries a good deal of responsibility and skill and that the ordinary lay person cannot express an opinion on it.  However, the ordinary lay person can express the opinion that the engineering staff of the Office of Public Works should be given some limit of time in which to report on a particular work.  The Shannon is one particular instance in which I feel something should and must be done.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the chief cause of the continuous flooding of the Shannon is the fact that the River <Col N="724" /> Brosna was drained and that there was, therefore, a bigger flow of water from the midlands of Offaly and Westmeath into the River Shannon.  I consider it a wrong expression of opinion to say that the River Brosna should not have been drained before the River Shannon.  Before the River Brosna was drained, one could stand on Ballycumber railway bridge and look around and see a vast ocean of water over areas in Offaly and it was there for months and months of the year.  That has all gone now.  I have wondered whether the drainage of the River Brosna has worsened the position of the river Shannon.  We see now that, after heavy rainfalls, it is as it was years ago.  Extensive flooding took place on the River Shannon in 1954 but it must be remembered that not for almost 100 years before that had there been such severe and heavy rainfall as there was at that time.</P>
    <P>I feel the Commissioners of Public Works are men with drive in so far as the initial and commencing stages of schemes are concerned.  I do not know if, during this debate, for the records of this House, any tribute was paid to the memory of the former chairman&mdash; the late Diarmuid Ó hÉigceartuigh.  On an occasion such as this and particularly as the man has passed to his eternal reward since the last Estimate for this Department was before this House, I feel a tribute should be paid to the fine service he gave, to his ability and efficiency and to the capable manner in which that gentleman discharged his duties as chairman of the Office of Public Works.  As a member of this House for close on 16 years, I always found him courteous, helpful and practical&mdash;and, indeed, to be practical is the principal attribute of any engineers or of any commissioners who hold the high office entrusted to those gentlemen.</P>
    <P>This House passed an Arterial Drainage Bill some years ago.  Is that not correct?  Apart from the drainage scheme carried out on the Glyde and Dee, the drainage of the Brosna, the Feale and the Corrib, are we to take it that, since the Arterial Drainage Act was passed in 1945, only these four important and extensive drainage <Col N="725" /> schemes were carried out?  If that is so, it means that, under the Arterial Drainage Act, it will take about 200 years before most of our rivers are drained.  That may be slight exaggeration: it may take 150 years.  However, that is little consolation to people who are anxious to have extensive drainage schemes carried out.</P>
    <P>I have been pressing to have the drainage of the River Nore examined under the Arterial Drainage Act.  That river drains the centre of the Country of Laois and the entire of the County of Kilkenny, including Kilkenny City. The Nore must be looked upon as one of our most important rivers in these days.  In parts of North Kilkenny and South Laois there are portions of the River Nore where, if you are any kind of an athlete or sprinter, you can jump from one bank to the other.  It is easy to walk across the river because of the huge logs or trees that have fallen into it and across it from time to time.  I have often wondered why, as a preliminary to a major scheme of arterial drainage, the Office of Public Works do not undertake the removal of obstructions from rivers if only to allow the free passage of water.  There are defective bridges on the Nore where the eyes are completely closed.  I know of a couple of instances, and I am sure the Office of Public Works is aware of them, where after heavy flooding or rainfall, instead of the water going through the eye of the bridge it flows over the bridge and there is a traffic chaos and county council obstruction as well.  That is only the River Nore. Deputy Griffin mentioned places in County Meath and I suppose every Deputy could raise cases in his own constituency.</P>
    <P>The Arterial Drainage Act is on the shelves of the Office of Public Works, covered with dust and surrounded by cobwebs.  It is nearly time the dust was shaken off and the cobwebs removed and some practical steps taken to do something on the more important rivers.  There is no use whatever in getting engineers, in asking for surveys and the taking of levels, with the very limited engineering staff there at present. It is so limited that if one of the head engineers becomes ill there is a <Col N="726" /> standstill.  It is all very fine for Deputies to ask that important works be carried out without delay, but there must be staff to do so.  If Deputies expect the work to be carried out effectively, it must be recognised that there must be staff or it cannot be done.</P>
    <P>Many might say that the Office of Public Works is overstaffed or that the staff should be drastically reduced, but I think what is needed is reorganisation, as there is too much overlapping. The Parliamentary Secretary might ask me to give an example.  The overlapping is there in the shifting of responsibility from one to another. There is no such thing as a time limit there for the submission of reports.  It looks as if everyone is his own boss and there is no one in charge.  I am not casting a serious reflection on the ability of those in authority there, but to me it looks as if the whole institution is running amok, with everyone his own boss, everyone doing his best and too much overlapping.  I feel it needs a drastic overhaul.</P>
    <P>The engineers may be asked from time to time to report on old Government buildings.  There are offices which are housed entirely in ruins.  I have known cases where the engineering staff have condemned public buildings in this city for almost 25 years.  I can distinctly recall that when I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture I occupied an office in an old building in Kildare Street.  I understood it was reported about 25 years ago as being in a dangerous condition. For 20 years there were continuous complaints.  I can distinctly recollect&mdash;and it is on the files of the Office of Public Works&mdash;that one morning the building trembled completely and in 48 hours it had to be evacuated. I feel there are many other old offices in this city in which Government officers are expected to work under extremely horrible conditions.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many of the Board of Works people ever visited the public offices known as &ldquo;100 Amiens Street&rdquo;, in which there are customs officials and, I think, officers of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I had occasion to pay a visit to these offices recently.  I see in this Estimate that there is a section of the <Col N="727" /> Office of Public Works called the Furniture Branch.  In that office there were chairs with three legs, some of the most ancient furniture I ever saw, which would not be put on a low class scrap heap.  If this branch is responsible for furniture I would like to know that and I shall make it my business later on to have a chat with the head of that section.  The furniture in some Government offices is so bad that it would hardly burn and it is a disgrace to the name of a Government office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be so, but the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that the Office of Public Works do not like to be petitioned too often for things required.  If there is an officer in charge who petitions too often, he may find himself in the bad books of superior officers or find himself transferred to a better building at a future date.  It is an awkward thing to send in petitions too often.  We know the old saying that if you attempt to walk on the toes of your superior officer and if you miss. some time you will hit and there will be a hit back.  People are very slow to complain about furniture.  I have visited some of those offices and the furniture there was a disgrace to civilisation.  Some of it must have been over 100 years old.  Part of it is held together by screws, nuts, bolts and tin.  If public services are to be maintained, such equipment should be <Col N="728" /> put right or scrapped altogether.  The bulk of the furniture in most Government offices, except those offices of a very high standard, is so bad, so old and so horrid-looking that it should be scrapped entirely.</P>
      <P>There is a division in the Office of Public Works called the New Works Division.  I do not know how long it is established; I do not know much about it, but I should like to know something about it.  There must be no work at all for that division.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell the House what new works are to be undertaken?  What is the purpose of that division, how many people are employed in it and what are their functions? It should be planning new schemes and new undertakings.</P>

I do not remember any reference to it in former Estimates.  I thought that at least it would be worth a query.  The New Works Division of the Office of Public Works, I presume, must be planning for new works to be carried out over a given period.  Perhaps they have a five-year plan, a ten-year plan or a 20-year plan.  I do not know what the position is.  If the New Works Division are anxious to find scope for their activities they should concentrate on some of the rural schools throughout the country.  I am sorry that the practice over recent years was as far as possible to cut down on the grants and the schemes for the construction of new schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">

      <P>My information, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, was that schemes were submitted to the Board <Col N="729" /> of Works and they picked out the schemes that were to be given priority. I may be wrong.  If it is wrong to raise it on this Estimate, I can raise it on the Estimate for Education.  I would ask the engineering staff of the Office of Public Works to give more attention to schools.</P>
      <P>I see here again in the Estimates the sub-head&mdash;Schools Division.  If they have no function with regard to schools, or no say beyond carrying out an inspection, I wonder what is the function of the Schools Division of the Office of Public Works?  There is an assistant principal architect, an assistant architect, a temporary assistant architect, a temporary architectural assistant, a temporary clerk of works and a writing assistant.  The Schools Division seems to be fairly well staffed but the condition of the schools, particularly in rural Ireland, does not seem to have improved very much.  However, it will probably be in order to raise it on another occasion.</P>
      <P>With regard to national monuments, I think it is nice to preserve all the old monuments and the national monuments section have done some good work.  I should like to refer to the work carried out at Clonmacnoise to the ancient graveyard.  The great pity is that whilst all the ancient stones and rocks of St. Kieran's are very well preserved, to some extent the old ancient look has gone from the place.  I have been attending funerals at Clonmacnoise for 15 or 16 years and since it was remodelled and redecorated one would hardly know that it was Clonmacnoise at all.  If the national monuments section of the Board of Works would try to preserve all those ancient landmarks by doing as little structural alteration as possible, it would be better.  As far as possible they should be left as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national monuments section should consider&mdash;of course the question of money arises and that is where the activities of the Commissioners of Public Works are hampered to a great extent&mdash;taking over the old castles all over the country.  I refer particularly &mdash;I see that Deputy T. Lynch is not here&mdash;to the Rock of Dunamase, the home of Rory O'Moore and of the <Col N="730" /> ancient clan of Laois.  I think it is a great pity that some section of the Office of Public Works&mdash;preferably the national monuments section&mdash;would not step in and do something about the Rock of Dunamase, which is, perhaps, the most historic rock on Irish soil to-day.  Some steps should be taken about having it preserved, about having the decay with which it is threatened, remedied and about having the rock put into a satisfactory state of repair.  The weeds, shrubs, rocks and dirt should be removed because most visitors to Laois always make an effort to see the Rock of Dunamase.  I think it is a pity that it has fallen into such a state of disrepair.</P>
    <P>There is, I think, a section in the Office of Public Works responsible for the heating of Government buildings. That section might be well advised to examine the whole question of heating so far as Leinster House is concerned. I can raise that matter on the Estimate for the Houses of the Oireachtas but certainly the heating system here must have something drastically wrong with it.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would direct the attention of the Office of Public Works is the dog cage of a reception room for visitors at the gate of Leinster House.  I think it is a disgrace. It provides a laugh and a jeer for any visitors who come here from any part of the world and who are asked to step into that cage at the main entrance to our Parliament House.  There are dog kennels which are kept better.  Certainly it is not in keeping with the entrance to our Houses of Parliament and something should be done about it.  It is surely ten years since the question of that reception room at the main gate of Leinster House was raised on the Vote for the Office of Public Works.  I do not know whether it is a matter for the Office of Public Works or the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad but whoever is responsible has nothing to be proud of and it should not be there.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may not have responsibility for it, but, again, we can see who is responsible when the relevant Vote comes up.  I stated a few moments ago that the engineering section of the Office of Public Works was probably under-staffed.  Even if a very small job is to be carried out, a team comes to do the job.  This is not a matter to which my attention was drawn by others.  I have known the Office of Public Works to be telephoned to remove a press.</P>
      <P>I have known the Office of public Works to be asked to remove a press in which there were files and documents. Three men came over to look at it first.  They were followed by two more who had a tape and who took certain measurements.  They proceeded to measure the press, the doorways and so on and then an inspector came to estimate the weight of the press. After all that, they left.  That was sufficient for a day's work.  But they arrived the following morning for the purpose of removing the press and there was a consultation as to what way it should be taken out and straightened up.  Again two employees left and arrived back with a step-ladder to view the top of the press. The two employees who arrived with the step-ladder naturally had to carry it back again to wherever it came from. Eventually it took four days to remove the press which, if a man wanted to do it, could have been removed in twenty minutes.  In the ordinary way if a private contractor were given the job he would call two men and say to them: &ldquo;I want you to shift that, and I will give you half an hour to do it,&rdquo; and have it done within that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a great deal in the old saying that if you are working for a private contractor, or for somebody directly, you will work but if you are working for the State or the Government you will do as little as you can, waste all the time you can and get all you can out of it.  I am afraid that is the tendency.  If any business man or any company conducted affairs in the way the Board of Works conduct theirs they would be bankrupt and out of business within three months.  There <Col N="732" /> seems to be a lack of supervision so far as the Board of Works is concerned and that matter should be carefully examined.  We must consider the possibility of getting as much work as possible done with a very limited sum of money, especially when men are as tied up as they are at present.  It is difficult to know what the position is or where improvements can be effected.</P>
    <P>So far as the personnel of the Office of Public Works is concerned in dealing with Deputies and Senators and with representations made to them, the officials always give splendid and courteous replies.  In fairness to the Parliamentary Secretary I want to say that any representations made to him since he came into office were satisfactorily dealt with.  That is also true of his predecessor who was a very decent, unassuming man.  I feel the Office of Public Works has lost a very good leader in the late Mr. Beegan.  In saying that I am sure I speak for all sides of the House.  Certainly he did not indulge in personalities; he was a man who gave of his best and I feel that on this occasion some little tribute should be paid to him.  He did his job fearlessly and conscientiously and above all, so far as his political opponents were concerned, in a fair and broad-minded manner.  That is the way I found him and his loss to the Department is great indeed.  He deserves a tribute not alone from his political friends but also from his political opponents.  I should like to say that everyone, and particular the Deputies, very much regret his early passing.</P>

      <P>My intervention in this debate will be brief.  My main reason for intervening is to renew the many requests we have made here from time to time on behalf of the people of West Cork for a greater allocation from this Vote.  We were told during discussions on past Estimates that the more important centres should be dealt with first and should get preferential treatment.  We found in recent Estimates big sums allocated to such centres as Dublin, Cork and Waterford. There may be justification for that attitude seeing that these are populous centres and possibly more important <Col N="733" /> than the many isolated districts I represent here.  But I think the time has come when we should get a more sympathetic hearing.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary's advisers will tell him that the isolated districts must be taken into account.  Representing, as I do, a constituency which has possibly the greatest stretch of coastline in the country I say we are bound to have a postion obtaining which I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary understands quite well since the constituency he represents is similar to West Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will do away with that term &ldquo;under active consideration&rdquo;. When a matter is &ldquo;under active consideration&rdquo; by the Board of Works it is not unreasonable to assume that the &ldquo;active consideration&rdquo; may spread over a period of five, six or seven or even ten years.  That is the type of &ldquo;active consideration&rdquo; that we in West Cork have received from the Board of Works in recent times.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary what is the present position regarding proposed improvements which have been submitted to his Department on behalf of the people of Dursey Island, the most isolated island in the country.  There is no need for me to refer to the difficulties encountered by the people on that island.  They are asking the Board of Works for the improvement of the slip, not an unreasonable request, and the provision of a derrick.  My information over the past number of years is that these matters are under active consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I stated that my main reason for intervening in the debate was to urge the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="735" /> just appointed to expedite the final examination of such works and do something about executing them. The same position applies to a scheme submitted for improvement of the slip and provision of a derrick at Dursey Sound.  I mention this matter in the House because repeated representations have failed.  The Cork Country Council disclaim responsibility.  They say the matter is under examination by the Board of Works and the Department&mdash;possibly they are correct&mdash;but there has been very little result.  You can imagine a group of people living under such difficult circumstances as the people of Dursey Island contacting every public representative in the area to try to get these essential improvements carried out.</P>
    <P>Surely the Board of Works should consider such cases in a special category, having regard to the difficulties of the people living on islands.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give that work special consideration.  The same applies in respect of neighbouring islands.  We had work submitted from Cape Clear, Baltimore and a number of other fishing centres in West Cork.  The unfortunate position obtaining in the Board of Works is that no adequate steps are taken to have these matter dealt with and final reports submitted.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle mentioned that the provision of money was not part of the Parliamentary Secretary's business; that his business was confined to the execution of the works, but it is no harm to mention to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;he has much longer experience of procedure than I have&mdash;that the Fisheries Department and other Departments, such as the Department of Education, give as their reason for holding up works that the matter is still under active consideration by the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>I will not dwell any further on this matter.  Neither will I go into the matters associated with the Estimate which have already been covered.  A number of Deputies spoke about the execution of drainage works required in West Cork.  It is little use mentioning them in the House.  Time after time, we have brought them to the <Col N="736" /> attention of the appropriate Departments. I feel it is a waste of time to reiterate these representations, so far as drainage in the West Cork area is concerned.</P>
    <P>Neither do I intend going into another matter which requires a good deal of attention&mdash;the condition of schools in the West Cork area.  Many of them, according to the reports of the county medical officer of health, are not fit for children.</P>

I do that in the hope that these works may be executed and removed from the list of those works under active consideration.</P>

      <P>I was delighted to hear that the professional staff is to be increased considerably.  I hope that our young engineers will be allowed to get the experience that will be useful and that is necessary so that they can undertake all major schemes in future.  We have plenty of young engineers, graduates from our engineering schools who are as good as can be got anywhere in the world.  I think they should get experience and not be sent abroad to earn a livelihood.</P>
      <P>With regard to drainage, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see that there is no further delay in connection with the drainage of the River Moy. The late Deputy Beegan told me he was certain that all the preliminary work in connection with that river would be carried out this year.  He also told me that the scheme would be published and that we would get on with the work in the coming year.  It was the late Deputy Beegan who initiated the survey of the Moy.  I well recollect in the year 1952, when I was a candidate in the by-election, hearing the Opposition, in the Foxford area especially, state that the sending of engineers to the River Moy to survey was an election dodge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> I also realise that the Moy should have been done somewhat earlier.  The Moy was on the provisional scheme which was supposed to come into operation some years ago, but, with the change of Government, the Corrib got preference.  I can forgive that.  It was just the fortunes of war.  I hope we shall hear nothing further about the drainage of the Moy, but that it will be carried out, that the Parliamentary Secretary will see his way to get that river drained as soon as possible and that the late Deputy Beegan's hopes will be realised.</P>
    <P>With regard to repairs to boreens, I come from a constituency where the boreens are the worst in Ireland.  We have the greatest number of boreens of any constituency.  It is a terrible disgrace to expect our people living in the backward areas, to be without a decent road to their houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been told that there is certain machinery available at present along the Corrib and that it is doing nothing.  I do not see why this machinery should be left idle.  The Parliamentary Secretary might inquire into that matter because we might be able to get work started on the Moy sooner.  The Moy is connected with two counties&mdash;Mayo and Sligo&mdash;and in those areas we have a number of people who could be engaged on those jobs instead of having to cross each year to England.  I hope there will be no further delay and that no engineer in the Department will be allowed to hinder the advance of the work on the Moy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention also in connection with schools that I cannot understand why there should be such a delay in providing ordinary sanitary accommodation in schools.  That the installation of sanitary facilities should take two years indicates that there is something wrong.  A lot of this red tape must be got rid of.  There is no reason why sanitary facilities could not <Col N="738" /> be provided for the schools inside three to four months at the most.</P>
    <P>With regard to school play-yards, legislation should be introduced to allow of the compulsory acquisition of land to provide every school with a decent playground.  Modern youth requires something more than that which satisfied the youth 20 or 30 years ago.  It is definitely essential that we should have ample playgrounds to permit our young lads to grow up good, strong and great men, so that they will be able to live in the present-day world.</P>

      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary and the House to know that I am not so much interested in the amount of money voted in the Estimate as I am in how much of it will find its way into Clare. Both inside and outside the House, I have listened to people talking about what the agricultural industry has done for this country.  I hope the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will not rule me out of order, because what I have to say touches this Estimate very closely. Even on the Budget this evening, the agricultural industry got credit for relieving what was a very awkward situation this time last year.  That situation was relieved by the export of our cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamMurphy" hpid="Mr. W. Murphy Mr. W. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I grant that, but he can take responsibility for this, and I want to drive it home.  We in Clare can boast of having the best land in Ireland under water.  That is a true statement.  I want some of the money &mdash;I do not mind how much so long as we get some of it&mdash;given to Clare and utilised to free the good land of the water which covers it.  It is only some time ago that we had the embankments in Rossmanagher repaired.  There was a time when those embankments could <Col N="739" /> be made right for the paltry sum of £400 but they were allowed to deteriorate until the repairs came to the grand criticise the Board of Works&mdash;and the total of £80,000.  Whilst we might Board of Works certainly have been criticised very severely here to-night&mdash; I will pay them the tribute of saying that the work they did on the Rossmanagher embankments was a credit to them.  The only thing I would wish is that we could get them down to do similar work on other embankments which need repairs.</P>
      <P>It is only a short while ago since I put a question down in the House about the upper reaches of the River Fergus.  It would not take a great deal of money to do that work but we are told that unfortunately it is very far down on the list of priorities.  While that is the case I can say that good farmers with good land find it practically useless to them.  As a matter of fact, a heavy shower of rain in the month of July deprives them even of a reasonable harvest.  Nevertheless that problem has been there; photographs have been taken of the area which have appeared in the daily Press but nothing has been done.</P>
      <P>I can never understand why this should be so when I consider the representation which Clare has.  We have the Taoiseach, the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Dr. Hillery and your humble servant.  Surely in those circumstances we should be able to get something into County Clare out of this Estimate.  There is no bother at all about voting £1,000,000 for the River Corrib and the River Clare to be spent over ten years.  If £1,000,000 were provided for Clare over a period of five years the Department need never worry again about Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, as I have said, when you consider that Clare is a cattle raising county&mdash;and the cattle industry undoubtedly has put the Government in the position it is in to-night; it has been given credit for that even by the banks in their reports, and even at meetings of the commercial and industrial firms&mdash;surely I am not asking too much of the Government. Does more land not mean more grass? <Col N="740" /> Does more grass not mean more cattle? Does more cattle not mean more cattle for export and more money for the country?  That is why I speak for Clare.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the late Deputy Beegan.  We were good friends, and while I have nothing to say yet against the man who has taken his place, I must say that the late Deputy Beegan was as decent and as honest a man as ever came, or ever will come, into this House.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me repeat that while I am in the House I shall strive in every way I can to get as much of that money as I think can be reasonably spent in Clare with good results.  As I have told you, the repair of the Rossmanagher embankments has brought back grass on good land which was left derelict.  Even the rates would not be paid on it.  It is a great thing to see cattle grazing on such land, which will mean more money to this country.</P>

      <P>I paid my own very meagre tribute to the Board of Works personages who departed this life within a few weeks of each other, but now representing the office it is my sad duty to acknowledge the very generous tributes paid by Deputies on all sides of the House to the work of these two public works functionaries, namely, my friend and colleague the late Paddy Beegan, who was my predecessor as Parliamentary Secretary, and the late Diarmuid Ó hEigeartuigh, who had just a very short time before his death retired from the office of chairman.  These tributes are very well deserved and have been very graciously paid.  I know that their colleagues in the Office of Public Works appreciate the tributes which they have heard for the past two days in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious that two matters, in the main, concern this House in relation to the Office of Public Works. It is not easy to say from the volume of references to them which takes priority in the interest of the Deputies but, in any event, each of them has been very well supported.  They are: <Col N="741" /> arterial drainage and the provision of schools.  Practically every speaker in this debate referred to these two questions.  Indeed, the Chair on occasion had to remind Deputies that, in relation to schools, our obligation in the Office of Public Works is to carry out the orders of another Department; and, if there are deficiencies in the accommodation or in the matter of the provision of a playground, that is not a matter, as the Chair quite properly pointed out, which can be rectified by the Office of Public Works.  We are really agents for the Department of Education and for the managers, who make the original decisions in relation to these schools.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Boland (for the Minister for Defence): Proposals for the establishment of a scheme for the introduction of apprentices into the naval dockyard at Haulbowline have been considered by my Department.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> On 18th February, 1953, the question was again raised:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Traynor: ...Particulars of the proposed apprenticeship scheme at the naval dockyard at Haulbowline will be communicated to the vocational authorities at Cobh as soon as a decision has been taken in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In July, 1953:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Traynor: The question of the establishment of an apprenticeship scheme in the naval dockyard, Haulbowline, is still under consideration. I am aware of the anxiety of the authorities in the vocational and technical school at Cobh in the matter and I shall keep that aspect in mind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On 10th November, 1953:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Corry asked the Minister for Defence if he is now prepared to give particulars of the apprenticeship scheme for the Naval Dockyard, Haulbowline, as promised to Cobh Vocational School in his Department's letter of 31st January, 1952.</P>
    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor): The question of the establishment of an apprenticeship scheme in the Naval Dockyard, Haulbowline, is still under consideration.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that until such time as consultations with the different interests involved have taken place it would not be possible to give particulars of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am endeavouring to have consideration of this matter expedited.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Twelve months elapsed and on 3rd November, 1954&mdash;I had to give the new Minister time to settle down before I tried to get any information out of him&mdash;I raised the question again:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Corry asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware of the anxiety of students in the Cobh Technical School in regard to the admission of civil apprentices to the Naval Dockyard at Haulbowline; and if he will state whether a decision has yet been taken in the matter and, if not, when it is likely to be taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> General MacEoin: I am aware that the Cobh vocational and technical school authorities are anxious that civilian apprentices should be admitted to the naval dockyard at Haulbowline.  This question is still under examination in connection with other related matters, but I regret I am not at present in a position to say when a final decision is likely to be reached.</P>
    <P>Mr. Corry: Is the Minister aware that the first question in connection with this matter was asked in May, 1947?</P>
    <P>General MacEoin: So I heard.</P>
    <P>Mr. Corry: Is the Minister aware that at various stages ever since, during seven long years, the Department of Defence have been considering this question and apparently negotiating everything in connection with it?  Surely it is not to go on for seven more years and surely we will have some finality in the matter?</P>
    <P>General MacEoin: Might I remind the Deputy that I said I was examining the matter and not the Department, but that I am not yet in a position to say when a final decision will be reached?  I hope, however, it will not be seven years more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In June, 1955:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Corry asked the Minister for Defence whether he has yet completed his examination of the proposal to admit civilian apprentices to the naval dockyard at Haulbowline, and, if so, with what result.</P>
    <P>Minister for Defence (General MacEoin): Examination of the question of admitting civilian apprentices to the naval dockyard at Haulbowline has not yet been completed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In November, 1956:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Corry asked the Minister for Defence whether he has yet reached a decision in relation to the proposal to admit civilian apprentices to the naval dockyard, Haulbowline.</P>
    <P>Minister for Defence (General MacEoin): I regret that I am not yet in a position to reach a decision on the proposal referred to by the Deputy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> That is a litany of the activities of the Department of Defence and the activities of three different Ministers for Defence to date.  Apparently, we have not heard the end of it yet.</P>
    <P>Haulbowline Dockyard and civilian apprentices there have been a tradition as far as the people of Cobh are concerned.  Large numbers of men from Cobh were taken in each year into the naval dockyard there during the British occupation.  Fine tradesmen were turned out.  Some great Irishmen were turned out.  As a matter of fact, I can state this: over 3,000 springs and heads for hand grenades for the Irish Republican Army were made in the naval dockyard at Haulbowline by these apprentices.  Now that our own Republican Navy is there, surely we are entitled to ask that at least they carry on that tradition. How many decent mothers in Cobh have seen their sons go out into the world unprepared to earn their livelihood, when they could have been trained as skilled tradesmen in that dockyard, had the Department of Defence done its part?  That is my complaint.</P>
    <P>Does it take 11 or 12 years, from 1947 to 1958, for a Department of State to decide whether or not they will train a handful of apprentices?  Is that what we have come to here?  I allowed the Minister a long 12 months to consider this matter.  It is a matter which could have been settled in any three meetings of the Department concerned.  It is outrageous and a fearful waste of public money.  Those people are in a position to train apprentices in a way they cannot be trained elsewhere.  We can get apprentices taken in Irish Steel and Rushbrooke dockyards, but the Department of Defence do not want anybody to train in this country. To-morrow or after, when they are short of skilled staff, they will send over for the dregs of the British Navy and put them in charge there.  That will be due to the fact that our own young men are not trained in that job which has been a tradition in Cobh for over 100 years.  It is a dreadful state of affairs and I suggest the Minister should make some move on in the matter.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Deputy Corry found it necessary to raise this matter on the Adjournment again.  I am afraid the answer which I gave him to-day is all the information I can give him.  The reply may not have been satisfactory from Deputy Corry's point of view, but it is a factual statement of the position: that it has not been found possible to reach a decision in this matter.</P>
      <P>The matter is not as simple as Deputy Corry appears to think.  In my opinion, these recurring questions which Deputy Corry puts down appear to show a belief on his part that there is some reluctance on my part and on the part of my predecessors to introduce a scheme for the training of apprentices in Haulbowline.  Deputy Corry appears to hope, by conducting a war of attrition by means of parliamentary questions and debates on the Adjournment, eventually to wear down this opposition by the Department of Defence to the proposed scheme.  I want to assure Deputy Corry for what it is worth&mdash;I do not know whether he will accept it or not &mdash;that there is no such opposition in the Department of Defence.  I am keenly interested in having the naval dockyard at Haulbowline utilised to the best possible advantage in the public interest.  I will co-operate to the fullest extent possible in any effort to utilise the naval dockyard in any way that will benefit the community always bearing in mind, as I must, the needs of the naval service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this question of the training of apprentices, I personally am in favour of having apprentices trained here in the naval dockyard.  I can appreciate as well as Deputy Corry or anybody else the desirability of providing increased opportunities for the technical training and education <Col N="746" /> of our boys.  If there were anything I could do to provide those increased opportunities for technical training, I would do it.  When I say in reply to the question that I have not found it possible to do so, that is the position. Even if this scheme were to be gone ahead with, Deputy Corry will appreciate that the number who could be taken in and trained would be very limited indeed.  There would be no question of providing an outlet for a considerable number of the youth of the surrounding district.  If the scheme does go ahead, the number who will be catered for will be very limited.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that the difficulties which arose when this scheme was first considered have not yet been solved.  I am not yet in a position to give a forecast of when they will be solved.  I realise that Deputy Corry's reason for raising this matter on the Adjournment was that he was not satisfied with the reply, but, as I have stated, it is the only reply I am in a position to give to him. I should like to satisfy Deputy Corry, but I can only repeat the factual reply I gave him to-day in answer to his parliamentary question: that it has not been found possible to reach any final decision in this matter.  That is not due to any inactivity or opposition on my part, or on the part of anybody in the Department of Defence.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider putting this genius who is not able to come to a decision for 11 years into a room and giving him no grub until he gets results?  I do not want to be coming in here in 30 years' time asking him about this.</P>
