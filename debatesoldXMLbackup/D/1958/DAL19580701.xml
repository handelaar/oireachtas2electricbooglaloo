      <P>Under statute the fixing of rates and scales of charges for electricity is a matter solely for the E.S.B.</P>
      <P>The board have informed me that the abolition of special service charges would involve an annual loss of £563,000, and that, to offset it, the standard fixed charge rates for all rural consumers would require to be increased by 22 per cent.</P>

It is hoped, however, to place a contract in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to a commonage containing 144 acres in the townland of Ballina.  The position here is that following the rearrangement, between 1936 and 1946, of a number of holdings in this district, in the townlands of Lecarrow, Lisheenmanus, Ballina and Mweelis, it was proposed to give to each tenant with his rearranged holding a 1/22nd share in the Ballina commonage.  For a start, on 28th March, 1952, ten tenants in the townlands of Lecarrow and Lisheenmanus were included in a vesting order, which provided for the allocation of 1/22nd shares in the commonage to them.  These tenants objected to the vesting order, however, on the grounds that tenants in Ballina and Mweelis had no rights to shares in the commonage. Following the hearing of the objection by the Lay Commissioners, the matter was further investigated and on 31st August, 1956, a new vesting order was made in respect of all the holdings involved, allocating the commonage as follows: (a) an undivided 1/11th share of 22 acres and an undivided 1/22nd share of 122 acres to each of the tenants in Lecarrow and Lisheenmanus and (b) an undivided 1/22nd share in 122 acres to each of the tenants in Ballina and Mweelis.</P>
      <P>The tenants in Lecarrow and Lisheenmanus objected to this vesting order also but the objection was disallowed by the Lay Commissioners in June, 1957.  An appeal was subsequently lodged and the matter is at present awaiting the reserved judgment of the Appeal Tribunal.</P>
      <P>Shares in the commonage form part of the holdings concerned and separate annuities are not assessed thereon.</P>

Is the Minister aware that portion of the commonage which was allotted in 1936 was reallotted by mistake in 1946 and that the inspector who did that had no authority to reallot anything other than lands in the possession of the Land Commission and that he allotted land that was not in the possession of the Land Commission?</P>

      <P>Since the Deputy insists and as the estates, apart from one small area, are completely allotted, I reluctantly give the names.  They are in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>

      <P>I am much obliged to the Minister for his reply but, arising out of it, is he right in the belief that public interest is best served by observing the discretion which he imposes upon himself?  If the information is ultimately available in the Valuation Office to those with sufficient sophistication to repair there, is it not infinitely better, from the point of view of the local people, that there should be the fullest declaration of the irrevocable decision of the Land Commission? Would the Minister not agree with me that there is no case in common between communicating to the public the irrevocable decision and of communicating similar information before the allocation is finally determined? In the latter case, I would be in agreement with him, but in the former case I think the course adopted to-day is the wisest one in the public interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If we could get to amendment No. 53, first of all I want to provide that where you have a retirement benefit scheme relating to all the personnel of the body corporate concerned, the mere fact that one of the persons in that scheme is a proprietary director or part-time director or part-time employee will not invalidate the whole scheme.  I could understand the Minister making the case, as he has made the point, with relation to proprietary directors and part-time directors, that they have a greater freedom to make arrangements for themselves and, accordingly, there should be different provisions for them.  That is not the point at issue here.</P>
      <P>As I understand the situation this means that a scheme, which is otherwise a good scheme and which would come in as an excepted scheme, falls altogether to the ground because a director or proprietary employee comes in.  I admit frankly I am not as clear on this part of the Bill as I was in relation to some of the other parts and there will be plenty of opportunities for the Minister to teach me what the sections mean but as I read the ordinary meanings of the words that is the meaning of sub-section (2), clause (b) as it is.  I would be happy to hear from the Minister what it means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme would not fall entirely.  The scheme could be excepted leaving the directors out.  As we have agreed already to exclude directors from the main scheme, then under this part it would be logical to allow them under an excepted scheme which is of far much less magnitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I read it, an excepted scheme cannot be an excepted scheme if they are in it.  If it is an excepted scheme it is automatically included willy nilly but if it is an approved scheme there is a discretion given.  I do not see why they should be taken out of the scheme as of right and put into the discretionary basis merely because one or two persons in the scheme are so included. We shall have to come back on the <Col N="936" /> Report Stage on the basis of an assessment of what one might term executive directors but, leaving that aside, the position should be that if the scheme&mdash; even on the Minister's set up&mdash;would be an excepted scheme, were it not for the presence of these people, then it must be an excepted scheme as of right for the remaining persons in it. I do not know if I have achieved that by my drafting.  That is another question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it would, but the Minister says it would not.  I accept his word, but I think it does.  I think the whole scheme goes as an excepted scheme.  Might I explain my view a little more clearly?  Sub-section (2) (b) deals with excepted schemes. If any of these people are included in it, then the scheme is not an excepted scheme any more.  If it is an excepted scheme, it is included in the provision as of right.  If any of these are in, it ceases to be an excepted scheme and therefore the right is gone.  A new procedure has to be initiated to have the scheme formally approved at the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners. We will come on to discretion in other amendments.  A new procedure has to be initiated for it and I <Col N="937" /> think it is correct to say that if a scheme is there with any of these people in it, the scheme wholly falls to the ground because it is no longer an excepted scheme and a new procedure must then start to make it an approved scheme.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in this amendment. Section 31 provides certain ways out of, if you like, the general blockade of Section 30.  Section 30 says that every such payment shall be treated in a certain manner.  Then, in Section 31, there are set out certain schemes which will not come within that general embargo.  The whole basis of Section 31 and, in fact, the whole basis of Part V, is that proprietary directors, part-time directors, proprietary employees and part-time employees shall be excluded.  There would be no point in letting them in under sub-section (2) (b), unless you let them in all over the place.  Why not also let them in under sub-section (1) (b)?  To accept the amendment would be to run contrary to the whole tenor of the section.  The section is to provide that certain limited schemes which comply with certain specific terms shall be exempted from the operation of Section 30 and I think the Minister, in following his general trend, is right in excluding this type of people from an excepted scheme.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Sweetman is in trouble, the House can well imagine the trouble I am in.  I just do not understand it but, as far as I do, I am inclined to agree with Deputy Sweetman.  As far as I can see, his argument is not that the scheme in Section 31 is necessarily wrong but that by making this odd provision, in the words of clause (b) of sub-section (2), the Minister appears to be going wider than he intends.  In other <Col N="938" /> words, if you have a retirement benefit scheme, say, in a smallish business, if one proprietary director, part-time director, proprietary employee or part-time employee gets into it, the whole scheme has gone and the others suffer as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The whole principle of Part V is to treat directors and employees over a certain figure in a different way from that in which other employees are treated.  The Minister agrees that that is the whole principle of Part V.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 30 provides that no scheme is a good scheme.  As the Minister himself put it, Section 30 is the universal blockade.  Section 31 says that certain schemes can get through.  One is an excepted scheme. The schemes which can get through under Section 30 and Section 31, to which Deputy Haughey referred, get through as of right.  There is no question of any discretion.  They get through as of right.  Sub-section (2) provides that excepted schemes shall get through as of right, but if there are, say, 100 employees in a firm and one proprietary employee as well as the 100 employees who do not come in under this, the whole scheme is killed by reason of the wording of sub-section (2).  I do not agree with the Minister's general line, but, to be logical on his own general line, what he should do is to say that the scheme will be an excepted scheme for everybody in it who is not a proprietary director, a part-time director, a proprietary employee or a part-time employee, then I would be quite happy.  They can go on under the approval section.</P>

      <P>Surely Deputy Sweetman is anticipating difficulties which will never arise?  Here is a special type of scheme, with benefits not exceeding £3,000.  If the situation which Deputy Sweetman envisages arises, all that is necessary is that the proprietary director, part-time director, proprietary employee or part-time employee should drop out of the scheme.  Then the scheme immediately becomes an excepted scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey has put it very well.  What we are doing here, as the Deputy has put it already, is first putting down a blockade.  Now we come along with the exceptions.  One exception, we say, is an excepted scheme which we define as a scheme, the total benefits of which cannot exceed £3,000 for each person, provided there is no director in it.  In fact, I believe that the directors are not in any schemes that the revenue has been dealing with.  Directors do not join these schemes.  Deputy Sweeman says he does not agree with it, but the idea is that, in order to have it an excepted scheme, the directors and proprietary employees should be excluded, the reason being that a director or proprietary employee has what may be regarded as the equivalent of a lump sum at the time of retirement.  He has an interest in the company.  He may be a director.  He has at least what might be regarded as the equivalent of the lump sum of the employee.  We regard it as appropriate that the employee should get a lump sum at that time and the director or proprietary employee is provided for otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second point is&mdash;it may not occur very often&mdash;that if we were to allow a director into this and to get a lump sum of £3,000 at a certain time, 65 years of age or 70 years of age, or whatever it may be, he might repeat that, if he were in more than one company.  From every point of view, <Col N="940" /> the provision in this part generally of excluding directors and proprietary employees from the benefits that we are providing here is desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing the point I am making.  I do not agree with a lot of what he has said, but that is entirely beside the point. Perhaps I am wrong in this, but, as I read it, a scheme does not get as favourable consideration under Section 32 as it gets under Section 31.  A scheme under Section 32 must comply with far more things than a scheme under Section 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the effect of including &ldquo;none of whom...&rdquo; is that certain schemes will have to get out of Section 31 and get into Section 32.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There are schemes already in existence with directors in them.  The whole scheme falls because of the way this is drafted. It need not necessarily be a director. It may be an employee.  Supposing a proprietary employee or a proprietary director takes the line that he has a contractual right already under that scheme&mdash;and he can have&mdash;why should he give up his rights?  That man can block 99 others from getting benefits under this section.  I do not agree with the Minister's general line but, to be logical on his own general line, sub-section (2) (b) should provide that an excepted scheme means a retirement scheme which does not apply to proprietary directors and so forth, and if the scheme already applies to proprietary directors, then it will be taken to be an excepted scheme; then the other 99 per cent. are not penalised.</P>

      <P>There are even more than that, but we shall come to them. I cannot see why, on the face of it, the procedure should be as it is stated.  I want to provide that if the Revenue Commissioners refuse to register a scheme, a person will have the right to appeal to the Special Commissioners. As the sub-section is phrased, I do not think a person has that right. I do not see why one should be bound to go to court with the devil in hell. Without drawing any analogy between his satanic majesty and the Revenue Commissioners, the present position is that the Revenue Commissioners are the sole people who can decide this.  That is wrong.  There should be a power of appeal somewhere and if the Revenue Commissioners turn an application down, the disappointed director or employee should be able to appeal to the Special Commissioners of Income-Tax in the ordinary way as he can appeal against his assessment.  I can see no difference whatever in the principle of approval for these schemes being subject to appeal from the <Col N="942" /> ordinary question of whether my income-tax assessment is correct or not. I would urge the Minister very strongly to accept this amendment and to provide for some method of appeal.</P>

      <P>It is being added on, if you like, but they have been dealing with superannuation schemes for a long time and there has never been any complaint.  Anyway, a Minister has discretion to deal with certain cases and if he uses his discretion, I do not think there can be any appeal.  Nobody can question that discretion, once he uses it, and if we give the Revenue Commissioners discretion in a case like this, I do not see how you can have an appeal.  If, let us say, the Special Commissioners or the Circuit Court say: &ldquo;You cannot use your discretion in that way,&rdquo; then you take that discretion from him.  If you have an appeal, the matter will have to be looked at in an entirely different way because we will have taken discretion from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>No, I am not trying to misquote the Minister.  As regards the question as to whether &ldquo;no payment in respect of, or in substitution for, the benefits has been made&rdquo;, where is the discretion there, or, as regards &ldquo;that some event has occurred by reason whereof no such payment will be made&rdquo;, where is the discretion there?  It is entirely factual, entirely a matter on which there should be a determination of fact, and I cannot see any reason whatever for vesting in the Revenue Commissioners the determination of such a matter.  I would have thought that on the actual drafting-but I am not prepared to argue this on a drafting point&mdash;if the section read: &ldquo;subsequently the director or employee proves that no payment in respect of,&rdquo; it would automatically mean he had to prove it, first of all, to the inspector of taxes and if he was not able to get agreement there, it would automatically mean the matter would go to the Special Commissioners, and under the Income-Tax Act, there would automatically be an appeal to the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>I still think that is the correct interpretation of the drafting but I shall not argue on that because whether or not my drafting is right does not matter.  The point here is that in this sub-paragraph (b) there is absolutely nothing to be determined by the Revenue Commissioners except a question of fact and, so far as I am aware, nowhere in the Income-Tax Acts, on a question of fact, is a discretion given to the Revenue Commissioners. So far as I can see, it is entirely a question of fact and, as such, there should be an appeal from that determination of fact.</P>

Under the section as at present drafted, the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to say: &ldquo;We are not satisfied.&rdquo;  Then you are put on proof, which may be difficult.  On the other hand, in the other way, if the Minister accepted Deputy Sweetman's contention, it would be up to the Revenue Commissioners to prove the contrary, if they could, and, failing agreement on the point, it would then go before the Special Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other point that concerns me in any such sub-section as this, where reference is made to matters to be proved to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, is whether the Revenue Commissioners, as such, ever hear of the matter which is in dispute.  My experience has always been that only very important matters get near the Revenue Commissioners. <Col N="946" /> In many cases, the decision is taken by some other official.  I have confidence in the Revenue Commissioners, as such, but I do not like the giving of discretion to Revenue Commissioners which is then exercised by someone else.</P>

      <P>On the section.  This section, and Section 30, refers to a proprietary director, a part-time director, a proprietary employee and a part-time employee.  Is there an allowance for income-tax purposes to those who contribute, say, to the superannuation fund in a local authority or to civil servants who contribute to a superannuation fund?  Would they be covered by this section or are they already covered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Look at paragraph (i) of sub-section (2).  They are exempt from this section altogether.  A statutory superannuation scheme is exempt from this.  They are already covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The purposes of Section 31 (1) (b) are fairly clear.  The idea is that where a scheme is in existence before the specified date the provisions of Section 30 will not apply to payments made by way of premium pursuant to such a scheme.  But the sub-section, paragraph (b), goes on to exclude payments which are related to directors and employees admitted to membership of the scheme after this part of the Act comes into operation, and proprietary directors, part-time directors, proprietary employees or part-time employees.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to make it quite clear that in so far as proprietary directors, part-time directors, proprietary employees, or part-time employees are concerned, in the future, where a payment relates to them the scheme will operate, and that payment will come within the provisions of Section 30 only and not invalidate the scheme as a whole.  In other words, a scheme that was in existence will continue in existence and Section 30 will not apply except in so far as the payments relate to these types of people. I should like the Minister to assure us on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like him to give some further thought to that idea, because it seems to me to be a bit harsh that these types of people, proprietary directors, part-time directors, proprietary employees and part-time employees, who have been members of a scheme up to now, and have enjoyed <Col N="948" /> certain benefits, are to have their conditions changed.  Would it be sufficient if the Minister merely confined the operation of paragraph (b) to any additional benefits which would be given to these people from now on, but in so far as the payments are only the same as they have been up to now that they be exempted from the operation of Section 30, that is, treated as income-tax in their hands.</P>
    <P>As regards sub-section (4), I must admit I do not understand what the sub-section means at the moment and I should like the Minister to elaborate on it.  I have read it many times and still it is not any clearer to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point is that we should say that we are not going to interfere with anybody there already.  What we are doing here is saying that what is done in the past is <Col N="949" /> all right, where the scheme is approved from this on.  The big point of this is approval and the amount that will be paid by way of pension, as compared with the amount paid by way of lump sum.  I feel it will not be difficult to make things all right, that is, so far as the other people in the scheme are concerned.  A proprietary director, or proprietary employee, would have to take himself out of the scheme.  I have given reasons for this several times before, but perhaps it is no harm to repeat them.</P>
      <P>The first point I gave was that the proprietary director or proprietary employee was able to wield a great deal of influence in the type of scheme that would be drawn up, and possibly drawn up to his benefit.  That was No. 1.  No. 2, as I mentioned already this evening, is that we are providing for a pension scheme by permitting one-fourth of the pension to go by way of lump sum.  The ordinary employee who retires, say, at 65, usually has not got any money.  He has had to rear a family, perhaps, and has not had any money to spare.  He now has to carry on on his pension.  The lump sum is very useful to him and perhaps allows him to retire to some place where he can buy a new house, or something like that.</P>
      <P>For that reason, the lump sum can be defended, but the proprietary employee or proprietary director is not in that position.  He has shares in the company.  If he is a director, he may be remaining on in the company and therefore he is at least as well off as the other man getting the lump sum. For that reason, we say that man can come to Part VI of the Bill where he can get equal treatment, as far as income-tax is concerned, on his premium.  But, on the other hand, he gets a pension and no lump sum.  I think the two cases can be equated in that way, the ordinary employee as against the proprietary employee or proprietary director.  It was for that reason, having these considerations in mind, that the difference was made between the ordinary employee and the proprietary employee and the proprietary director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one <Col N="950" /> further point in that connection which I should like to put to the Minister. The House has accepted the principle of Part V, that proprietary directors and employees are in a different category.  I want to deal with this narrow aspect, the case of schemes which are in existence, which are dealt with under sub-section (1) (b).  Is it clear that the only effect of sub-section (1) (b) is that a scheme which is in existence will not be affected at all?  All that will happen will be that in so far as payments are made to these types of people under existing schemes, they will be just treated as income-tax in their hands, but otherwise the scheme would not be affected and other payments made in respect of other employees will be perfectly all right.</P>
      <P>If that is so, and I think it is, will the Minister look at it from this aspect?  If he is satisfied that there is no great abuse under existing schemes, and unless certain schemes that he knows of do provide excessively for proprietary directors or proprietary employees, will he agree to help this type of person who is in a scheme?  From now on he will either withdraw from the scheme, and possibly lose a certain amount of what he has paid in already, or he will have to pay income-tax on the amount paid on his behalf.  I should like the Minister to look into it.</P>
      <P>If there are no great abuses known to him at the moment in this type of scheme, he might consider that it would not be exactly fair to this type of person who is a member of an existing scheme from now on for the Minister to put the gun to his head and say: &ldquo;You must either get out of the scheme&rdquo;&mdash;thereby ensuring he will suffer some disadvantage&mdash;&ldquo;or else we will tax the payments made on your behalf as income.&rdquo;  I am asking the Minister, in considering that one aspect, to ignore his general principle of treating the proprietary director, part-time director and so on separately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It appeared to me that there was a danger that schemes already approved might be held to come under Section 31, sub-section (1) (b).  Even if they do not, does it not mean that a contract existing between a proprietary director or part-time director and a proprietary employee or a part-time employee and an insurance company or pension company is now being invalidated?  Unless there is something improper and unless it could be substantiated that the Revenue Commissioners would not have approved, I feel there is an element of retrospection there that a proper contract for retirement benefit made between two individuals is now being invalidated by the Revenue Commissioners or by the Act.  If there is any danger of that, I would be very much concerned.</P>
      <P>I should like an absolute assurance from someone&mdash;and I do not wish to cast any aspersions on my colleague, Deputy Haughey&mdash;that every scheme now in existence which has been approved will not and cannot be amended in any way by any subsequent legislation either as regards taxation or the benefits which can be received under the scheme by way of capital sum or otherwise.</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear to Deputy Booth that approval of a scheme under the 1921 Act is one thing, but the fact that the Revenue Commissioners have not been able to collect income-tax on contributions made in a company scheme does not mean that they could not collect the income-tax. The fact that it is strongly disapproved is the reason we are bringing in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 32</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 56 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 57:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to delete paragraph (h).</P>
      <P>There are three points I want to raise in moving this amendment.  First of all, is it clear that &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; in line 44 means annual benefits? Certainly, it is intended to mean annual benefits, but I do not think it is necessary because, as the section is arranged, the one-fourth lump sum is a benefit.  It is taken into account in the second sub-section.  If it is paid, then the first sub-section is out and that is all an inclusive clause and the scheme must comply with every single item.  I think that is what is intended but it is not drafted properly.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I am not quite clear in regard to this particular paragraph dealing with the case of a pension to a widow or dependent.  I am not clear whether including &ldquo;any person on his retirement&rdquo; also covers the pension that might be payable to the widow. I use the word &ldquo;widow&rdquo; as covering &ldquo;dependents&rdquo; as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are only objections of form, <Col N="954" /> because I am quite sure there is no real difference between the Minister and myself.  What I object to in this section really is that there is no method in it by which a highly specialised person can be taken into a company and given special retirement treatment. We all know that a company may have one person doing a very particularly specialised job.  There may be only one such job in the company and they have to take somebody in at a late age to fill that job when it becomes vacant, when the previous man dies.  As far as I can see, that man cannot carry over, so to speak, the years of his working that he has had otherwise.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there should be something other than complete discretion. We should recognise the principle that we may have to take people in.  If we must have this clause&mdash;and I do not imagine for an instant that the Minister will agree to its deletion, as that would seem to upset completely his whole scheme, rotten though his scheme is&mdash;then it should be &ldquo;whichever is the greater&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;whichever is the lesser.&rdquo;  In that way, one can bring in specialised personnel and a company can engage them.  Without something like that, one just would not be able to get the specialised personnel one may want to deal with many of the more modern facets of the knowhow of industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The &ldquo;aggregate value&rdquo; referred to here means the value of pension and lump sum combined, that is, the total value must not be more than is set out&mdash;one-sixtieth of the final remuneration multiplied by the number of years of service, or two-thirds of his final remuneration, whichever is the lesser.  There is a method of calculating the lump sum and calculating the benefit of the pension, and so on, to arrive at that test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>He gets one-sixtieth for each year.  He has been employed for, shall we say, 20 years.  His salary is, say £600&mdash;that is easy to calculate &mdash;that means his total would be 20 multiplied by 10, which is £200.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; includes the lump sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he gets his £200, that would be the maximum; he would get no lump sum.  It is only if the lump sum is provided, that the pension would be lower, somewhat lower.  As the Deputy knows, in the Civil Service the rule was one-sixtieth multiplied by the number of years' service, not more than 40.  That was changed, then, to one-eightieth plus a lump sum. It would have to be somewhat like that here, one or the other.  The reason why it has to be like this, as the aggregate value, is to give some latitude to allow a lump sum, but not more than a quarter of the total benefit must be in the form of a lump sum.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked how a widow or dependent could be provided for. That is provided for later on, in regard to the widow or dependent.  Of course, that would come into the aggregate value of the retirement allowance, whatever the widow or the dependent can get.</P>
      <P>With regard to the highly specialised persons, what the Deputy has in mind is that an expert or a very highly qualified technical person coming into employment would probably be above the average age of entering employment. There is provision for that under clause (v) of sub-section (2).  An exception can be made in a case of that kind.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister confirm my opinion of what clause (h) means?  I should like the Minister to tell me whether I am right or wrong &mdash;that when a person benefits under retirement it works out in this way. Take the one-sixtieth multiplied by the number of years' service.  That would give a certain sum.  You take the value of that sum as a pension for life.  It is that value which is meant by &ldquo;aggregate value&rdquo; in paragraph (i)?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, where you have a person being paid £600 a year in the year of retirement and where he has been there for 20 years he is entitled to 20 sixtieths of £600, which is £200, as a pension for his life.  Supposing that, under the tables, the expectation of his life when he retires is ten years, the &ldquo;aggregate value&rdquo; is intended to mean £2,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section stands, with the words &ldquo;for his life&rdquo; included, it would mean <Col N="958" /> that the one-quarter benefit would be only on the pension payable to the man himself.  That might be lower than the total value because he may have provided, as he can do under this Act, for a pension for his widow after himself. In fact, we are being more fair to him by leaving out these words.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are really doing here is, as it were, laying down rules which are to be followed as desirable. Later on, we can make exceptions to these rules, but we will make all the desirable rules first.  We speak here of the amount that must be given as a benefit on death in employment.  We give four possibilities; one, the sum of £1,000; two, an amount equal to the person's final remuneration if it is higher than £1,000; three, an amount equal to one-thirtieth of the person's final remuneration multiplied by the number of his years of service or by 45, whichever is the lesser.  I think that is the Civil Service rule.  The fourth is that we give back an amount equal to the aggregate of the sums contributed, in other words the premiums, with interest.  All these choices are given and I think we should not tie them any further than that.  The Deputy's amendment would compel people drawing up a scheme to include compound interest. Such people have to keep everything in view, such as what pension they could provide on a certain contribution, and they do not want to be too liberal, as it were, in regard to any particular contingency, whether it is a girl going out to get married&mdash;she may get premiums back&mdash;or a person dying in employment, or a person reaching retirement age, and the determination of what pension or benefit he should get.</P>

      <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister to consider deleting the £1,000 because the way I see it operating is that it would be harder on the lower income people than the higher income people.  A man's final remuneration, in the case of a better paid employee, could be £2,000 and I should like to know why the Minister is restricting the lower paid employee to £1,000.  The whole purpose of this is to cut out abuses in existing superannuation schemes, but surely there can be no question of abuses in the case of people with £500 or £600 a year, people whose final remuneration would go up to, say, £1,000 a year.  I am not pressing the point but I should like to put it to the Minister that he should consider deleting the £1,000 and leave it as a sum equal to the person's final remuneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; I mean increasing the £1,000, because in the case of a man whose final remuneration would be only £500, I would suggest increasing it to £2,000 or <Col N="960" /> £3,000 to cover the type of person I have in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be rather hard on the scheme if the person were only one year in the service and drew £3,000.  I must say I have not examined the schemes-although I have seen them-from this standpoint.  One scheme I know provides for one and a half year's salary and nothing else, no matter what the length of service may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter of saying that the employee shall get £1,000 but that he may not get more. The promoters of the scheme are perfectly well able to look after themselves, but once you put in the provision that it shall not exceed £1,000 or the amount of final remuneration, no matter how benevolent the promoters wish to be, they are not permitted to be benevolent.  I agree with Deputy Haughey that the lower paid employee, or his dependents, are considerably prejudiced.  A higher paid employee, presumably, will not be unduly pushed for money when he retires; neither will his dependents, but one in the lower income group might well need a capital sum to set up in business or buy a house.  I cannot see why there should be a strict maximum of £1,000, or the final remuneration.  I agree with Deputy Haughey that the maximum should not be less than £3,000 and that it might even be higher, because a higher paid employee might be able to draw £5,000 or even £10,000, although that is not very likely in this country.  I can see no reason, from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners, for not increasing it to £5,000.  I can think of many cases, especially of those in the lower income group, where £5,000 in a lump sum would be worth a good deal more than a small or a moderate pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the point of the section to set limits beyond which an approved scheme may not go?  Is it not the Minister's intention to provide that a scheme cannot become a &ldquo;diddle&rdquo; in some way or another by giving a benefit greater than the remuneration of the employee would appear to warrant?  It would defeat part of the objects which the Revenue <Col N="961" /> Commissioners are seeking to achieve in this Bill, if the higher figure is fixed.  I understood from the Minister earlier that the Revenue authorities disapproved of schemes where the benefits were unduly high; that that was part of the &ldquo;fiddle&rdquo; that was involved and that was what they were trying to guard against.</P>

      <P>Deputy Booth and I are concerned with the relation between the £1,000 and the person's final remuneration.  This paragraph deals with the death benefits payable and the person mainly concerned will be the man's widow.  A person in the higher income bracket on final remuneration could get conceivably £3,000 for the purposes of this Act.  Why should the lower paid employee not be entitled to provide that for his widow if the scheme is able to provide it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, the sum of £1,000 does not represent a very high pension benefit.  If the alternative were a pension, the amount of that pension would be comparatively small, and there might be a large number of employees whose dependents would be entitled to a pension on death but who would much prefer a lump sum in order to put the family on a reasonable financial footing.  A thousand pounds is not a tremendous amount for anyone to have his life insured for, and I feel the dependents of a deceased employee, particularly in the comparatively lower income groups, might very well be <Col N="962" /> entitled to a moderate pension or an equivalent cash payment considerably in excess of £1,000.  If that is the case I just cannot see why his dependents are precluded from getting it particularly as people in that income group would be more sorely in need of a cash sum on death of breadwinners.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 60:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to delete paragraph (1).</P>
      <P>It seems to me all this discussion is more relevant under amendment No. 60 and I am obliged to Deputy Booth for making part of my case for me.  I can understand the Minister finding it necessary to restrict the benefits because otherwise they could be used as a method of milking a private company for the purpose of taking out moneys without liability for tax, but I cannot understand why there should be the restriction on commuting the sum of those benefits.  This thing has been taken entirely from the Civil Service superannuation code, and it is an entirely different case, on the Civil Service basis, that operates behind the restriction on commutation.  There the State is the person that pays the pension, and the State might have to come to the aid of the pensioner if the pensioner had not got his pension to sustain himself.  It is because the State has to come to the aid of the pensioner there is the provision against commutation in the Civil Service code.  I do not see why there should be any mitigation in the case of a private employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can foresee the case of a private person who retires, wanting to settle down on a small farm in the country, and preferring to commute his pension within the limits the Minister has fixed <Col N="963" /> for the purpose of getting the money to buy a farm.  Why should he not be allowed to do that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would excuse me.  Is the point of restricting the lump sum which can be taken to one-fourth of the aggregate benefit, not because that lump sum is free of tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not but there is a very substantial tax remission on the face of it.  The position could very well be that the burden of the relative lump sum, the relative tax remission, that could be obtained, could be considerably less in this scheme than in the life insurance.  I can understand the Minister's anxiety to restrict the amount of the benefits that can be obtained, but I do not see why a benefit <Col N="964" /> should not be commuted.  I do not think it affects the tax problem to any worthwhile degree, but I certainly think that in so far as the individual is concerned it is trying to mollycoddle him too much to suggest that he must under statute provide for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is quite well aware, the whole purpose of this part of the Bill is to stop the practice that has been growing of employees and directors having contributions made for retirement benefit free of income-tax. The company did not pay income-tax because it was an expense of the company.  The person concerned did not pay income-tax because it was not returned.  When it came to the time when he received the benefit, it was a lump sum and therefore he paid no tax on it.  This part of the Bill is to get at that.  We say that the contribution made is taxable, unless he does certain things.  One of the certain things is to make sure that he will pay tax at the other end, that is, that he will get a pension and pay tax on that.</P>
      <P>We could have stopped there and said that we had done our job, but I felt that the person might say that he was not being treated as well as civil servants are treated.  Civil servants get one-fourth of the benefit by way of lump sum.  I said: &ldquo;All right; we will give him one-fourth as a lump sum, but no more.&rdquo;  I felt that we would be treating him too generously, if we allowed any more.  Therefore, we cannot allow the pension to be commuted, assigned or surrendered, because in that case it becomes free of tax.  That is what it amounts to. If a man wants to provide a lump sum for himself at 65 years of age, he has to insure his life separately for that purpose.  We are dealing with a scheme of superannuation and have to stick to that.</P>

      <P>In answer to Deputy Sweetman, I said that the reason why the Minister will not permit somebody to commute more than one-fourth of <Col N="965" /> the aggregate value of his benefit is that, in so far as it is commuted and becomes payable as a lump sum, it is free of tax, whereas in so far as it is a pension or annuity, it is taxable. It is taxed when he subsequently receives it.</P>

      <P>We had some discussion when the Ceann Comhairle was here and I reserved my right to move amendment No. 61.  I think the interpretation is slightly different.  I can get what I want on the section.  What I want to know is in relation to clause (m) and I put down the amendment so as to draw attention to clause (m).  In the case of a person who has been an ordinary employee, not a proprietary employee, not a part-time employee, as is provided here, but an ordinary employee for, say, 15 years, of a company, must the scheme provide that that man can never buy shares in the company?  As I see it, if the scheme does not provide that he must never buy up to 10 per cent. of the shares in the company, he is liable to be caught under this clause.  I can understand the Minister's point of view in relation to a person who comes in <i>ab initio</i> as a director, proprietary director or even proprietary employee, that he should obviously go on to the next part, but now, as I see it, by reason of this section, if a person who has been in the company for years as an ordinary employee gets promotion or buys stock in the company, <i>ipso facto</i>, he has to lose whatever he would get under this scheme for the remaining years' service.  I do not think it is right.  To be fair to the Minister, I do not think it is what he intended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like now an explanation from the Minister on the point about clause (m), where a person spent 15 years as an ordinary employee. Surely it is reasonable to provide that where a person has been working for a long period like that, he will not have to choose between his promotion and his scheme.  That is what it amounts to.  He will have to choose between promotion and the scheme.  It is not beyond the Minister's power to devise an amendment here which would mean that a person who has been an employee for a long period could have his remaining time continued, but that a person coming in fresh could not, by so doing, defraud the Minister of his tax.  I think the Minister will be able to find some form of words to cover that between now and Report Stage.  I shall try to assist a little also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention, however, to 32 (1) (b) (i), lines 18 and 19: &ldquo;or on becoming permanently incapacitated at an earlier age,&rdquo;.  Is it essential to have &ldquo;permanently incapacitated&rdquo; there?  I am thinking of a person who becomes incapacitated for such a period that he would prefer to leave the company and, when his incapacity finishes, try to find some other type of occupation.  He might, for example, contract tuberculosis and decide that, when he recovers after a period in a sanatorium, that type of work was not to his liking and that he would prefer to try something else.  In those circumstances if he wishes to withdraw from the scheme and to withdraw his contribution, it would break the whole scheme. He is not permanently incapacitated <Col N="968" /> and there should be some method of providing that a person can withdraw from a scheme and get back his payments without breaking up the whole scheme.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister explain what is the reason for the inclusion of the words &ldquo;not exceeding 70 years&rdquo; which is in the sub-section to which Deputy Sweetman has been referring?  Paragraph (i) provides: &ldquo;directors or employees of the body corporate on retirement, either on reaching a specified age (not exceeding 70 years)...&rdquo;  I cannot see any good reason for including that specific age limit but I can see quite a number of good reasons for omitting it altogether. We are dealing with this rather on Civil Service lines as if everybody would be starting round about the same age whereas in ordinary businesses a scheme like this may come into operation and include fairly senior employees, say, of the age of 60 or 65, and it would be impossible to arrange any proper retirement benefit if they could not continue in employment after the age of 70.  With the present expectation of life, 70 years is not an excessive age by any means.  Perhaps the Minister would let me know what is the official reason for putting it in.  Would it prejudice anyone if we just took out those words in brackets altogether?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are dealing with here is income-tax and the only way we could get the income-tax paid is by way of a pension scheme.  If we did not put in this age limit of 70, you might have a small private company with three or four people in it providing <Col N="969" /> very big sums to give them a retiring allowance, say, at 95 and then, providing death comes in the meantime, the whole lump sum is paid.  There are large considerations like that.  The age of 60 or 70 is usually laid down for such schemes but in this case, under sub-section (2) there is power to vary that if there is any good reason why it should be done.</P>

      <P>Surely there should be some provision as to the grounds on which the Revenue Commissioners can withdraw approval?  It seems an incredible power to give to anyone that, in relation to a scheme which may be put into operation or a contract which may be drawn up between an employee and an insurance company, when submitted to the Revenue Commissioners for approval, they may either agree to it or, on any grounds at all, withdraw approval.  That is giving a tremendous power.  It would make it very difficult for anyone to enter into a contract when it is known that the Revenue Commissioners, the people with final approval, might not approve of it and need not say why the approval is withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">

      <P>Would the Minister not consider re-drafting the sub-section? The Minister and the Revenue Commissioners never can see that their intentions, which are apparently quite honourable, later on become the intentions of other people. When this House is passing legislation, it has to look beyond the people who are in office when the legislation is being passed.  It should be so framed that nothing but the intention of this House can, in fact, be put into operation. I am quite sure the Minister will agree that the intention of this House is that it should not be possible that withdrawal of approval can be made without the right of appeal to anyone else, except in cases of fraud.</P>

      <P>If sub-section (3) of Section 33 of the Bill gives the Revenue Commissioners this power or if they have power even to approve of any part of a benefit scheme, would it not be well if they were given power, if they thought fit, to withdraw approval only in relation to part of the scheme?  It seems to me that, in sub-section (3) of Section 32, they must just withdraw approval and that that is that.  Would it not be desirable to give them authority to withdraw approval <Col N="972" /> for part of a scheme, just as they have power to approve of part of a scheme?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not say he will reconsider the matter? Would the Minister not deal with it completely by accepting amendment No. 62?  I do not know if this is the ordinary phraseology for income-tax appeals: I did not look it up.  However, if an appeal is given from the withdrawal of approval or from the refusal of approval, that seems to cover all the points we have discussed. The appeal would then be thrown out if there was fraud and, if the withdrawal of approval was unnecessary, the appeal would succeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 32, (1), the Revenue Commissioners shall approve a retirement benefits scheme if it fulfils all the conditions mentioned in the sub-section.  It says &ldquo;... the Revenue Commissioners shall approve a retirement benefits scheme....&rdquo; They have no option.  They must approve.  However, under sub-section (2) they have discretion to approve a retirement benefits scheme notwithstanding, for example, that the conditions set out in paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 32 are not satisfied, and so on.  We come, therefore, to a case that either the Revenue Commissioners have granted approval because they had to do so or have refused, under their discretion.  I think this is a case where there could be no appeal.  If we give the Revenue Commissioners discretion in this case, say, to vary the terms of sub-paragraphs (a) or (b) or (c), as the case may be, down along, and if they decide in a certain case they will not agree to vary, say, sub-paragraphs (a) or (b), we have given them the discretion and must put up with it and there could be no appeal.  Therefore, the Deputy's amendment could not be accepted because it is giving discretion and an appeal from that is impossible.  No appeal tribunal can say they did not use the discretion properly.  If we did not give them the discretion we would have to do it in some other way, if we wanted to question it.  We cannot do it by an amendment like this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow the Minister's argument.  There are plenty of cases known to the law, for example, where a person had a discretion and where the appeal that is there is an appeal not over the discretion but as to whether the discretion was or was not properly used.  The same would operate in relation to sub-section (2). As sub-section (1) is at present, it is provided that the matters have to be proved to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners.  If it was required to have an appeal, there would be consequential amendments. I do not suggest for a minute there would not be consequential amendments. There would.</P>
      <P>The principle appears to me to be quite undeniable that all these matters must, in the long run, be matters of fact&mdash;as to whether the fact is this or that; whether the scheme in fact does this or in fact does that.  I cannot see, under those circumstances, why the Revenue Commissioners should be set up as the sole judge of fact.  The whole tenor, even of the Income Tax Acts&mdash; and they are restrictive enough, God knows-is to provide that, where it is a matter of fact, there is an appeal against their determination.  There is no reason why we would not have a similar sort of appeal in this case except that people are jealous of any power they have&mdash;and that is the same whether it is a Fianna Fáil Minister or a Fine Gael Minister or the Revenue Commissioners.  None of us like parting with it.  That is the only thing that is holding this there.  Will the Minister consider the matter between now and the Report Stage?</P>

      <P>I must say I am not sure exactly on this point.  I do not understand this legal phraseology very well, but, if it is a question of fact, can a person have an appeal on that?  You say it is a fact, but I say the other thing is true.  I am not sure that there is or is not an appeal in law in this case.  I do not think it would be wise to have an appeal to the Special Commissioners because it is a matter of discretion. The Special Commissioners will have a look at it and say: &ldquo;You use your discretion in a certain way: we would use it in another way.&rdquo;  I do <Col N="974" /> not think we would be much better off with that.  If we give the Revenue Commissioners discretion, we will give it to them and see how it works.</P>

Does that mean that under the sub-section all the members could possibly lose their benefits by being assessed?  All I want is some information.  Is it possible that that point is met by the last part of sub-section (3), Section 33, where it refers to a retirement benefits scheme approved under Section 32 of the Act and says &ldquo;shall be deemed to include references to a part of a scheme under this sub-section&rdquo;?  Is there power there to deal with any particular scheme where approval has been withdrawn.  In other words, can the Revenue Commissioners withdraw approval of part of a scheme?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 64:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5) Where the aggregate value of all benefits provided on or in connection with the retirement of a director or employee under all retirement benefits schemes subsisting in connection with the body corporate does not exceed £3,000, this section shall not take effect in relation to such director or employee.</P>
      <P>Section 34 provides for the taxation of so much of a lump sum benefit under an approved scheme, given to a member on his retirement, in excess of one-fourth of the total benefit.  That section applies to whatever the amount may be.  We have, however, already dealt with excepted schemes and in excepted schemes, the person may get benefit up to £3,000 without restriction. This is to give the £3,000 exemption.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 34, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to be clear on this section.  It seems to me that it means one thing and I would like the Minister to indicate whether I am right or wrong.  Take the case of a scheme which is approved, despite the fact that it does not comply fully with paragraph (h) of Section 32, and does not comply fully with it because the amount of benefit which is taken on retirement exceeds one-fourth of the aggregate benefits.  In other words, if a man is entitled to take £1,000 in a lump sum and he took £1,500, that <Col N="977" /> scheme could still be approved.  But what would happen is that the Revenue Commissioners would say in relation to that extra £500: &ldquo;We are going to assess you for tax in the year you retired.&rdquo;  I should like to know if I am right in that.  The section goes on further to work out a way in which the tax on that extra sum in the year of retirement would be reduced to a certain amount, which would, I think, be more or less equivalent to the tax the person would pay if, instead of taking it in the year of his retirement, he took it over his lifetime, in the form of an annuity.  That roughly is what the section seems to mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be right, provided he lived a normal life, but we are not prepared to take that risk.  What is done is this.  Let us say a person draws a lump sum of £6,000, with a big pension, and really ought to have drawn only £4,000; £2,000 is the excess referred to.  We take the commutable pension and assume he has no other income for that year, the year of retirement. Then we take the notional pension.  That would be a pension that would give £2,000 per year for the rest of his life.  We say: &ldquo;What would the income-tax be on that?&rdquo; Obviously if he is drawing a big pension, 7/6 in the £1; if it is a small pension and he has a wife, it might be only 6/- or partly 3/- and partly 6/-.  We get the average. That is applied to the lump sum.  The same applies to surtax.  Again, if he has a small pension, there will be no surtax; but if he has a large pension, there will be surtax.  It is a much fairer method than taxing the lump sum on the year of retirement.  If it were a substantial lump sum, he would have to pay surtax at a fairly high rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why this procedure has been decided on by him in regard to persons engaged in the lowly avocation of trader when every civil servant in the State on retiring <Col N="978" /> gets a large lump sum and, I understand, none of them is subject to the scheme of taxation here envisaged for a lump sum payable to a citizen of the State?  Is there anything iniquitous or shameful in allowing the concession granted to a public servant because the person who has earned it is in trade?  I remember when I was young aristocratic old ladies very greatly regretted that their daughters became engaged to somebody engaged in trade. But if it was somebody in the public service, particularly the foreign service, it was regarded as a very eligible connection; persons in trade were not eligible.</P>
      <P>Why is it wrong to get a lump sum in trade if it is not wrong to get it in the Civil Service?  If I am employing 500 men as a director of a firm why is it wrong for me on retirement to get a lump sum or pension when the secretary of the trade union catering for my men retires on the same day and gets the same lump sum or the same pension? Why is the person in trade assessed by this elaborate procedure when nobody else is?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that he is not.  If the Deputy had been listening to the debate, he would have known that that is not true.  We are taxing that part of the lump sum in excess of what a civil servant would get; a quarter of the total benefits can go as lump sum. That is the figure the civil servants get. If a person gets more than a quarter of the total benefits, we tax that excess.</P>

      <P>This part of the Bill provides a new relief from income-tax and surtax.  Payments made by self-employed persons to secure annuities for themselves in their old age are being relieved from tax.  The relief will extend also to payments made to secure, after the death of the individual, an annuity to his widow or other dependent.  Relief of this sort has long been argued for by professional organisations and others.  Deputies will remember that last year I promised that the matter would be considered in connection with this year's Finance Bill.  It is an extremely complicated matter to legislate for, as my predecessor pointed out in the Finance Bill debate in 1956, and again last year.  This explains why this part of the Bill runs to eight pages.</P>
      <P>It is obviously necessary to limit the amount of the payments which will qualify for the relief.  The limit has been set at 10 per cent. of the person's &ldquo;net relevant earnings&rdquo; or £500, whichever is the less.  &ldquo;Net relevant earnings&rdquo; are defined in Section 38 (8) and 39 (4).  Roughly speaking, they correspond to earned income for income-tax purposes as reduced by payments in the nature of charges on income and all losses and capital allowances, for years from 1958-59 on, which are regarded as reducing such income.</P>
      <P>If a person, besides being self-employed or in non-pensionable employment, also holds pensionable employment or is over 40 years of age, there are appropriate modifications of the limit.  These modifications are detailed in the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to qualify for relief, annuity contracts or superannuation schemes must be approved by the Revenue Commissioners and certain conditions have to be satisfied before such approval is given.  These precautions are included to prevent abuse of the reliefs.  A basic condition is that the benefits must in general be confined to an annuity commencing between the ages of 60 and 70 or, in the event of the individual's death, providing for his widow.  The conditions may, however, be modified at the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners, for <Col N="985" /> example, to permit of retirement before 60 years of age on grounds of ill-health or to allow of payment of an annuity to dependents other than the widow.  An annuity under an approved contract or scheme may be payable at the age selected whether or not retirement has taken place.</P>
    <P>The self-employed person who makes his own annuity contract will make it direct with an assurance company but the trustees of a superannuation trust scheme may or may not reinsure the benefits with an assurance company. The effect of Section 40 is that the investment income of the part of an annuity fund of an assurance company which relates to such pension annuity business will be exempted from tax in so far as it is applied for the benefit of the annuitants.  Profits on such business retained by the company would be subject to taxation.</P>
    <P>The general idea behind the provisions is (1) that the premiums or contributions paid by an individual will be treated as reducing his income for tax purposes and (2) that the income arising from the investment of such premiums or contributions will be exempt from tax, but (3) that the benefits must be provided entirely in the form of annuities which are subject to tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point concerning the payment of the benefit from an insurance company.  It happens that at any given moment different insurance companies offer varying types of annuities, offer better or worse bargains for types of annuities.  As far as I see, it is not possible under the section at the moment to exercise a choice.  Would the Minister consider some clause whereby a person could exercise a choice as between the company he has contracted with and some other company&mdash;provided, of course, it is still an insurance company&mdash;which at that given moment might be selling an annuity on better terms than the company with which he is actually insured?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point the British Act does differ from ours, now that I think of it.  I think what the Deputy suggests is permitted in the British Act and I think they are getting a great deal of trouble over it.  At least, so I am informed. As we have very few insurance companies operating here, I thought it better not to include that choice and so avoid trouble.  I think what Deputy Haughey has in mind is the case where a person goes to a certain insurance company and insures himself for a pension at 65. Everything is in order and approved by the Revenue Commissioners, but at the age of 65 the man could draw the lump sum and go to another company and say: &ldquo;Give me an annuity on this.&rdquo; I believe that is permitted in England but I do not want to permit it here because I understand they have had a great deal of trouble over it.  I do not think it is necessary here as the number of companies is very small and there would be no great choice.</P>

Naturally, they are, because they get confidential information about the individual's affairs, but in order to work the double income-tax arrangement, they must give information.  If a person who is living in England has an income here, the British may require some information which the Revenue Commissioners must give them for that man's benefit, and they must, therefore, have permission to depart to that extent from their obligation of secrecy.</P>

    <P>(c)  any such shares as are to be brought into account under sub-section (3) of this section,</P>
    <P>amount to 10 per cent. or more of the issued shares of that class, the net amount of the dividend received on the shares in the holding shall, to the said extent to which it was paid out of profits accumulated before the shares were acquired, be brought into account in computing for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts the profits or gains or losses of the trade as if it were a trading receipt which had not borne tax.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a person entitled under any enactment (including this Act) to an exemption from income-tax which extends to dividends on shares becomes entitled to receive a dividend on a holding of shares of a class to which this section applies, being shares sold or issued to him or <Col N="992" /> otherwise acquired by him on or after the operative date and not more than six years before the date on which the dividend becomes payable, and the dividend is to any extent paid out of profits accumulated before the date on which the shares were so acquired, then, if those shares, or those shares together with&mdash;</P>

    <P>(5)  Where, at the time when a trade is, or is deemed to be, set up and commenced, any shares form part of the trading stock belonging to the trade, those shares shall be regarded for the purposes of this section as having been acquired at that time by the person then engaged in carrying on the trade; and, subject to the foregoing provisions of this sub-section, where there is a change in the persons engaged in carrying on a trade which is not a change on which the trade is deemed to be discontinued, the provisions of this section shall apply in relation to the person so engaged after the change as if anything done to or by his predecessor has been done to or by him.</P>
    <P>(6)  The provisions of the Third Schedule to this Act shall have effect for the purpose of ascertaining whether a dividend is to be regarded as paid to any extent out of profits accumulated before a given date.</P>

    <P>(a) &ldquo;company&rdquo; includes any body corporate, but does not extend to a company not resident in the State;</P>
    <P>(b) &ldquo;person&rdquo; includes any body of persons, and references to a person entitled to any exemption from income-tax include, in a case of an exemption expressed to apply to income of a trust or fund, references <Col N="994" /> to the persons entitled to make claims for the granting of that exemption;</P>
    <P>(c)  &ldquo;shares of a class to which this section applies&rdquo; means shares of any class forming part of a company's share capital other than a class of fully-paid preference shares carrying only a right to dividends at a rate per cent. of the nominal value of the shares which is fixed or fluctuates only in accordance with the rate of income-tax and which in the opinion of the Special Commissioners does not substantially exceed the yield generally obtainable on preference shares the prices of which are quoted on stock exchanges in the State;</P>
    <P>(d) &ldquo;share&rdquo; includes stock other than debenture or loan stock;</P>
    <P>(e) shares shall be regarded as of different classes if the rights and obligations respectively attached to them are as regards the payment of dividends or the amount paid up or in any other respect distinguishable;</P>
    <P>(f) any reference to shares acquired in right of other shares includes a reference to shares acquired in pursuance of an offer or invitation which was restricted to holders of those other shares;</P>
    <P>(g) two trades shall be regarded as under the same control if they are carried on by persons one of whom is a body of persons over whom the other has control (within the meaning assigned to that expression by sub-section (8) of this section), or both of whom are bodies of persons under the control (as so defined) of a third person, and several trades shall be regarded as under the same control if each is under the same control as all of the others,</P>
    <P>and in the last foregoing paragraph &ldquo;body of persons&rdquo; includes a partnership.</P>
    <P>(8) For the purposes of paragraph (g) of sub-section (7) of this section, the following shall be taken to be <Col N="995" /> the meaning assigned to &ldquo;control&rdquo; by this sub-section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;control&rdquo;, in relation to a body corporate, means the power of a person to secure, by means of the holding of shares or the possession of voting power in or in relation to that or any other body corporate, or by virtue of any powers conferred by the articles of association or other document regulating that or any other body corporate, that the affairs of the first-mentioned body corporate are conducted in accordance with the wishes of that person, and, in relation to a partnership, means the right to a share of more than one-half of the assets, or of more than one-half of the incomes, of the partnership.</P>
    <P>This amounts to three new sections. We had some discussion of these section when the Financial Resolution was brought in, on the subject of dividend stripping.  I explained as well as I could at the time what the practice we were trying to get after was.  These sections are brought in to deal with that evil that has crept in here to some extent.  It has been practised to a substantial extent in England but has crept in here to some extent.</P>
    <P>As I explained at that time, Company A, having a fair amount of profits and not doing very much business perhaps&mdash;it may be an almost dormant company&mdash;but having a fair amount of profits on which it paid income-tax, is bought by Company B. Company B, having bought that company, gets Company A to declare a dividend of practically all the money that is there, and then sells it again.  They sell it, of course, at a figure very much lower than the figure for which they bought it.  They can show in their accounts that loss on the sale and, as they have taken this dividend out of Company B, they can claim against their loss the income-tax already paid.  The sum total of the transactions is that they have succeeded in getting money from the Exchequer.  We believe the whole thing to be an unfair transaction. <Col N="996" /> These section are designed to stop that.</P>
    <P>I gave the example before in figures because it was necessary to give some idea of how the thing could be worked. The figures I gave at that time were that Company A had purchased for £135,000, that it had profits on which it had paid income-tax; Company B, having got Company A to declare a dividend which absorbed £125,000 of that and left £10,000 profits there, sold it back for £10,000 either to the original people who owned it or somebody else.  They got rid of it. Now, in their returns for income-tax they show expenditure of £135,000 for a given company, which they sold for £10,000, representing a loss of £125,000. It is true that they have on the other side the £125,000 dividend that they took from Company B but, they said, that is not taken into account in income-tax because the income-tax is already paid upon it.</P>
    <P>The loss is shown and they can claim a refund of the income-tax already paid to cover the loss, which income-tax was originally deducted from the dividends. They claim that back.  It is proposed to deal with that in this way: In such cases, to be defined as well as possible, the £125,000 to which I referred will be treated as income and not as if income-tax had been deducted from it.  Therefore, no refund can be claimed or given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as clear as mud after the Minister's explanation, because I understood previously that the explanation in relation to this was that the purpose effected by those who carried out the transaction was that they got the £125,000 out of the company without paying surtax.  I understood from the Minister on the earlier occasion that that was the purpose of the transaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the manner in which surtax is avoided, I can understand the transaction all right.  In relation to the other part of it, it seems to me that the benefit that arose was different from what the Minister has set out.  The profits had <Col N="997" /> already paid income-tax.  The £135,000 is accumulated profits in the company that have already suffered income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In England there was the profits distribution tax and there dividend stripping meant avoidance of the profits distribution tax.  I can understand that.  But the profits had already paid income-tax and, therefore, it did not seem to me that the position was the same in relation to income-tax.  If the transaction operates in the way the Minister says, that there are £135,000 of accumulated profits that have paid income-tax and the shares of that company are bought for £135,000 by another finance company, then the first company declares and pays a dividend of £125,000.  That goes into the purchasing company and the position at that point is that the purchasing company has paid £135,000 for its interest and has got £125,000 back, so that the company stands at a loss of £10,000, and then it sells its shares back to a group of individuals.</P>
      <P>I can understand all that from the point of view of surtax avoidance because it takes a lump of money out of the company without taking it out in a way that it is a dividend in the ordinary form, because it has gone by the purchase of £135,000.  But at the end of all that transaction I cannot see where the second company has any benefit at all.  It has paid away £135,000.  It has got in £125,000.  It has suffered a loss of £10,000.  I cannot see where the benefit comes to the purchasing company and yet it is the purchasing company that is affected by these sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dividend stripping, so far as anybody can understand what it means, is a scheme for the avoidance by somebody of paying his fair share of tax. There are many such legal schemes in operation.  They are prepared from day to day and the Revenue Commissioners suggest to the Minister of the day that there is too great a loophole in that and the Minister closes the loophole.  I have no quarrel with a Minister who wants to close a loophole but in our circumstances, with no profits distribution tax, it seems to me <Col N="998" /> to be the benefit on income going out without being liable to surtax that should be caught.  It is not that income that is caught but something else.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be able to satisfy me that the effect of this transaction is to catch as well the money that is siphoned off without surtax liability.  I do not know how he is going to do that, because, as I understand it, Company A has accumulated profits of £135,000,&mdash;I am assuming for the purpose of this argument that all the companies are controlled in Ireland and that there is no question of double taxation involved&mdash;and those profits could be paid out to the shareholders, subject only to the shareholders having to meet surtax on them, and there is no question of any further income-tax being payable because the whole basis of this transaction is that they have paid income-tax.  That company with £135,000 on which income-tax has been paid is now sold and the people concerned who have the shares in that company get their money back in cash at the purchase price of the shares, and by that method the owners of those shares have the money just the same as they would have had it, if it had been declared to them as a dividend, except that they are not liable to surtax.  If that is for the avoidance of surtax, I cannot see why they cannot get that avoidance by liquidating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Why can they not liquidate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, if they liquidate, the accumulated profits are paid out by the liquidator as a dividend, not in the sense of an income dividend but a dividend in liquidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, so far as this transaction is concerned, we can forget it from the point of view of the lump sum the directors get into their hands.  That was part of the argument used by the Minister on the Financial Resolution.  That argument will not hold water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same surtax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because you are liquidating and if you liquidate, nothing you can do will prevent surtax attaching.  The £135,000 in the company is net accumulated profits.  If that dividend is declared, it will be equivalent to a dividend of £200,000 gross.  I think that is why the Minister chose £135,000 to be approximately equivalent to £200,000 gross, but £200,000 gross is only being offset by a much lesser sum net and therefore the purchasing company, being of its essence a finance company, an investment company&mdash;because unless it is an investment company, it cannot set off its capital loss against its income profit &mdash;has to set off £125,000 of an investment loss against a gross dividend of £200,000.  Therefore it is taxable on the difference, £75,000.</P>
      <P>The effect of this operation in the purchasing company is to create a liability for income-tax that was not there before, the liability to tax on the additional £75,000.  That liability was not there before this transaction operated.  Therefore, at the end of the transaction, in certain circumstances, there could arise in this country benefit to the revenue rather than loss because of the fact that the situation is different here, that we have not got high surtax payers of the nature they have in England.  It seems to be a fact on the examples, but it does not seem to me to make sense. There must be something more in this whole process of what is termed dividend stripping than the Minister has explained to us already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the practice that has grown up here is a practice <Col N="1000" /> that has grown up as between different countries.  I can see the situation completely if you have a varied profits tax, where there is a different rate of profits tax for distributed and undistributed profits.  Then the situation becomes absolutely clear because the accumulated profits in the company in Britain have borne profits tax at a lower rate of tax for undistributed profits, which, as well as my recollection goes, was only 2½ per cent., and if you distributed the profits, there was a tax of 30 per cent.  Clearly, this scheme, when it was tried there, codded the British revenue out of that 27½ per cent. difference.</P>
    <P>That I can understand without question.  We have no such scheme here.  They changed it recently in Britain, but we never had any such scheme.  The moneys we are talking about have paid income-tax already and the only benefit there would be by such a transaction would be the benefit of surtax avoidance.  If the company is, as the Minister says, a virtually dormant company, what is to prevent the liquidation of that company and the same result being arrived at?  There must be some flaw in this, but I want to see where it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to disagree with Deputy Sweetman on this matter because dividend stripping is quite clearly a method whereby companies can keep from the Exchequer sums in income-tax to which it is entitled. When Deputy Sweetman was giving the instance of the company, he overlooked one point that if the company which is bought out&mdash;let us call it Company B&mdash;had £135,000 left in the kitty it would mean that at some stage it earned £200,000, paid tax on that amount and was left with £135,000. What happens is this.  They declare a dividend, not for the £135,000, but for £200,000.  They say: &ldquo;The gross dividend is £200,000 and we pay that, less tax.&rdquo;  They pay £135,000 into the purchasing company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>That means that if the purchasing <Col N="1001" /> company had a loss&mdash;it could have a trading loss or a loss on a capital transaction&mdash;they could say, as in Deputy Sweetman's instance, that they lost £125,000 on the capital transaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman brought the argument to a certain stage.  Deputy Sweetman said: &ldquo;We have a capital loss of £125,000 and we have an income of £200,000.  Therefore, we have a net income of £75,000, which can be taxed.&rdquo;  He should have gone on to say: &ldquo;However, we have paid tax on £200,000.  Therefore, refund us the difference.  We got £200,000 worth of dividends, less tax.  Therefore, as we have paid tax on £200,000 instead of £75,000 repay us the difference.&rdquo;  In other words, it is a means of paying £125,000 out of the bought company and getting back the tax it paid on it.</P>
      <P>You could also have the instance of a company which had a trading loss forward of £200,000.  It could buy a company like this, get the £200,000 gross dividend, less tax, and say: &ldquo;We have a loss forward of £200,000.  We have income from dividends of £200,000.  Therefore, our liability for the year should be nil.  But we have paid tax by deduction on the £200,000. Therefore, refund it to us.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It seems to me that that is how it works and that that is a definite way of avoiding the impact of the Income Tax Acts as we all intend them to work.  For that reason, I think the whole new part is necessary.  As far as I can read it, I think it very adequately covers the problem.  Therefore, I welcome the new part of the Bill.  I quarrel with the Minister on one point, namely, that he wants to be retrospective.</P>

If I make a loss as a grocer or a publican and purchase shares and sell those shares at a loss, so far as I know, I cannot set off against my trading loss the loss I have made on the purchase and sale of shares.  However, I agree with Deputy Haughey that the dividend stripping operation as I understand it or thought I understood it &mdash;and I still think I understand it&mdash;is a practice which we are right in bringing to an end.

      <P>No.  The Deputy is raising that.  They would escape surtax.  As far as I could see, in dealing with this proposition, the big advantage to the company which is prepared to sell is that they escape surtax.  Usually, there are three or four shareholders.  If they paid out the dividend, they would be liable for surtax.  Doing it this way, it is capital, and therefore no surtax is payable.</P>
      <P>The Deputy suggested liquidation.  In my example, I gave them nothing but surtax.  However, they could be reduced by another £10,000 in the deal also and still have a fair profit.</P>

      <P>(2) This part of this Act and the Third Schedule thereto, as well as applying prospectively with effect as from the passing of this Act, shall also apply retrospectively with effect as on and from the operative date (no interruption of application being regarded as having occurred at such passing) and, for that purpose, the said part and Schedule (apart from this sub-section) shall be construed, where appropriate, as if this Act had been passed on the operative date.</P>
      <P>(3) This part of this Act and the Third Schedule thereto shall, so far as they relate to income-tax (including surtax), be construed together with the Income-Tax Acts and shall, so far as they relate to corporation profits tax, be construed together with Part V of the Finance Act, 1920, and the enactments amending or extending that part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is an awful lot which I can add to what I said already on the Financial Resolution.  Anything I said then certainly appears to me to be still true.  On all sides of the House we are agreed that this method of tax avoidance must be stopped; that if it is not stopped it will make serious inroads on the revenue as a whole.  But what it amounts to is that the Minister is coming along and saying that people who ordered their affairs in accordance with the law, up to this, are now to be taxed <i>ex post facto.</i>  It makes no difference whether you say a person is not going to get a benefit he is entitled to receive, or whether you are saying you are taking it off him.  The principle is exactly the same in either <Col N="1007" /> respect.  So far as I know, there is no case at all in which a revenue tax has ever been dealt with retrospectively like this.  We have always been able, in this respect, to operate and to close the gaps as we go along.</P>
      <P>I must confess that at one stage I was rather annoyed with revenue because they did not close a certain gap retrospectively.  I was wrong at that time, even though it had cost me, and other solicitors like me&mdash;who did not take advantage of the particular avoidance of the law which existed&mdash;substantial sums.  I was quite wrong, all the same.  The loophole which had been used by some solicitors was changed in the Finance Act of 1950 but was not changed retrospectively, even though we had suffered losses, and it was correct not to change it retrospectively. Here the Minister may be saving himself some revenue.  On a previous occasion he mentioned a figure.  If the figure were ten or 20 times that, even if there was £2,000,000 involved, nothing would justify the abrogation of the principle that you shall not have retrospective tax legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is passed, in relation to dividend stripping, it will be used as a precedent by some Ministers for all sorts of things.  Looking back over the years, and looking back over ministerial briefs, you will see that precedents are quoted for purposes entirely different from the purpose for which the original precedent was passed. Once we have set out on this slippery slope, in relation to something about which the whole House is agreed, there is no use anybody, either this Minister or any other Minister, trying to think it would be restricted to that.  The next step will be that some other Minister for Finance will come in with a similar retrospective amendment about something that only part of the House thinks is reprehensible and that a gap should be closed.  You cannot abrogate a principle of this sort without making inevitable the result that the precedent quoted is one that will inure to the benefit of unworthy causes, even if we accept that this is a <Col N="1008" /> worthy cause.  I do not think I put too far, on the last occasion, the effects I thought this would have in relation to the business community, in relation to the inception of new industry, in relation to people anxious to start out on some new venture.  They will not know where they stand.  It will certainly mean that no solicitor and no accountant can ever in future advise his clients as to what the clients can safely do and order their tax affairs on a safe basis within the law as it stands. They will always have to say: &ldquo;After the Finance Act, 1958, there is always the danger that, although this is perfectly legal at present, the Minister for Finance might take objection to it next year and you may be forced to pay tax you did not expect to have to pay.&rdquo;  No business can function in this way; no country can function in this way; no Government can exist with that argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all aware that under this amendment it is not proposed to require anybody to pay very much tax.  We are all aware that all this amendment purports to do is to prevent persons claiming back tax, which the majority of Deputies do not think they are equitably entitled to do, and I constitute one of that majority. I experience all the temptation of saying that we ought, by effective legislation, protect the Treasury from what appears to us to be a raid carried out by unworthy persons as a result of an astute interpretation of the existing law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to urge on the House most strongly that that is a temptation which should be resisted.  The temptation would not be there if there was not pretty general agreement that the practice of dividend stripping is unworthy and one which it was never intended to permit under the law, but the temptation to do wrong, in order to constitute a danger, must be of its nature an attractive temptation.  There is no doubt whatever that the Minister can state the case that this is not retrospective taxation at all; but he cannot deny that it is retrospective legislation.  It provides that, after the passing of this Bill, something cannot be done in respect of the month of May, 1957, which it was perfectly lawful <Col N="1009" /> to do in 1957.  It is that principle which we are concerned to defend.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the House that it is a very grave error indeed to allow ourselves to be actuated by a desire to frustrate a transaction of this kind to the point of betraying what heretofore has been a sacrosanct principle of finance legislation in this country and, as far as I am aware, in every other country with a parliamentary system such as ours.  I think powerful confirmation of the view we hold can be had from the experience in the British House of Commons whence this legislation has been borrowed; because all these provisions have been taken out of the British Finance Act and are now being enacted by us.</P>
    <P>When these proposals were first brought before the British House of Commons, the Chancellor of the Exchequer there was in a position to say that these provisions were merely the implementation of a warning he had given the House of Commons two years ago.  He was able to go on record as saying that he had stated on the occasion of the Finance Bill, 1956, that, if this practice continued, he proposed to ask Parliament to take such legislative measures as might be necessary to frustrate any activity of this kind embarked upon after 1st April, 1956.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that, although that notice was given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the British House of Commons, no parallel notice was given here.  But even though the Chancellor of the Exchequer was in a position to refer back to that notice, he was warned that it did not constitute a valid justification for the principle of retrospective legislation; and between the Second Stage and the Third Stage of the Finance Bill, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, having taken counsel with his advisers, came back to the House and announced that, having carefully considered the arguments submitted in the course of the debate on the Second Stage of the Bill and having carefully evaluated the quality of the warning he had given publicly two years before, his mind had been coerced by the arguments pressed upon him and he proposed to drop the retrospective element <Col N="1010" /> for controlling the practice of dividend stripping.</P>
    <P>They were dealing with very large sums and there cannot be any doubt that this practice, which had grown to very formidable dimensions in Great Britain, resulted in claims being made in respect of the last 12 months of a very large sum&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>£2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we have got to bear in mind that that £2,000,000 is probably drawn from the Exchequer by a very small number of financial operators in the City of London, to whom nobody willingly saw the revenue of the community diverted.  I do not believe the sum here is substantial. I think the Minister set a ceiling on the possible claims that might be made upon him of £100,000.  I think it may be substantially less, but he apprehends that further claims may manifest themselves which have not yet been presented to the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not care what the size of the claim may be because I think we purchase at too great a price immunity from these claims, if one accepts the principle of retrospection.</P>
      <P>I have a feeling, born of 25 years' experience of this House, that if, in financial legislation, we accept the principle of retrospection, every Deputy sitting here will live to see that claimed as a valid precedent for the principle of retrospection in other branches of our legislation.  Bad as it is&mdash;and it is very bad&mdash;to introduce that principle into financial legislation for the reasons set out by Deputy Sweetman, it is infinitely worse that it should be introduced into other types of legislation, a development which I most seriously apprehend.</P>

      <P>When I moved to report progress on the last occasion, I was speaking about the necessity for supplying our fisherment with the best boats and gear to carry on their calling. Unfortunately at that time, I had not read the Minister's speech on the Estimate, but I have since done so.  It is the same type of speech as that which we have heard here down the years since the State was established. The only improvement we had during all that time was when Deputy Dillon became Minister in 1948.  Up to then, it was impossible for fishermen to get boats or gear, unless they paid a 50 per cent. deposit.</P>

      <P>I will come to that later.  It was reduced later When Deputy Dillon took over, it was 20 per cent.  That cannot be denied.  At one time previously, it was 50 per cent. deposit.  I am not too sure that it is not much the same to-day.</P>

In fact, he made a statement here&mdash;and it is only right that the House should be reminded of it&mdash;that if any good, efficient fisherman could not afford that 5 per cent., he would not be deprived of a boat or gear to enable him to carry on his occupation. I think that is correct.</P>

      <P>That is perfectly correct, and during my time, while Deputy Dillon was Minister, that was done.  He was the first to introduce the 50-foot boats.  Previously, there <Col N="1012" /> were small boats, 30-foot and 35-foot, which were all right for inshore fishermen. The whole trouble during the years was that there was a certain competition between the inshore fishermen and the trawlers.  I do not think we had any trawlers until Deputy Bartley was Parliamentary Secretary. He bought five German trawlers and they were to supply the whole country with fish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; I will say there were three.  That is three too many.  I wonder where they are now. They must have cost a lot of money in their purchase, their repair and their upkeep.  So far as I remember, we read of their being broken down along the west coast whenever they went out to fish.  I wonder if they were disposed of and what was lost in their purchase and sale, if they have been sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone would think, by the Minister's statement, that this was the first time ever we did anything in this country to promote the fishing industry. During the long years since 1923 or 1924, I suppose every Government has done something to try to advance it.  However, prior to the taking over of the Government of this country, the fishing industry was much more prosperous than it is now, after 35 years of native government.  I remember that, in my town and all the neighbouring towns and anywhere you went around the country, you could get fresh fish delivered to you, even at your door.  It may not have been done in a very hygienic way, but the fish was in plentiful supply.  At present I can see no fish, although I live near the coast. There must be something wrong in the catching of the fish, in the distribution or the marketing of the fish.  Living near the coast, near a fishing centre, we cannot get fresh fish even on Friday; <Col N="1013" /> so what must be the position of those in inland towns?  We have heard the Minister and others state that our people are noted for the lowest consumption of fish in Europe.  How is it that during all those years we have not educated our people to eat more fish? It is a healthy food, but it cannot be obtained, even on a Friday, either near the coast or far inland.  Whether An Bord Iascaigh Mhara or the Department is responsible, I could not say, but that is the position and it cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal about what is being done in Killybegs, Galway and Dunmore East.  I have not heard of anything at all being done in South Kerry, in Cahirciveen, Portmagee or Ballinskelligs, where the fishing was once very prosperous.  By the way, the Minister went down there, in state, some few weeks ago.  I could not tell for what purpose, but I may say it was never known before that a Minister entered a constituency to receive a deputation of fishermen or to see the conditions prevailing there and that the Deputies of the area were not invited to that conference.  If the Minister wants to carry out his duty, he must not be politically minded.  He must not go to any area anywhere within the State, without inviting all the representatives of the people to whatever conference he holds.  I was not invited to that conference, whoever was responsible.  On the previous occasion, when the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Flanagan, went to South Kerry, he invited all the representatives and we all went along together and gave our views.  If the Minister thinks he can make a political issue out of it, he is entirely mistaken and he will do no good for fishing in South Kerry or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In South Kerry, it is inshore fishing. I could not say what it is in other areas, but it has never become an issue to be decided whether we would have inshore fishing or whether boats should be supplied to fishermen to fish in the open sea in competition with foreign trawlers.  I suppose Deputy Bartley's idea when he was Parliamentary Secretary and when he got the German trawlers, three or five of them, was <Col N="1014" /> that they would go out and fish outside territorial waters.  I do not believe they have ever caught a fish, but it was very strange to see&mdash;in the <i>Cork Examiner</i>&mdash;I think&mdash;that Spanish fishing fleets were taking shelter in Bantry Bay from storms outside.  They must be fishing outside our territorial waters.  Will the time ever come when our fishing fleet will shelter in Spanish ports when fishing outside Spanish territorial waters, or even shelter in the ports of the country nearest ours&mdash; England&mdash;when fishing outside English territorial waters?</P>
    <P>I know that efforts have been made in the past, but we must have been working in the wrong direction.  The Minister has spoken about the export of fish, and we may have exported it, but people in our own country did not get any fish.  There is something wrong with the distribution and marketing of fish.  I suppose when our fishermen must purchase boats on the hire-purchase system, through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the board must market the fish for them so that they can hold back a certain percentage of the price to pay for the boats.  The problem is a most peculiar one and I cannot say how it can be solved because of the hire-purchase question. Fish caught in Cahirciveen must first be sent to Dublin and it is quite possible it will be sent back again to Cahirciveen or some other place.  Why could not some arrangement be made by which fish caught along the coast near a certain port would be marketed from that port within a certain area and the surplus, if any, put in cold storage or exported to a country that will accept such surplus?</P>
    <P>I have heard fishermen talk about this and surely they would know best. I believe we have experts in our Department connected with the fishing industry as good as in any other country.  I would not say that the Minister himself should have expert knowledge, nor would I expect him to have it and, in fact, it may be just as well if he has not, but I have often thought that it is strange that since the Irish Government was established, we have had no Minister or Parliamentary Secretary with a full knowledge of fish or the fishing industry.  I do <Col N="1015" /> not profess to know very much about it but I have often gone fishing both in the sea and inland and I am in constant touch with fishermen.</P>
    <P>Something should have been done down the years to make our people more fish-conscious because fish is a very useful and healthy food.  I do not suppose it would be possible for the Department to teach people how to cook fish.  We know that in hotels and cafés and such places, it is perfectly cooked, but the ordinary girl or woman in the country, if she knew how to cook fish in its different varieties, could make it more palatable.  The only hope is that with the progress of technical education and the teaching of cookery, the housewives of the future will be able to cook fish properly and make it more palatable than is possible by merely throwing it into a pot and boiling it.  That is what is very often done.</P>
    <P>At the present time, we must give our fishermen the biggest possible boats.  Even the 50-footers are now outdated and instead something about 70-foot or 80-foot long is needed.  The Department's technical advisers could decide that, but if we want the fishermen to follow the fish instead of adopting the old method of the inshore fishermen and waiting until the fish come in, if we want to make the industry successful and have sufficient fish for our people and for export, we must supply the fishermen with boats and gear to enable them to follow the fish out beyond our territorial waters.  It is a bit of a problem because the inshore fishermen think their case should be considered, first of all.</P>
    <P>So far as I know, the inshore fishermen are people who go out in small boats, in 30 or 35-foot boats, and they are often small farmers or have some other occupations.  The supply of fish from that source is entirely inadequate to supply this country's home requirements or to provide for fish exports. Therefore, the Department must decide what they will do and, no matter what the expense may be, we must have a fishing fleet like the other countries of Europe, like England, Iceland, Norway, Spain, France and so on.  We are a maritime country and fish abound in <Col N="1016" /> the ocean around our coasts.  I do realise that the question of finance may present a difficulty but, during the years, we have not done very much to build our own boats, even with the boatyards we have.  We have to bring many boats from abroad, from Scotland and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There were great hopes in North Kerry, in the Dingle area, when the Dingle boatyard was to be extended, that we would secure all the 50-foot and 70-foot boats that were necessary. Though the Minister has talked about all this, I do not know that any boats at all have been issued in that area. I am sure that not one 50- or 70-foot boat has been delivered to any fisherman in Kerry since the Minister came into office, though we have some of the best fishermen in the country there. One of them, in fact, was trained some months ago at the school in Galway and he was supposed to get a boat, but it has not reached him.  I may be wrong.</P>

There must be something wrong and we must not have the real political pull they may have in other areas.</P>
      <P>I have nothing at all to say against An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, except that they change their personnel too often. An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should not be constituted principally of Fianna Fáil personnel, or even Fine Gael personnel, either.  It should be representative of the fishing industry in every part of the country.</P>

Choose the best men for the purpose and do not change them about every time there is a change of Government.  The whole trouble with the fishing industry, with the agricultural industry and with all industries is that there is no continuity at all in the policy adopted in regard to them.  When there is a change of Government, each Minister tries to carry out the work in his own way and that is the whole trouble.  As was stated on the previous day, the fishing industry at one time was second to agriculture in importance, and that was the case until we got a native Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Minister and every Parliamentary Secretary who has since been responsible for fisheries has been messing about, with the result that nothing has been done.  Every Minister thinks that his views are the best.  We should have the experts of the Department of Fisheries, and experienced members who know all about fishing and the marketing of fish, on a proper board.  I do not say that such a proper board would prove successful or not, <Col N="1018" /> but I can say that while all the boards of the past did their best, I do not think they have been too successful in their efforts.</P>
    <P>I would advise the Minister that when the board is distributing 50 and 70-foot boats, they should be given to the best fishermen, to the most desirable and most experienced fishermen, to the fishermen who have received proper training, to the fishermen who have had 35-foot boats in the past and who paid their instalments in the shortest possible time.  They should forget whether they are Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or anything else.  If we want this country to advance in fishing or anything else, we must forget politics.</P>

      <P>Having regard to all the talk about fishing and the money expended on it, it is remarkable that we still have to import a lot of fish. We export some fish.  I have before me <i>The Kerryman</i>, to which the Minister referred on a previous occasion. I know he likes it very much.  <i>The Kerryman</i> shows importations of tinned salmon from Japan, Norway, Canada and so forth.  If we have salmon or any other kind of fish, it is remarkable that we cannot can that fish and eliminate imports.  There are various fish products that we could make use of.  There are agricultural products also of which we do not make proper use.  The Fisheries Branch should consider all these problems with a view, not only to helping the fishing industry, but of helping the national economy and thus save a lot of trouble about the balance of payments.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I should congratulate the Minister.  I do not want to be extravagant with bouquets or over-generous with praise but I do say that the Minister had a reasonably encouraging statement to make when he introduced the Estimate in the Dáil last week.  He was able to show substantial increases both in quantity and value of all qualities and grades of fish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who makes a fair appraisal of his efforts will agree that the Minister is making a good job of one of the most difficult Departments of State.  That is only fair comment on his efforts.  When I said that he had <Col N="1020" /> a reasonbly encouraging statement to make I had in mind that the leeway yet to be made up is considerable.  The greatest cause for optimism is the method by which the industry is being tackled at the present time.  That holds out very high hopes for an industry that has the greatest potential of wealth and employment for the western seaboard.  The efforts that have been made to direct industries to the western seaboard and undeveloped areas are important but there are a few industries which are native to that area and it is on those that we can base our hopes for the future.</P>
      <P>I was more than delighted on Thursday last to see a Bill going through the Dáil in almost record time which makes provision for research into the development of bogs. The fishing industry, like the peat industry, is an industry for which we have the raw material.  We do not need to import any material for that industry with, perhaps, the exception of equipment.</P>
      <P>I do not envy the Minister his task. I would not envy any Minister or Parliamentry Secretary who ever occupied the position.  I know perfectly well the difficulties with which he has to contend.  Any member of the House who might take on that appointment would find the same difficulties.  For that reason, I never liked to be unfair in my criticism of any occupant of the post, whether a Parliamentary Secretary or a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fishermen are never really satisfied with their lot.  Private enterprise believes that the State is interfering too much in what should be its affair.  The consumers believe that they are paying too high a price for fish. It is no easy task to resolve the differences of these three groups.  I am satisfied that the Minister has made a fair effort to tackle the problem in the proper manner.  I believe there is some reconciliation at the moment between private enterprise and the State-sponsored side of the industry.  I have discussed this matter hundreds of times with practical fishermen.  They blame An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for not handling the problem properly.  Yet, they all admit that our fisheries could never have been developed to the <Col N="1021" /> stage at which they have been developed by private enterprise. Private enterprise is sometimes unduly critical of the efforts of the board but I think the Minister is succeeding to some extent and I am sure he will have the co-operation of every member of this House in bringing about harmony between private enterprise and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara so that they may all pull in the same direction for the benefit of the industry.</P>
    <P>The primary concern of those who must necessarily be interested in the fishing industry is that as many people as possible should be employed in the industry, with reasonably good conditions of living and reasonably good working conditions.  I was surprised that Deputy Palmer should compare conditions in the fishing industry to-day with those which prevailed before the establishment of native government. I remember years of activity in Killybegs when I was not very old. The year 1938 was a year of great activity in fishing for herring in Donegal Bay from the port of Killybegs but I do not think there was a single Irish boat participating in that fishing.  Eventually there may have been one or two.  It was mainly Scotch drifters that took part in that fishing.  To-day we have a growing fishing fleet of which we have a right to be proud.  When we consider this industry from the point of view of the producer and the consumer, I wonder if the people in Dublin who complain of high prices for fish realise what a fisherman's lot is, or what type of life he leads in catching the fish that is marketed in what is, unfortunately, the only central marketing place we have, the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>In passing, I should say for the Minister's information, that I have had deputations from the Killybegs fishermen who were not quite clear or satisfied with regard to the Minister's opening statement in relation to the competence or otherwise of the fishermen in the industry.  The statement the Minister made was that he was not completely satisfied.  I should like the Minister to clarify that position in replying.  Some of our fishermen interpreted his statement as meaning that they were not putting their best foot <Col N="1022" /> forward, that they were not competent or making the best possible effort to produce the fish.</P>
    <P>I do not want to move too quickly from the general to the particular or to become too parochial but it is only fair to say in relation to the Killybegs fishermen&mdash;and I say it in all sincerity &mdash;that they are second to none.  Those men go to sea any time from 5 a.m. to 6 a.m. and their day's work concludes about 10.30 p.m.  It is not unusual for them to remain at sea overnight, a fact which may not be generally known. That is all very well but they may return with very little for their day's effort.  Fortunately in many cases they draw reasonably good catches and I think I can say that for some time past the market has been entirely dependent on supplies from Killybegs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was waiting for that.  There is only one reason why the port is well developed and that is because there is a good supply there of competent fishermen, and competent fishermen will make a port anywhere. Before you get boats or anything else you want competent skippers and crews; otherwise it is a waste of time and public money to provide facilities. The Killybegs and Donegal fishermen generally are hard workers and intelligent workers.  By their own efforts they built up the industry to its present strong position and fish landed at Killybegs, on the figures available for the past year, showed an increase in value from £116,000 to £143,000.  That is a creditable record.  These fishermen have an excellent record for paying up for their boats which they have secured on the hire-purchase system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is because they had the most suitable fishermen. I should like to refute what Deputy Palmer has said.  He may have made the statement in good faith.  We have a fleet of 30 boats worth from £10,000 to £16,000 each according to equipment and age.  They were never allocated on <Col N="1023" /> any political basis and if you go to Killybegs to-morrow you will not hear a single complaint in that direction. You may get plenty of other complaints but you will never get any person to say that because of his politics he was deprived of a boat or got one because he had certain political views.</P>
      <P>Those people who complain about the high cost of fish do not realise that before a crew can go to sea they must have a boat worth £16,000 complete with gear which enables them to work under reasonably good conditions.  It has adequate sleeping accommodation, echo sounder, wireless transmitter, and all the other facilities necessary to make for satisfactory conditions at sea. That boat is issued on payment of 10 per cent., a percentage that has been in operation since the time that Deputy Bartley was Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clear up the point with the Minister with regard to his opening statement which I am quite certain he never meant as any reflection on the fishermen who are operating there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall carefully indicate the position to the Deputy when I am replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be glad if the Minister will indicate what the position is.  To get back to the point I was making.  We are not trying to cast aspersions on any other harbour around the coast&mdash;I would like to see a good fishing fleet in every port from Donegal to Cork as well as on the east coast&mdash;but the main reason we have a reasonably good fleet in Killybegs is that there is an ample supply of fishermen available.  I am sorry the Minister did not see fit to accede to our request at the time to have a nautical school established in Donegal instead of Galway.  I believe that, if he had, we would have a better record than eight or ten students enrolled.  I guarantee we would have the maximum number at all times.  Be that as it may, we can continue to train fishermen in the boats which are there and I hope that applications for further boats will come in.</P>
      <P>As regards applications for boats, there is a rather peculiar situation. Our own boat building yards are not working to capacity.  Applications for boats are not coming in as frequently as they were.  That seems to me an indication that perhaps we have almost exhausted the number of highly competent fishermen here interested in fishing in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which is rather serious.  Boats built in our own areas are costing too much.  I wonder <Col N="1025" /> if the Minister would get An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to examine the position of the costings of these boats. There are fishermen seeking boats and if they can pay down cash they can buy fairly decent secondhand boats in Scotland for as low as £3,000 complete. The Minister is naturally opposed to financing the hire-purchase of those boats from State funds because we would be competing with the boat-building industry in our own country. None of us wants to see the boatyards closed down.  We want to see them do more and more work.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to examine costings.  Young fishermen dread taking on the huge responsibility of going to sea with £16,000 worth of boat and gear and only 10 per cent. paid down.  They are faced with the terrible task of paying that back by the deduction of instalments from the marketing of their fish through the board.  It takes a bit of courage and a bit of confidence in oneself. Fewer people these days seem to be prepared to take the risk.  I should like to see more of it.</P>
    <P>The question of increasing the number of people employed in the industry is tied up (1) with having enough boats to increase production and (2) with being able to market the amount of fish landed.  I said the Minister's opening statement was encouraging.  The most encouraging thing he said was that the market was there for more and more fish if we could land it.  It is not so many years ago that a small fleet of inshore craft could glut the market to the extent that the fish had to be used as dung.  There is hardly a port around the coast, certainly in Donegal, where adjoining fields have not been manured, at different times, with herrings when no markets were available.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems optimistic with regard to the future marketing of fish. If we can dispose of more fish, I can assure the Minister more and more people will go into the industry and provide those fish.  Donegal fishermen were alarmed at his threat to take in foreign trawlers or outsiders to catch fish.  They are confident they are equal to the task.</P>
    <P>The marketing of fish does not merely <Col N="1026" /> mean having somebody to buy fresh catches.  We have to market them in every conceivable way, canned, cured or kippered, making the maximum use of quick freeze in order to obviate those spasmodic gluts which, down through the years, have been a characteristic of Irish fishing.  When there is a scarcity, the price is high and when there is a plentiful supply the price is poor.  That can be eliminated only by processing plants and quick-freeze facilities at the different ports so that continuity of supplies may be passed evenly on to the market and so that a reasonably fair price level may be maintained throughout the year.</P>
    <P>I find that, at the moment, boats refuse to go to sea on Friday and Saturday because they feel no market would be available for their catches.  If we are to extend the time for fishing, those boats should be in a position to work every day.  Our salmon, which fetch such a high price on the market as fresh salmon, if canned, would be a prohibitive price and could not be marketed at the same price as cheap imported Japanese salmon.  I estimate that if home salmon were canned it would cost at least four times what we pay for that imported salmon.  Speaking subject to correction&mdash;the Minister may have information to the contrary &mdash;I doubt if any commercial enterprise would ever attempt to can home salmon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>What about canned fish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Various varieties have been processed economically at home and exported.  If you have a canning factory for salmon in Kerry and the Kerry fishermen bring in salmon at 10/- a lb. you will not buy them for canning when they can sell them at three times the price the cannery could afford to pay them as an economic price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every year on this Estimate the usual complaints are made with regard to marketing organisation.  I do not know if any definite progress has been made.  I think it is seven years since I first spoke on this Estimate and I referred, and every Deputy referred, to the problem whereby fish are brought from the western coast right <Col N="1027" /> into Dublin and people who want continuous supplies have to be in touch with Dublin in order to get them.  That, largely, is the position but it is somewhat better now.</P>
    <P>If anybody is interested in having a suitable shop in any provincial village or town for the disposal of fish by setting up the appropriate cold storage plant or keeping a simple fridge for the purpose, he can arrange to have constant supplies from some of our ports.  There are people who, by contract system or otherwise, go in for private distribution of fish from the ports&mdash;certainly from Killybegs. The Minister should ask the board to consider giving better terms to those people who are interested in the distribution of fish from the ports.  Men who are pretty well qualified in handling fish and who are prepared to market them under the best conditions will get no better terms, I think, at the port than any private person would get if he went to buy fish.</P>
    <P>A wholesale system should be operated for the benefit of those people who are prepared to go into distribution, and even a credit system which would enable them to pay at what was the wholesale price on the particular date, because sometimes when they pick up their supplies, it is not possible to ascertain what the price may be on the market the following morning. If we were to give those people who are prepared to go into distribution a fair wholesale system, we would have many more people distributing fish.  Ultimately, it would be bound to have the effect of opening more centres and developing the home market to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not want to appear to be too parochial on this Vote, but I should be failing in my duty as a representative of West Donegal, when the opportunity presents itself, if I did not advocate additional and better facilities for the port of Killybegs.  We make no bones of the fact that we regard Killybegs as the finest fishing port in Ireland.  I do not apologise to any other port for that and I think it is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Most of those who have already spoken on this Estimate, particularly Deputy Palmer, to whom I listened with interest, referred to the question of a larger boat.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>And fishing successfully, too.  As I said, there is everything but unanimity on the question of purchasing larger boats.  As the Minister pointed out, I think correctly, we are the only maritime country in the world which has not got mid-water boats.  I doubt if anybody can argue that we will ever make a success of our fishing industry without those boats, but when one Minister ventured to purchase three larger boats, he was condemned on every possible occasion. I think the experiment would be worth while.  How are we to know whether or not we can use larger boats, or what type of larger boats or to what extent we can use them, if we do not try to use them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have discussed this question with fishermen and some have pointed out that the Seine boat which is being used at present, is adequate, if we have sufficient numbers of that type of boat around the coast.  Their contention is that foreign trawlers are attempting to <Col N="1030" /> operate within our limits, and therefore, why do we want to go outside them?  That is not a foolproof argument because those boats follow the fish.  If our fishermen had the larger boat, they could go outside after the fish, if they wanted to.  Another point is that they will be able to go out to sea on days when the small boats are not able to go out.</P>
    <P>I advise the Minister to move with the greatest caution in that respect. He will be criticised in this House if he plunges into the larger boat and fails, but I think he should try it as an experiment.  I think we should try a 75-foot boat&mdash;I think anything under 65 feet is not considered capable of mid-water fishing&mdash;and see how it goes and then it would be time enough to move into a larger boat, but I would like to see them operated in a manner that would not hamper the efforts of the smaller fleet, which are doing such a good job.</P>
    <P>I believe you will get fishermen, not in every port, but in some ports, who will be prepared to go out and stay at sea, as they would have to do in the larger boats.  One can easily visualise that, if the fishing industry should expand to the point to which we would all like to see it expanded, there will definitely arise an inevitable need for those larger boats, because if we have an export market which we are not able to meet&mdash;if the home market develops to the proper extent&mdash;then I am afraid the inevitable is a further step forward.  While many of our fishermen do not agree with that, it is the inevitable outcome of a successfully pursued fishing industry, with the proper rate of expansion which one would reasonably expect, if the present impetus is maintained.  I think we are moving rapidly towards that stage.</P>
    <P>I want to say something briefly on inland fisheries.  We had a great hue and cry when the rod licences were increased.  It is never popular to increase anything.  I have discussed this question with some of the anglers. They admitted that, at present-day prices for salmon, one salmon would pay for the licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it the Minister said that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1031" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have known anglers who caught one salmon which would pay three years' licence fees.  At a time when everybody is crying out for the conservation and protection of our salmon fisheries, it is only natural to expect that the cost of the licence would be increased.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that every penny of the levy would be used for the protection of salmon.  Like other Deputies, I am a member of a board of conservators. I know how perplexed the members of that board are in regard to salmon preservation.  They are anxious to do everything possible in regard to protection and restocking, but it is a question of funds.  It is only reasonable to expect that the money should come out of the industry itself.</P>
      <P>I should like to mention something about the system whereby ministerial Orders are made closing salmon fisheries. The Minister will have no difficulty in anticipating what I am getting at.  The Erne Fisheries Order, which prohibits fishing in the Erne estuary and the upper reaches of the river, has not been very popular.  Everyone agrees there was evidence of the depreciation of salmon in the Erne, but not all of us agreed about the reason.  The Minister should reopen the Erne next year for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the decline in the landing of fish was only temporary.  I am satisfied it was not brought about by the action of the fishermen.  It was the result of the unusual operations during the erection of the hydro-electric scheme which undoubtedly upset the salmon and allowed them to be caught in large numbers in the lower reaches of the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also made allegations that the E.S.B. were responsible for the destruction of the fish by preventing them getting down through the falls. Experiments have been carried out recently in order to establish where the trouble lies.  I have no up-to-date information about the results of these experiments, but the Minister might have something to say about it when replying.  I should like him to give us any information he has.  The fishermen should not be unduly penalised for something not of their making. Letterly, there were not many boats <Col N="1032" /> employed on the Erne.  Those crews who fished the river season after season depended on it for part of their livelihood.  In fact, it was the main source of their livelihood.  They have been particularly disturbed.</P>
    <P>What they object to most, and I agree with them, is the manner in which an inquiry is held for the purpose of having an Order made.  It is a statutory matter that an inquiry take place before the Minister can make an Order prohibiting fishing. That inquiry was rather hastily summoned and the report was issued so rapidly that one can come to no other conclusion than that the holding of the inquiry was merely a perfunctory operation.  It would appear that the powers that be simply made up their minds that an Order would be made prohibiting the fishing, and that the holding of the inquirly was merely a perfunctory operation to comply with the statute.</P>
    <P>Such inquiries should not be held by any person from the Fishery Branch, although it should be allowed to have observers present.  It would be better if the inquiry were constituted of persons from the legal profession, persons with no vested or indirect interest in the particular fishery, but having available to them whatever expect knowledge they would require from the Minister's Department.  I have never yet seen a fishery inquiry in which what was sought was not obtained.  I do not think we have on record any inquiry which has resulted in the Department changing its mind in regard to what it set out to do.  I am not suggesting it was not done for the best possible motive.  It is silly for anybody to suggest that the Department would go up to Ballyshannon and deliberately deprive fishermen of their livelihood for no good reason.</P>
    <P>The decline in the salmon fishery became so alarming that some action had to be taken, but I would have preferred if the examination of the possible causes of decline and the restocking of the river had been undertaken years ago, or even if the number of boats had been limited.  That would have been much better than coming to a town already burdened with unemployment <Col N="1033" /> and depression after the busy period of the hydro-electric scheme operations and taking away its final source of employment.  This was done by the Minister's signature, following an inquiry in which evidence was taken in a few days.  Such inquiries usually take months before any decision is promulgated.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House, but I should like to close on the note on which I opened and that is to say that any reasonable appraisal of the Minister's efforts since he took over this important office could not be otherwise than that he is making a very good job of a very difficult office. I am very hopeful that we can look forward to expanding production and providing greater employment in the fishing industry with the consequent improvement in our exports which is bound to result from that effort.  I would ask the Minister to allay any misgivings in regard to his opening statement about the competency or otherwise of our fishermen.  I challenge anyone to say that we have in Donegal anything other than the best possible type of fishermen, a type of fisherman who has always done a good job, who has a tradition behind him and who will continue to do a good job if given half a chance by the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were impracticable economically, it would be disastrous to attempt it.  If Deputy Brennan has sound reason for putting forward that statement and we follow it to its logical conclusion, it would mean that we would gradually find our way into non-production in practically every item.  If we follow that with regard to wheat and imported all our requirements, we would have the two-pound loaf at 8¼d. instead of the 1/1 that the home grown wheat is costing us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy <Col N="1034" /> Brennan's statement regarding the export market for our surplus.  It is far better policy to have production and to have a surplus and then try to find a market for that surplus.  No country in the world has a ready market for its surpluses.  In England, in regard to heavy machinery, they had to penalise their own people and prevent them from buying by a heavy purchase tax in order to sell abroad in a highly competitive market.  I think it is better, even though we may reach the stage where we would have a surplus of fish, to have the surplus and then fight for a market.  It would also help our own people to market their surplus in a better and more attractive condition.</P>
    <P>We have a surplus of agricultural production; yet it would be disastrous to suggest that we cut down production in cattle, sheep and wheat, to sufficient to feed our own requirements.  It is much better to get the food in the country particularly free food such as we can get from the sea.  Fish is a free food except for the labour and the danger involved to the fishermen who are brave enough to go to sea to look for it.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister what he is doing with the old traditional fishing industry that existed in my constituency, particularly that centred around Clew Bay.  As a matter of fact it existed all along the west coast from Galway to Enniscrone.  To my mind, despite what Deputy Brennan said, we had the best type of traditional Irish fisherman along that coast.  That does not take from what he has said about the Donegal fishermen who, I am sure, are hard-working, competent fishermen. There exist in my constituency, especially round Clew Bay, as good traditional fishermen as there are anywhere in the country.  These are the best fishing grounds in the West of Ireland, particularly in the neighbourhood of Murrisk and on both sides of Clew bay down to Achill Island.  The Mayo fishermen knew these fishing grounds intimately but unfortunately, due to the carelessness of successive Governments, many of our best fishermen had to emigrate.</P>
    <P>The last thing these fishermen want is to emigrate.  In that way they are <Col N="1035" /> different from people on the land and people in towns throughout the country.  The last thing they want is to leave their homes and settle down in England or Scotland.  They are always anxious to get boats to pursue their normal activities.  I am informed on good authority that a well-equipped modern 50-foot boat costs £15,000.  It is ridiculous to ask a small farmer in a little mountain holding of £2 or £3 valuation who is also a fisherman, to contribute 10 per cent. of the cost of such a boat.  That would mean a contribution of £1,500 and you might as well ask him for £500,000.  He has not got it; if he had £1,500, it is very hard to say if he would put it into a boat particularly when he would own only one-tenth of that boat.  I would ask the Minister to give the deepest consideration to that part of the problem before the whole tradition of fishing dies in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan took exception to the statement made, I think, by Deputy Palmer, to the effect that fishing was more prosperous in this country before the take-over by a native Government.  As far as my part of the country is concerned I can verify that statement.  It is true of the West of Ireland, particularly of Mayo and Galway.  There was a thriving fishing industry in that part of the country in days gone by.  If the Minister wants to revive that industry, and to hold on to the nucleus of good fishermen left in the country, he should place boats at their disposal without any charge at all or, at least, at a very small charge which is within their competence to pay.  There is no use in asking them for a contribution of £1,500.  They have not got it; you might as well ask them for a slice of the moon.  The Minister will find, if he trusts them, that they are the most trustworthy people it is possible to have and that every single one of them will pay for the boats in time.</P>
    <P>On the question of trawlers, mention has been made of the three German trawlers which Deputy Bartley caused to be purchased when he was Parliamentary Secretary.  I think we want much larger boats.  We cannot be hugging the shore all the time.  There is <Col N="1036" /> a good field for inshore fishermen but we shall have to go further afield if we want to develop the industry properly. I am informed on good authority that the Spanish trawlers, mentioned as sheltering in Bantry Bay, are a free gift by the Spanish Government to the Spanish fishermen.  We shall have to do something on the same lines.</P>
    <P>Those engaged in the fishing industry have little or no finance to back them or support them.  If the Minister or the Government does not step in, it will be completely outside the power of those people to get the boats and gear necessary to compete with the foreigners.  If the Minister has any information on the subject, perhaps he would give it to us when he is replying. Is it true that Spanish and French trawlers are given wholly and entirely to the fishermen by their respective Governments?  If such is the case, it leaves our fishermen at a terrific disadvantage, apart from the poaching right into our very shores.</P>
    <P>Since this new scheme, which Deputy Dillon started when he was Minister, how many boats have been allotted to the Mayo and Galway fisherment?  I do not want the figures from the Minister right now, but when he is replying, he might have the details to give us.  Once again, let me impress on him the fact that it is useless to ask contributions from these people.  I can understand what the Minister is up against and can understand his feelings in the matter.  When he is giving such a valuable means of livelihood into the hands of fishermen, he would like to have some reasonable deposit put down. However, the contribution is too high for the cost of the boat.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not feel like making it a flat rule all round to give the boats without any contribution, would he try one or two boats in certain areas?  They will not be lost or damaged and, at the worst, they can be taken back if the fishermen prove unworthy of them.  I think I can give the Minister a guarantee they will not prove unworthy.  If they get the boats, they will operate them, particularly when they know that every catch they bring in is enlarging their claim on the boat until it will be completely their own.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1037" /> At present in Clew Bay we have an international fishing competition, and just as I am speaking here the town of Westport is buzzing with practically every foreign tongue and reports on all sides are of the suprise and amazement of those foreigners at the teaming fish in Clew Bay.  If that is the case, what must it be like just outside? There is a veritable source of wealth in those waters if we but go out and catch it.  The Minister is the only authority who can put it within the power of our fishermen to do that.  In addition, he would be making a very serious dent in the emigration problem by going ahead with fisheries.</P>
    <P>What is happening to the processing factory established in Galway?  I am told that, while it has been completed and opened a considerable length of time, no work has been done there.  It seems to be a magnificent factory.  If it is not in working order, why is it not? Perhaps the Minister can give some explanation.  Why has it been completed, if it is to become a white elephant? I sincerely hope it will not, but the Minister might tell us about it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish the Minister God-speed and the best of luck in his work.  Just like the other branch of the service under his control, afforestation, he has means in fisheries of stopping a certain amount of the flight from our country around the coastline and, at the same time, helping to gather in free food which is there for the taking.  When it pays the Spaniards to come 750 miles across a dangerous ocean to fish close inshore in our waters, surely it must be much more profitable to those at home who are beside those waters?  I do not understand why more effort was not made in the past.  When I was a member of the Government, I was always anxious to see fisheries developed.  It is one branch of our living which has been sadly neglected.  I remember that I was very glad to give every assistance to the boatyards in Killybegs and Donegal in their boat building operations, to do the little I could by asking Forestry to make timber available to them for the building of fishing boats, of which they make a very good job.</P>
    <P>Might I ask the Minister to consider <Col N="1038" /> changing the 10 per cent. contribution; or, if he does not make it a flat rule all round, would he try the experiment &mdash;he has tried a few experiments&mdash;of requiring no contribution, in a few experimental cases?  If it is all a loss, it will not sink the State or put the Minister for Finance out of business. It would be an experiment well worth trying and I think I can assure him that he will not be sorry if he gives the boats to these people without a contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The fishing industry is one of the most complex we have.  It is easy to say that we have the fish, the fishermen and to a great extent the markets; and to ask why we do not make greater progress. It is not as simple as that, in modern days.  In order to compete with other countries and in order to increase the supply to the home market, we need better boats, more modern boats and safer boats.  The young people of to-day will not become fishermen and operate under the conditions under which their fathers and grandfathers worked.</P>
      <P>Great attention should be paid to the building of the most suitable kind of boats.  Furthermore, the crews who man them must be given the most expert guidance and they must have a good period of apprenticeship, so that they may be able to operate the various safety devices, which should be installed on the medium and larger types of fishing boats which go out into the deeper waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past year, in various parts of the country but more especially in Donegal, we had unfortunate tragedies amongst the fishing fleet.  It is sad when it occurs, when we see mothers, sons and daughters, left without the breadwinners.  That is one of the hazards which these men put up with when they go out to fish daily.  I wonder if the Minister would consider some scheme of insurance which would cover those people in the event of such tragedies?  It is very praiseworthy and typical of the Irish character that, when these tragedies occur, the public in general, not alone in the particular locality but all over the country, come to the assistance of those who are left without the breadwinners.  I still think <Col N="1039" /> it is a source of worry to fishermen when they go to sea and do not know what will happen and possibly are not covered by insurance.</P>
    <P>Regarding the training of fishermen and skippers for these boats and training of men who will maintain the engines and other gear, I think an all-out effort should be made to conduct training courses in various centres throughout the country.  Vocational committees could be of great assistance in any training or apprenticeship scheme, if given assistance by the central Government.  A start was to be made in Killybegs this year in marine engineering and other classes connected with the fishing industry.  I do not know whether that is progressing or not.  There were some difficulties but I trust they will be overcome.</P>
    <P>The third essential in the fishing industry is the provision of suitable and central ports.  I do not agree with those who say we should have ports all over the place, but we should have safe ports along the coast.  In the main, Donegal is fairly well catered for.  We have Glen Bay, Burtonport and Downings, but when one comes to North Donegal, the fishermen have very many serious problems.  From Downings right around to Derry, the fishermen are not catered for as they should be.  For years, the provision of a first-class port at Glengad was under consideration.  Some years ago, Greencastle was improved.  There is a suitable port at Buncrana, but the type of fishing tradition which was there, based on herring-fishing and the operation of a Scottish fleet which landed catches there at one time, has gone.  An effort is now being made to re-establish a fishing industry in Buncrana. Applications have come in for boats, and, as this is the first effort to get the industry going again, I ask the Minister to consider the applications as favourably as possible.</P>
    <P>At Greencastle Harbour, following the expenditure of about £20,000 five years ago, the fishing fleet more than doubled.  At yesterday's meeting of our county council, we had before us a letter from the Minister in which he indicated that certain further repairs <Col N="1040" /> were required at Greencastle and that he was in favour of having those repairs carried out because he was convinced they would result in further development.  The feature of that letter which disappointed us was that the local authority would be required to contribute 50 per cent. of the estimated cost of £68,000.  If the local authority is asked to put up that £34,000 and further to guarantee maintenance of the work done in proper repair ever afterwards, I think the central authority is not taking a fair amount of responsibility, because a good deal of the expenditure envisaged concerns dredging, and if the council has to put up 50 per cent. and guarantee to maintain the work afterwards, it will mean that the council will have to carry out dredging itself later on.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that both the present Minister and the past Minister turned down proposals for the expenditure of a large sum at Glengad, I would urge the Minister to give more favourable consideration to the case of Greencastle.  At present, with a rate of 45/- in the £, Donegal County Council could not possibly think of paying 50 per cent. of a £68,000 job and we hope that sanction will be forthcoming for a much lower percentage.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who advocate that the fishing industry should not consist merely of fresh fishing.  We should pay as much, or possibly more, attention to canning, freezing and so on.  Export of salmon is a valuable part of our fishing industry because salmon command high prices and I agree with Deputy Brennan that canming of salmon would be totally uneconomic. I understand smoking of salmon enhances its value as well as making it available all the year round. I do not know if any commercial smoking of salmon is done in the country, but I think the Minister should consider that aspect.</P>
    <P>The efforts the Minister is making in regard to the further development of our inland fisheries are indeed very praiseworthy.  In England and Scotland, there seems to be a switch from other pastimes to fishing.  It has replaced golf and other forms of sport, with the result that holiday-makers, most of whom come from across the <Col N="1041" /> water, try to take part in fishing competitions, both sea and inland.  The money that is being spent on the development of our inland fisheries, on the restocking of our rivers and so on, will yield a large dividend through the tourist industry in years to come.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with those who advocate the reduction of the 10 per cent. deposit on the purchase price of boats, especially in regard to the larger boats.  If a fisherman wishes to buy a small boat of 40 or 45-foot, then the cost is lower and 10 per cent. of the purchase price is not any great hardship, but in the case of larger boats of 50 and 56-foot, 10 per cent. is a big bite and it may prevent some really good fishermen from acquiring them.  I have urged that the Minister should reconsider helping those who wish to purchase secondhand boats. There is the danger, mentioned by Deputy Brennan, that in so doing, the Minister may create a certain amount of unemployment in our boatyards, but I believe the position at the moment is that not enough boats are available, that the turnout is not equal to the demand.  In Scotland, and in some of the English ports, very good boats of from 40-foot upwards are available at a very low price.  They are first-class boats and I think we should utilise the availability of them as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Looking at the fishing industry, especially as it exists in Donegal from Malin Head to Killybegs, I want to say that conditions, prices and the whole industry have improved immensely during the past 20 years.  Fishing is becoming an easier life now, though it still has some of the hazards that will always be connected with it.  The conditions under which men work, the rates of wages they receive, and other features connected with the industry, have improved immensely, and naturally with the increased fleet we have, landings of fish also increased.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that during the first World War when we had no boats ourselves, when freezing and other methods of keeping fish were not available, the British trawlers used our ports for landing fish.  It was safer to land them here than in England, but when people look back, they see only <Col N="1042" /> that period in the days of long ago in the fishing industry, and they compare that small period with the present.  By and large, however, we have progressed very much and under the Minister, judging from the efforts he has put into the running of his Department since he took office, we feel sure that we will have the same, sound, steady progress in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the policy that has been carried out for years in connection with the Department of Fisheries, even by the Government that I supported, has been a kind of kettle of fish.  One could say that this kettle boiled up when we had the <i>Pinta</i>, the <i>Nina</i> and the <i>Santa</i><i>Maria</i>, the three German trawlers that were purchased.  We still find people coming into this House defending the expenditure of £120,000 on those boats.  That money went down the drain.  They were tied up for years and God knows what it cost to repair them.  If the money that was spent on them had been spread around the east coast, where fish can be caught and are caught, we would have been achieving something.  Instead of that, the policy seemed to be that it did not matter if £70,000 were spent on one of them and £90,000 on another.</P>
      <P>During the period 1948 to 1957, 80 boats were given out by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and of those 80, Dunmore East got two.  I was twitted by a Deputy on the opposite side that the boats that went into Dunmore East were not from Dunmore East.  It would be hard for them.  It might be said that the people in Dunmore East did not apply for boats.  They had a definite qualification for getting boats; they did not have to attend any schools of navigation.  Some of them joined the British Navy and, of course, committed a mortal sin by going into the British Navy as young men and boys.  When they left the navy, they went into the mercantile marine service, sailed the Seven Seas and came home as qualified master seamen. Some of them would have liked to set up as fishermen at home, but they would have no chance at all, if they applied for a boat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department the Minister is now <Col N="1043" /> in charge of would not spend twopence on Dunmore Pier, but that is something I do not think is the responsibility of the Minister.  He gave me his word it was a misprint, but this shows the policy of the Department of Fisheries.  Over a year ago, when the Fianna Fáil Government came into office, Deputy Dr. Ryan, in his Budget statement, at column 944, of Volume 161 of the Dáil Debates, stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I propose to make available for the benefit of the sea and inland fisheries an additional sum of approximately £50,000.  Of this sum, £45,000 will be used to erect an ice plant at Dunmore East and to provide additional fishing boats.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was reduced to £5,000 and I do not blame the Minister for that.  I blame the policy of the Department of Fisheries.  They would not spend twopence on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>They are getting a bigger ice-plant in Dunmore East now and I hope the Deputy will be satisfied with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There were more fish caught at Dunmore East last year than at any other port.  We did not get £78,000 spent on piers.  We did not get fleets of boats.  Our fishermen are serving on the P. &amp; O. Line and God knows where.  They have no chance of getting a boat.  The Minister should make a statement that men who are still young and have service at sea, who come from fishing families in fishing villages and have master's tickets, are invited to apply for boats.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to-night to the 10 per cent. deposit.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and all previous Ministers for Industry and Commerce have endeavoured by grants and every means in their power to have industries established and have backed such industries to the last penny.  I do not ask the Minister to present boats to people but he should be prepared to give boats to suitable people on better terms than they have been offered heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated in the House that <Col N="1044" /> applications for boats have been falling steadily.  We have not exhausted the supply of fishermen, but the patience of many people has been exhausted. They could not wait for years and years.  I have no doubt that the Minister means what he says, that he will see to it that the boats are given to the best type of applicants, irrespective of political affiliation. There was a day when the man from the cumann had the best chance.  That policy is coming home to roost now. Many people came to the conclusion that it is no good their applying for a boat.  They got tired of it.  They saw what happened other people and they crossed to the other side and signed themselves up in the foreign ships that Deputies opposite frequently refer to. They tried to earn a living for their wives and families on the sea that called them.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that the schools for fishermen and for navigation should be centred in Galway.  Perhaps they should be in Galway.  Galway has a great tradition.  There is a bigger population on the east coast.  I am not asking the Minister to place the school in Dunmore East or anywhere in particular but he should consider having a school of fishing on the east or south coast.  That school should be a travelling school.  When finished in Galway, they should pack up and operate in other centres.</P>
    <P>On the question of seeking a 12-mile limit, my opinion is that we should not bother so much about it.  We are not able to fish the waters we have.  When we are able to fish what we have, we should go to some trouble to have the limit extended.</P>
    <P>I have here a publication in Irish, <i>Fairrgí an Domhan.</i>  The writer is Seán Ó Ciosáin.  According to that publication, the Japanese are able to catch 4,000,000 tons of fish in a year. It gives the figures for Norway, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal and Ireland, for which the figure is the lowest in the world, 18,000 tons.  I am sure the Minister knows that.  Even if we expanded the output by ten we would still be last.  There is plenty of room for expansion.</P>
    <P>I shall not look for political <Col N="1045" /> advantage in this or any other debate. It was during the term of office of Deputy Oliver Flanagan that the factory was built in Galway.  It appears that that was a mistake.  I shall not go into that now.  It was good to build it It is a pity that they did not build it somewhere else.  The Department should see to it that fishing is carried out from Galway even with bigger boats or that the <i>Nina, Pinta</i> and <i>Santa Maria</i> are sent to Galway in order to bring fish into that factory.  I was in Galway recently.  There is a fine crop of weeds growing around the factory.  The Minister should ask the people responsible for it to have the weeds removed.  The factory is a beautiful piece of work architecturally and it is a shame that it should look as if it were already scrapped.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have referred to the home market for fish and mentioned in a nostalgic way the little boats that used to fish.  I remember those little boats.  There were fish joulters in Ireland at that time.  They used to travel with donkeys and carts and ponies and carts, carrying the fish to inland centres.  It is a pity there is not somebody carrying fish inland now.  In times of glut it would be a good thing if fish could be brought into centres, filleted, deep-frozen and brought inland where there is a demand for fish.  The amount of fish being landed is infinitesimal.  The home market does not take a great deal but the home market should be developed. The fact that fish is not sent to inland centres compels people living there to buy tinned salmon and other imported fish, often at the cost of dollars.  The Minister has experimented in other ways and I respectfully suggest to him that he experiment with some refrigerated vans from some centre and see could a round be built up in certain towns.</P>
    <P>Coming to the inland fisheries, I compliment the Department on the good job they have done in that direction, in the setting up of the factory in Roscrea and the way it has been handled since.  The inland fisheries are a great source of revenue to us.  I am saying that on this Vote and I shall not come into the House on some other Vote screaming about foreigners as other <Col N="1046" /> Deputies have done.  On some Votes, such as External Affairs, Deputies speak of foreigners as if they had the mange or some other disease, saying they should not be allowed to come here, and when you come to the Fisheries Vote they say these people should be brought in to fish and to spend money.  I do not speak with two voices.  I believe they should be brought in and should be encouraged to come here and I know the Minister welcomes them here.</P>
    <P>A good job was done in stocking streams and lakes.  I met people in hotels who were delighted with the fishing here.  We all know how it is with fishermen.  A man who came into a bar recently in Galway was asked how he had done.  He said he had caught 12 trout and said he would buy everybody a drink.  I am sure when he got back to England, he would tell everybody about the 36 trout he caught.  Our inland fisheries have been well looked after by the Department and the Tourist Board.</P>
    <P>Since I came into this House and before that, it has been the habit of Deputies from various constituencies to come in here asking for boats.  If they get the boats, they want piers. The only other thing they want is somebody to go down and catch the fish for them.  I suggest to the Minister that he should not be influenced by any more of that claptrap.  There are enough piers to accommodate for some time all the fishing boats we have.  We should concentrate on the piers we have and, if repairs are necessary, they should be done, especially those used by fishermen.</P>
    <P>As far as the boats are concerned, even though they are costing much more, I would prefer if the boats were built at home.  Several Deputies, to my horror, said it would be better to buy cheap secondhand boats away.  The fewer secondhand boats we bring in, the better.  We have had the experience of the three trawlers that were bought abroad and it should be a lesson to us. I think the Minister's policy is to have new boats built at home, even at a greater cost, and he should be encouraged in that.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister for his <Col N="1047" /> courtesy in inviting me to Dunmore when he came there.  I have heard complaints being made by other Deputies on the visits of Ministers.  The Dáil is the Parliament of the Irish people and when a Minister of State comes to a constituency, he should, as a matter of etiquette, recognise the representatives of the people and see to it that local bodies, no matter from what Party they come, are made aware of his visit to that place and be invited to meet whatever people are at the meeting.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is very keen on making a success of his Department. I wish him the best of luck and I can assure him that he has the good wishes of everybody in this House.  If there is anything I can do as a Deputy&mdash;perhaps it would be very little&mdash;to help the Minister and his Department, I am at their service.  I would again say to him: do not be afraid to give out the boats to people who have master tickets and who have a background of fishing.  Do not let the 10 per cent. deposit stop the Minister from giving out the boats.  Let him follow the line taken by the Department of Industry and Commerce; they are prepared to spend a great deal of money to establish an industry.  Every boat that is put on the sea is a small industry in itself, a small unit that will give a livelihood to Irishmen and bring wealth to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking as a Labour Deputy, I said last year that we were prepared to give the Minister an opportunity to show whether the Fisheries Section of the Department of Lands would succeed under his administration.  We are not yet in a position to judge that adequately and, therefore, we do not wish to be overcritical in relation to the activities of the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What strikes me forcibly is that the returns, as shown by the Department and as announced by the Minister on various occasions, do not differ in the least from the announcements in each year in the past in relation to fisheries.  Each year, we hear of extra landings and more money.  That sounds good and is very important for the <Col N="1048" /> fisherfolk concerned.  However, coming as I do from a seaboard area, I believe, in spite of the fact that we must have the interests of fishermen at heart, first and foremost must come the welfare of the whole community and the right of the people of this community to share in what should be the wealth from the landings of fish at various places around our coasts. I am sorry to say that, notwithstanding the many statements and the returns showing increased landings, the people, even in the coastal areas, are still in the same unsatisfactory position that seldom if ever do they see a fish on the table even on a Friday.</P>
    <P>When the Minister speaks about the importance of fish exports&mdash;any form of export means an advantage to this country&mdash;we should first put our house in order.  We should give the people in the inland areas the same benefits as are being given to a few areas as we know them at present.  Why must it continue that people adjacent to Cork City, and people in towns very little removed from some ports, cannot get fish?  There is a variety available to people in Dublin.  There is a variety in Dublin hotels and perhaps, to a certain extent, in Cork City for the tourist.  The Minister is right in stressing the importance of catering for these people and the fisheries can play a big part.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that, to any extent, we are being fair to our own people or to the fishing industry when we are continuing that policy.  If I am to condemn in any degree the policy of the Minister, it is only because it is the policy of each Minister for Fisheries in this country every year.  I would wish that to be changed. We should make some attempt to provide at least a little of such an important food as fish for the people in the inland areas.</P>
    <P>Before we concentrate on or even before we speak about the importance of fish exports, we should put into practice a system whereby we can provide for the home market a little more in the way of supplies of this important commodity.  If we are to attempt to provide the home market with anything like a fair amount of <Col N="1049" /> fish it means we can release, to a certain degree, more food for export in the way of cattle, in which another Minister is interested.  Such exports are, all the time, paying us good dividends. The more we export the more we gain.</P>
    <P>The more fish we can provide for the home market the freer we are to concentrate on the export of other food products.  Therefore, in the very brief statement I intend to make this evening, I want to point out how vitally important it is that the system in relation to the distribution of fish should be overhauled in order to provide some measure of benefit to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>As well as the housewives, be they living in Cork City, or in any inland town, local authority hospitals in part of Munster cannot, unfortunately, at times, get anything like an adequate supply of fish for patients.  Surely that is not satisfactory.  It is important for us to realise the necessity of providing an adequate supply of fish for these institutions before we start speaking about exports in that connection. Perhaps the Minister is justified in talking about all that is being done to improve the situation in regard to increased landings and in regard to marketing.</P>
    <P>Though it may have improved a little, marketing is not satisfactory. Therefore I suggest that, while the policy of the Minister and of the present Government, as of previous Governments, seems to concentrate on the importance of the individual fisherman I believe that will never give us the satisfactory situation which each of us must surely hope for, namely, to increase fish supplies in our inland areas.</P>
    <P>It is essential to have a form of co-ordination in relation to the present system and the setting-up by the Minister or the Government not just of a fisheries board&mdash;whether we call it a fisheries board or An Bord Iascaigh Mhara makes no difference&mdash;because ultimately we shall have to tackle the problem by forming a State service such as, to a limited degree at least, Bord na Móna or the E.S.B.  The State must accept greater responsibility.  In <Col N="1050" /> that way, we could have a State fleet with our present fishing fleets.</P>
    <P>We speak of the number of boats we have and of the number of people employed in the fishing industry.  A large number of those engaged in fishing are people who treat it as a little hobby.  Unfortunately, I know it to my cost and I know it from the experience of the people in the areas I come from. Many people who are gainfully employed in other occupations for periods of the year go fishing for a while.  They realise that certain profits can be given to them at periods when they are slack in other occupations.  They are listed as part-time fishermen.  The tragedy is that they are not helping to any degree to improve the situation.  Notwithstanding that, each year, irrespective of who may be the Minister, while we are told the number of men engaged in fishing and the number of boats being given, we are not ultimately prepared to admit that in many instances the position is such that these people not alone are only part-time but are just engaged in fishing for a very limited period of the year.</P>
    <P>Let us go further and admit that, as well as the trouble of lack of supplies in the inland areas, human nature being what it is, in many instances even the people landing the catches are anxious to keep down supplies because the law of supply and demand must at all times govern prices.  We know, therefore, that prices are governed by the landings in most instances and that people, in relation to the landing of fish, are as interested in keeping the prices up as are the merchants who are anxious to get their own cut.</P>
    <P>I consider it essential that, at this stage, the State must take a greater share of responsibility in relation (1) to the landing of fish and (2) to the marketing of this important food commodity. It may be said by the Minister that the introduction of a co-ordinating effort by such a State fleet may interfere with the livelihood of fishermen in different areas.  It may be said by vested interests and by members of this House that such a policy would be wrong, that it would interfere with what had been known to be almost sacred in the lives of the fishery folk <Col N="1051" /> in the coastal areas.  I do not believe that.  I believe it as little as I believe those who are trying to tell us that the welfare of the fishing industry must be based on the part-time fisherman.</P>
    <P>I am trying to approach the subject in a constructive manner not believing for one moment that the Minister is not trying to do his best.  Whatever that may be and however hard a person may work to achieve the aims towards which he strives, unless we are prepared to approach this problem from a new angle, unless we are prepared to be critical in our views when we realise that so much has been said and, I suppose, will continue to be said by merchants who are not satisfied with the system because it does not, as they believe, operate fairly, but very often because it does not suit them, we must not forget that another section would much prefer to keep the supplies low, in relation to landings.</P>
    <P>There are further sections who wish to see Dublin well stocked with fish at all times, a position which would be deterimental to people in the country.  I do not say for one moment that the people of Dublin, and the hoteliers, are not entitled to supplies but because that policy exists at a time when landings are not showing any benefits in the inland and southern areas, I ask the Minister to consider the other aspects&mdash;some form of co-ordination between a State company and our present system.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister to do his best for areas such as Kinsale. The Minister was there recently and he knows the problem which exists in relation to the harbour at Kinsale. There is also the question of the harbour at Ballycotton.  Deputy Lynch referred to the importance of Ministers of State visiting these areas and doing their best for the people concerned.  I agree with that.  The Minister went down to Kinsale recently, and while I have no personal animosity against him on this score, the fact is that the three Deputies for South Cork have been at all times very interested in the fishing industry as a whole but in particular in such old ports as Kinsale.  I am sorry that at the time of his visit only one Party was represented and <Col N="1052" /> two other Parties were ignored.  I hope that if the occasion arises again, when a Minister visits Kinsale, Opposition Deputies will also be asked to show their interest in such an important industry as fishing.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his opening statement stressed several very definite points of view which he holds.  One is that we should increase our deep water fishing fleet as rapidly as possible as we have at our doorstep a ready market for fish.  He also said that if necessary he would invite foreigners to fish in this country if we cannot get our own people to do it. Further, as far as I can see reading into his speech, he does not wish to advise the Government to interfere with our present international fishing limits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>One could only construe from the Minister's remarks that the conference, in which so many people are concerned with fishing and which is so vital to this country, was at a deadlock and that no changes are envisaged for the future.  If the Minister likes, I shall read the extract from his speech&mdash;which I construed as having that meaning.  I hope I am wrong and that it is the intention of this Government to take some action in that matter.</P>
      <P>It is very vital&mdash;I think there is general agreement on it from all sides of the House&mdash;to expand our fishing industry.  It is one of the avenues of expansion which lies open to us.  We have an abundance of fish everywhere. That is evidenced by the fact that trawlers from practically every country in Europe may be seen off our shores. There is considerable ambiguity as to where the fishing limit ends.  I know that the captains of the corvettes which protect our fishing rights, do not actually know what the line is.  As far as I can gather from my researches, I do not think the Department know either.  It would be very welcome to the fishing industry as a whole if some definite decision could be reached on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was announced to-day that the Icelandic Government had taken a <Col N="1053" /> very vital and courageous decision. They were forced to take that decision by virtue of the fact that 99 per cent. of their exports depend on fishing.  In our country it is a comparatively small item, due to a variety of circumstances. We have not got a big economy in the fishing industry, but the Icelandic Government took the action which they have taken because they were forced to take it by predatory trawlers from such countries as Britain and Belgium, fishing within their waters.  They are big nations with plenty of money behind them and with adequate equipment and they are taking the fish in Icelandic waters. Exactly the same thing is happening off the coast of Ireland, practically without any redress of any sort over a good many years.  Although the position was critical before, it is far more critical to-day than ever because other countries have out-fished their waters and their stocks have fallen so low that practically nothing is left.  The two main fishing centres now are Ireland and Iceland.</P>
    <P>I suggest that Iceland has given Ireland a good lead.  The answer may well be that if we increase our territorial waters we will not be allowed to land our fish in Britain.  We have special facilities there now for landing our fish which may be denied to us.  I know that when the Icelandic Government decided originally, before they made a definite order, to increase their territorial waters, there was an outcry in Britain and that fishermen from Iceland were not allowed to sell their fish in the fish markets of Britain as they had done previously.  I am personally aware of that because it came before the Council of Europe and was referred to the agricultural committee, of which I am a member.  At the same time, Iceland was able to carry on by extending its limits, as it was entitled to, and I see no reason why Ireland should not do the same. But I see no indication in the Minister's speech that he is going to do that.  I am more hopeful now, because when I was on my feet for a few moments only the Minister said that that need not be construed from his speech.</P>
    <P>Perhaps when the Minister is replying <Col N="1054" /> he will tell us whether it is his intention, as Minister, to advise the Government to extend the territorial waters.  If he does not extend the territorial waters the whole basis of his speech, in my opinion, falls to the ground because what he has told us, and in the main I do not disagree with what he says, is that the object is to build our fishing fleet as rapidly as possible.  Deputies are no doubt aware that Rome was not built in a day and that we cannot create a fleet overnight.  Anybody who is conversant with our fishing conditions knows that that is quite impossible.  Until, in the first instance, the Minister is prepared to take courageous action and extend our territorial waters, protect our ports and our waters and say, in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Defence, that those fishing waters are properly protected&mdash;until that is done to provide the basis for our fishing industry, then it will be impossible for us to expand very much.</P>
    <P>The Minister very hopefully said&mdash;I think it was Shakespeare who said &ldquo;Hope springs eternal in the human breast&rdquo;&mdash;that there is an unlimited market for fish.  I think he is right in saying there is a better market for fish than there was previously.  Most of the fishing grounds in Europe have been fished out already and there is a considerable shortage of fish.  There is a tendency to extend as the result of the Icelandic decision.  The fish these countries were able to procure previously are not available to them now, unless they are prepared to fish outside the 12-mile limit.  From Iceland's point of view, they would be welcome to that, for all the fish they could get.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with what the Minister says about middle-water trawlers, a larger type of fishing boat.  We have got to be realistic.  Again, the thought of the landlubber comes to mind.  The cart is rather being put in front of the horse.  If you are to increase the size of fishing boats, you must have harbours for them.  If you are to increase your fishing fleets and encourage people to go in for fishing, you have to remember that they are human beings like everybody else.  They <Col N="1055" /> do not want to live on the high seas all the time.  They do not want to have to dock in distant ports.  They want to be able to dock in the vicinity of where they fish.</P>
    <P>I maintain there has been considerable neglect of, shall we say, the southeastern area in regard to the development of fishing boats and harbours.  It is a known fact that there is no properly protected deepwater fishing harbour for the fishing members of my own constituency, Wexford&mdash;which is a considerable maritime constituency&mdash; between the Waterford harbours and Dublin.  The Minister may say that the south-eastern fishermen can go into Dunmore East.  That is all very fine. If they go in there and if they live in Wexford, it is 30 miles by road for them to get home at night.  They have to go all around by Waterford to get home.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable Wexford fishing fleet which, I regret to say, has been dwindling.  It varies; sometimes it improves and sometimes goes down again.  In my opinion, that is largely due to the lack of harbour facilities. During my time, we have been visited by Parliamentary Secretaries and Ministers.  Kilmore Quay is a particularly active place in the fishing world. They are very go-ahead people, and they formed a co-operative society of their own.  They would be pleased to have a small job done to their harbour, costing a limited amount of money.  It rather annoys me when I hear Deputy Brennan from Donegal getting up here &mdash;I am very fond of the Donegal people myself; I think they are magnificent seamen and fishermen&mdash;talking about more facilities.  What do they want?  They have got the finest fishing harbour in Ireland.  Nobody can gainsay that.  They have got every facility, complete shelter, freedom from any anxiety when they dock their boats. We have not got that at all, nor do we ever get anything from any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary except empty promises.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is this: The Minister is in this happy capacity &mdash;I said so on the Estimate last year&mdash; that he is a full member of the Government. <Col N="1056" /> Therefore, his voice, since he deals directly with the matter, carries far more weight than that of a Parliamentary Secretary.  He also has had the advantage of having a man in the Government&mdash;the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for giving the money&mdash;who must be fully conversant with the problems.  In fact, I have often heard him state at elections and other times that he is interested in the fishermen of the south-east.  Surely, if the Minister is in this happy position, being a member of the same Government, he ought to be able to get the small sum of money necessary to put Kilmore Quay into a safe, navigable condition?</P>
    <P>The Minister knows these facts.  He has been down there himself.  I might add <i>en passant</i> that what Deputy Palmer said was perfectly true.  There was no invitation to anybody outside the Minister's Party to be present to meet him when he came.  That is beside the point.  If the Minister wishes to be surrounded by his own political advisers, that is another matter.  We all think alike in Wexford about that harbour.  Only a small sum of money is required to build a breakwater. If we are to encourage fishermen to go in for bigger boats, we must give them the necessary facilities.  The cart is being put before the horse.</P>
    <P>I am in full agreement with most of what the Minister said in regard to deep sea trawlers, but I do not agree with his remarks about bringing in foreign fishermen.  I may be misconstruing him.  What I read in the Official Record was something slightly different from what seems to have appeared in the papers, which indicated that if he could not get Irishmen to fish in these boats, he would invite foreigners to do it.  I do not know exactly how far the Minister intends to go, but our whole trouble here has been to try to keep foreigners out.  If the Minister is to invite foreigners in to fish here, it seems to me that is the thin end of the wedge. He must have some cut and dried scheme to do it.  There must be an adequate safeguard that they will not cut across the Irish fishermen in any way.</P>
    <P>I take it that if the Minister is going <Col N="1057" /> to invite them as entire crews in a boat, they will be strictly licensed.  If the Minister offers these facilities I envisage to foreign trawlers and fishermen, it should be ensured that they will live in this country and settle down here.  If they are going to take fish out of Irish waters and absorb the industrial raw material of Ireland, they should spend the money they get from it in Ireland&mdash;if necessary, buy or rent a house here, buy their clothes here and contribute to the economy of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is ambitious in his flights of fancy.  I do not think any the worse of him for that.  It is good to have a Minister buoyant with hope.  He appears to share the same optimism about the wellbeing of the country as a whole.  Unfortunately, we cannot see it.  He appears to have painted a picture here whereby we will drive ahead and have these middle water boats; we are going to build a fleet; there will be an abundance of fish brought into the harbours and for every one man in a boat, there will be 14 on the shore.  We will have huge exports of fish to meet our balance of payments and so forth.  Is a lot of that not wishful thinking?  This will take a considerable time.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the Estimate.  If all these happy things take place&mdash;and no one will be more pleased to see them than I, because I think the fishermen have had a raw deal&mdash;one might expect to find in the Estimate some considerable sum of money made available for this all-important industry.</P>
    <P>Yet, we look at the Estimates and what do we see?  We see that there is only a matter of an additional £16,000 in this Estimate this year.  Will £16,000 produce a fleet of middle-water trawlers, sufficient to expand our fisheries in the manner outlined by the Minister?  I cannot see it.  The major portion of that sum, £12,500, is for an exploratory fishing vessel.  That leaves us only £5,000 to do all the wonderful things the Minister envisages.  I do not think he will be able to do anything, unless he can persuade his colleagues in the Government that fishing is no longer the Cinderella of our industries, and he ought to be in <Col N="1058" /> a position to do that.  I think he has the will to try to improve our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>In regard to inviting capital into fishing, one of the things of paramount importance is an extension of our territorial waters and, apart from that, we need proper protection for our fisheries. The supply of ships to protect our fisheries is, naturally, a matter for another Department, but the Minister in charge of that Department would greatly appreciate and act on the advice of the Minister in charge of fisheries.  If the Minister conferred with his colleague who is in charge of our Naval Service and advised him on the type of vessel needed for the purpose, he would probably be able to persuade his colleague to take another look at the situation.</P>
    <P>This time last year, actually 15 months ago, in the early part of 1957, very heavy catches of herrings were being made around the Waterford and Wexford coasts.  I was approached by the local fishermen to get protection down there as soon as it possibly could be provided.  I phoned the then Minister for Defence and the protection ship was down the next day.  The unfortunate thing about it was that the coming of the protection vessel was known.  She could be seen coming a good distance away and the foreign fishermen had plenty of time to get away.  The protection vessel passed on and the foreign trawlers came back again and operated freely there.  That was all right because at the time there was fish enough for all, but it was extremely irritating for our fishermen to see that state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the protecion of our fisheries, as far as it affects his own Department, merits very serious consideration.  This suggestion may not be strictly in order, but perhaps I will have the indulgence of the Chair in asking the Minister if it would be possible for him to arrange to have one trawler in every fleet with protective powers.  I think the plan has been tried in other countries.  One of the trawlers in each fleet has been given protective powers and acts as a protective vessel.  It acts as a Q-ship. The unauthorised trawlers are surprised <Col N="1059" /> to find that one of the fleet of what seemed to be ordinary fishing vessels can arrest them, bring them into port, have them heavily fined and their gear confiscated.</P>
    <P>The fishing grounds of this country are more open than those of other countries and are likely to become more so.  The heavy subsidisation of British fishing which took place heretofore for the purpose of securing personnel for the British navy does not obtain nearly as much now, in view of the fact that naval forces do not now play as big a part as they did some years back.  In Britain, they have not now the same subsidising facilities they once had, and therefore they have more interest in coming into our waters and preying on our fishing grounds.  The British are the greatest offenders and the outcry from them will be greater if we extend our territorial waters.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies mentioned that new boats were very dear and that the cost of production was going up.  The two Fianna Fáil Deputies from Donegal mentioned that you can buy good second-hand boats in Scotland for about £3,000 each.  Would the Minister not consider, if he has the funds available from this limited Vote here, buying some of those boats at that price and, if necessary, refitting them in Irish boatyards?  There is a precedent for that.  When our famous German trawlers arrived here, it was found that they had to be refitted before they could be put into service.  We can buy a few Scottish trawlers and do the same.</P>
    <P>If we did that and they were refitted here, would the Minister consider leasing those boats to people who would be interested?  That would be one way of building up a deep-water fleet.  If we are to continue under the present system of building new boats and giving them to prospective purchasers at a 10 per cent. deposit, it will be a long time before we make any progress. Deputy Blowick made quite clear the difficulties of small farmers, who constitute the bulk of our fishermen, in making such deposits.  It will be a long time before we build up a fleet of the <Col N="1060" /> size the Minister has in mind, if we continue on those lines.</P>
    <P>I think it would be possible to secure quite a number of secondhand boats and refit them.  A market for them would exist in all part of Britain, in view of the heavy subsidisation being withdrawn.  Many of our own people who have capital invested in our fisheries, as well as those of our fishermen who would like to own boats of their own, would be interested in them, particularly if they could be acquired by easy payments.  A leasing fee could be charged for them and the responsibility would be on the lessee to keep the boat in good condition.  In that way, it would be possible to build a fleet fairly rapidly.</P>
    <P>Whatever we do with our fishing industry we know there is a market.  The Minister says that £33,000,000 worth of fish is imported into Britain.  Even though there is a ready market for exports, no industry can be soundly based unless it has home consumption.  No one could consider our distribution of fish satisfactory.  It is a difficult problem.  It is largely concerned with ice and the preservation of fish and the question of making the Irish people fish-minded.</P>
    <P>There seem to be several reasons why they do not become fish-minded. The primary one is that they cannot get the fish.  That is a very obvious reason.  It is very difficult to get fish. People in Dublin who live in places surrounded by all the comforts of life do not realise how difficult it is to get fish in many parts of the country.  The cooking of the fish is very important, also.  Here again, the Minister might consult with the Minister for Education, to see if some scheme could be devised to encourage the proper cooking of fish.  When the housewife goes out to buy fish, she is more inclined to buy preserved fish than ordinary fresh fish, for several reasons.  First of all, as I say, she cannot get fresh fish, or she is doubtful if it is fresh; or, if she gets fish which purports to be fresh, it is sometimes not as fresh as it should be.  Deputy Palmer has told us about fish going up to Dublin and coming back to Kerry again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> If fish were readily available, I think the people would use it.  One of the most important things is to have a big home market for it.  This is a country in which our people have to eat something other than meat on Fridays. There are periods in Lent when our people have to do that a couple of times a week, so there should be a ready market for fish.  Using our creameries as a spearhead, it ought to be possible to build up a fish trade all round the country.  The Minister might use his energies on those lines to circulate fish as much as possible.  The fishery organisations have suggested to me that the creamery is one of the best ways to do this.</P>
    <P>I will not detain the House any longer on this subject, as I realise the Minister is trying to improve conditions generally.  I was very critical of him on the Forestry Estimate, but I believe he has achieved more in the Fisheries line than in Forestry.  I hope he will be successful in building stronger fleets and increasing our fishing industry considerably.  It is capable of expansion, not only by 25 or 50 per cent. but by 100 per cent.  Belgium has only 45 miles of coast, and what coast have we, with entire beds around us and the fish waiting to be taken there?  In the final analysis, we cannot build up the fishing industry unless capital is made freely available for it. That is where the Minister, as a member of the Government, has an important part to play, and I hope he will continue to use his best efforts to build up this industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been some 30 years here, listening to debates on this Estimate.  In some of those other years, more was said about fishing and we were told every year that it was &ldquo;next to agriculture.&rdquo;  At one time, an attempt was made by the Fianna Fáil Government, when it was earlier in office, to kill the cattle industry.  Of course, in those years, no one ever attempted to say they killed the fishing industry.  It would not be hard to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Deputy this evening spoke until he had to sit down from exhaustion. The Minister set a bad example himself, as it took some 22 columns of the <Col N="1062" /> Official Debates to tell posterity what he had to say.  I want to put briefly before the House what it is all about. From a business point of view, you could write the whole subject on the back of an envelope.  According to the Minister, last year, £907,000 worth of fish were landed in this country.  If you take the cost of administration of the Department at £193,000, that leaves £713,000.  We exported the enormous quantity of £215,000 worth of fresh fish and £100,000 worth of herrings.  This is the industry that was &ldquo;next to agriculture&rdquo;. Is it not well that Fianna Fáil did not kill the cattle industry? Had they done so, I do not know what would happen us now.  There is the whole picture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Take £713,000, having deducted the cost of the administration. Imagine the repetition of all the speeches I have listened to over the years, about this industry which could be something great.  There is the net result of it, and the Minister takes 22 columns of the Official Debates to tell us what it is all about.</P>
      <P>In past years I made some suggestions as to things which are essential. What is this problem, in brief?  It is (1) to get fishermen who can fish; (2) to provide boats; (3) to catch fish; (4) to land them; and (5) to market them. There is the problem.  The efforts will be utterly futile and useless unless the marketing system is of the highest order.  I do not like to say hard things. but after all those years of disappointment one feels like saying hard things. It seems to me that this Department could not sell lollypops.  Imagine all the money of the taxpayer that has been spent to carry this on, with the net result to-day of £713,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say this in a bitter way, but I have a sense of disappointment at the way this question has been talked about.  The cattle industry Fianna Fáil were going to kill, brought to this country last year over £45,000,000.  This Department of Fisheries brought £715,180.  There is not a word about it in this House.  Last year, eggs exported realised £220,364. The farmer's wife who mainly looks <Col N="1063" /> after the butter, and always did, exported butter to the value of £4,349,333.  Is that not a comparison?</P>
    <P>Although this may sound hard, it is perfectly friendly&mdash;the Minister disappoints me.  I read the speeches made by the Minister up and down the country and he gives the impression of being the efficiency expert of the Government.  There is no efficiency about that.  For years I have tried to develop the consumption of fish in this country because the first thing one must do with any native industry is to provide a home market.  Surely that is obvious, but there is not a word in the 20 or 22 columns the Minister produced about fish distribution and marketing inside the country.  I repeatedly asked that a fleet of insulated vans should be made available to the Department and that they should go through the country from various centres each morning into every village and town and cover the whole network with supplies of fish.</P>
    <P>I would go so far as to say&mdash;I would be very revolutionary in this&mdash;that for a period I would give fish away free. I would give time to develop a taste for it because apparently something drastic must be done.  There is no use in blaming the public for that, because, as has been said here to-night and every year for the past 30 years I have been here, the people cannot get fish. There is no use in burking that issue. When they look for fish, they cannot get fish.  One might as well look for a needle in a haystack as look for fish in any country village.  When I was a boy 70 years ago, a farmer would go to some fishing port with a horse and cart it, take home a load of fish and cure it, and have it for his wife and family for a whole year.  I can think of the districts where that happened, districts where you would not get a sprat to-day. So why blame the people for not being fish conscious?</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the board and the Department developing an export market.  That makes me writhe, especially when alongside that the Minister said England imports £33,000,000 worth of fish every year. Why look for markets?  Our contribution <Col N="1064" /> to the market, even if the whole of it went out would be about £900,000 and that does not all go out.  There is a market for £33,000,000 worth at our door within an hour's reach of us and the Minister proposes to spend the taxpayers' money seeking markets elsewhere. Is there anything more fantastic than that?  It reminds me of the economic war period when they were going to send the eggs and butter and the old cattle up the Mediterranean&mdash;to look at the palm trees I suppose.  It vexes to hear that, when everybody is complaining about the depopulation of the country which is taking place mainly along the seaboard.  Is that not a sad commentary on our work and our efforts?  Should we not be ashamed of ourselves and ashamed to talk about it?  I am not going to talk any more about it.</P>

      <P>If we went down to Westport to-day, we might realise the value and importance of the Irish fishing industry.  We have there visitors from all parts of Europe and they realise that we have something in Ireland which is worth coming here for and that we have a real fishing centre here.  That fishing centre, I am happy to say, is in the County of Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard the Minister talking of a large exploratory fishing vessel to be designed by a naval architect.  I wonder if he has heard of a vessel which came from West Germany recently to Sligo.  This vessel was a deep sea trawler and one of the biggest of the German fishing vessels.  It was capable of travelling to any fishing ground in the world.  It was also able to sort fish, cure fish and was equipped to process fish and make fishmeal. It was really a floating factory, and I think until we settle down and realise that we must get vessels of this sort, we will not be able to have a good fishing industry.  The day of the currach and the small boat has gone.  The fishing industry must advance; there is no use in attempting to carry on that industry on the basis of our people going out four or five miles from their ports.  We must have vessels equipped to travel to any place and they must be large enough to be able to stay out in any kind of weather.  The rougher the <Col N="1065" /> weather, the better chance we have of getting a market for our fish because in rough weather the fish will naturally be scarce.</P>
    <P>We must get An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to take charge of our fishing industry in a big way and it must become something like the E.S.B. or Bord na Móna.  Surely we have plenty of fishing grounds around Ireland&mdash;if we have not we should have&mdash;because we have a big coastline in comparison with the area comprising the State.  If we look at what has happened in Belgium, which has one of the largest fishing fleets, with a very small coastal area, we will appreciate what must be done to make our fishing industry something good and valuable and something of which we can be proud. That is what I hope the Minister will do.</P>
    <P>Let us get rid of the small boats and stop giving out boats on hire-purchase, boats that will go out for a day's fishing and no more, boats that will run for home when bad weather is expected.  We want boats that are able to travel to any part of the world and able to fish even in bad weather, because such boats will bring home fish that will be worth bringing home at times when fish will be scarce and dear in the markets.</P>

      <P>I was pleased to know that such a large quantity of fish was taken on Lough Conn under such trying circumstances.  I was pleased to hear of the quantity of fish taken by two boats fishing during two very bad days.  I think the Minister mentioned something about 30 or 50 fish caught during those two days, and that they weighed something over 50 lbs.  I am also pleased with the arrangements the Minister is making in connection with Irish lakes.  Our lakes and rivers, if kept in good order and looked after properly, could be a great asset to the nation.  They will attract plenty of tourist anglers and will be of great benefit in that way.</P>
      <P>I was sorry more people did not attend the training centre at Galway. I had hoped plenty of young men would have attended those courses arranged by the Minister.  Fairly decent terms and generous allowances were provided and I was disappointed that there were only 24 applicants for those courses.  I have read about the Icelandic fisherman who is coming here to this country.  He will give lectures but I wonder what effect they will have on the people of Portacloy, Belmullet and Blacksod?  As I said before we must draw those people away from the methods of fishing that their forefathers used.  It is good to realise that the currach is dead.  It will become a dead industry unless we improve it, and the only way to improve it is to provide larger boats.  We have plenty of young, adventurous Irishmen at home and we must ensure that they build boats of sufficient size, boats that will be equipped by some party like An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  There is no reason why plenty of young, intelligent, adventurous men should not take part in the training courses arranged for fishermen.</P>
      <P>I was very pleased to note that we have increased our wet fish landings by 41 per cent. over last year and that the herring catches at Dunmore East have been increased so much.  I was disappointed to learn that we did not increase our shellfish landings and I am wondering could anything be done to bring about an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> I did not hear the Minister make any mention of one part of the fishing industry in the West.  I refer to shark fishing in Achill.  It is a part of the fishing industry that certainly gives great employment in that area, and also inland, and it has been carried on through the energy and enterprise of one individual in the area.  Certainly I thought the Minister would have made some mention of the advantages the shark fishing industry confer on the Achill area.  When one individual, such as Mr. Joe Sweeney, is able to organise such an important industry it should be possible to get plenty more people to invest in sea fisheries.  That is a matter I should like the Minister to consider, to see if we could expand that industry in the West.</P>
    <P>Counting my own constituency we have the best sea fishing areas in Ireland but we are not making enough use of them.  We cannot get fish at certain times when we want them. Sometimes we have too much and sometimes none at all.  There are no definite arrangements to have fish transported to market.  Salmon fishing in the area is good and I hope the Minister will refer to the problem of drainage and how it may affect angling.  Some of our people are wondering if the drainage of rivers such as the Moy might have a serious effect on salmon and trout fishing.  I hope the Minister will be able to say when replying that he has taken certain advice on the question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must refer the Minister to the statement he made on this Estimate last year.  As a new Minister he said he did not know much about the Department at that time, but he continued to speak for column after column and said about as much as he has said this year.  When one looks through the debate one sees something of a rehash of last year's debate.  There may be a few points in the Minister's speech with which I agree, but there are quite a number of important items which are absent from his statement. He asks for more money but I do not see what will be done with this increased demand in the year to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that he hopes to set up a permanent <Col N="1068" /> nautical school in Galway Vocational Education School.  As a member of the Galway Vocational Education Committee, I can assure the Minister that he has, and he will have, their fullest co-operation in that project.  The Minister has expressed disappointment in the number of applicants for that course.  May I suggest to him that he should try and attract young men who already have their tickets as that would short circuit a lot of the training that takes place?  It would speed up the course.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on that suggestion when replying.  Again, I can assure him of the fullest co-operation from the vocational committee.  The Minister mentioned certain figures but I suppose I shall not be able to go into them to-night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day at Question Time, I asked the following question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that extensive flooding was caused on lands and farmyards near Broadmeadow River as a result of the recent heavy rainfall; and if he will state what progress has been made regarding arterial drainage plans in respect of this river.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reply I received was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commissioners of Public Works are at present investigating the possibility of a drainage scheme for the Broadmeadow catchment area under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  For that purpose, an engineering survey of the area has been completed, and it is hoped to make the necessary valuation survey of the affected lands this year.  When the design and preparation of a scheme have been completed, the requirements of the Act as regards exhibition, consideration of observations <Col N="1069" /> and confirmation, will have to be complied with.  I cannot say when drainage works in the catchment area are likely to commence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, that is a most unsatisfactory reply.  This Broadmeadow River flooding has been causing hardship and losses for at least 50 years.  I have a file here before me and, if necessary, I can read letters dated 1903 concerning proposals to carry out drainage work on the Broadmeadow River, owing to serious flooding in November, 1901.  It was considered at that time that it was clear that a drainage scheme for the Broadmeadow River should be made. However, since 1901, this matter has been brought up in an active manner on several occasions.  There are many reports available concerning that river, but to-day from the reply to my question, it is obvious that we are not near any actual work being done, although we may be nearer on paper to having some effective work carried out.  It seems that as far back as 1928 a scheme was ready; and a design for the drainage work was exhibited as far back as 1930.  Here in reply to this question to-day, we are told that it will be necessary to exhibit the scheme, now that the survey has been completed.</P>
    <P>Briefly speaking, the recent history of this river is that in January, 1957, a survey began and apparently it was completed recently, according to the reply.  We are indebted to the <i>Irish Independent</i> for a photograph which shows hundreds of acres of land under a lake of water, only a couple of years ago.  Here I have a cutting from the <i>Irish Times</i>, dated 27th June of this year&mdash;some days ago&mdash;and standing in the middle of the public road there is a man with a fishing rod and line, beside the signpost pointing to Ballyboughal, Swords and Dublin, 50 yards from the main river stream.  He is fishing there on the public road, because he could not get any nearer to the stream.  In addition, we have a photograph here of a tractor and trailer driving along on the public road and there is a flood there to a depth of one and a half feet.  I mention this so that it can be appreciated that this flood one and a half feet deep went in to farmyards, farmhouses and <Col N="1070" /> dwellinghouses.  It caused a sleepless night for the residents of those places, watching the water rise in the darkness of the night, wondering just when it would stop and finding it necessary to move their live stock to higher land.</P>
    <P>All these problems are being caused by the delay in having this drainage work carried out.  This was a need which was appreciated as far back as 1901.  My complaint is that over the years the Board of Works has had sufficient time and sufficient data to enable them to complete a scheme within a reasonable time.  I think I am right in saying that there is on the file a report which says that, on completion of the survey, one senior engineer and four junior engineers could, in the space of eight weeks, design a scheme for the drainage of this river.</P>
    <P>Approximately 50 families are affected.  The river damages at least 600 acres of land three or four times a year at times of heavy rainfall.  That occurs not necessarily in the winter time; sometimes these floods come just as they did last week, during what would be expected to be the drier period of the year.  I was informed in 1955 that the river was listed No. 4 on a priority list by the Board of Works under the minor rivers section of the Arterial Drainage Act.  It is considered by the local families that a dredging machine operated by a drainage contractor could bring considerable relief to the flooding which is being caused there.  It is appreciated, of course, that the general bed of the river is twisted and that the water does not get a straight run to the sea just north of Swords.  The records will show that the road bridge at Rolestown was swept away in 1954. It was swept away because the flood waters were not taken away quickly enough, down further towards the river mouth.  At that time, it was necessary for an Army pontoon bridge to be provided at Rolestown.  It is costing something around £4,000 to provide a new bridge there.  Now, £4,000 would certainly go some of the way towards the improvement of that watercourse which would avoid the flooding being caused at the present time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> I should like to mention to the Parliamentary Secretary that I found a letter addressed to the Board of Works by the Dublin County Council dated 21st January, 1955, reminding the Board of Works that in a letter dated 8th September, 1950, the Chief Engineer of the Board of Works stated that the board prepared a scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, which was not proceeded with.  It was not proceeded with at that time because a small contribution was required from the landowners affected in the area.  Apparently, at that time, when the scheme was surveyed, when it was designed and exhibited and when it had reached the final stages, it was found that the landowners and ratepayers in the area were not prepared to contribute a very small proportion of the cost required to pay the interest charge and annuity in connection with the remainder, after the grant had been provided towards this work.</P>
    <P>This river channel is narrow and twisted; it is choked by weeds and has been neglected for years.  Even at this stage, some kind of relief work could be carried out by the Board of Works on this river.  There are approximately 27,000 acres of land drained by it and at times of heavy rainfall, approximately 1,000 acres of land are being flooded and damaged. If attention were given to this problem immediately, much of that damage could be avoided and it would be of great benefit to the people who normally suffer these losses.  The river is unable to carry the flood waters at times of heavy rainfall because it crosses flat country and is twisted.  If the river were straightened, the water would come down much more quickly. I read in some report that on a previous occasion the water was running at the rate of eight feet per second which is a very high speed for water in a river, but when it is running at that rate in a twisted and choked river bed, the amount of flooding near the course of the river will be appreciated.</P>
    <P>In 1930, the Office of Public Works approved a scheme which was estimated <Col N="1072" /> some years ago by an engineer of Dublin County Council to cost £6,500, but the figure to-day for a reasonably good job would be around £10,000. However, the question of cost will arise only when the formalities which have been mentioned to-day in this question are completed.  The scheme was exhibited in 1930 but the landowners at that time refused to make a small contribution towards it.  I know the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, will not require householders and landowners to make any contribution towards the work to be carried out now.</P>
    <P>This river could have been dealt with under the Arterial Drainage (Minor Schemes) Act, 1928, and much of the survey work was done at that time, but the scheme was not proceeded with.  The matter was raised again in 1931 and the landowners and people who were suffering the losses kept the matter before the Board of Works.  The reply to the question to-day gives some hope but these people had those hopes in the past.  Therefore, I am putting it up to the Parliamentary Secretary that the design could be completed in less than three months &mdash;and probably in two months&mdash;which is the time estimated for the completion of the design.</P>
    <P>Several deputations were sent up by the families who were affected by this flooding and a strong case has been made for the carrying out of the work.  I shall not bore the Parliamentary Secretary with any quotations which I can give from the various letters available on the file here because I know all this information is available to him.  However, the Parliamentary Secretary says in the last sentence of his reply to-day:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I cannot say when drainage works in the catchment area are likely to commence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As this flooding will take place at least three times or more in every 12 months it is disappointing that the Parliamentary Secretary on this occasion cannot give a more hopeful reply.</P>
    <P>I hope the information I have given to the Parliamentary Secretary will be useful.  It is from first-hand knowledge because I have studied this problem <Col N="1073" /> over a period of ten years.  The place in question is not far from the Swords and Rush areas and I am fully aware of the hardships this flooding is causing and of the desire amongst the residents to have the matter put right as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply to give an assurance that efforts will be redoubled and that finance will be provided in the immediate future in order to have this work carried out.  I mentioned that even temporary relief could be given, if the river bed could be cleared of various obstructions which have accumulated down the years. The obstructions are not just rock that cannot be moved.  They are all kinds of tree trunks which were swept down from the surrounding lands at times of flooding.  When the floods come, they carry into that stream all these obstructions which remain there and which I feel could easily be removed by a drainage contractor.  This would enable the floods to get away more quickly than at present and would alleviate the hardship until the actual work of drainage under the Arterial Drainage Act could be carried out in the normal way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to contest any of the arguments which Deputy Rooney has put forward to impress upon the House the importance of having this Broadmeadow drainage scheme done at the earliest possible time.  However, he himself has raised a question with regard to the desirability of doing this work when he reminded me that a scheme prepared in the late twenties was not proceeded with because the people who were to benefit from it would not make what he described as the small contribution necessary.  That immediately raises the question of the economics of the scheme on which I shall not now make any comment because we have not reached the stage at which any economic assessment of it can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy, I am sure, is aware that the first survey carried out is usually the engineering survey and that survey has been completed in respect of <Col N="1074" /> this Broadmeadow minor catchment area.  The next survey, which has not yet begun but which I understand may be undertaken between now and the autumn, is the valuation survey.  The design of an approved scheme is being prepared on the basis of the engineering survey and that should be ready early next year.  When the valuation survey is also available, these two together will be discussed and the possibility of preparing an economic scheme will then be considered.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also is aware, I take it, that when a scheme has been exhibited, as it must be under the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act, at least a month must be allowed for observations on it and objections to it on the part of the public.  Then there must be a period of three months during which the county council will have an opportunity of making their submissions in respect of it.  Assuming that these two parties do not produce any objection to the scheme, I take it we would then be on the way to the preparation of a final scheme for submission to the Minister for Finance.  However, all these stages, which are statutory and must be complied with, take time.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Deputy that the piecemeal treatment of the immediate trouble area here cannot be carried out by the Office of Public Works. Under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, they are obliged to treat the entire catchment area as a unit and to prepare a scheme on the basis of that unit. Therefore, any piecemeal method of dealing with this flooding problem cannot be applied by them.</P>
    <P>It is possible that, when the scheme has been exhibited, Deputy Rooney and the Deputies for County Dublin may find that the objections to the scheme by the potential beneficiaries, to which he has referred, may be renewed and that they may not accept the financial obligations of the scheme. It is true, as he says, that no contribution has to be made by the beneficiaries for the carrying-out of the work, as would have been the case in respect of the scheme to which he referred under, I take it, the 1925 Act.  However, the Deputy must know that there is a statutory obligation on the beneficiaries, that is, the rated land-holders <Col N="1075" /> in the catchment area, to pay the maintenance costs which will subsequently be incurred by the Office of Public Works in maintaining the drainage works which will have been carried out. These charges are collected by the county council and must be paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a general charge on the rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is.  That is true. However, the ratepayers of County Dublin will, in any event, have to bear it and they have no choice but to pay.</P>
      <P>I am not yet in a position to say anything with regard to the time in which works can be undertaken here. Deputy Rooney will appreciate that, until we reach the stage at which an economic scheme can be drawn up with an estimate of the time which will be required to complete the further stages before the actual implementation of the scheme can take place, it is not possible now to give any such estimate.  The question of whether or not an economic scheme can be devised for the Broadmeadow catchment area has not yet been definitely decided.  I do not want to depress the Deputy.  I hope such a scheme will be possible but I do not want to state that positively on this occasion because the preparatory work has not proceeded sufficiently far to form any such estimate.  There will be no avoidable delay.  The priority of this scheme on the general programme has not been interfered with in any way by me since I became Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and it is being given its allotted place on that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are about 60 catchment areas, divided between minor and major, the division being about half and half.  The Deputy will appreciate that there will be other schemes in progress at the <Col N="1076" /> same time as this one, when the work commences, and there are other works in progress at the present time as to engineering and valuation surveys, contemporaneously with this.  For that reason, the degree of expedition of which the Deputy has spoken cannot be given to it.</P>
    <P>The available staff of the Office of Public Works must be employed to the best possible advantage, keeping in mind the general national programme of arterial drainage which has been approved by this and the previous Government.  I do not think I am in a position to say any more.  I can give the Deputy the assurance that the officials or the Commissioners of Public Works charged with the promotion of this scheme are highly competent and efficient at their work.  I am satisfied they have applied themselves diligently to it.  For that reason, I expect it will be possible to have a favourable report in the matter but I do not, and cannot, tie myself to time.</P>
    <P>The conditions which flooding throw up are very much the same in regard to inconvenience and discomfort and the other drawbacks associated with it in all districts.  I would remind the Deputy that they exist in a much greater degree in other catchment areas than is the case even in the Broadmeadow catchment area, as described by him as a result of the present month's flooding.</P>
