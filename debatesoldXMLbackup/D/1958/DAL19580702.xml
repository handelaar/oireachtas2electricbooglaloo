      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is prepared to make available to interested parties a memorandum setting out (a) the industries which could be established based on the by-products of the oil refinery, Whitegate, County Cork, and (b) the location and suitability of industrial sites on both the eastern and western approaches to Cork Harbour.</P>

      <P>As regards (a) of the Deputy's question, I am aware that a wide range of commodities can be produced from oil.  I am having the position actively examined so far as the Whitegate Refinery is concerned but I am not in a position to make a memorandum on the subject available.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the actual increase in C.I.E. revenue to the latest convenient date since the recent increase in bus fares for the metropolitan bus services; and if he will state the receipts for the comparable period in 1957.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether the Household Budget Inquiry of 1951-52 or any other similar inquiry reveals a pattern of food consumption as respects women and children which would enable such consumption to be expressed as a percentage of the average food consumption of a man; and, if so, if he will indicate the approximate &ldquo;man value&rdquo; in food consumption units applicable to (a) adult women, (b) children under five years, (c) children of five to ten years, and (d) children of ten to 14 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Such inquiries as have been undertaken in this country do not give the information in the form sought by the Deputy.  For example, the National Nutrition Survey, which was carried out by my Department, was based on the intake of the family as a unit and did not extend to an examination of individual dietaries.  In any case, I understand that in surveys of this kind where individual dietaries are adopted as the basis of study, it is the practice to express intake not as food consumption units but in relation to nutrients, vitamins, minerals and calories, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CeliaLynch" hpid="Mrs. Lynch Mrs. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether his attention has been drawn to the manner in which the replies given by him in Dáil Eireann on Wednesday, 25th June, to Questions Nos. 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, relating to poliomyelitis, were reported in an issue of a newspaper on 26th June; and, if so, whether in view of the fact that the report in question is likely to mislead the public as to the conditions under which the public anti-polio vaccination service was available to parents he will make a statement in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention was <Col N="1080" /> drawn to the report referred to and I wrote to the editor of the newspaper concerned pointing out its inadequate character.  The editor has since published my letter which incorporated, not only the full text of my reply to a parliamentary question concerning my policy in regard to vaccination against poliomyelitis, but also the text of a reply to a further question by Deputy Liam Cosgrave, who sought details of the revised arrangements for such vaccinations.</P>
      <P>In order to remove any possible misunderstanding in regard to this matter, I take this opportunity to emphasise that the free vaccination service is available to parents and guardians who cannot, without undue hardship, provide out of their own resources for the vaccination of their children, irrespective of whether or not they hold medical service cards.</P>
      <P>I propose also, as I have already stated, to authorise health authorities to make arrangements for the provision of vaccination for children of parents and guardians in the classes specified in Section 15 (2) of the Health Act, 1953, which include persons who might not be in a position to show conclusively that the service could be provided in their case without undue hardship but who might, nevertheless, be expected to find difficulty in meeting the full inclusive cost of the vaccines and professional services involved. Like the present free service, the supplementary service will be administered by the local health authorities and will cover children up to ten years of age and expectant mothers.  Under it the charges for a full course of three injections will be 15/- per expectant mother, 15/- per child where one or two children from the same family participate and 10/- per child where three or more children participate.  As the supplementary service will be administered by the local health authorities, applications for vaccinations under it will require to be made to the county council or county borough council in the district in which the parents or guardians concerned reside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under these arrangements, it should be possible for all parents and <Col N="1081" /> guardians who are anxious to do so to have their children immunised against poliomyelitis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the confusion which exists concerning those entitled to this service, will the Minister consider having details of the service published at dispensaries and clinics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall look into that. I do not think there can be very much confusion.  After all, the announcement regarding the service was made only a few days ago, when the arrangements were finally completed for providing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister recall that the announcement was made in the middle of a by-election, when a good many other matters were engaging the attention of the public, and that there is now opportunity for clarification of his amendment of the policy first declared by him in this House and which was pretty generally accepted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Deputy's supplementary question conveys an innuendo which is quite baseless, as most of the Deputy's innuendoes are.  The announcement was made because this was a matter in which there was a great deal of public interest and made as soon as it was clear to me that we could provide a service to meet the marginal cases and those who are in the upper limit of the group covered by Section 15 (2) of the Act and those beyond them, on the margin.  I made the announcement because I was anxious that no parents should continue to be unduly alarmed or apprehensive, because they might think that the cost of vaccination for their children against polio would be beyond their means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will arrange that the civilian staff employed at the Curragh Camp will be notified in detail of their income-tax assessments and of the allowances granted to them before income-tax is deducted from their wages, so that they may have an opportunity of checking whether they have been given credit for the allowances to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements are already in operation whereby persons from whose official remuneration income-tax is deducted are supplied on request with a statement of the basis on which the tax is deducted.  These arrangements are working satisfactorily and no extension is contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the employees concerned are notified that their income-tax for a particular year is X sum and that it is proposed to deduct that from them in Y weekly instalments.  They do not know whether they have in fact received the allowances to which they are statutorily entitled. The purpose of my question is <Col N="1083" /> to ascertain from the Minister whether he would give these people either an assessment form or a copy of an assessment form showing the income on which the tax is assessed and the allowances which have been made to them in respect of the income-tax assessment.  That is what the ordinary taxpayer gets from the income-tax authorities.  The fact that these people are in public employment in the Curragh Camp should not deprive them of that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If any individual applies for particulars, he will get the full particulars giving the basis on which the tax is claimed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say why these persons do not get an assessment form saying: &ldquo;Your income-tax for the year is so-and-so, and the following allowances are being made to you?&rdquo; The Minister gets that form himself.  I and every other taxpayer get it.  Why is it dispensed with in this case?  Surely it should be a simple matter to give that information to the persons concerned?  Presumably they can get if if they now ask for it.  Why do they not get it the same as any other income-tax payer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that there are 31,000 people drawing public funds being assessed for income-tax.  They are all free to ask for particulars if they wish, but actually only 3,500 ask for particulars.  There is a very big saving in time by doing it this way. At the same time, every person has a right to ask for the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why in these particular cases do the persons not receive a <Col N="1084" /> notice of assessment saying: &ldquo;Your income-tax is so-and-so and the following allowances have been made to you. The net tax is so-and-so and it is proposed to deduct that in such-and-such a way&rdquo;?  Surely that is an elementary right where a person is asked to pay income-tax?  Would the Minister mind looking into the matter?  It should not be very difficult to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many new departures from the time about which the Deputy is talking.  What the Deputy should realise is that the £8 tax he is talking about is a concession. In its present form, it is purely a concession and nothing more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be absolutely necessary for a farmer taking cattle to a fair or market to take the owner of the cattle in the tractor or trailer?  The point I am making is that it is absolutely essential to bring in this amendment if it is to be of any value.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider the concession asked for by Deputy Wycherley?  It is not an extraordinary concession.  If it is not given it can only cause irritation and hardship, both to the farmers and to the Guards, who may feel bound to prosecute in the frivolous cases that must certainly arise out of this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>I have no information in regard to the effects of the recent flooding other than that contained in the Press reports. It appears that drains and watercourses were unable to cope with the abnormal run-off resulting from the exceptionally heavy rainfall last week. It is a matter for the local authorities concerned to consider whether the surface water drainage systems in their districts should be improved, especially if flooding is becoming more frequent. Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation and Dublin County Council have had the problem under consideration for some years and a joint scheme is being formulated.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said at an earlier stage of the Bill he felt perhaps the House was erring on the side of excess in making the representations, and he yearned for expedition.  I made the case last night against it and I do not want to weary the Minister or the House by repeating the representations I made last night, to which I have nothing really to add.  Retrospection in itself is bad.  This very issue was examined in Great Britain, where the Chancellor of the Exchequer was in a position to say he had given two years' notice of his intention.  Nevertheless, on the representations submitted to him, he determined to abandon the retrospective element in his proposals, because he felt that to persist in them was to abandon a vital principle for disproportionate gain for the Exchequer.  His position was that in the current year he expected claims to be made on the Exchequer amounting to at least £2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our conditions, we understand the Minister's highest anticipation is that claims might mature up to £100,000.  None of us in any part of the House is desirous of seeing those who engaged in this operation benefiting, as we believe their activities to be unmeritorious, and I think that is the strongest adjective we could properly apply; but if, by their action, they manoeuvred us in this House into doing something we have never done before in order to give ourselves the satisfaction of believing that we have frustrated something that we could have foreseen perfectly easily&mdash;because we were forewarned of it by what transpired in the British House of Commons two years ago&mdash;and if we <Col N="1094" /> were deluded into abandoning a very fundamental principle of legislation by the simple desire to frustrate people who we think are more clever than is good for them or for the community to which they belong, we could make a terrible mistake.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we would be justified in legislating retrospectively in any circumstances, but if the Minister were even in a position to put forward his argument that this practice had come upon him like a bombshell and that he had to take a snap decision&mdash; where I speak of the Minister, I mean the Minister and his predecessor&mdash;I could understand his arguing strongly for the course which it is proposed to follow in this amendment, but he is not in that position.  The Minister for Finance in Ireland had full knowledge of this type of operation.  Consequent on this discussion in the British House of Commons in 1956, the Minister had full knowledge in Ireland of the Treasury view that was taken of this kind of operation two years ago, and it was open to him last year to pass the requisite legislation, even though he might have felt that at that time the drafting of remedial measures might have lacked perfection, but it would have put all and sundry on notice that legislation was there which it was intended to operate to the limit of our capacity to prevent this practice.</P>
    <P>The very fact we had all that foreknowledge and did not do it seems to me to make it doubly wrong to invoke on this occasion the principle of retrospection, and I urge most earnestly on the Minister that to throw away the record of administrative integrity that we enjoy in this community for so trifling a purpose is an egregious error. I think it right, although these grounds were advanced by Deputy Sweetman when we were discussing this matter before, to point out, that quite apart from the ethical considerations underlying our objection to retrospective finance legislation, there is the fact that when you seek to draw into the country foreign investors, the first question potential investors will ask their accountants and legal advisers is: are we certain that we know the law as it is of this day?  Heretofore, we were <Col N="1095" /> in a position to say to any such inquirer: &ldquo;Yes, and you have further the certainty that there is accepted in our legislation, as it has been accepted in many other legislations in the world, the principle that the law will not be changed retrospectively and therefore anything you undertake to do to-day, if it is lawful, cannot retrospectively be made unlawful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we adopt the course proposed in the Minister's amendment for the purpose of catching out a few individuals who may otherwise benefit, I think we throw away that most important quality of certainty that heretofore we have been in a position to offer to potential investors; and instead we will be obliged to say to them in the discharge of a professional man's duty that, since the Finance Bill of 1958, nobody can ever know under our system what the law is from year to year, because it is now the position that what is legal to-day can be made next year or the year after retrospectively illegal.</P>
    <P>It is hard enough to persuade people to venture into a strange country with their assets and to risk their capital under a legal system and conditions with which they are not familiar, but to introduce a new element of uncertainty seems to me to be supreme folly and therefore on ethical grounds we are most strenuously opposed to the introduction of the principle of retrospection into finance legislation and, of commercial grounds, we think the introduction of the principle of retrospection into finance legislation is a game which most emphatically is not worth the candle.  If we succeed in frustrating a few individuals from claiming back from the Treasury £10,000, £20,000 or £50,000, or whatever sum may ultimately appear to be involved, we shall pay far more for that petty triumph than the actual sum by which the Treasury will benefit.</P>
    <P>We have debated the Finance Bill with the Minister for days on end.  We have made several representations from this side of the House and the Minister himself has admitted that the Bill has been approached on a reasonably objective basis.  He said he <Col N="1096" /> desired to keep it on that basis.  We all know that most of these proposals are ordinary run-of-the-mill proposals presented by the Revenue Commissioners for the defence of the revenue. If it was not the Minister's duty to bring in those, it would be some other Minister's duty to examine them, bring them in or to reject them, but here is an entirely new principle, the principle of retrospection in finance legislation.</P>
    <P>The most urgent representations have been pressed on the Minister not only from the Opposition but also from his own benches.  I suggest it is not a good thing for parliamentary procedure if, in respect of every detail involved in legislation of this character where it does not constitute some fundamental part of Government policy, reasoned representations from all sides of the House are rejected on the ground that the Minister is not prepared to depart from the text of what he originally introduced.  Indeed we are now discussing a ministerial amendment to his own Finance Bill. Whether or not the Minister entirely agrees with the views expressed from this side of the House and from his own benches on this question of retrospection, he cannot doubt that there are many responsible elements in the House who regard this principle as bad ethically and commercially.</P>
    <P>I think he would be well advised in the circumstances to say: &ldquo;This view is so strongly pressed on me that I am prepared to accept it.  I do not see the dreadful consequences other Deputies appear to see in this but I understand what is worrying them and I am anxious to meet them.&rdquo;  Or, are we to take it that restrained argument in regard to a Bill of this kind is so much beating of the wind?  If that is the fact, it is something profoundly to be deplored and I think this House should begin to make its influence felt.  I have no doubt that powerful and strenuous arguments have been pressed on the Minister by his revenue advisers.  That is their job: it is their duty to make the case as an autonomous body in defence of the Treasury and for its protection, but it is our job as representatives of the people to make the case on the merits of what <Col N="1097" /> appears to us to be the ethical and the commercial expediency of such an effort to protect the Treasury.</P>
    <P>I think we have made a very strong argument and even if we on this side of the House, and those Deputies on all sides of the House who have spoken, have not carried complete conviction to the mind of the Minister, at least we must have made him certain of this: that the proposal shocks and disturbs reasonable elements in the House and that we have a legitimate right to make a claim upon him that there is nothing here at stake by way of principle which would justify the Minister for Finance in a democratic Parliament in violating what appears to us to be a fundamental ethical principle, that is, the impropriety of retrospection in finance legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy said that we have dealt with every question on this Finance Bill in an objective way.  I agree with him.  In fact, as the Deputy says, in many cases members of my Party agreed with members of the other Party and vice versa.  I would like to deal with this case objectively also.  I do not see how there could possibly be a clear-cut division between two Parties on this question.</P>
      <P>The next point I want to make is this&mdash;let us leave the Revenue Commissioners out of it.  It is the Dáil that will make this decision.  The Dáil will have to decide whether we will hand over money to certain people and ask the taxpayer to make good the void in the Exchequer; in other words, whether the people we are dealing with here have more right to get the money back than the taxpayer has to keep the money in his pocket. It is the Dáil which has to decide that matter and whatever decision is made here will be carried out by the Revenue Commissioners.  If I want to get a certain thing done, I will ask the Revenue Commissioners how to go about doing it and when we make the law here, we rely on the Revenue Commissioners to carry out that law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to make on this is whether it is retrospection or not.  If it was the case here that these people <Col N="1098" /> we are dealing with had got the money we are talking about and I was asking the Dáil that they should pay it back, there would be no doubt that such a procedure was retrospection.  I do not think it is the same thing and it cannot be regarded as retrospective legislation or retroactive legislation, if we come here and say that we do not think we should pay out certain sums of money that are claimed by certain people under certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House has raised the slightest objection to the method by which I propose to deal with this activity, which has become known as dividend stripping, from this day forward.  There is, therefore, nothing but disapproval of the practice from any member of this House.  To that extent, we have a very strong volume of opinion that it should be stopped. I think Deputies will also admit that if it had occurred to any Minister for Finance, or any Deputy or any member of the staff of the Revenue Commissioners when Finance Bills were being framed in the past that this position could arise they would have dealt with it long ago.</P>
    <P>These people, therefore, are availing of a flaw in the Act which was overlooked because the circumstances under which it arose were never visualised by anybody in framing the Finance Acts.  This, it is true, is a legal position which we discussed here yesterday and we need not go back over it again.  The circumstances under which people can buy up another company is a legal process.  The circumstances under which they can claim back income-tax already paid is also a legal process, but it is one which no responsible person in this House ever envisaged would occur.  It is a legal device and it must be condemned as far as we can.</P>
    <P>The application here is for the repayment of income-tax and the application is being made because legally the person can show that he suffered a loss.  In fact, he had no loss and that must be kept in mind. Legally, under the income-tax law as it stands, he can show a loss and because he can show that loss, he claims a refund, and as the law stands, that refund must be made.  I, therefore, ask <Col N="1099" /> the Dáil not to pay out this money. The Dáil is quite agreeable to give me that power for any transaction from this on.  However, I went further and I said that claims may come in for a transaction that took place after 7th April, 1957, and I am asking power also to refuse to make a return of income-tax paid in this case.</P>
    <P>That is what some Deputies disagree with.  They do not like that because they say it is retrospection and they do not think retrospection should be agreed to.  I point out against that that we are not compelling anybody to suffer a loss.  We are merely saying to them: &ldquo;You tried to get away with an opportunity under the law which happened to be there.  You did not suffer any loss and I am, therefore, asking the Dáil to give me power not to pay out to you because you did not suffer any loss, and it is not right that you should be paid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The British House of Commons has been quoted here, but as far as I could read the proceedings&mdash;I read extracts from the speeches there and I got one copy of the Official Reports&mdash;I gathered that the argument in the British House of Commons was not on principle.  If the British Government were acting retrospectively with regard to a principle, then the Chancellor of the Exchequer would never have put that into his Bill.  I do not see how he could do so if the British Government were acting retrospectively.  On the evidence, the British Government did not think of doing anything wrong with the principle of retrospection even though the Labour Party, which is a very large minority there, are altogether in favour of going back over the years in this particular instance.  As far as the British House of Commons is concerned, we may dismiss them and go on to deal with our own problem.  I am not saying that we should follow anything they may have done because circumstances may be quite different.</P>
    <P>I have some regrets, if you like, on the matter of tactics in putting this into the Bill.  If I had not put it in, it is almost certain that somebody else would put it in in the form of an amendment on the Committee Stage <Col N="1100" /> and I might be in a better position to agree with it in that way.  However, that is over and done with and the question is there now and we must deal with it.</P>

      <P>I thought these amendments were designed to bring in retrospection?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole three went in together.  It was an after-thought&mdash;it was left out of the Bill when it was drafted and the three amendments went in together.</P>
      <P>Take, for instance, income-tax. Supposing I had proposed in this year's Budget to put another 6d. on income-tax I would, in fact, have said to a person drawing a salary: &ldquo;You lived your life last year on a certain salary and I am going to take 6d. in the £ from you off that salary.&rdquo;  In my opinion that is a much better example of retrospection than this particular case because, in this case as pointed out already, what we are doing is saying: &ldquo;We will not give you what you are applying for,&rdquo; but in the case of an imposition of income-tax there is retrospection there.  There was never any objection from that point of view. Certainly it was not objected to on principle.</P>
      <P>We all have objections to income-tax, to the standard rate of income-tax. We have all said it was too high, but I do not recall any member of Dáil Éireann saying it was wrong in principle to impose taxation and take it from last year's salary.  Let us take another example.  When Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture in 1956, I think at that time he fixed the price of barley at 42/- a barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>40/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter for the sake of the example, but let us say it was 40/-.  Suppose some wealthy man saw some profit in it and he said to his agents down the country: &ldquo;Give 42/6.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the barley went into that man's barns, when people began looking for barley he said: &ldquo;My <Col N="1101" /> price is 60/-.&rdquo;  That man was taking a commercial risk.  Things might go wrong with that barley, it might go damp, or go bad and he was taking a risk.  There would be a clamour in this House if that happened and Deputy Dillon would be compelled to fix the price at, say, 50/-.  There is a case where there would be retrospection and I am quite certain whatever objections might be raised to the particular transaction, or to the action of the Minister for Agriculture, nobody would say it would be wrong in principle. Nobody could say so.</P>
      <P>We could continue quoting cases of better examples of retrospection than those, but I am giving only these few cases to show that, though retrospection may be wrong in principle, you can invade the principle of retrospection and people will not say you are evading it, and will not condemn you because you practice retrospection in another way.  It is because this thing has been referred to as retrospection that the big objection appears to be put up to it.  I think we should not adopt the very strict interpretation of the whole procedure that has been adopted on it by certain Deputies here &mdash;not on that side alone I admit&mdash;and we should take a more practical and sensible view of what is taking place here.  We should try to make up our minds whether these people deserve our sympathy more than ordinary taxpayers. As I have said already if these people take £100,000&mdash;I do not know how much it may be, there is no possibility of finding out how much it may be&mdash;then the taxpayers generally must make up the £100,000, and it is a question of whether these people we are dealing with are more deserving than ordinary taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned here before, and I think it was a very good illustration, that we are dealing with people who have really put their hand into the till.  We are making up our minds whether we shall say to them: &ldquo;Take your hand out of the till, we are not going to permit that,&rdquo; or whether we shall say to them: &ldquo;Dáil Éireann on the 6th April, 1958, says, &lsquo;Fill your hand, fill it well, because it is the last chance you have&rsquo;.&rdquo;  I do not like to see these people getting away with it.  I may <Col N="1102" /> have given this matter more study than other Deputies and perhaps I am prejudiced. I do not know but I do not like to see these people getting away with it.  I must say I am not convinced by the arguments put up to me that we should let them get away.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say I am not arguing this as a political question. I do not see how political Parties could be divided for or against this. It is a matter for individual approach. There may be individuals on the side of Fine Gael who do not like this and there may be individuals on that side who say they do not see much wrong with it.  There may be the same difference of opinion on this side here. There may be individuals who do not like it and there may be others who think we should not show any mercy whatever to these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make it perfectly clear that I have no sympathy with people engaged in share stripping activities.  My anxiety is not the protection of the guilty, but the protection of the innocent.  I do not believe, for a moment, that the share strippers are innocent in any moral sense whatever, but what I am concerned about is that once we step on to this slippery slope, as Deputy Dillon has called it, we will expose ordinary taxpayers to retrospective legislation.  I cannot agree with the Minister at all that there can be anything innocent in retrospection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Retrospection is here.  I can fully sympathise with the Minister in his anxiety to protect the revenue. That is his main responsibility and I have every sympathy with him as he tries to discharge that responsibility. He has put it to us what he is trying to do is to protect the ordinary taxpayers from paying a sum of £100,000 to a person engaged in a rather shady transaction.  I am just as keen as he is to protect taxpayers, including myself, against such a contribution in such a connection.  At least we shall know the total amount which we as taxpayers will have to pay.  We have a fair idea at the moment that it is somewhere around £100,000 but, if we once leave the door open to subsequent <Col N="1103" /> Ministers for Finance as advised by the Revenue Commissioners, I am gravely concerned lest we should be putting ourselves in a position of creating a precedent whereby there can be retrospective legislation for taxation or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I view this whole thing rather like a town planning question.  It might well be there was a flaw in a town plan whereby a factory, though it was undesirable, was permissible.  Supposing a person found that loophole in town planning regulations and was able to erect a factory quite within the law, even though possibly it was undesirable, we would have created a precedent which would have allowed the Legislature to say: &ldquo;You did not break any law by erecting that factory.  We are not asking you to take it down or compelling you to take it down.  We are simply passing a nice little bit of legislation whereby you will not be able to use it.&rdquo;  That person would possibly have incurred very considerable expenditure and in that case he would not be able to get any return from it.  It is the same as saying: &ldquo;I am not taking any money away from you; I am just preventing you getting any return for your investment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not want to be personal about the Revenue Commissioners because they are not able to protect themselves in this House, but, at the same time, the Revenue Commissioners are advising the Minister.  They are the watchdogs over the national Exchequer and they are inclined to be ruthless.  At a time like this, I am frightened of them and I am frightened as to what advice they may give to this Minister or subsequent Ministers.  They may very well say that we ought now introduce legislation which will catch certain guilty parties who are perfectly obvious and they may overlook the fact that they may catch a very large number of innocent parties as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another simile, if you like, is the legal principle that everyone is innocent until proved guilty.  That means that some guilty people get away.  It is far better that guilty people should be acquitted rather than that one innocent man should be convicted.  For <Col N="1104" /> the same reason, I believe that it is better that some trickster, if you like, should get away with some money almost illegally, although not quite, than that one innocent taxpayer should be taxed retrospectively or improperly.</P>
    <P>My objection to the whole thing is not directed at the protection of share strippers.  Any way we can get them, let us get them, as long as it does not create a precedent whereby innocent parties can subsequently be placed in an invidious position.  I do sympathise with the Minister in his anxiety, but, once we do this, there will be no protection for the ordinary taxpayer.  I am more worried about him than I am about the foreign industrialist.  I am worried about the danger that retrospective legislation might be brought in whereby the ordinary taxpayer will be made liable to tax retrospectively.</P>
    <P>I find myself in considerable embarrassment over this.  I greatly dislike disagreeing with my own Minister, but, as the Minister himself has stated and as Deputy Dillon has stated, we are trying to deal with this in an objective way.  I will find myself placed in an extremely embarrassing position, and I think other Deputies on this side of the House will also, if this matter is pressed.  I do hope that the Minister will yield to us on this.  We will all join with him in every possible endeavour to stop this happening in future.  We are absolutely behind him in that, but the danger is that, through over-anxiety to convict the guilty, we may be creating a position in which the innocent may also be convicted in future.  I would plead with the Minister again and again, with the utmost sincerity, with everything I have got, to reconsider this matter and let it be a unanimous decision to get after these rather shady transactions.  By all means, let us stop them, but, for heaven's sake, do not let us ever do anything whereby retrospective legislation of any kind can be justified by this precedent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Booth's speech, coupled with the Minister's approach, rather disturbs me.  The Deputy rather intimated that he would like to get after dividend strippers in <Col N="1105" /> every possible way.  I think the Deputy might halt and clear our minds on that, because I take it that, whatever emotional element may have entered into the words &ldquo;dividend strippers&rdquo; now, they were proceeding to do what was perfectly open to them to do under the law.  Just for clarity, I should like to know what element there is in their transaction that would make Deputy Booth want to get after them in every possible way.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that point has been cleared because what the Deputy said struck me as rather supporting the Minister in the attitude that the Minister puts before us now, that these were pilferers and that, while individual Deputies may have certain views on the situation, no ordinary Deputy who has to think as an ordinary man and has to think of the taxpayer behind him, would take the risk of casting a vote that would in any way help somebody who was pilfering.  I think Deputy Booth's remark, therefore, rather dangerous in the atmosphere created by the Minister.  I do not think it is reasonable for the Minister to put it in the form in which he does.  However, the Minister having put it in that form, it makes me hark back to an original remark made by the Minister.  I understood him to say that he would want to hear more before he would change his mind on the matter.  Would the Minister elaborate on that?</P>
      <P>We are asked now to leave the Revenue Commissioners out of it. They have made their case; they have made their stand.  The argument that has been made against the principle of retrospection has been fairly clearly-put. It is that it introduces an element of doubt into the atmosphere in which men in the financial or business line might be operating in future and that no man could be clear that that is the law to-day and that he can work on that law securely and with confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister indicates that there is a possibility that he could change his mind if he heard more, in <Col N="1106" /> what way does he want to hear more? Does he want to hear more in quality about the disturbance that this might create in the minds of people proceeding about their business in the ordinary way inside the law?  Does he want to hear more from Deputies or Senators? Has he heard anything at all from outside?  When the Minister refers to things that are being said that might cause him to change his mind, is he referring only to what has been said in the Dáil up to the present? Has he heard anything at all from people connected with financial, legal, commercial and production circles, either individually or collectively?  Has he heard anything at all from individuals or functional groups in relation to the financial side of business, the legal side, the commercial side or the production side?</P>
    <P>It is rather important that we should know that.  Is it a fact that the only people who are vocal in this matter up to the present are the Deputies who have spoken in the House, who have spoken from their contacts with the commercial and business life and from the ethical outlook?  It would be very interesting if it were the case that, while we are dealing with this measure, no group or individuals connected with any aspect of finance or economics have made representations to the Minister.  Is the Minister in a position to say that he has not heard anything from them, or, if he has heard from them, is he in a position to say anything about the quality or the volume of the arguments they have put up?</P>

A merchant in this country has goods on the high seas which he has ordered with the knowledge of existing tariffs and a Government rushes in here and puts on levies.  If that is not retrospective legislation applied to the individual who, in good faith months before this legislation was brought in made commitments on certain costings for goods, I do not know what is. Here we are using arguments against retrospective legislation in relation to people who have sat down and deliberately searched for flaws in an Act of Parliament in order that they can rob the ordinary taxpayer.  More damage has been done to this country in the last few weeks on this matter than can ever be calculated.

I myself have met people from abroad who were seriously considering investing in the creation of an industry here and on the day after this matter was first raised in the Dáil they produced to me the morning newspaper saying: &ldquo;This guarantee of your Government of freedom from income-tax on profits made on exports is not worth anything because a succeeding Government can come along&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>By the suggestions made by those who are objecting to this piece of legislation by saying this is the beginning of retrospective legislation as if it had never existed here before.  Everybody in this House knows&mdash;members of all Parties have always subscribed to it and I am always very happy to feel that it is so&mdash;that every Government that has come to office has always honoured its obligations and has accepted the obligations of previous Governments. When a Government indicates in all seriousness: &ldquo;This is a piece of legislation limited to a certain type of transactions&rdquo; it is sufficient for me to accept it as dealing with a particular thing.</P>
      <P>I am amazed at the attempt that is being made to make much of it.  A Government comes in here at Budget time or in between Budgets and will bring in legislation to increase or reduce tariffs.  What is the effect and the impact on the trader?  One man may have brought in a large consignment of goods and paid very heavy tariffs and, having got his stock in, discovers the Government is reducing the tariff on that.  He is left with his high-priced goods to meet competition from somebody who has not before brought them in; or the reverse, as I indicated, by imposing the levies, or by imposing additional tax on goods coming in.  We have all had the experience of people saying these goods were ordered in good faith.  They were on the high seas and could not be in but because the tariff increase operates as from the moment it is announced, those people are caught and out of pocket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That to me is a worse type of retrospective legislation than that now suggested because it affects the ordinary trader, the ordinary person who is honourably concerned in carrying out his business, who is not sitting up burning the midnight oil to find a flaw and then to go about acquiring somebody else's business &mdash; which through prudence has a reserve of undistributed profits&mdash;and who after buying at, to the seller, a high price, <Col N="1109" /> uses it then for the purpose of collecting a drawback against what he can produce as evidence of other losses. It is one of those peculiar transactions that only a certain type of brain can work out, but it is against the welfare of the public generally and I have no hesitation in saying that I hope, no matter what the discussion is, the Minister will stick to his guns and put through this piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>It may be truly said by the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;May God defend me from my friends.&rdquo;  He has at least heard now from the lips of Deputy Briscoe and on his authority what this retrospective element in this proposal has meant to people outside. They have expressed incredulity and, according to Deputy Briscoe, so high a degree of dismay that they have recoiled from the thought of pursuing their original purpose of making investments in this country, and they did it because it has been represented to them in the course of this debate that this proposal represents retrospective legislation.  Is that not so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy recalled his experience of long ago when he was on this side of the House.  He was shocked to hear the principle of retrospection introduced into legislation and when he was then told: &ldquo;This applies only to a very limited extent&rdquo; he tells us all from these benches he still passionately opposed it because the principle was at stake.  Behold the miracle! This Daniel come to judgment has crossed the floor of the House and lo and behold! He has not only turned his person, he has turned his mind as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; but the Deputy will agree that it is the same old principle of retrospection in legislation which shocked him in his salad days. He has now grown old, hoary and experienced and what dismayed him then causes him no tribulation now.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister consoled by Deputy Briscoe's representations? Is he sustained in his resolution by Deputy Briscoe's agony of soul?  I do not know whether it is necessary to pursue Deputy Briscoe's well intentioned intervention further, save to thank him for recalling that, in his pristine youth, he felt the same degree of apprehension about the principle of retrospection as I feel now.  Let us jointly deplore <i>autres temps, autres moeurs.</i>  He is a very different man to-day from what he was a golden quarter of a century ago.  He is a much tougher proposition, with a conscience more reconciled to practical expediency than it used to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving that aside for the moment, the power of words is wonderful. &ldquo;Dividend stripping,&rdquo;&mdash;I do not attribute that artistic touch exclusively to the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland.  I think it was born in the Revenue Commissioners in London.  I <Col N="1111" /> recall, however, that for many years a distinguished Irishman was chairman of that body and he left his poetic heart after him.  If we called this operation &ldquo;dividend equation,&rdquo; it would not have sounded half so indecent. It is most moving to me to see Deputy Booth shudder at the horrible activity of dividend strippers.  I was at once carried down into the lowest dive of Hell's Kitchen in New York with strip-teasers all around me.  I can sympathise with Deputy Booth's feeling that to associate with such people was positively impure.</P>
    <P>Let me assure Deputy Booth that this rather seedy transaction was conducted very largely in the offices of eminent solicitors and accountants of standing, but the Revenue Commissioners got in before the accountants and solicitors got in.  If Deputy Briscoe would ever engage in this kind of activity, I think he would have called it dividend equation.  I think that would have a respectable and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy got out before the strip-teasers undressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about being carried down to the lowest dive of Hell's Kitchen in New York where there were strip-teasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was apprehensive for fear Deputy Booth, in this context, would feel he frequented an atmosphere analogous to that.  I do not think it is true.  I do not think this activity of dividend equation or whatever you call it is praiseworthy.  However, it is silly to get &ldquo;het up&rdquo; about it.  It is a perfectly lawful operation under the law as it stands at this moment.  To introduce emotional reactions into our discussion carries us nowhere.  Nobody, on any side of the House, is concerned to preserve anybody's right to conduct this dividend equation operation to the detriment of the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All are agreed it is an operation which, in the interests of equity between taxpayers, should be put a stop to.  That is all.  But, just as we were concerned on other occasions not to <Col N="1112" /> achieve a relatively minor good at the cost of a major evil, we should to-day refrain from abridging the principle against retrospective legislation, though tempted to frustrate the activities of half a dozen or a dozen people who have perfectly lawfully carried out this dividend equating operation during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister overstates his own case when he says he is entirely satisfied that, if this operation had been foreseen, his predecessors or he himself would have taken measures in anticipation to put an end to it.  Surely he cannot say that when he knows we were forewarned of it and given a full detailed description of it in the course of the discussion on the Finance Bill in the British House of Commons in 1956.  The average Deputy did not have his attention directed to it, but every adviser of status in the Minister's entourage was fully informed and directed the attention of the Minister to it, in so far as it was thought expedient to do so.  Therefore I suggest to the Minister that there is no validity in his argument that had he been forewarned of the possibility of such a practice, inhibitory steps would have been taken and that the present course is embarked upon only because this practice came upon them like a thunder clap.</P>
    <P>Even though we are all agreed that this practice should be stopped, I think we ought to hasten to add&mdash;<i>pace</i>, Deputy Booth&mdash;that though we disagree with every word a man may speak, if he does it within the law, we should be ready to lay down our lives in defence of his right to speak it. Though we may dissent emphatically from certain actions which certain individuals may take, if they act within the law, then, if we believe in democracy and freedom, we should cheerfully lay down our lives in defence of their right to do what we dislike.  But one thing we must not do is to legislate in retrospect and say that: &ldquo;Because we do not like what you do or say, we shall declare to-day that, as of six months ago, what you did was illegal, though we know that when you did it, it was not.&rdquo;  Surely, here is a great and important principle which is worth defending and which is of consequence <Col N="1113" /> to the community to which we belong.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I think the Minister revealed his own state of mind when he found himself forced by his own argument into the necessity of saying: &ldquo;It is a very mild form of retrospection.&rdquo;  I do not think I am in any degree irreverent if I remind the Minister of the Scriptural saying: &ldquo;He that contemneth small things shall fall little by little.&rdquo;  To that affirmation, I do not think anything could profitably be added.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us must be very wary of accepting retrospective legislation in any shape or form.  It seems to me that there is a lot in what Deputy Booth says.  He said he appreciates that this legislation may be introduced for the purpose of catching people who have been able to evade taxes, which, morally, they were liable to pay, but which, legally, they could escape paying but that we would also catch in the net other perfectly innocent people who would be brought in under this legislation.  As I understood him, the Minister tried to make the case that this is a very mild type of legislation, that it affects certain people only and would not in any way affect anyone who was innocent.</P>
      <P>I think I am right in saying that the function of the Revenue Commissioners is to collect the moneys due to them by law.  No matter what the case may be in favour of not embodying a particular individual in this retrospective legislation, it will be the task of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;in fact, it is mandatory on them&mdash;to collect those sums, and if this House passes this legislation, then I do not know how deep or how far it goes.  Quite frankly, I am not much clearer after the Minister's statement than I was before it. No matter how far it goes, or who it enmeshes, it will be mandatory on the Revenue Commissioners to collect that money.  Therefore, on principle, I am against retrospective legislation.  I feel it is a very dangerous form of legislation for us to bring into being in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several arguments have been used by Deputy Briscoe and others as to <Col N="1114" /> legislation passed here in times gone by.  In fact, as far as Deputy Briscoe's intervention went, I could not understand it.  At first, I thought he was arguing in favour of the Minister and then it appeared to me that he was arguing against the Minister, because he made it quite clear that the fact that this side of the House found itself impelled to oppose some of the proposals in this Bill, and more particularly its retrospective proposals, meant we are going to prevent industrialists&mdash;who are expected to come in shoals from overseas to start industries here under tax-free concessions&mdash;to set up here.  That, in itself, appears to be an argument 100 per cent. against the legislation which the Minister is introducing.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has justified his case.  He ought to make it much clearer to the House as to what persons he has in mind to get at.  I take it that it is some of these industrial groups who have grown fat in the State, and probably in and around the City of Dublin.  I would like the Minister to give us something more concrete than he has given.  I should also like him to indicate the dangers to those who may be embroiled by this legislation, and who those people are who are brought in under this legislation, so that the House may judge fairly for itself.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that there is not any great measure of support for the Minister on that side of the House and I am perfectly certain there is none on this side.  It may be that the Government wants to drain the last drop of blood out of the tax-paying public. That is pretty evident.  It may be that the Revenue Commissioners, in doing their duty to the Government, in trying to provide all possible revenue to carry on the administration of the State, have advised the Minister on this matter.  Personally, I am not satisfied with that legislation.  The Minister could very easily take a further look at it, but perhaps he is not prepared to take a further look at it. He should justify his case to a greater degree than he has done so far.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I suggest to the Minister that as there does seem to be a <Col N="1115" /> good deal of controversy about this legislation, and as it affects so vitally the whole principle of taxation, he should leave it to a free vote of the House and there will be no doubt about the outcome&mdash;it will be thrown out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde is entirely wrong.  We have spent a good many hours on this problem for about a fortnight and again yesterday and again to-day.  It is unfair that Deputy Esmonde should come in now and ask me to restate the whole position.  The Revenue Commissioners are not entitled to collect any money from anybody under this clause.  If Deputy Esmonde makes a case that the Government are trying to drag money out of the taxpayer, it is quite the opposite.  We are trying to save the taxpayer from paying out certain money to someone who we think should not get it.  So far as Deputy Esmonde's argument is concerned, I think we can dismiss it at that.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of play made with the word &ldquo;retrospective&rdquo;.  The point I made before was that it was not retrospective at all and I think I was in a stronger position there. Retrospection, after all, is only wrong in principle, if it entails a penalty.  In this Bill, we have given retrospection where benefits were concerned and nobody objects to that.  It is only where a penalty is involved that you could claim that it was wrong.  Our discussion, therefore, is based entirely on whether there is a penalty or not.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out before, we are endeavouring in these clauses&mdash;leaving out this particular clause, dating back to 6th April, 1957&mdash;to prevent people buying shares from another company, on which income-tax has been paid, showing a loss in their accounts, and then claiming a refund of the income-tax on the shares on which they got a dividend.  Whether my proposal to stop refunding that tax on that dividend which has been received, is a penalty or not is the whole question. However, we have debated that often enough and I suppose we will have to come to a decision on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Booth and others are afraid <Col N="1116" /> of a precedent.  I must say I cannot see why.  Whether we agree or disagree with that, it is not going to change my nature as Minister for Finance or that of any other Minister for Finance.  He will look at each problem as it comes, and as it strikes him, and it makes no difference, in my opinion, as far as the future is concerned.</P>
    <P>In answer to another question, I did not meet anybody from finance or business.  As far as I know, the financial and business population in this country are entirely disinterested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing whatever.  I have heard the views of a number of Deputies.  Some of them agreed with the proposals I have here and some were against them.  The great majority who spoke here were against this, but I suppose that is only to be expected. If people feel they are against something, they are inclined to say so, whilst those agreeing with it are inclined to let it stand and come along at the time to support it.</P>
      <P>Finally, I was asked by Deputy Mulcahy what I meant by saying I should like to hear more.  It is because I had heard the views of only four or five Deputies here so far.  As far as the arguments put to me are concerned, I still remain convinced that this provision is right.  There is one thing I would like to say.  The Opposition are all right&mdash;they can vote against it&mdash;but if I were convinced that members on this side had a conscientious objection and might be divided between loyalty to their own convictions and loyalty to Party, then I should not like to put them in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case we are not up against a decision to-day.  The amendment to the amendment is not being moved, as <Col N="1117" /> already stated.  The section deals with other things besides this particular matter.  The Dáil has to agree with the section and leave a decision on this net point until the Report Stage.

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 50.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 72:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 50 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Third Schedule to the Finance Act, 1946 (No. 15 of 1946) is hereby amended by the deletion of all words from and including &ldquo;And in the event of the goods or chattels of the said&rdquo; down to, &ldquo;whichever shall be the shorter&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment which I would urge very strongly on the House.  There is at this moment, to my knowledge, a man in this country in jail in the following circumstances.  He was engaged in business.  His business terminated and was taken over by another firm.  He took employment with the firm which was taking over the business.  After a period that firm went out of business and this man's employment came to an end.  He was left without any means of livelihood because he had found no alternative employment.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances the Revenue Commissioners recovered a judgment against him in respect of approximately £200 income-tax which it was determined was due in respect of his income in the past.  After a limited time the Revenue Commissioners handed that decree which they got to the Sheriff for collection.  The Sheriff attended at that man's place of residence and, having investigated the circumstances, returned the decree to the County Registrar endorsed <i>nulla bona</i>&mdash;the man had no goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the instance of the Revenue Commissioners that decree was then endorsed by the County Registrar and handed by him to the local superintendent of the Guards who, without any other legal procedure, went to the residence of the man in question and, on the authority of that decree endorsed by the County Registrar, arrested that man and removed him to jail where he now is, and informed him that he would be kept there in jail for <Col N="1119" /> six months or until such time as the Revenue Commissioners' claim was discharged, whichever was the shorter.</P>
    <P>The man has no property.  He has no means of paying the debt and must remain in jail for six months.  Everybody knows that on the day of his discharge from jail there is outstanding against him a further debt for £400.  Presumably, if the law remains as it is, that man will go back to jail for another six months.</P>
    <P>I believe that that procedure is <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution because it means that man is being put in jail without any recourse to any court of law and is being detained there without any judicial sentence being passed upon him.  I have tried to establish how this came about and how this power is claimed and used by the Revenue Commissioners.  I find that in the Finance Act of 1946, Section 27 sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) This section applies to any proceeding instituted in the High Court or the Circuit Court for the recovery of any tax or duty under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners or any fine, penalty or forfeiture incurred in connection with any such tax or duty, wherein an execution order (the form whereof is set out at No. 37 in appendix N to the rules of the Supreme Court (Ireland) 1905 and is therein described as a form of writ of <i>Levari Facias</i>) or an order similar in requirements thereto could hitherto have been issued if such proceeding had been instituted in the High Court.</P>
    <P>(2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided by or under any enactment or by any rule of court, where judgment against the defendant for any amount is given by the High Court in proceedings to which this section applies, the form of execution order to be issued for that amount shall, if the plaintiff or informant so requires, be in the form set out in the Third Schedule to this Act, and where such judgment is given in the Circuit Court, the form of execution order to be so <Col N="1120" /> issued shall, if the plaintiff or informant so requires, be in the said form with the appropriate modifications.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When you turn to the Third Schedule, you find the form of execution order in revenue cases.  It reads as follows:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE. REVENUE.</P>
    <P>To the several Sheriffs, Under-Sheriffs and County Registrars and to the Commissioner and Officers of the Garda Síochána:</P>
    <P>Whereas it has been adjudged by the High Court of Justice that John Doe is justly indebeted to the Minister for Finance for the benefit of the Central Fund in the sum of X pounds, X shillings and X pence together with the sum of X pounds, X shillings and X pence costs as appears of record in the High Court of Justice.  You the several Sheriffs, Under-Sheriffs and County Registrars are therefore hereby commanded to take in execution the goods and chattels of the said John Doe to satisfy the said sums for debt and costs.</P>
    <P>And in the event of the goods or chattels of the said John Doe not being sufficient to satisfy the said debt and costs or in the event of the said John Doe having no goods or chattels which can be taken in execution to satisfy the said debt and costs as aforesaid, you, the Sheriff, Under-Sheriff or County Registrar to whom this order is handed for execution, are hereby commanded to give a certificate to that effect in one of the forms endorsed hereon and to transmit this order with such certificate signed by you endorsed hereon to the Superintendent or other proper officer of the Garda Síochána who shall act for the area or district within which you may levy execution. And you the Commissioner and Officers of the Garda Síochána are hereby commanded upon the receipt of this order by such Superintendent or other proper officer with the certificate endorsed hereon signed by the said Sheriff, Under-Sheriff or County Registrar, to take and convey the said John Doe to the nearest <Col N="1121" /> prison and there deliver him to the Governor of such prison there to remain and be kept by such Governor until satisfaction be made of such debt and costs, or until the expiration of the period of six months whichever shall be the shorter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now I took the trouble to find out as best I could the history of the writ of <i>levari facias.</i>  The history of it is that it originated in ancient ecclesiastical proceedings, but the furthest to which it ever went was that it provided that, if a person was unable to satisfy the demands of the Crown on foot of a decree secured against him, the sheriff of the area in which he was domiciled could take into his custody all his goods and property and hold it for the benefit of the Crown until the Crown claim was satisfied.  But there was never any provision in that writ of <i>levari facias</i> that in any circumstances the debtor could be seized and thrown into jail.  Even with the limited application of the ancient writ of <i>levari facias</i>, it was provided by the Bankruptcy Act of 1883, Section 146 (2), 46 &amp; 47 Victoria, Chapter 52, that the writ of <i>levari facias</i> was abolished in all civil proceedings.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, I began to ask myself, if this recourse had been abolished by the Bankruptcy Act of 1883, how was it preserved under our legislation?  Then I noticed that its abolition in the Bankruptcy Act related only to proceedings between citizens, but reserved the rights of the Crown. Then it struck me that, even under the prerogative of the Crown, no claim was made that you should have power to detain the person of the debtor&mdash; only his goods and his real property. I then discovered that if you went back to the Taxes Management Act of 1880, you found the root of this matter.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the House this.  I have already referred to the finance Act of 1946 and I have given the House the text of Section 27 and the relevant Schedule.  I was a member of the House in 1946 and I was astonished that a Finance Bill with that section could have passed the House without comment from me, at least.  However, anyone who looks at the Act of 1946 will realise that it was a long and complex Bill.  Yet the matter was raised; and <Col N="1122" /> the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Aiken, was asked to state the significance of this section and the Schedule. His answer was: &ldquo;It represents the correction of archaic phraseology in the existing law.&rdquo;  That is the only discussion of this section that took place in Oireachtas Éireann&mdash;&ldquo;It represents the correction of archaic phraseology in the existing law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The significance of that is that in the rules as set out by No. 37 in Appendix N to the Rules of the Supreme Court of 1905, the form of the writ of <i>levari facias</i> mentions King Edward VII.  I think that most Deputies in the House believed that this was simply another handspring of Deputy Aiken, the Minister for Finance, to shake off his lily-pure person the regal references to King Edward VII.  Certainly I do not believe anybody in Dáil Éireann had the faintest notion that we were legislating to incarcerate people in jail for their inability to pay a debt.  In fact, probably that section is not the real root of the power which the Revenue Commissioners seek to exercise and had in fact exercised on the person of the man to whom I referred at the opening of my remarks.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I determined to seek further and I found that the power traces back to the Taxes Management Act of 1880, 43 &amp; 44 Vict.  Chapter 19, Section 89.  As far as I know, that is the first reference in British law to the power of the Revenue Commissioners under modern conditions to imprison a citizen for debt.  When I sought to inquire into what discussion had taken place in connection with that, I was unable to find Hansard for that date. In any case, as Deputies will understand, members of the Irish Party then present in the British House of Commons were concerned with graver matters relative to the people of this country than the implications of the Taxes Management Act of 1880, 43 &amp; 44 Vict.</P>
    <P>I want to ask Deputies here now whether there is any Deputy on any side of the House who believes that if a decree is being got by the Revenue Commissioners against a man or woman in this country for arrears of income-tax and if the sheriff has attended with authority to seize his property and <Col N="1123" /> dispose of it and realise that property for the satisfaction of the claim, and then certifies to the county registrar that the man has nothing, has no goods, it is intended that he should be locked up in jail for six months or until such lesser time as the Revenue Commissioners' claim is satisfied.  I do not.  I believe it is wrong and I believe it is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Now, the difficulty is this.  One thinks immediately, if this is unconstitutional, why does not one go to the courts and prove it so?  The answer is that these unfortunate people, by the very nature of their circumstances, cannot get access to the courts.  Who is going to take their case?  Who is going to ask before a High Court judge for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, and then get a conditional order, which has to be argued thereafter to make the order absolute? There is open to the Revenue Commissioners not only the right but the duty to go to the Supreme Court, where protracted argument may take place.  Where is the man, who has no goods, going to find solicitor and counsel who will be prepared to embark on that protracted litigation, without fees or prospect of reward?</P>
    <P>This matter cannot be tested in the courts, because the only people who have the right to test it are persons who have no goods.  Now, I would be quite content in regard to this matter, if the Minister were prepared to say he would request the President to submit this section of the existing law, through the Council of State, to the Supreme Court for determination as to its constitutionality.  I am perfectly certain that it would not stand examination for a moment, but I think it would be much better if Oireachtas Eireann would here and now declare that they do not approve in our community of imprisonment for debt. Certainly, not imprisonment for debt without giving the debtor any right to appeal to the court, for the protection which the court is there to provide against the Executive, where oppression by the Executive threatens the individual citizen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> We are all aware that, under the existing law, if one citizen recovers a judgment against another and hands the writ to the sheriff for execution and finds the writ returned <i>nulla bona</i>, it is up to that citizen to apply to the District Court to have the debtor brought before the court and there examined as to his means; and unless the creditor can convince the court that the debtor has available means which could be properly applied to the redemption of his debt, having due regard to his family responsibilities, the district justice will make no instalment order against him.</P>
    <P>But suppose the district justice does make an instalment order, thereby declaring that he has available means to pay the debt if he wants to pay it, and directs him to make a payment once a month or once a week, or whatever the period may be, if the debtor subsequently fails to perform what the court has directed him to perform, it is not open to the creditor to hand the instalment order to the superintendent of the Garda and have the fellow-citizen removed to jail.  He must bring the man back to the court and there ask the district justice to make a committal order, on the ground that the debtor, being able to perform what the instalment order required him to do, refused to do so.  It is open to the debtor, at that stage, to say: &ldquo;Since the instalment order was made against me, my circumstances have deteriorated and I am not now in a position to perform that which by inquisition I was found to be able to do when this instalment order was made.&rdquo;  If the court so finds, the man will not be committed to jail and the instalment order will be suitably amended to meet the new circumstances in which he now stands.</P>
    <P>Now, I ask whether anybody in this House wants to preserve to the Revenue Commissioners the right to send a man to jail because he has not got the means wherewith to pay what is due.  I believe this power is infrequently used for the purpose of bringing pressure to bear on the relatives and friends of the debtor to provide for the Revenue Commissioners the money they claim.  To do that by the operation of blackmail, by incarcerating <Col N="1125" /> a father of a family in jail, is really, to my mind, an uncivilised procedure.</P>
    <P>I want this clearly understood, as I have said it frequently in this House before.  We are not in this House to point the finger of scorn at the Board of the Revenue for discharging the duty that we put upon them.  If we give them powers to be used in certain circumstances and if they use them when those circumstances occur, the fault is not with them but with us. That is why I am asking the House to delete that part of the form set out in the Third Schedule of the Act of 1946, which says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And in the event of the goods or chattels of the said John Doe not being sufficient to satisfy the said debt and costs or in the event of the said John Doe having no goods or chattels which can be taken in execution to satisfy the said debt and costs as aforesaid, you, the sheriff, under-sheriff or county registrar to whom this order is handed for execution, are hereby commanded to give a certificate to that effect in one of the forms endorsed hereon and to transmit this order with such certificate signed by you endorsed hereon to the superintendent or other proper officer of the Garda Síochána who shall act for the area or district within which you may levy execution.  And you the Commissioner and officers of the Garda Síochána are hereby commanded upon the receipt of this order by such superintendent or other proper officer with the certificate endorsed hereon signed by the said sheriff, under-sheriff or county registrar, to take and convey the said John Doe to the nearest prison and there deliver him to the governor of such prison there to remain and be kept by such governor until satisfaction be made of such debt and costs, or until the expiration of the period of six months, whichever shall be the shorter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask the House to delete those words and leave the Revenue Commissioners <i>vis-a-vis</i> any citizen of this State in the same position as that in which a creditor would stand, with the right to bring him before the District <Col N="1126" /> Court and get an instalment order against him; if it is believed that he has means, to prove the existence of those means and to get an appropriate assessment made, for a regular reasonable instalment to discharge the liability; and with the further right to the Revenue Commissioners, if the debtor fails to conform with that requirement, to bring him further before that District Court for such committal order as the district justice may think appropriate in the light of the action of the debtor on foot of the instalment order made.</P>
    <P>I cannot withhold from the House this information, that I know of a case in which this power was used before. The circumstances were those of a dentist.  Prior to the establishment of this State, it was popularly proposed to our people that it was a praiseworthy thing to withhold payment of taxes to the British Crown.  A great many people followed that advice, some from the loftiest motives, some from motives more easily understandable by the mundane mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, sometimes from a combination of both.  But there then came the establishment of the State, the establishment of our own Board of Revenue and our own Revenue Commissioners, and the injunction of this House to go and collect the income-tax due to the State.  This procedure was invoked and the sheriff attended on a man who had been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be in default in income-tax.  The trouble was that, as a result of his patriotic refusal to pay income-tax, he had lived somewhat above the true income which he ought to enjoy.  There was no money left, but he was a dentist and had his skill.  In the course of collecting the goods and property, they took his dentist's chair, they took his instruments and sold them by public auction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He found himself at the end of the proceedings bereft of the means to prosecute his profession.  In those circumstances, they returned to the charge.  They got the writ further endorsed and they lodged him in <Col N="1127" /> Mountjoy Jail.  In those days, there was abroad in this country a passionate love of freedom and for once, the Executive of this State was invoked and there was then a Minister who said to the Revenue Commissioners: &ldquo;Let us not delay in an examination of the law.  Let this man out,&rdquo; and he was let out.  Since that time, this matter, as far as he is concerned, has remained in abeyance.</P>
    <P>I think the necessity to have recourse to executive action of this kind is deplorable.  I do not think it should be possible under our law for an injustice of that kind, which necessitated recourse to the executive act of sovereign government, to arise.  I do not want to enjoy my freedom from imprisonment at the will of the Executive.  I claim for every citizen of this State the right, before any governor of any prison in this country can take his person into custody, to appear before an independent judiciary and to make the case that I have done, knowing that he has not done anything which the law prohibited or omitted to do anything which the law required him to do.</P>
    <P>Under the law as it stands to-day, there is a man in jail in this country who is guilty of no offence other than that his goods and chattels were not sufficient to satisfy the debt and the costs.  I do not see how any of us can sleep easy at night in the knowledge that there is a man in that condition in this country at the present time.  Let it be said at once lest the Minister should misunderstand my solicitude or see in what I have said any implication reflecting on his integrity, that the person in question is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, an active supporter of the Government to which the Minister belongs.  I think that is a matter of indifference.</P>
    <P>What to me is horrible is that, under our law, a father of a family is in jail because his goods and chattels were not sufficient to meet the claims of the Revenue Commissioners, that that could happen to him and that he was afforded no opportunity of going before any independent judicial person to make the case that it was no fault <Col N="1128" /> of his, or that he was prepared to discharge the debt on any terms that an independent court thought fair and equitable.  He was taken from his house without reference to any court of law, incarcerated in jail the governor of which, without any warrant from any independent judge, now holds him in accordance with our law under a dispensation&mdash;which I think exists in no other civilised country in the world except here and in Great Britain&mdash;that in the case of debts to the Crown or State the debtor can be held in prison until he pays them or for six months.</P>
    <P>There is the additional horrible aspect to the situation that it is quite possible that, when he goes to jail and abides there for six months, on the day he leaves it exactly the same thing will begin all over again in respect of another claim.  In this case there is outstanding another claim twice as big as the one on foot of which he is already in jail.  Surely nobody in Dáil Eireann wants that to go on being the law in Ireland.  If they do not, there is an easy may to amend it&mdash;to insert this amendment in the Finance Bill. If that is done this Finance Bill, bad as it is in many respects, will have the distinction of becoming a new charter of freedom for a very oppressed section of our people&mdash;the debtors who have no goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of the amendment which I should like to put to the Minister.  A person can become a debtor for income-tax and get into the situation which Deputy Dillon has described inadvertently.  I have in mind a situation such as this&mdash;that because of the complexity of the Income Tax Acts the assessments are very frequently made at a stage much later than the income accrued.  In this way, it is quite possible for a man to believe that the income he was receiving was capital income and not taxable. He could dispose of that income entirely on the basis that it was his own and that he could do with it what he wished and that no income-tax was payable in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a later stage the income would be assessed and he would become a debtor and the procedure described by <Col N="1129" /> Deputy Dillon would come into operation. That would lend weight to Deputy Dillon's argument.  In that case it is much more unfair to the person involved than if he were an ordinary debtor.  The ordinary debtor must be fairly conscious of the fact that he is incurring a debt and his case would be far worse than that of the income-tax debtor.  I mention that aspect of the matter in support of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I did not ever think when I was taking on this job as Minister for Finance, that I could be, indirectly at least, guilty of the great criminal actions that Deputy Dillon and others have outlined against the Revenue Commissioners and the collectors of taxes generally.  Deputy Dillon made a very moving speech here.  I was looking at some of the older members of the Fine Gael Party as I thought tears would come to their eyes, but, to give them their due, they had not that much hypocrisy in them.  I do not know enough about this.</P>

      <P>I do not know enough about Deputy Dillon's heartrending appeal.  There were so many big questions in the Finance Bill to be gone into in detail that it was impossible to deal in detail with every amendment put in.  This amendment which Deputy Dillon put in was entirely apart from all the other amendments to the Bill and I had not time to go into all the merits and demerits of the case made by Deputy Dillon.  Therefore I am not going to accept it as put by him.  I suppose he has been often wrong and was sometimes right.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  First of all, we have to make a distinction between the ordinary debtor and a person <Col N="1130" /> who owes money to the Revenue Commissioners. For one thing, if a man is dealing with a shop, the shop can say: &ldquo;We will give you no more goods,&rdquo; and the shop suffers no more loss.  In the same way, the E.S.B. can cut off his current and they will suffer no more loss either, but the State goes on and on and its loss accumulates. The State has no means of stopping that because if the income-tax is not paid every half-year or every year, it gets no return.  For that reason, the State is in a different position from that of an ordinary trader.  The ordinary trader does not continue to supply goods, but the State goes on supplying its services generally.  It must supply these services and, therefore, it is in a different position.</P>
      <P>As I said at the beginning, I do not know whether the present procedure is unjust or unjustifiable, whether it should be changed or abolished.  I do know this, however, that there is one thing Deputy Dillon said that is not altogether correct.  I think he said a man could be imprisoned without any recourse to the courts at all.  Of course that is wrong.  The person is taken before the court for the purpose of getting a distraint on his goods and, at the time the court gives that decision, they give a decision that if distraint is not successful, then imprisonment may follow.  That is the law and I am not saying whether the law is right or wrong.  That is the law as it stands, and Deputy Dillon is wrong in saying there is no recourse to the courts in the case of imprisonment for a defaulting income-tax payer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Revenue Commissioners use their discretion about the man to light on.  They take only the man they know has the money and will not pay it, and in practically all cases where they have adopted that procedure, the person involved does pay.  That shows that, if that penalty was not there, a man would get away without paying.  I am just stating facts; I am not giving opinions at the <Col N="1131" /> moment.  One particular case was stated to me in all detail.  It concerned a man who had a very big income in this country from foreign securities. He had as big an income as probably the sum total of all the incomes of all Deputies put together, and I am including some very wealthy men on the other side in that.  He had this very big income, but he paid no income-tax. He had no goods and he lived in a rented house.  Nothing could be done about it and it was only the threat of imprisonment that availed at all in that case.  There was no other recourse open to the Revenue Commissioners in that case.</P>
      <P>There may be at least the appearance of injustice in the case quoted by Deputy Dillon, but, even if there is, even if this were established and, on examining the case, I came to the conclusion that Deputy Dillon was right, it does not mean this amendment could be accepted.  There are cases so far as I can judge at the moment in which it might be necessary to retain the powers of imprisonment, where it is obvious that the men have money but will not pay.  It is very obvious that if a man, living a very luxurious life, were to come in to the Revenue Commissioners and say: &ldquo;Please certify as he requests and so he gets his double income-tax arrangement carried out with the British.  In such a case, the Revenue Commissioners know what his income is and what his tax should be, and still they cannot collect it.  I think Deputies will see there is a difficulty there and that a sweeping amendment such as this could not be accepted without having at least an alternative.  The question will have to get very much more consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make this point.  Sometimes the Minister wants to make little of this House.  For myself, I am nothing but I represent a constituency and I have been a Minister of this State.  If I put down an amendment, which is obviously a considered amendment, three weeks ago, and have gone to very great trouble to get it set down at the earliest possible <Col N="1132" /> moment so that the Minister's advisers would have time to consider it, then I am entitled, both in the capacity as representative of a constituency and as an ex-Minister of this State, to expect from the Minister for Finance a greater courtesy than a public declaration that, in his preoccupation with the Finance Bill, he had not time to consider every little amendment put on the Order Paper.  I think that is extremely uncivil and I think it is bad for the House.  It makes little of Parliament and it is an insult to every Deputy, never mind to those of us who have been privileged to participate in Government.  I do not believe the Minister himself was ever exposed to an affront of that kind by his predecessor, and I think it is an affront which does not become the Minister or any member of an Irish Government.</P>
      <P>I am not asking that the Revenue Commissioners should be deprived of the means of collecting income-tax from wealthy men who come in asking for assessment to be made.  I am asking only that the Revenue Commissioners be constrained to do what any other creditor has to do, that is, to apply to a court of law for an instalment order against such a man.  I am asking that they bring him before a court of law and tell the court that a judgment has been given for £1,000 against him.</P>
      <P>I am asking them to tell the court that they feel he has an income wherewith he can pay that sum that is due, and that they ask the District Court to make an instalment order prescribing the days and dates upon which he shall meet this obligation, whether it be in one sum or in a series of instalments, and, having got that order from the court, if the debtor fails to perform it, they shall come back before the court and say: &ldquo;This man has failed to perform what you considered he was fit and able to do.  Let him now tell the court why he has not done it and accept the penalty of his refusal to perform that which the court is satisfied he is well able to do.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is truly ridiculous to suggest that the Revenue Commissioners have no recourse for the recovery of taxes against a defaulting taxpayer except <Col N="1133" /> the power enshrined in Section 46 of the Finance Act of 1946 and the section of the 1888 Act to which I have referred.  Of course, the Revenue Commissioners have abundant means of collecting what is due.  The Minister says himself that he has not had time in the last three weeks to bother his head about an amendment of this kind or even to inquire from his advisers what its meaning or significance is and that though he knows there is a man in jail at this moment under the provisions of this Act, he would not bother his head to inquire into the rights and wrongs of the Act under which a man is at this moment in jail.</P>
    <P>I think that is carrying irresponsibility to lengths which I certainly have never heard paralleled in this House before and I am amazed that the Minister or any of his colleagues, on being fixed with notice that there was a man in jail, could bring himself to come into this House and say: &ldquo;I could not bother inquiring into why or wherefore he is in jail or whether the provision of the law under which he is in jail was deserving of amendment or not.&rdquo;  That is offensive and outrageous, not only to a man who, in my judgment, is the victim of cruel injustice, but offensive and outrageous to every Deputy in this House.  If the Minister has not read the amendment, other Deputies have read it and they are at least entitled to hear from the Minister responsible for Finance in this country his answer to the case I have made.  He has made no answer so far.</P>
    <P>Is he prepared to say now that if the facts are as I stated he will take some measure to implement this intention on the Report Stage of the Bill? Is he prepared to say that the man at present in jail will be let out or are we in this House to shrug our shoulders and say: &ldquo;Let him stay in jail; he is no concern of ours&rdquo;?  He is in jail.  He has no means open to him of having his constitutional right to freedom vindicated.  Does Dáil Eireann say to-day they just do not give a damn?  I am happy to think that 30 years ago they did not say that but I do not despair that they will not say it now.</P>

      <P>The Minister has <Col N="1134" /> raised the point that this amendment goes too wide and that it would operate to wipe out powers and leave nothing behind.  The Minister has been apprised of a particular case.  He has intimated that he has not examined the details of the case.  In view of the presentation of the case that has been made by Deputy Dillon, does the Minister undertake within the next 24 hours to examine the details of that case and to establish to his own satisfaction the case that the Revenue Commissioners have that this man is able to pay but is not paying?  At any rate, will he look into the details with a view to seeing that immediate relief is given to the person in this case if that relief is warranted and do that as an interim measure to having this matter discussed further on Report Stage?  It would take the edge off the type of discussion that has gone on here if the Minister would give an undertaking of that kind.</P>

      <P>I am not moving this on behalf of any individual.  I am merely pointing out to the House that this power is in use to-day.  I have no authority to speak on behalf of any individual.  I am not personally concerned on behalf of any individual but I conceive that to come before the House and to argue <i>in vacuo</i> for an amendment of the 1946 Act, if I were not in a position to say the power is being used, would be very materially to weaken the case.  I do not base the case I made on one case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is trying to be rude and provocative.  I do not propose to accept that challenge at this <Col N="1135" /> time.  I am making a case on the merits.  Is it right that people in this country should be imprisoned for debt without any right in them to have access to an independent judiciary to make the case, &ldquo;I have no means to pay the debt&rdquo;?  I believe that to be wrong.  I believe it to be unconstitutional. I believe that the constitutionality of this cannot be tested because the victims of this injustice have not the means to set the law in motion and that this injustice goes on indefinitely, simply because the victims, by their very circumstance, cannot get access to a court of law.</P>
      <P>I would be content if the Minister would say that on the constitutional issue he would initiate to the President the appropriate procedure for having the constitutionality of this proviso tested in the Supreme Court, which it is within the power of the President to do at the instance of the Council of State.</P>
      <P>Surely this House is entitled, unless we have sunk to a very low level, to hear a better discussion on an amendment of this character than to hear the Minister for Finance saying: &ldquo;In the last three weeks I had not time to inquire what the meaning of this amendment was.&rdquo;  That is a depth of degradation to which I never thought the Legislature of this country would be brought and I do not believe it true that the Minister for Finance received no advice from the advisers who surround him in respect of this amendment.  I know it is not, because my own experience teaches me that, no matter what the nature of any amendment submitted, it was never brought to my desk when I was Minister for Agriculture without an appropriate memorandum from the relevant section of the Department setting out the significance of the amendment and the departmental view upon it for acceptance or rejection by me as Minister preparatory to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an abomination that a Minister for Finance should come into the House in that attitude and state that which I cannot accept as being a true representation of the fact.  It is offensive; it is degrading to the House and, <Col N="1136" /> what to me is worse, it is a repudiation of his responsibility to see justice done to humble people who have no other means of getting justice than the power of this House to protect them from the arbitrary action of the Executive acting through a board on which duties have been placed which, in my judgment, should never have been thrust upon them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy tries to misrepresent me.  I said I had not time to go into this thing fully but I did say in the end that I had time enough to go into it to the extent of knowing that I could not accept the amendment and surely that is fair enough.  If I had any doubt about the amendment I could have gone into it more and more, but I had no doubt having gone into it, not fully, but to some extent. Of course, the officials gave me notes on it.  I read them, but I came to the conclusion without going into them fully that I could not accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave a case.  Why can the Minister not argue the case at least?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the reasons why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the Minister this case: the Revenue Commissioners have power to recover any sum due to them by the ordinary procedure available to any other creditor in the State.  They can get an instalment order against a person who defaults and subsequently a committal order if the person stubbornly refuses to pay what is due while he has the means to do it.  Is that not available to the Minister?  Is that not sufficient?  Why should the Revenue Commissioners, as distinct from every other creditor in the country, have the power to put their debtor in jail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were all taught as children in the elementary study of the Scripture, through the story recited in parable, that the cruellest injustice was when a creditor delivered his debtor no the torturer until the debt was paid.  The modern parallel of that is to take the father of a family and put him in jail, there to remain until his debt is paid. I think it is torture to the average law-abiding citizen of this State who <Col N="1137" /> has met with adversity to find himself deposited in jail, eating prison fare, living with the stigma of the prison upon him and knowing that his children are obliged to avow before their contemporaries that their father is in jail in the knowledge that the average citizen does not distinguish very acutely between the various circumstances which may bring a man to jail.</P>
    <P>Is that a matter to be laughed off as being irrelevant?  To me it is a horror. It is a continuing horror and it is in our power now to put it right as of this very day but we shrug our shoulders and pass by simply saying: &ldquo;It does <Col N="1138" /> not matter.  We have not had time to examine it.&rdquo;  It is not true for the Minister to say that this amendment in its present form would deprive the Revenue Commissioners of the power to collect the revenue due.  They would have all the power that any creditor in this State has to collect his debt. What more do they want?  Surely there is an obligation on the Minister to tell the House, why, if that remedy is sufficient for any citizen of the State, it is not sufficient for the Revenue Commissioners, or is he too proud to stoop to give that kind of explanation?</P>

      <P>Sub-section (3) makes 1969-70 the last year.  Sub-section (4) means that the new categories of mushrooms and fish may go back a year or two, if they wish, in order that they may get the concession backwards for two years.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned before, this matter has been under consideration for some time.  The banks have asked for some sort of arrangement by which they could pay cheques without having them brought in to be stamped and embossed, as they have to be at the moment.  There was a good deal of trouble in that and the Revenue Commissioners, having satisfied themselves <Col N="1141" /> that there would be no loss or evasion, have agreed to do it in this way.  The banks will no longer be asked, when this section comes into operation, to have this embossed stamp.  There will be some note on the cheques that the stamp duty has been paid to the Revenue Commissioners and they will pay it every quarter, or at the end of whatever period is decided upon.</P>

      <P>I should like to be clear on this.  I am obliged to stamp certain instruments to which I am a party. Is that not so?  It is the duty of the recipient of a payment to stamp the receipt, but I commit an offence if I accept a receipt which is not appropriately stamped.  Is that not so?</P>

If it is the duty of the bank to see that the cheque is stamped, and they have arrived at an agreement for short-circuiting the procedure, that is all right.  There is <Col N="1142" /> not a residual liability for those who draw cheques for any default on the part of the bank in performing their duty in paying the appropriate amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will this section have the peculiar result that any receipt issued by the Department of Agriculture will have to bear stamp duty, whereas receipts issued by any other Department of State will not?  Part of the revenue of the Department of Agriculture derives from the Church Temporalities Fund.  It says here:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Stamp duty shall not be chargeable on any instrument (including an instrument executed but not stamped before the passing of this Act) where the amount of such duty chargeable thereon, but for this section, would be payable solely out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As the Minister knows, the revenue of the Department of Agriculture consists of moneys provided by this House, plus an annual grant from the Church Temporalities Fund, I think.  Does that mean that every receipt issued by the Department will have to bear stamp duty?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, but does the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; not exclude a Department of State, part of whose revenue comes from a source other than the moneys provided by the Oireachtas?  Has this matter been overlooked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The question the Deputy is raising is that the Department of Agriculture has a certain income under the Church Temporalities Fund.  It is provided that the Exchequer will make good.  In some <Col N="1144" /> other Act, we have gone part of the way.  In any case, the Exchequer will make it good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is really designed to spare trouble and to avoid people having to stamp receipts unnecessarily. It would appear that the myriad receipts issued by the Department of Agriculture, which I suppose at present carry a stamp, are not to be stamped.  It is sought to put an end to the need for stamping such receipts; but if the words &ldquo;where the amount of such duty chargeable thereon...would be payable solely&rdquo; mean what I think they mean, does it mean that if a Department's revenue comes partly from moneys provided by the Oireachtas and partly from moneys provided under statute from another source, the strict interpretation of this section would not exonerate such Department from the obligation to stamp its receipts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>I have the Deputy's point now.  I thought he was referring to the income.  These receipts are stamped on credit by the Revenue Commissioners and, later on in the year, the Department of Finance has to make good out of the Contingency Fund to the Revenue Commissioners. It is a very involved procedure.  The whole amount of money involved is not very much.  I do not know how it would apply in this case.</P>

      <P>Surely the point in answer to Deputy Dillon is that unless an Act, such as the Church Temporalities Act, provided that some of the money going from that to the Department of Agriculture was subject to stamp duty, only then would Deputy Dillon's point arise.  It is not the amount for which the receipt is being given that matters.  The section says: &ldquo;Where the amount of such duty chargeable thereon...would be payable solely out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another little &ldquo;if&rdquo; in this business.  The Deputy will recollect that an essential element of the levies was that they were a temporary expedient designed to discourage consumption, until such time as the balance of payments should be restored.  That purpose was achieved in the calendar year 1957 when, for the first time for 20 years, there was a credit balance of £9,000,000 on the balance of payments.  The clear implication was that if that measure of success continued to attend our efforts, these levies would be abolished.  They are now part of the revenue of the State.  One million, seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds per annum are being used for the recurrent annual charges that will come in course of payment.  If we do not get them from this source, they must be sought from some other source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in the calendar year 1958 it looks as if the balance of payments is going to go wrong again, and we do not know what the prospects are for 1959.  Suppose they do go wrong again, what do we propose to do about them?  This section withdraws from our disposal the flexible and effective instrument of levies which we used before and which held down consumption, pending the expansion of exports.  It is no longer available to our hand because now it is part of the revenue of the State, to be used for the Supply Services and the <Col N="1147" /> Central Fund.  What can we do to check consumption, if that necessity should come upon us, as it may come if our balance of payments position continues to deteriorate?  It cost the Government, of which I was a member, pretty dearly in terms of politics to restore the balance of payments, but we did it.  How do our successors propose to do it, if confronted with the same problem?  This section in fact operates to increase taxation by £1,750,000.</P>
    <P>There is one specific matter on this section which I want to raise.  When the appropriate measures were taken to change the levies into permanent taxes a good deal of excitement was created and a good deal of publicity was bespoken by the announcement that one levy would be abolished or would be excluded from the provisions of Section 57, on the ground that the public health demanded it.  The Fianna Fáil Party, from which the Government is at present constituted, declared itself as distressed at heart and soul at the cruel imposition of a levy on oranges and that, therefore, when they brought the levies to account as revenue, they proposed to exclude oranges.  We were all awaiting for the dramatic fall in the prices of oranges that would follow on that decision.</P>
    <P>Has anyone seen any change in the price of oranges?  Oranges were 7d. apiece before the levy came off and are 7d., 8d. and 9d. now, and the only difference I can find is that, whereas the Exchequer collected heretofore, those who deal in oranges at the point of import are collecting now.  Is that a satisfactory situation?  Has the Minister evinced any interest in what is becoming of the yields that used to be forthcoming from the levy on oranges which we had been scrupulous not to impose as a permanent tax?</P>
    <P>It seems that if a commodity of that kind is expressly excluded from a section of this character, with a view to making the commodity more readily available to the poorer sections of the community, somebody should interest himself in the fact that, although the revenue no longer inures to the credit <Col N="1148" /> of the Exchequer, it is inuring to somebody else's credit.  We should find out who the somebody else is and how it is that he is able to collar the lot.  Is there a monopoly in the import of oranges, or how is it that the ordinary law of competition in trade does not bring the price of oranges down?  Why is it the price of oranges has not come down?  Is it the Minister's intention to inquire into that question and find out why the benefit it was intended to confer has in fact never reached those for whom it was intended?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay unnecessarily but I think I should reply to a point which the Deputy raised.  I congratulated the Minister at Budget time on not raising the level of taxation and Deputy Dillon cannot adduce Section 57 as a reason for withdrawing that congratulation. Section 57 does one simple thing.  It states that after 31st March, 1958, receipts from import levies will not go into the Capital Fund which was there before.  That has no bearing whatever on the amount of taxation that is to be raised or the level of taxation, or the amount to be raised under Special Import Levies.  It merely means that instead of taking the same amount and putting it into a special capital fund, we will now use it for revenue purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the special import levies were brought in, their purpose from the economic point of view was twofold. First of all, they acted as a discouragement on imports and consumption generally, but in addition to that, they were a classic deflationary device for taking money from current revenue and putting it into capital account.  It is only the latter aspect of them that is changed by Section 57.  They are, in fact, current revenue and it is perfectly legitimate to use them for current expenditure, but, because the Minister for Finance at the time decided he would not do that, he pressed the deflationary aspect further and instead of using them for current expenditure, used them for capital.  Section 57 changes that back to the normal situation where we have ordinary revenue being used for ordinary current <Col N="1149" /> expenditure.  Certainly, it has no bearing whatever on the amount of money raised by them or on the level of taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if I say a word here, it may help the Deputy if he is putting in this amendment or amendment No. 74 on the Report Stage.  I want to warn the Deputy that the effect of the amendment as put down would be that we could hold securities in the United States and Canada, but we could not hold cash.  That would create an impossible position, because, if we have securities in dollars, whether Canadian or American, we will receive dividends and we shall have to deal with those by cashing them for the time being and putting them on deposit somewhere.  I think the amendments are impracticable. We must have a certain amount of external assets in reserve because the Post Office Savings Bank is a very big fund, something like £90,000,000. Theoretically, it can all be drawn out at any time and for that reason we must have a fair external reserve.  No Deputy will say there is any good reason why it should all be in sterling. There is no reason why part of it should not be in securities in the United States or Canada.</P>
      <P>Another point is that the foreign exchange account is being closed.  I think that was an emergency measure and that in fact it is closed now since 30th June because the emergency legislation has gone.  It was necessary, as we had some dollars there, to transfer them somewhere and we thought the most convenient place was the Post Office.  I am just making these points in case the Deputy might propose to reintroduce the amendments on Report.</P>

    <P>(i)  is not substantially greater than the annual rate of dividend on those shares in the period of three years ending on the relevant date, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  in a case where the shares in question were acquired in the ordinary course of a business of arranging public issues and placings of shares, represents a yield on the cost to the person receiving the dividend which is not substantially greater than the yield obtainable by investing in comparable shares the prices of which are quoted on stock exchanges in the State.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of clause (b) of the foregoing sub-paragraph the Special Commissioners shall have regard to all dividends paid on the shares in the respective periods, to any share-issue made in those periods to holders of the shares and, in a case under sub-clause (i) of the <Col N="1155" /> said clause (b) where the shares were not in existence three years before the relevant date, to the dividends paid on, and any share-issue made to holders of, any shares surrendered in exchange for the first-mentioned shares or in right of which the first-mentioned shares were acquired, and shall take such averages and make such adjustments as may appear to them to be required for a fair comparison.</P>
    <P>3.  (1)  The part of the profits of the company arising in the period beginning on the relevant date and ending on the date on which a dividend is payable which is available for payment of the dividend shall be determined as follows.</P>
    <P>(2) There shall be deducted from the said profits such amount, whether fixed or proportionate to the amount of the profits, as in the opinion of the Special Commissioners ought justly and reasonably to be treated as set aside for payment of dividends on any other class of shares in the company, having regard to the respective rights attaching to the shares and on the assumption that the total amount available for distribution by way of net dividend on all the shares in the company over any period will be proportionately greater or less than the profits of the company arising in the period beginning on the relevant date and ending on the date on which the dividend mentioned in the foregoing sub-paragraph is payable, according as the first-mentioned period is longer or shorter than the second-mentioned period.</P>
    <P>(3) In a case where, in the period beginning on the relevant date and ending on the date on which the dividend is payable, no previous dividend became payable on the shares of the class in question, the whole of the profits of the company arising in the period, less any deduction to be made under the last foregoing sub-paragraph, shall be regarded as available for payment of the dividend.</P>
    <P>(4) If any previous dividend became payable in the said period on <Col N="1156" /> the same shares, there shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing paragraphs the extent, if any, to which that previous dividend is to be regarded as paid out of profits accumulated before the relevant date, and the profits of the company arising in the said period, less any deduction to be made as aforesaid, shall be regarded as primarily available for payment of the net amount of that previous dividend so far as it is not regarded as paid out of profits accumulated before the relevant date and only such balance, if any, as remains shall be regarded as available for payment of the later dividend.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where under sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph it falls to the Special Commissioners to determine what should be set aside for payment of dividends on shares of any class, and dividends on shares of that class have been treated under this Schedule as paid to any extent out of profits accumulated before the relevant date, the Special Commissioners may take that fact into account and reduce the amount to be set aside accordingly.</P>
    <P>4.  (1)  For the purposes of this Schedule, the profits of a company arising in a given period shall be determined as follows.</P>
    <P>(2) The said profits shall be the income of the company for the period diminished by&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the income-tax actually borne by the company for any year of assessment in the said period (including any surtax borne by the company under Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1922, and the First Schedule to that Act), and</P>
    <P>(b) the corporation profits tax payable by the company for any accounting period in the said period;</P>
    <P>Provided that where relief has been afforded to the company under Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1950 (No. 18 of 1950), Section 14 of the Finance Act, 1955 (No. 13 of 1955) or Section 42 of this Act, references in this sub-paragraph to tax actually borne or to tax payable shall be <Col N="1157" /> construed as references to the tax which would have been borne or payable if that relief had not been given.</P>
    <P>(3)  In ascertaining for the purposes of this paragraph the amount of income-tax and corporation profits tax by which the income of the company for the period is to be diminished, any tax on the amount to be deducted under clause (d) of sub-paragraph (3) of paragraph 5 of this Schedule shall be left out of account.</P>
    <P>5. (1)  For the purposes of this Schedule the income of the company for a given period shall be determined as follows.</P>
    <P>(2) There shall be computed the aggregate amount&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  of any profits or gains arising in the period from any trade carried on by the company computed in accordance with the provisions applicable to Case I of Schedule D, and</P>
    <P>(b) of any income for any year of assessment in the period (computed in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts) other than profits or gains arising from any such trade.</P>
    <P>(3) There shall be deducted from the said aggregate amount the sum of the following amounts, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) any loss sustained by the company in the period in any such trade (computed in the same manner as profits or gains under the provisions applicable to Case I of Schedule D),</P>
    <P>(b) any allowances in respect of any such trade under Rule 6 of the Rules applicable to Cases I and II of Schedule D, sub-section (3) of Section 5 or Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1946 (No. 15 of 1946), Part V of the Finance Act, 1956 (No. 22 of 1956), Part. IV of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956 (No. 47 of 1956), or Part V of the Finance Act, 1957 (No. 20 of 1957), for any year of assessment in the period,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> (c) any payments made, by the company in any year of assessment in the period to which Rule 19 or Rule 21 of the General Rules applies, other than payments which are deductible in computing the profits or gains or losses of a trade carried on by it, and</P>
    <P>(d) if the company is not engaged in carrying on such a trade as is mentioned in sub-section (1) of Section 49 of this Act and has received in a year of assessment in the period a dividend which, if the company had been engaged in such a trade, would have been required by the said sub-section (1) to be brought into account to any extent as mentioned therein, such amount as would, after deduction of income-tax at the rate authorised to be deducted by Rule 20 of the General Rules, be equal to the amount which would have been so required to be brought into account,</P>
    <P>and the balance shall be the income of the company for the period.</P>
    <P>6.  Any reference in paragraph 4 or 5 of this Schedule to an amount for a year of assessment in the period in question shall be taken as a reference to the full amount for any year of assessment falling wholly within the period and a proportionate part of the amount (on a time basis) for any year of assessment falling partly within that period, and the reference therein to corporation profits tax payable for any accounting period in the said period shall be construed in a corresponding manner.</P>
    <P>The new Schedule deals in detail with the dividends payable which would come under the new sections put in, Sections 48, 49 and 50, under this dividends stripping arrangement.  This gives a very detailed account of the dividends that would be regarded as paid out of profits accumulated before a given date.  Naturally, it will make a difference whether a dividend is paid before acquisition or afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, Sir, I assured the Minister of the full co-operation of the vocational educational committee in his starting the nautical school in Galway and I raised the question of short-circuiting that course by taking on already qualified men who have their tickets with the merchant navy.  I know of many fully qualified men who are prepared to come back and settle down with their families and pull their weight in fishing off the west coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am reluctantly compelled to refer to the abandoned fish freezing plant at Galway.  I can say that &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; is the word because that plant was opened on the 1st February and the Minister made some flowery speeches there.  I have copies of some of those speeches from the local paper of that date.  He held out great hope for the future of the fishing industry in the West.  That plant has now been abandoned and I repeat that &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; is the word.  As I said, the <Col N="1160" /> Minister made some flowery speeches and referred to the freezing of fish and the freezing of vegetables so that we did not know what industry he was giving us.</P>
    <P>The building is most impressive.  It should be, because it cost £62,000.  At the moment that plant is surrounded by weeds three feet in height.  I saw them only the other night.  The plant is the laughing stock of the whole country and it is recognised as a white elephant.  It need not be a laughing stock because it could be, and should be, brought into full production when it would be an asset to the West.  I have already said that the Minister has fallen down on this matter.  He did not like being told that, but I repeat it.  It is not speeches we want from the Minister but a little bit of action.  I should like to know his intentions with regard to putting this plant into immediate production.</P>
    <P>The action of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara has resulted in killing fishing in the West.  The Minister has said that he would like us to co-operate with him in encouraging the landings of fish so as to get this plant working, but the first action taken by his Department was to reduce the price of pollock from 6/- to 4/- per stone.  How does the Minister expect that fish freezing plant to be brought into production if he is not prepared to pay a proper price for fish?  Does he think that the fishermen are born fools, that they will hand the fish over to him when they can get double the price for it from the merchants in Dublin?  &ldquo;Let the Minister pay the price and the plant will be put into immediate production.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to some of the fishermen the other night and they told me that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is trying to put the onus on the fishermen to land the fish and to keep the plant going.  The answer of the fishermen given to me is: &ldquo;Let the Minister give the lead.  Let him bring the three German trawlers to Galway and let them prove their worth by landing the fish.  Let him berth them at Galway and let them fish from Galway.  Let the Minister show the fishermen how to do their own business if he is able to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> I should also like to know why An Bord Iascaigh Mhara has not made an offer for whiting to the fishermen.  The Minister should give a guarantee that, during periods of glut, the plant at Galway will accept herring and mackerel from the Claddagh fishermen. It is a terrible thing to see them having to dump the fish back into the sea.  Such a guarantee would mean a lot to these men.  While as I have stated, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have reduced the price of fish they have, over the years, increased the price of gear and surely this is not very encouraging to fishermen.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what steps the Minister is taking to develop the escallop industry.  Why cannot he seek a market for them?  The French market for lobster and other shellfish is very uncertain.  Is the Minister prepared to leave that also to Gael Linn who have already done so much?  We have in Clarenbridge some of the best oyster beds in the world and I should like the Department to interest itself in the oyster beds there.  Three years ago An Bord Iascaigh Mhara dumped 10,000 oysters in those beds and since then they seem to have forgotten all about them.  They seem to show very little interest in them.  I should like the Minister to take steps to protect these beds and show greater interest in their further development.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned inland fisheries and paid tribute to the good catches on Lough Corrib.  We are justly proud of Lough Corrib as a fishing centre and voluntary effort by angling associations, both at Corrib and other places, is to be highly commended. I am glad to note the laudatory remarks of the Minister in regard to the wonderful fishing on Lough Corrib and, in that connection, I should like to refer to a matter which I raised last year, the connection of Lough Corrib with Lough Mask through the abandoned canal.  I understand there has been a survey of that project to see what the possibilities are, and I should like the Minister to let us know the results of it. If this project were carried out, we would have the greatest fishing grounds in the world and they would pay greater dividends to the tourist catering communities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> I agree with the Minister when he says it is essential to develop our fishing harbours.  I know it is not the responsibility of the Minister to do it, but I feel it is the responsibility of the Minister to press that these harbours be developed.  I should like to know the contents of the report on Kilronan Pier.  At times, quite a number of fishing boats are berthed there and I can foresee, at certain stages of the wind during rough weather, that these boats will be smashed to pieces, unless the proposed extension is made to the pier.  I know it is not the Minister's responsibility, but I should like to have attention paid to the problem.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see better and greater berthage provided at Galway docks, to see certain sections allotted to trawlers, and I would like the Minister to examine what arrangements can be made.  The Department should make provision for a proper maintenance, repair and supply service for boats.  Sometimes trawlers are tied up for two or three months and that is a terrible thing to see.  Some arrangement should be made whereby they could be repaired more speedily.  It is an important matter for our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I understand that some boats built by and for An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are not suitable for the carrying of ice. The Department should inquire into this question.  I understand the bulkheads are not airtight.  I do not want to go into the technical points, but I have been told they are not suitable for the carrying of ice which is an important thing in the handling of fish to ensure that they will reach markets in a good state.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of protection for our fishing fleet within the three-miles limit.  With other Deputies, I hold that the limit should be extended to 12 miles.  Every day we hear of the three-miles limit rule being flouted by foreigners, and if our corvette comes around, a tip-off is given, and the corvette suffers from that disadvantage. It has been suggested here, and I think it is a good suggestion, that the Department of Defence should be asked to put an armed party on board some of these trawlers.  If that were <Col N="1163" /> done, there would soon be respect for our three-miles limit, a respect that has not been given to it heretofore. At times, our fishermen's nets have been torn to pieces by foreign trawlers and, in addition to that, they come in with a very fine 32-row mesh and gut our areas of fish.  Because of that, it is no wonder our fishing has gone down over the years.  Our fishing grounds have been swept clean by foreigners. We say that if it pays the foreigner to come here, surely it should pay the Irish to go out a few miles and catch fish, but they will have to go out further.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to let us know what his views are on the fish-freezing plant at Galway.  It has caused a lot of ridicule and I do not like to see it being left there in its present condition.  It is not for the sake of ridiculing the Minister that I raise this matter.  There are quite a large number of men unemployed in our city and I recall that, on the day the plant was opened by the Minister, there were ten or 12 men present in white coats.  They impressed me.  These men had been brought from the exchange for show purposes, but I think if we have less show and more action, fishing might be put on a proper footing. I look forward to a full explanation from the Minister of his intentions. Fish are being landed there which could keep that plant operating, but the fishermen will not hand their catches over to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for half the price they get elsewhere. Let the board pay a proper price and that plant will be put working right away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I may preface my remarks on fishing by stating that I have no particular knowledge and no particular skill in the industry beyond the fact that I come from an area in which fishing is an industry, that I associate with people who fish and that I have a small knowledge of seafaring conditions from my youth.  I read with great pleasure the report of the Minister on fishing in the year under review.  I have been pleased to note that, in all branches of the fishing industry, progress has been <Col N="1164" /> made, and I have no intention of entering into any controversy initiated here as to who was responsible for that progress, whether it was the previous Minister, the present Minister or any Minister in the past.  It is sufficient for me that we are making progress and it is good that the Minister can make such a report.  I congratulate him on the fact that he is able to do that and I do not raise the question of how or by whom the progress was achieved.</P>
      <P>I agree in the main with the majority of the Minister's conclusions and with his suggestions as to what should be done for the future.  I have read his report with very deep interest, and, in particular, I agree with his suggestions about the size of what he calls the middle-water boat, the 75-foot boat. The smaller boats on which we concentrated to a great extent in the past are not desirable in present circumstances.  They are not profit-making. Boats of 75 feet are needed. That is the general view of fishermen, particularly in the Waterford area.</P>
      <P>On the question of the examination of the habits and movements of fish, a great deal more is required in that direction.  Some time ago I read a report published by the Department of Local Government before 1900.  Included in that report was a large section devoted to fisheries, the movement of fish around the coast, the trend of exports and imports and the various other aspects of fishing.  I can find no contemporary publication that in any way corresponds to the extensive study of fishing as an industry that was given in that report.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the Minister is dealing with fishing as an important industry which could come quite close to agriculture in importance.  Fishing has been treated as the Cinderella for far too long.  The transfer of Fisheries to the Department of Lands is an improvement.  I wonder whether or not Fisheries deserves a separate Minister but probably that matter is not to be talked about.  I am delighted at the Minister's proposal for research both afloat and ashore.  That is of the utmost importance.  Until the question is tackled in that way the progress so urgently needed will not be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1165" /> In dealing with the question of the scarcity of trained men, the Minister struck a note that appealed to me. Less than a year ago, in Waterford, the problem arose of getting a trained skipper capable of handling a boat fitted with modern equipment.  While there were excellent fishermen available, we did not have the type of skipper necessary for that type of boat.  Eventually a man was appointed who, after a course of training, was able to take over the boat.  That boat is now in service.  There is urgent need to attract young boys to sea fishing. The Minister suggests that they should be offered good pay, hard work, and an element of danger.  That will appeal to young boys.  Irish boys are willing to accept those conditions.  The work is hard.  There is an element of danger and if the good pay is assured, young boys will be attracted to the industry and progress can be made.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that there could be an extension of the training school to the south coast.  It is all right to have a school in Galway and to attract boys from other areas to that school, to pay their way there and to give them every inducement.  A beginning must be made somewhere.  Possibly Galway was the best choice.  I would suggest that a school situated adjacent to the maritime counties of Munster would be more attractive to Munster boys.  It could be run in conjunction with vocational schools.  Such a school would be more attractive to boys from Munster, even if it were on a smaller scale than the school in Galway and catered for a limited class.</P>
    <P>The Minister's suggestion that there should be propaganda to encourage young people to enter the fishing industry is a good suggestion.  Every member of the House could be very usefully engaged in that propaganda.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the Minister's statement on the matter of political influence.  I welcome it.  It is most desirable that such a statement should be made.  I heard Deputy Palmer's very definite statement on the matter of political influence.  I could not say of my own knowledge that there were instances where political influence was exerted, but I could <Col N="1166" /> understand Deputy Palmer's remarks because of the fact that, in the County Waterford area, rightly or wrongly, it is taken for granted that you must have political influence to get a boat, so much so, that I have seen Deputies in deputations at ministerial, Parliamentary Secretary and official level recommending people for boats when they had not the ability to judge as to their capabilities in handling a boat.  It often made me smile.  Of course, they were good Deputies, doing what their constituents asked and fulfilling the part expected of them.</P>
    <P>I do not know when it originated but the belief crept in that, unless you had political influence, there was no use applying for a boat.  I know that can be said of many positions that are under ministerial patronage and does not apply solely to the Fisheries Branch but it is there, whatever the reason may be.  The Minister would be well-advised to heed the comments of Deputy Desmond of South Cork. Deputy Desmond said that the Minister should be careful, that he should be, like Caesar's wife, above suspicion, that when he visits an area he should invite not only Deputies of his own Party, but all Deputies, if he wants us to believe his word&mdash;and I accept his word&mdash;that there is no political influences, or none intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In actual fact, I may have been acting wrongly in this but I assumed the local association would invite the people.  I would be very glad to have any Deputies present who liked to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not apply to me. It is not a matter personal to me.  The Minister came to Waterford and, I understand, invited Deputy Lynch.  I did not get an invitation, incidentally, but it did not affect me.  In order that the Minister may, like Caesar's wife, be above suspicion, all public representatives should be invited, down to a certain level.  I do not suggest that every local councillor and all such people should be invited.  I accept the Minister's assurance but I feel that, if he adopted that suggestion, it would help to make it known that, as and from now, there will be no more political <Col N="1167" /> influence in the matter of securing boats, that the only consideration will be ability to do the job well.  All Parties in the House would welcome that.  I do not say that in the past boats have been allocated otherwise but the Minister's remissness to which I have referred, if it was remissness, could give countenance to the complaints that have been made.</P>
      <P>On the question of marketing, the Minister stated that we should produce for the best market available, that is, Britain and elsewhere.  The Minister knows much more about it than I do, having facilities to learn about it. In my area, where there are only a few boats, the catch could often be trebled but the catch is limited to what the buyers indicate.  Before the boat goes out, the fishermen are told how much they must catch and not to bring in more.  I can give the Minister, in private, if he wants it, the name of the boat and can quote where the buyers have said: &ldquo;Catch no more than ten boxes of fish.  If you bring in any more than ten boxes and the box or two you want for your own use and which is not for sale, none of it will be taken from you.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is deplorable that the middleman or buyer is able to dictate to the man who goes out to sea as to how much fish he is to take irrespective of what is there to be caught or what the possibilities are.  That is a regular occurrence in Helvic, County Waterford. Although I have no knowledge of fishing I mix with fishermen in the Ballinagoul area.  They are personal friends of mine and if I speak here as one without knowledge, I speak on behalf of full-time fishermen who have the knowledge and who tell me they are being dictated to by these middlemen.  They are being put in the same position as the farming community were some time ago before they developed the cooperative movement.  If they take in extra fish even to sell locally, and which they could sell locally, they are told: &ldquo;The next time you take in fish you will get nobody to buy it at all and it will be left on your hands.&rdquo; The Minister surely has some function there.  He should be able to stop that exploitation of the fishermen because I <Col N="1168" /> feel that is what it is.  Maybe &ldquo;exploitation&rdquo; is too strong a word but I am repeating what I have been told by people who are engaged full time in fishing.</P>
    <P>I read with very great interest the Minister's views on the small fishing centres.  On the whole I agree with him.  I suppose he is quite right that considering the overheads on taking small catches, say, of lobster to the Dublin market, it must be done on a co-operative basis.  The ordinary fisherman, as I know him, is not capable of doing the job and somebody must step in to remedy that position.  When we were discussing the Transport Bill a fortnight ago, it struck me that, when the Minister was agreeing to give the farmers certain facilities for moving cattle, and so on, there were no representations made on behalf of fishermen.</P>
    <P>In the past representations were made to the Minister for Industry and Commerce from the area I repesent, Helvic, that the fishermen, by some relaxation of the trade plate, should be allowed to take their fish to Dublin, because it would not pay to charter a C.I.E. lorry to take small lots of fish. That was turned down, I suppose, because of the existing Act.  I was wondering were the fishermen's representatives as active as the farmers' when the Transport Bill was going through.  Perhaps they were, but if so they were not as successful as the farmers.</P>
    <P>The main reason for the falling off in lobster catches around the area I represent is that the transport charges to Dublin leave too small a margin of profit.  Twice or three times or maybe ten times as many lobster could be caught and sent to Dublin, but what is the point of sending it for a pittance? I am not one of those who blow hot and cold on this subject.  I was always completely in favour of having a licensed haulage service but I do feel that if an important industry is struggling to live and to develop, concessions can be granted without inroads being made on the rights of the people, in other words, that the weaker sections in any area should be helped to grow stronger to the point where they would be able to employ full time transport.  By encouraging them now <Col N="1169" /> you might be able to provide more employment later on.</P>
    <P>In relation to the home market, Deputy Palmer and other Deputies raised the question of the availability of fish for use in rural areas.  The Minister spoke about our having a very low fish consumption.  I suppose that is true and may always be true.  I do not know, but I do know that I live within only two or three miles of a very good fishing centre and on most Fridays&mdash;and I speak only of Fridays &mdash;fish is not available unless it comes from Dublin.  Surely there is something wrong there.  In Cappoquin, Dunmore, Waterford, Carrick-on-Suir, all through Tipperary and Cork there is not a bit of fish to be had unless it is obtained from casual fish carriers.  Unless people get what is called gabble, the cleanings of the boat, there is nothing on offer.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have a function there. I suggest to the Minister&mdash;I am only repeating what my colleague, Deputy Desmond, said&mdash;that there is need for some organisation, be it State or semi-State, to co-ordinate the present arrangements so that fish will be available everywhere in Ireland when it is wanted.  I would suggest that cooperative creameries are the kind of framework around which that could be carried out.  Perhaps some deep-freeze centres, so many in a county or in an area, could be established so that fish could be distributed as required under the control of some central agency in the manner in which an army commander at headquarters would direct supplies here, there and everywhere.</P>
    <P>I know that fish will be sold if it is available, but even quite close to the coast where I live fish is not available for people who want it.  I can always get fish.  All I have to do is to drive to Ring at any time and pick it up, but everybody is not in that position. Housewives cannot drive out to Ring, Helvic or anywhere else.  I know cases, which must be very galling to fishermen, where fish which the fisherman has risked his life or certainly worked hard to get, was sold at 15/- a box by him and purchased at 30/- a box by the local buyer, with the middleman making <Col N="1170" /> £1 a box without even looking at it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has quite a task before him.  The fishing industry needs a good deal of examination.  It needs a Minister who is prepared to deal with the position which has existed for a while past.  I do not pretend to have any particular knowledge on this matter. I am giving the Minister a reflection of what I might say uneducated fishermen have struggled to tell me.  I am now struggling to give a reflection of that picture to the Minister in an honest effort to have the fishing industry improved.</P>
    <P>With regard to the protection of sea fisheries, I think there is need for more boats.  I do not know much about the ten-mile limit, or whatever the limit may be.  I assume the Minister and his officials will deal with that matter better than I can.  Even the fishermen on whose behalf I speak have not presumed to advise in that connection. However, from my own knowledge, I would say there is need for protection.</P>
    <P>The Minister might be well advised, at Cabinet meetings and elsewhere, to press for the use of helicopters by the Army, instead of jet planes, for use as spotters and scouts.  If he could succeed in getting the Department of Defence, or whatever Department may be involved, to provide more boats we might clear the area within which we have fishing rights and reserve it exclusively for our fishermen.  I am glad the Minister is giving fishing the attention it deserves and which I feel it has not received up to the present. I wish him well in his task.  I hope he will succeed in making fishing a big industry because I believe the potential is there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a contribution to this important debate and to start off by referring to deep-sea angling.  In recent months, the Minister has succeeded in giving encouragement to this relatively new form of activity in so far as he has been able to bring about the establishment of quite a number of deep-sea angling clubs at appropriate points of our sea fisheries.  At the moment, those clubs are very anxious to do all that is expected of them but they are <Col N="1171" /> lacking somewhat in facilities.  It is necessary for the members of those clubs, in the course of their fishing activities, to engage boats that are at present being used by local fishermen on hire-purchase terms from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The question of insurance presents a very big problem.</P>
      <P>The boats, when used on operations of the type to which I have referred, have to be specially insured.  The ordinary insurance coverage does not indemnify An Bord Iascaigh Mhara or the renters while the boats are being used on such occasions.  I have been told by one club in particular and also by members of another club that they are involved in considerable expense in obtaining the necessary coverage for the boats when engaged.  I was hoping the Minister might be able to bring about a situation whereby the existing insurance coverage could be extended, on payment of a small premium, to cover the extra risk involved in this connection.</P>
      <P>Those clubs that have been set up in recent months are very enthusiastic and will give very great co-operation to the Minister to popularise deep-sea fishing.  It should not be beyond the Minister's power to come to their assistance in the manner I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>At the moment, the Minister is inclined to lay pretty strong emphasis on deep-sea fishing and mid-sea fishing, if we may use the term.  In his opening statement the Minister also referred to inshore fishing and the activity that arises in that connection. I think he indicated that, if people engaged in inshore fishing were prepared to remain at work for longer periods during the day, the percentage of catches would be considerably increased, thus reducing the overheads and adding a nice margin to the net profits of the people participating in the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been told that in the Dingle area, part of my constituency, the people who have charge of the hire-purchase boats, and even those who have boats of their own&mdash;if there are any of that kind; I do not <Col N="1172" /> know&mdash;go out at five o'clock in the morning and remain out until eight o'clock in the evening.  I have personal knowledge that that statement is correct. The Minister will have to admit that if people, in the main, are prepared to fish for such a lengthy period on any day, and particularly over the week, they are making the effort necessary to obtain the greatest reward for their labours.  Even if the catches are satisfactory, there is difficulty.  Up to the present, they find that for the first four days of the week they are able to dispose of their catches through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara but, for the remaining two days of the week, the fish have to be sold under a different arrangement.  I find it hard to understand why that should be so.</P>
      <P>I am advised, on the authority of quite a number of fishing people in Dingle and the adjoining fishing centres, that they have no reliable market for fish on Thursdays, Fridays and even Saturdays.  In other words, the board is not in a position to take the fish from them at the guaranteed price at which it is taken in the early part of the week.  There is very little use in fishermen spending longer hours in endeavouring to catch more fish if there is not some sort of steady market to dispose of the catches the whole week round.</P>
      <P>With regard to the investigations to which the Minister referred&mdash;and which, I think, were dealt with on the debate last year&mdash;in relation to exploring certain fishery areas that had not, more or less, been fully utilised within recent years, I have been told that the local fishermen are anxious to carry out that experiment as they believe they can carry it through fairly successfully. A question arises as to the initial expense involved.  Extra gear has to be obtained.  There is also the point that the damage likely to occur to that gear in the course of such exploratory work is rather severe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister could offer some incentive to private interests, of the kind to which I have referred, by way of compensating them, to a reasonable extent, for the destruction of gear which will occur during the course of any special investigation work of the kind that will have to be undertaken. <Col N="1173" /> One fisherman told me that he made a survey of part of the fishing waters off Baile na nGall and after some days he found considerable damage had been done to his nets, due to the fact that they had come into contact with rocks, and in one instance with wreckage, which destroyed the net altogether. There is something there which the Minister might take up and examine. Those local people are familiar with the particular area being explored. They are anxious to go into new grounds and to develop their potentialities, and if possible they should be assisted in some way.  I am quite sure that at least they could obtain a considerable portion of the information that the Minister seeks through this special scheme for investigating the potentialities of certain waters.</P>
    <P>There is a question regarding the existing arrangements of hire purchase with which I should like to deal.  I have gained some knowledge of this over the past six months because of representations made to me.  Even though there are times when An Bord Iascaigh Mhara might have very good grounds for tightening up, nevertheless the hire-purchase terms are rather severe. Formerly gear could be obtained by a down payment of approximately 25 per cent. and the balance was liquidated by the board getting two and a half shares per catch.</P>
    <P>The board have tightened up now, so far as that is concerned, and the applicant now is obliged to have a clear account before he can enter into a new transaction.  When he does propose to enter into a new transaction the initial deposit, I understand, has been raised from 25 per cent. to 33? per cent. and the method of paying the outstanding balance has been increased from two and a half shares to three and a half shares per catch.</P>
    <P>I have gone into the whole question with the fishermen in great detail and unless catches are very satisfactory I am satisfied that hardship can be caused in quite a number of cases by the operation of the present system. The trouble is that the system is cut and dried and once the hirer has entered into the transaction he has no alternative but to allow the deduction <Col N="1174" /> to be made.  The previous system, in my opinion, might have been a bit more liberal than what the board could possibly afford, but I should like the Minister to examine the question in the hope that he might find it possible to relax the present arrangement in some way.</P>
    <P>The question of the erection of a deep-freeze plant at Dingle has been broached here on many occasions over a long period.  I believe that, in the early stages, there was some difficulty in settling the contract for that project because of legal title to the lands which were required for the site.  I understand that the question of title has been settled satisfactorily for several months past but, nevertheless, the contract has not yet been advertised. I have raised the matter here by way of question and I had hoped that by now a start would have been made. I regret to say that there does not seem to be any definite progress yet, so far as we can see.</P>
    <P>The people in the area have been looking forward for a long time to the setting up of this very important plant, because it is so necessary to the general success of the fishing industry in the locality.  At present many types of fish, which could be processed successfully in a plant locally, have, I understand, to go to Galway.  The result is that the local market is erratic and the charges for transport, and other handling charges, tend to reduce the prices paid to an uneconomic figure.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to do something about this project without undue delay, and arrange for the contract to be advertised and put in hands.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred very fully to the matter of inland fisheries.  There is not much that I have to say in that connection because we had an opportunity of discussing it recently on the Fisheries Bill.  I looked, however, with interest at the Minister's statement regarding the conservancy fund which is being set up and on which there is still a good deal of confusion among fishermen who are directly involved and contributing to this particular source of revenue.  I do not know whether the Minister made it clear in his concluding address on the Fisheries <Col N="1175" /> Bill that this fund will be isolated from the ordinary finances of the Department of Finance and that, in fact, the full amount that will be collected from the levy will go back into that fund, solely for the purposes for which it is intended.  It would be very helpful if the Minister could repeat that assurance because fishermen in inland waters, who are contributing to this fund, are rather doubtful about the general application of the fund.  What we want is to develop a rather high sense of civic spirit among inland fishermen because if that is not forthcoming no amount of money spent on protection will bring about the desired results.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage now when our fishermen should appreciate that they are being asked to co-operate with the Department in protecting a very valuable asset.  It is an asset of great importance from the fisherman's point of view, because it is his livelihood and he should be expected to protect that livelihood in the same manner as he would protect his job on the farm or in the factory.  Nevertheless, there is a certain amount of loose thinking among many fishermen as to the degree of co-operation that they should give to the local board of conservators in the matter of protection.  What is required is some sort of national campaign under the auspices of boards of conservators and under the Inland Fisheries Trust and kindered organisations, to try to educate fishermen as to the practicability of it in the first instance, and in the second instance, the moral obligation which devolves upon them to protect their own property.</P>
    <P>It is rather unfortunate that such a large amount of money has to be spent by the various boards of conservators in paying protection guards.  Notwithstanding that expenditure, we still find evidence of illegal fishing on many rivers.  In some cases the poaching is serious; in others, not so serious but I am glad to say that my experience in my own area shows it is on the wane.  We should, however, not be satisfied until we can say that poaching has almost completely disappeared. Until then we will not be <Col N="1176" /> in a healthy position in regard to our inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>In some of his recent speeches the Minister dealt with this matter very positively and objectively.  He should avail of similar opportunities in the future to repeat what he has said.  If he does so, I think he will eventually succeed in stamping out this practice. It would be too much to expect a 100 per cent. success but public representatives, both local representatives and Deputies, could co-operate by condemning this practice and making it plain to anybody who contemplates engaging in it that they can expect no sympathy if they are involved in a prosecution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke at great length on this debate last year.  I am pleased that the Minister paid a little attention to what I said and went down to West Cork to verify for himself the matter to which I had referred.  As a result of his visit to Bantry and Castletownberehaven, he had an opportunity of seeing for himself the great opportunities there awaiting development. You have the finest harbours in the world there and the fishing grounds are very convenient to those harbours. They are the best fishing grounds in the world.  The fishing industry has been very neglected over the past 40 years.  Since the end of the 1914-18 war, very little attention was paid to development.  The result has been that to-day the men who should be experienced fishermen are no longer with us.  The majority of them have gone to other jobs where they have more security and are sure of their weekly wage.  They have gone to work in merchant shipping or have emigrated to foreign countries to seek a better life.</P>
      <P>I need only quote what the Minister himself said in his statement last week. He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It would be a great pity if, through lack of interest on the part of our own people, we were forced to employ foreign fishermen to develop our fishing industry.  But I must make it clear beyond all doubt that the supply of skippers to fishermen trained to fish in middle waters is an absolute prerequisite to develment. <Col N="1177" /> For that reason, I consider that if we cannot get Irish fishermen, we should employ others to begin with, now that we know markets are available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I certainly do not blame the Minister for the present state of affairs.  It is the result of years of neglect.  The Minister has a big task before him to try and revive the interest that existed in this wonderful industry in the early 'twenties.  It was looked upon as second to agriculture, but, like agriculture, it was sadly neglected.  The result has been that we now have a depopulated coastline with a scarcity of fishermen.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Minister's visit to Bantry and Castletownberehaven the people of the area are looking forward with great hope.  We have a very fine port at Baltimore.  Adjacent to it is the fishing yard of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, which was taken over some years ago during, I think, the term of office of Deputy Dillon.  It was part of the Baltimore fishing school.  It was a pity that when the boatyard was taken over the fishing school was not taken over as well.  That school was built about 80 years ago for the training of young fishermen.  When the fishing industry fell on bad times and the interest was no longer there, the men did not go into the school for training, just as the Minister finds it hard to get them now.  The school was converted into a school for training other boys.  It had also been used for making fishing nets.  It supplied the requirements of boats all over the country and of countries outside Ireland. I know that because I was speaking to the manager and he told me it supplied nets not alone in this country but in other countries also.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister has gone to Castletownberehaven and Bantry it is only right that he should complete his tour and pay a visit to Skibbereen and Baltimore.  He should see the Baltimore boatyard and the fishery school and the great scope for development there.  I have no doubt that if interest is shown in the development of that area, in a short time there will be no lack of fishermen who will be quite capable of putting to sea with very <Col N="1178" /> little training.  It is absolutely necessary to get a lead from the top.</P>
    <P>I have heard the complaints of the fishermen.  I have listened to them with the greatest sympathy when they told me about the herring or mackerel which they sold for 1½d. or 2d. apiece down in Baltimore and which were retailed in Dublin for 1/- each.  Yes, the cost of transport made the fish very dear, but with the development of the ice plants which are springing up all around the south and west coasts, there should be greater security, a lessening of the cost and a hope of a continuous and regular supply of fresh fish at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>In the urban towns of the country and in the small towns around the coast, it is impossible to get fresh fish any day of the week.  The moment it is landed on the pier, it is put into boxes and transferred either to Cork or Dublin.  Then, if a person wants it, he must have an order placed in advance and it is railed back again to the very town from which it came.  That was the position in the past.  It put fish at a prohibitive price for the vast majority of the people.  I remember the day when it was quite easy to get fresh fish, but the more commercialised it became, the harder it became to get it.</P>
    <P>There is a wide open door to be pushed now for An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  If they wish to develop the fishery trade in the towns, it can easily be done now, with the development of the ice plants there.  The towns should be looked after.  It will take some little organisation, but we have sufficient brains in the country to see that there is a supply of fish for the hotels and for those who want it, at least on a few days of the week.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Swedish engineer will soon issue his findings on the harbours of the country which are most suitable for fishery development. I sincerely hope that the harbours in West Cork will get careful consideration, as they are excellent and safe for boats.</P>
    <P>I should not like to see the Minister importing too many fishermen from abroad, for a start.  We are always inclined to look at the foreigner as being a wee bit better than ourselves.  We <Col N="1179" /> send our agricultural advisers to Denmark, Holland and other countries, and, on their return, they say we are away ahead of those peoples ourselves. Our fishermen and our farmers, if given a break and a fair bit of encouragement, are as good as those anywhere else.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that when the Minister goes down to Baltimore, he will see fit to take over that school for the training of young boys for the south and west coast, from Cork and Waterford and Kerry, so as to have a sufficient number of them to man the fleet of boats which I hope will be built in the boatyard in Baltimore.</P>
    <P>I see a great future for the fishing industry and I believe that, with the energy and ability of our Minister, in years to come, it will hold the place it should hold in the economy of this country.  With our miles of coastline, this industry could be developed into one of the greatest fishing industries in the world.</P>
    <P>I come now to our lakes and our rivers.  There is a big leeway to be made up in the stocking of them.  We have several in West Cork and, to my knowledge, nothing whatever was ever done to develop the fishing on the lakes and rivers of West Cork.  It is a great tourist centre and tourists come to my area in large numbers.  I was speaking last week to an angler who fishes regularly on the River Ilen, which flows beside the town of Skibbereen where I live.  When they applied for help in the stocking of that river in this great tourist centre, they got no help whatsoever.  The lakes and rivers, if properly stocked with salmon and trout, would certainly be a great medium for the development of the tourist industry in West Cork. The tourist industry is flourishing there, but another little pep on that line would help it very much.</P>
    <P>If the Minister decides to come to West Cork, to Skibbereen and Baltimore, I can assure him of my fullest co-operation.  It will not be like the case of Deputy Kyne in Waterford, who was there by accident.  I shall be only too delighted to meet the Minister and will make sure that my colleagues, <Col N="1180" /> Deputy Cotter and Deputy Murphy, will be there also to lend a hand in the development of the fishery industry in West Cork and in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy from an inland county, I do not know much about the fishing industry.  However, I have been 20 years here and have heard much talk about its revival, so that it might become a great industry, but I have almost given up hope.  The present Minister is a man of drive and ability and, if given the finance, he will make a good job of it.</P>
      <P>We have too much talk and too little action.  I do not like spoonfeeding. Everybody nowadays wants something for nothing; they want money poured into everything.  The fishermen could look after themselves, if we gave up the talk about cheap money and cheap boats.  If we give them a market here and abroad, they will get on with the job; they will co-operate and put up most of the money themselves.  I do not believe in the crawling way, expecting to be spoonfed, morning, noon and night.  Thirty or 40 years ago, the fishermen were not spoonfed and it was a splendid industry.  Why is there so much crying and craving to-day?</P>
      <P>If the fishermen are properly organised on a working basis, they can build up the industry themselves. We nearly killed Gaelic with doles and subsidies, whereas if there were a proper spirit and if the people were asked to revive the good things, for the good of the country, without expecting to be paid for it, we would be better off.  A certain amount may be needed for the purchase of big boats, but a good deal can be done by the fishermen themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to concentrate on the development of the home market.  It is enormous and is not catered for in the least.  In the Midlands, one cannot get fish of any type or quality from Sunday to Sunday, without going a long distance; and even then, it is of doubtful quality.  I would like to see proper development of the home market, so that there would be a depot in every large and small town, with deep-freeze centres all over the country and a distribution <Col N="1181" /> centre whereby the fish could be got out to the people.</P>
    <P>Not alone would the people in the Midlands eat fish on Friday, but they would eat it two or three times a week, if they could get it.  All they do get is what is brought from Dublin or other centres by hawkers, and this is usually second or third-grade fish carried in a dirty van and sold by a man with no coat and of dirty, greasy and ugly appearance.  Frequently, these people come with good fish and one buys it and is satisfied, but they come the next time with very doubtful fish; or again they come with fish you cannot eat at all and which, an hour after you buy it, has a strong stench.  People get tired of it and turn against fish.  Until there are proper distribution arrangements, deep-freeze depots and so on, this situation will not be remedied.</P>
    <P>I believe the fishermen could get plenty of fish, if they wished.  They will not seek fish for which they have no market and when they know they may have to dump their catches.  This is something that the Minister could develop in a proper way&mdash;the arrangement for proper distribution.  People from the Midlands will not go to Dublin once a week to buy fish.  They should be supplied regularly with different varieties of fish in proper condition. They would pay reasonable prices for it, prices that represent a fair return for the fishermen.  If the Minister concentrated on the marketing end of it, the fishermen would do most of the job themselves.</P>
    <P>I am concerned regarding fishing on the River Boyne which is one of the most splendid fishing rivers in the country, with a good run of fish providing some of the best fishing in Ireland.  Since Bord na Móna began draining bogs in the Midlands, an enormous amount of silt comes in from those bogs and there has been very little effort to get rid of it, with the result that the famous spawning beds of the Boyne and the Blackwater are silted up.  There is now practically no such thing as spawning or, if there is, it is of no avail because the silt chokes the young fry.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consult <Col N="1182" /> with Bord na Móna we put up this proposition before&mdash;so that something can be done about it.  We do not want the river robbed of its fishing potentiality. It is the only river we have in that area and it was responsible for a fair amount of money being spent in the neighbourhood.  If Bord na Móna and the Department get together, they should be able to do something to stop the silting which is ruining the fishing. There is no use in killing one good river while opening up others in the West of Ireland.  We are entitled to our river.  We were told that Bord na Móna were doing something and they made a couple of sinking holes here and there to catch the silt, but I do not believe these are much use, and, unless something is done before long, there will be almost nine inches of silt in the river bed and that will be the end of salmon fishing there.</P>
    <P>There is a big scheme on hands to deepen and widen the harbour at Drogheda and, near this harbour, there is a fair-sized mussel industry out of which 40 or 50 people get a living. They are concerned about the harbour improvements and the effect they may have on their industry.  We do not want to have the harbour improvements postponed.  In fact, we are guaranteeing at least £10,000 from the county council towards that project, but at the same time the 40 or 50 men may lose part of their living by the construction work in the harbour.  I should like the Minister to make a close inquiry into that situation, before the work proceeds, to ensure that the living of these men is not destroyed or, if it is, to ensure that somebody else will come to the rescue, the harbour board or somebody, by means of compensation.  These men are just as much entitled to consideration as anybody.</P>
    <P>There has been far too much talk about fishing and not enough being done about it.  Little will be accomplished, unless some big project is undertaken. The Minister will require more money if he wants to go into deep-sea fishing. He will not get very far on what is provided in the Estimate.  We should stop giving money to this person and to that person.  Fishermen are a good type of people.  They can get together <Col N="1183" /> and co-operate and put up most of the money required for their own industry. Do not let us spoonfeed people because I believe there is nothing as good as private enterprise where people can take off their coats and do the job themselves.  The biggest task the Minister has is to open up markets for these people and provide proper distribution centres.</P>
    <P>If that is done the home market can absorb all our fish for years to come. We are starved for fish in the Midlands and what we get is very often only third-grade fish.  I believe fish is dangerous, if not in proper condition, and I would ask that the hawking business, which has killed fishing in the Midlands, should be stopped.  Provision should be made so that one can go to the local village and get the kind of fish one wants when one wants it. If that is done, the fishermen around the coast will develop the industry rapidly and carry it on as they did 40 or 50 years ago, when they got no help from any Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a big task, but I believe he is a man with drive and he is a member of a Cabinet with a powerful majority.  I think that next year he will get more money for the development of the industry.  If he does that and makes a good job of it, I shall come back and compliment him. It makes no difference on which side of the House he is, if he is a man who is able to pull his weight, I shall respect him for it.  I hope, in the coming year, he will prove to be a man.  Before he was appointed, I thought he would make an ideal Minister for the fishing industry, but I never thought he would make a good Minister for Lands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In the words of the Minister, there are plenty fish in the sea, if we go after it.  The more I think of that fact and the more I see Spanish and English trawlers reaping the rich harvest of the seas around our shore, the more sleepless nights I have.  I do not feel as depressed as some Deputies feel on this matter.  As a public representative, I feel, that as far as my constituency is concerned, I have a duty in representing North Mayo, to say I believe that fishing is 50 per cent. of the answer to our problems.  Therefore it is my opinion that this Estimate is one of the most important before the House.  Since I have been elected I have, in a very short time, done my best in the interest of my constituency as regards fishing, to encourage the fishermen and help them to develop the industry in North Mayo.  Personally I do not claim to have a great knowledge of fishing but I can honestly say that I have handled as much fish, cleaned it, packed it and sold it as any Deputy in this House.</P>
      <P>We in North Mayo are confronted with two very serious problems, unemployment and emigration, and the answer to these problems lies in the hands, to a great extent, of the Minister. I have stated, on each occasion on which I spoke in this House, that the answer to those problems in my area is to give the people a living from the natural resources of the countryside by helping them to develop the fishing industry and by helping to develop our bogs.  We have got the green light in regard to one of these and I appeal to the Minister to give it to us as regards fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a tremendous fishing potential in North Mayo; we have there the finest bays and harbours, from Killala to Broadhaven and from Achill to Blacksod.  About eight months ago I started working on the fishing industry in my constituency and I thought the first step to take was to visit each area as the previous Parliamentary Secretary had done in order to educate myself in the requirements of the local fishermen, find out about <Col N="1185" /> the bays and harbours, the slips and piers, the boats and fishing tackle.  In the course of my tour, I held a few public meetings and a few private meetings and we discussed fishing in detail.  I then approached the present Minister and asked him for his help and co-operation, and I take this opportunity of thanking him and the officials of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for all the help and co-operation I got from them.</P>
    <P>As Deputies, whether in Opposition or in Government, we must formulate a policy which will give our men a genuine incentive to stay at home rather than have them going abroad seeking positions on fishing boats on the Continent.  In visiting my constituency I found out, taking an overall view of fishing, that we are faced with five serious problems, problems on which neither we, as representatives, nor the Minister can afford to delay action if the fishing industry is to be developed in North Mayo.</P>
    <P>The first of these problems is the improvement of our landing facilities; the second is to train our young men in the handling of modern fishing boats; the third is to encourage our fishermen to fish the whole year round and to encourage deep sea fishing.  The fourth is a suggestion of my own, that we should encourage boat building and in conjunction with that, that there should be a special maintenance course as regards boat engines in all our vocational schools.  I am glad to say, in regard to No. 4, that we have in my own town of Belmullet a teacher in the vocational school who has done the course in boat building at Mullingar. I am also glad to be able to say that ours is the first vocational school in Ireland to co-operate with industry in regard to the special maintenance course at the Glenamoy Experimental Station.</P>
    <P>A fifth point is that if we hope to improve the conditions in the area for the future it is essential that we have a programme for that area as well as for other areas and other projects throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In dealing with No. 1&mdash;the improvement of harbour facilities&mdash;I want to bring to the Minister's notice the position <Col N="1186" /> in North Mayo at present.  I think that the Minister, in his planning for fishery development, should have a little more regard to geographical location.  We, in North Mayo, have been left out in the past to a great extent except for one grant which was given by our Government for the improvement of Purteen Harbour in Achill Sound.  We got that, along with the improvement of Porturlin pier which, I understand, cost in the region of £3,000.</P>
    <P>I read in the issue of the <i>Western People</i> of 4th June, 1955, an article of special interest with regard to fishing. It was headed &ldquo;The position as regards the fishing industry in North Mayo&rdquo; and it is a statement which was made in Blacksod by the previous Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O. J. Flanagan.  He went on to say: &ldquo;Since becoming Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the fishing industry I have travelled to almost every important fishing centre in the Republic and I must say that I am particularly impressed with what I have seen in Blacksod.  I am satisfied that, despite continuous neglect by the appropriate State Department, a prosperous fishing industry can be developed here and I am going to take all the steps necessary to provide the facilities required to improve the position of the wonderfully fine type of fishermen I have met in this area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan went on to say that a proper slip would be constructed at Blacksod in the very near future, that everything possible would be done to improve Faulmore pier and that negotiations in connection with obtaining a better place for fish would be diligently pursued.  That was at a meeting at Blacksod.  Later on in the day at a further meeting at Graughill where there was a large attendance of fishermen, Deputy Flanagan said: &ldquo;I have been completely misled by the information submitted to me in connection with landing facilities here and the necessity for improving them.&rdquo; He went on later to say: &ldquo;I will give to the fishermen of Graughill the facilities they so badly need.&rdquo;  That was only part of the false promises used by the Opposition in the course of their stately visits to North Mayo. <Col N="1187" /> I could mention a few of the piers, slips and harbours that are required in my area which, as I have stated, I have visited and for which I feel I can put a genuine case to the Minister.  I would ask him to use his good offices and, if necessary, to approach the county council of Mayo, for the sanctioning of the supplementary grants for this very important work.  There are various arguments to be put up about harbours, slips and piers in my constituency.  When I visited the Minister about six months ago, I asked him to send an official of the Department of Fisheries, together with an official who could advise me and the fishermen in regard to piers and harbour facilities.  At this stage, again, I must thank the Minister for sending those officials.  Before they visited the area, I sent a genuine order to the extent of £23,000 to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  This involved only five fishermen and I have in my possession the five letters that were sent from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to those five fishermen.  I asked those fishermen to meet the officials with me, to put up their arguments and to make a genuine case.  I further asked them were they prepared to pay a 10 per cent. deposit on the Bord Iascaigh Mhara boats.</P>
    <P>One of those boats was a 56-foot boat, costing £13,000; another was a 35-foot boat; and three of them were 28-foot boats.  After the visit of those officials to my area, I got a letter from the Minister as follows: &ldquo;Following on our discussion in February on the possibility of developing the fishing industry in North Mayo, I arranged to have a fishery officer from this Department and an official of the board visit the area.  They have done so in the meantime and have, I understand, discussed the matter fully with you and other interested parties.  There appears to be a prospect of development in Blacksod.  There are good fishing grounds in the vicinity.  The harbour there is not, however, suitable for the type of boat which would be required to exploit the fishing grounds.  I am arranging, therefore, to have this aspect of the problem examined by the Office of Public Works engineers.  It may also be possible to have it considered <Col N="1188" /> by an expert of international repute who is to report on fishing harbours generally.  At other points in North Mayo harbourage for large boats presents a difficulty which could not, I understand, be surmounted except at an expenditure which would be out of proportion to the likely benefit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A few weeks after receiving that letter, I read with delight that the Government had invited to this country a consultant from the international Food and Agriculture Organisation to advise us on fishing and on harbours. The first thing I did when I reached Dáil Éireann was to table what I would class a very important question as regards my constituency.  I asked the Minister for Lands on May 8th:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether, in view of the urgent necessity for providing suitable harbour facilities on the North Mayo coast for fishermen who wished to avail themselves of the hire-purchase facilities provided by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, he will arrange as a matter of priority to have that coast investigated at an early date by the Food and Agriculture Organisation harbour consultant whose services he has engaged.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In reply, the Minister for Defence, for the Minister for Lands, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not proposed to ask the consultant to give priority to any particular part of the coast.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I then asked:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the fact that we have organised the fishermen in my constituency and that I have given a genuine hire-purchase order to Bord Iascaigh Mhara to the extent of £23,000, would the Minister not consider giving my area priority for the provision of harbour and landing facilities?</P>
    <P>Mr. K. Boland: I am sure every area feels it should get priority.  It was considered that the best thing to do was to give the consultant a free hand and let him select the areas for investigation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I also asked the Minister on that day:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether in view of the provision in the Fisheries Vote for the construction <Col N="1189" /> of an exploratory fishing vessel, he will consider giving priority in survey work to the Blacksod and Achill area and the area from Broadhaven Bay to Killala Bay with a view to having them explored for deep sea fishing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply from the Minister for Defence was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The areas mentioned will be borne in mind in planning survey work to be undertaken by the exploratory fishing vessel but it would be premature to say whether they could be given priority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At this stage, I appeal to the Minister, in a last and final effort, to help to develop the fishing industry in North Mayo and, in view of the fact that I have made representations to him, to give us priority in those very important matters.</P>
    <P>In discussing Blacksod pier, it has been agreed by the Opposition and by our side that the proper thing for Blacksod Bay would be a slip.  After visiting that area and discussing the matter with officials, I have come to the conclusion that a slip would be a waste of public money.  What is really required is an extension of the Blacksod pier.  It does not require anything elaborate like a concrete pier which would cost a large amount of money. We will not need anything like that, until we prove that our fishermen are prepared to fish the whole year round. I respectfully submit to the Minister that the extension by 100 yards of the Blacksod pier, a wooden pier with a slip at the end of it with the usual pulleys which would be used by two men to haul in anything up to a 50-foot boat on a stormy night, is all that is required.  That would serve the Blacksod area, for a start.  It would not cost the Government a fortune.  It would also be useful to the people of Achill who are very enthusiastic about this very important industry.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I wish to bring to the Minister's notice.  A gentleman who resides in Doohoma has bought a 40-foot boat out of his own pocket and is now prepared to buy an engine and to go fishing.  The only safe landing place is Tullahaun Bay.  On <Col N="1190" /> his way to Tullahaun Bay, he will have to pass by rocks which are covered at high tide and are very dangerous. Years ago, the rocks were marked by iron stands.  After a few months, the stands disappeared.  I would ask the Minister if it is possible to have the rocks marked.  I do not think it would cost a lot of money.</P>
    <P>There is one other question that I wish to raise before concluding, namely, the position in regard to the fishermen of Achill, County Mayo.  It is only a small matter.  I have done my best on a number of occasions to find out the position by inquiring at the Department of Finance, the Mayo County Council, the Department of Lands, but it still is a mystery to me. I would ask the Minister if he could let me know in the course of his reply the position in regard to the wooden jetty at Achill.  It was a temporary jetty and I understand that it was taken down a few years ago and that the fishermen have applied time and again to have the jetty re-erected. There was a light on the jetty.  The jetty was the only safe landing place in Achill Sound for fishermen.  I would ask the Minister to look into the possibility of re-erecting that jetty.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister also indicate, when replying, the number of certificated skippers for fishing boats in the country and also, in respect of North Mayo, the number of applications received for fishing boats under the Fíor-Ghaeltacht scheme and whether it is hoped to provide any applicants with boats in the near future.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is an enthusiastic man but enthusiasm can best be gauged by performance.  I would appeal to the Minister to give us a break in North Mayo, to give us the boats and the tackle.  During the war, Churchill asked America to give them the tools and they would complete the job.  Give us the boats and the gear and we will help to develop the fishing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there has existed ever since the day the early Christians adopted the fish as a symbol of their secret code, a more successfully kept secret than this alliance between the Minister for Lands and Deputy Doherty in the improvement <Col N="1191" /> of conditions for fishing in North Mayo over the past eight months.  In the course of my speech on this Estimate, I shall come to deal particularly with certain matters referred to already by my colleagues from my constituency and, at the same time, to point out the gross inconsistencies, not alone in their approach, but in the content of their various speeches of studied advocacy.</P>
      <P>This Estimate for the Fisheries Section of the Department of Lands is an important Estimate.  At the risk of being rebuked by my colleague, Deputy Giles, about talking too much, I say it is an Estimate upon which Deputies from maritime constituencies and those who have the good fortune to live in constituencies where the more profitable inland fisheries are operating should make their contribution, because out of every contribution, there could or, at least, should come a certain proportion of good, whether the contribution is motivated by an honest desire to make a worthwhile contribution, on the one hand, or, on the other hand, by a desire to promote the interests of a particular political group.</P>
      <P>In any industry, one can expect very little progress, unless there is substantial capital investment followed by the co-operation, enthusiasm and energy of all concerned, both the investor and those who work in the industry.  It has been pointed out by other speakers that, in spite of the plaudits from the opposite benches as to the remarkable progress made by the Minister up to date and the wonderful things to be expected from him, the progress to be expected cannot be very great when one considers the Estimate and the very slight increase in it in the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, of course, I must say straight away, does not prevent very substantial planning for the years to come when, probably, financial stringency will not be operating in such a difficult manner as it is now.  In this industry, as in nearly every other enterprise, planning on a long term basis is extremely essential, but, honestly, I cannot see any greater detail in the plans for the future as outlined by the Minister <Col N="1192" /> in his speech introducing the Estimate than was in the plans included in his speech last year.  There is a great deal to be said for the viewpoint expressed by Deputy Giles, that our fisherfolk, if given the facilities that must be provided at larger cost, will do the job themselves, because, in my experience, they have been doing it over a considerable number of years, with very little help from any State Department.</P>
    <P>I am speaking particularly at this juncture of the inshore fishermen and those who use the smaller boats.  In fact, I am speaking of the part-time fisherman, part-time farmer, who lives on an uneconomic holding, such as we have in my part of the country and who supplements his income by fishing at the suitable times of the year when the opportunities offer themselves through seasonal movements of fish.</P>
    <P>Co-ordination among all the interests concerned, the Department of Industry and Commerce through Bord Fáilte, the Department of Education through the vocational schools and the Department of Fisheries itself, should form the keystone of what I regard as essential for the development of the fishing industry.  Presenting us with fish at a dear price is bad enough, but presenting us with fish which is cooked and offered for consumption to the public in such a manner as to make it distasteful is the one great deterrent to our development as a fish-eating nation.</P>
    <P>The element of compulsion has never achieved anything very much and in that respect An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is doing a very good job, because, from my experience of it, its main characteristics would appear to be guidance and advice directed from a store of research built up over the short time they have been in operation, not forgetting the fact that they had the advantage of a considerable volume of research before they came into being.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with the Minister when he says he does not think the small centres can survive here any more than in Scotland.  Very probably in Scotland they have not the same dual operation to which I have already <Col N="1193" /> referred, namely, the small uneconomic holding supplemented by fishing activities.  I would deplore any aspect of Government policy that might be directed towards destroying the small man, part-fisherman, part-farmer, and in that respect piers, slips, harbours, boats and general maintenance are factors which must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doherty has taken Deputy Oliver Flanagan to task for a speech he made on June 4th, 1955, at Blacksod and later on at Graughill, County Mayo.  The facts are not such as Deputy Doherty might like the people to believe from the next issue of the <i>Western People</i>, when this speech of his will be read by those who read that paper.  The facts are that a slip was sanctioned as a result of that visit of Deputy Flanagan at Blacksod.  It was cleared in the Fisheries Branch of the Department of Agriculture, sanctioned by the Department of Finance in February, 1957, and sent to the Mayo County Council on the usual terms, that they would put up the 25 per cent. of the estimated cost and guarantee maintenance.  It was not the first time that, as a result of the engineering advice available to that county council, the present Government Party, then in opposition, were able to persuade the county council of Mayo to reject that offer for the slip at Blacksod.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in relation to Graughill, as far back as 1949 or 1950, there was made available a grant for the improvement of the slip there.  It was kept on the long finger as a result of the efforts of Deputy Doherty and his then supporters and former colleagues in North Mayo, by reason of the fact that they were able to use the engineering advice available to the Mayo County Council in order to thwart the work of Deputy Costello's Government in those days.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doherty has just informed the House, in the presence of the Minister and of the officials of the Fisheries Branch of his Department, that he came to the conclusion that a slip at Blacksod for the purpose of providing amenities for the lobster fishermen during the summer months would be a waste of money.  I want to <Col N="1194" /> ask the Minister now to state specifically when he is replying, whether that conclusion reached by Deputy Doherty and stated here this evening in his presence, is the conclusion from the expert advice available to him in relation to that slip.  If it is, then that expert advice has been directed into this channel by some queer means, because it was that same expert advice as was available to Deputy Dillon when the slip at Blacksod was sanctioned and cleared by the Fisheries Branch of Agriculture and the Department of Finance in February, 1957.  Does this conclusion, drawn by a Deputy of undoubtedly tremendous experience and knowledge, bear weight with him? The lobster fishermen of Blacksod have been deprived of this amenity over the past two years, an amenity provided for them as a result of the efforts of Deputy Oliver Flanagan, then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, and in the full implementation of the promise he made on June 4th, 1955, at Blacksod.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Doherty and Deputy Calleary&mdash;the latter having far more associations with the engineering advice available to the local authority of Mayo&mdash;know perfectly well what has happened down the years in relation to Graughill slipway.  They know that a grant was sanctioned during the tenure of office of Deputy Costello's first Government.  They know that it was further inspected during the period of Deputy Costello's second term of office and that it was blocked and impeded by the Government Party interests in my constituency as a result of the influence which they had with the engineering advice available to the local authority.  That is the kind of national approach you get from the Fianna Fáil Party, when in opposition. Then, when they come into Government, we are expected to pay tributes to Ministers, to thank them for their wonderful interest, enthusiasm and great effort to get things for the people, thereby implying that nobody ever does anything but these newfound saviours of the people.</P>
    <P>Porturlin pier was sanctioned during the term of office of Deputy Costello. Three other projects on the coast of my constituency of North Mayo were, <Col N="1195" /> over the past ten years, sanctioned, examined or recommended during Deputy Costello's two Governments. Let nobody, through the medium of this House or through the medium of local papers, try to give the impression that Fianna Fáil, in their great enthusiasm, have been the only providers.</P>
    <P>So much for the improvement of landing-places.  Now let us come to the second point in what I will call the five-point plan for progress enunciated here this evening.  The training scheme for young men was in operation long before this Government took office.  People from my constituency and from Deputy T. Lynch's constituency took advantage of this training scheme.  Like the blocking and the thwarting of the piers, slips and runways, those people who took advantage of it were dissuaded by the local Fianna Fáil supporters at the time who advised them not to go to Galway for the course, as it was all cod.</P>
    <P>It was just the same with the land rehabilitation scheme and the lime subsidy scheme.  The people were told not to take advantage of them as they would increase the rates.  That is the kind of patriotic endeavour we get from Fianna Fáil when they are in opposition.  So long as I represent North Mayo, nobody will come into this House and seek to get away with whitewashing or hypocrisy without getting a full and adequate reply.</P>
    <P>The third point in this five-point plan for progress was to encourage fishing and deep-sea fishing all the year round. The fourth point concerns boat-building and lobster-pot mending.  The fifth point was a programme of some sort.  Nowhere were we told how all this could be done, when it would be done or what would be the result of the wonderful liaison between the Deputies from my constituency and the Minister for Fisheries with secret visits by officials to the area.  Nothing, that I can find out, has been done.  No plans have been formulated.</P>
    <P>The only item of any significance that has come to my notice over the past year has been the promise by Deputy Doherty to the people of Blacksod fishing area that a ball-alley would be provided <Col N="1196" /> for their amusement.  When the lobster pots are unmended, when the boats are not available, when the slips are not made, merely because they were sanctioned by us, the fishermen of the area can always repair to the ball-alley and there amuse themselves.  It was like the advice I heard given by a one-time Deputy of this House who was avoiding an issue that was a matter of controversy at the time.  He rather asked the people in a constituency in Kerry not to forget their Irish dances and Irish music as it did not really matter whether there was anything in the pot or anything to put on the table. We shall have the same situation now with a ball-alley as they were to have at that time in Kerry-take out your old fiddle and play as they played in Kerry long ago.</P>
    <P>That slip at Blacksod is necessary. It was considered necessary and desirable on the expert advice of the Fisheries Branch and of the officers of the Office of Public Works. It was sanctioned by the Department of Finance in February, 1957.  I ask the Minister to see that that job is got on with, because the shellfish industry &mdash;lobsters and crayfish&mdash;is a very essential and integral part of the life of the people in that end of the Belmullet peninsula.</P>
    <P>Deputy Calleary may well say that the currach is dead and that it is good to realise that fact.  I do not know how that news will be received by people who supplement the earnings from their small-holdings in Belderrig, Graughill, Blacksod, Achill and elsewhere, from currachs.  I do not know how they will receive that wonderful pronouncement from Deputy Calleary yesterday evening that the currach is dead and that it is good to realise that fact.</P>
    <P>They do not appear to have anything else for Achill except the shark industry. There is no doubt that the shark industry is a good industry.  There is no doubt that Mr. Joe Sweeney, mentioned by Deputy Calleary yesterday evening, deserves our best commendation for his enterprise in that matter. But when we examine all the facts of the case we make a discovery.  When my colleagues examine it, if they have not <Col N="1197" /> done so already, they will be shocked to discover that it is not all private enterprise.  In fact, private enterprise here has been rewarded by the Minister by the selection of Mr. Sweeney as a member of An Bord lascaigh Mhara, at a remuneration increased by £100 a year above that which was being paid to the members of the former board.</P>
    <P>I should be surprised if Mr. Sweeney is taking that extra £100.  I should be very surprised, and I am sure he is not because it was he who, as a member of the Mayo County Council, proposed that no employee of the county council, employed in a clerical or any other capacity, should receive any increase in salary, wages or allowances in the present financial year.  I am sure he is being consistent and is not accepting any increased amount as a director of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  If he is receiving it, he will, as the Minister knows of his constructive activity in relation to wages in the Mayo County Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very good, Sir.  Let us examine the policy of the Minister, the policy of Deputy Calleary and Deputy Doherty.  Deputy Doherty was boasting here this evening about a £23,000 order for hire purchase of boats in the Blacksod area.  He wants to get that into the <i>Western People.</i>  He had it in before, but I do not think anybody believes him.  He wants the hire purchase and he wants the small boats, the 56-footers and 35-footers, and that order, for his people in North Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> Yesterday evening, Deputy Calleary, representing the same constituency and representing the same Party supporting the Minister, said: &ldquo;Let us get rid of the small boats and stop giving boats on hire purchase, boats that will go out for a day's fishing and let us have no more boats that will run for home when bad weather is expected.&rdquo;  Now, where are we?  One man has £23,000 on hand for the hire purchase of small boats.  The other man says: &ldquo;Get rid of the small boats and stop giving boats on hire purchase.&rdquo;  Is the Minister not in a terrible pickle&mdash;to use a suitable word on this Estimate&mdash;when he has to deal with conflicting opinions of that kind?  What is he to do when Deputy Doherty's £23,000 order becomes a reality?  Is he to send for Deputy Calleary and say to him: &ldquo;Deputy Doherty wants me to give small boats, on hire purchase, to people in your constituency; you want to get rid of the small boats and stop giving boats on hire purchase.  What am I going to do; whose view should prevail?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will tell us which view he accepts: the view that the small boats should continue to be made and be given out on the hire-purchase system, or the view that they should be got rid of altogether, thus accepting Deputy Calleary's urging in the matter?  If the small boats go, or if hire purchase goes, Deputy Calleary's wailing about the Icelandic expert being no use in Belmullet, Portacloy and Blacksod will become a reality, because there will be no boats and there will be no fishermen.</P>

      <P>All Mayo Deputies appear to exaggerate their points, including the present speaker.</P>

      <P>On the question of exaggeration, in any sphere of public life, I am content to take second place to the Minister and I will leave the placings of his colleagues from my constituency to himself.  This important industry for shellfish, lobsters and crayfish at Blacksod must be looked after and looked after quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this important matter of territorial limits, Deputy Esmonde last night urged that we should extend the <Col N="1200" /> limits of our territorial waters, as the Icelandic people have done.  Perhaps there may be some difficulties in doing that to the same extent as the people of Iceland, but something should be done about it, if for nothing else than the psychological effect of safety it will provide for the people occupying the rather indented bays we have in North Mayo, Donegal, Galway and, in fact, in the whole of the north-western and southern coasts.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that Spanish and British trawlers make such raids on our coast as we are sometimes led to believe.  Sometimes, on their way out from shelter, they do a trawl; and whenever they have offended in this respect, I must pay a well-deserved tribute to our maritime service watching the coasts.  I do not believe that the damage these trawlers do is as great as people say, except when they do a trawl moving out from shelter, as I have mentioned.  I do not think it is a matter that should cause anybody, except a fisherman, sleepless nights. Deputy Doherty told us that these inroads of Spanish and British trawlers have caused him sleepless nights.  I am quite certain that whatever caused him the sleepless nights, it was not the inroads of the trawlers in relation to fishing.  The sleepless nights might be better explained by a simple reference to the line of the poem: &ldquo;And Spanish wine shall give you aid, my dark Rosaleen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by many speakers to the necessity for fish depots, the greater use of ice and to the presentation of fish to the customers in a better condition and fresh. Of course, that is certainly a very great essential in the fishing industry. You cannot present to your customers in any shape or form food that has decayed or has begun to go off in any way.  The use of refrigerated lorries and, possibly by co-operation with C.I.E., the use of refrigerated wagons on the railways, should be considered. As I said last year, C.I.E. could take the benefit of the very good example given in this respect by a private enterprise, the Donegal Railways, to the Killybegs fishermen.</P>
    <P>I remember speaking on this question <Col N="1201" /> of fish preservation, packeting and marketing in general and saying that aluminium, while somewhat dearer than wood, is nevertheless cleaner and more lasting.  It is lighter for the purpose of carriage and is the better way of dealing with the packing of fish.  It is coming into use at the moment at quite a decent rate.</P>
    <P>The Inland Fisheries Trust is doing a tremendous job.  It is the kind of job that goes on so quietly, nevertheless efficiently, that very few people, except those interested in what is going on, know about it at all.  But the immensity of their job and the success attending it right up to the present is reflected in the increased interest there is in angling, not alone on the part of visitors from abroad but within the country on the part of our younger people who have formed angling clubs.</P>
    <P>In this respect, there is a matter I should like to bring to the Minister's attention.  There are smaller rivers, not privately owned, but in the possession of the Department of Lands, which angling clubs sometimes seek to rent. While they may not offer as much as some private owner, either local or foreign, nevertheless, they should be given preference, once it is established that the application comes from a reputable angling club and that the members of the club are genuine in their efforts not alone to indulge in angling as a sport but to take all the necessary and possible precautions to see that the location and venue of their angling is preserved as an amenity.</P>
    <P>Such rivers should be given to them, even though their offer might be lower than that of an individual tenderer.  If that is not done, what happens in a country locality where there is a small club?  What happens if they do not get access to the river?  Every one of them becomes a potential poacher.  That is a system to be deplored by everybody on all sides of the House.  It is something that is costly to the industry, and I think it was referred to by the Minister himself as not being an Irish sport.</P>
    <P>The matter of the stocking of lakes is a very important aspect of their work.  In addition to that, a considerable amount of research has been <Col N="1202" /> undertaken.  There is a research centre at Traenlaur, near Newport, where work of tremendous interest has been done.  The Minister himself has visited the place since he took office.  We cannot fail to notice the tremendous interest taken in deep-sea angling in Westport in South Mayo at the present time.  That is something to which we can point as a great result of private local enterprise, where anglers from all over Western Europe and Britain are brought to Westport for this particular week.  In that respect, it is a boon to the town and an incentive to the further development of such like interests.</P>
    <P>In the course of his introduction to this Estimate, the Minister made it a strong point that political influence did not operate with him in the allocation of boats, or indeed in any aspect of his work which might come under the term of patronage.  I accept that from the Minister, but until such time as he dissipates the illusion which is being created, not alone in my constituency but in many others by Deputies of his Party that political influence can work the Minister and that they cannot expect to get a boat unless they come under the aegis of the Fianna Fáil Cumann, there is no point in it.  As regards the preservation of respect for public institutions there is no point in the Minister making such wonderfully neutral and commendably patriotic utterances, while on the other hand his satellites, particularly in my constituency, give the exact opposite impression, that they have the Minister in their pocket and can get anything they want for anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I often despair when I listen to the debate in this House on Fisheries.  It is a subject near to my heart and of which I have some experience.  Really, when I hear Deputy Calleary laying it down as the essential desideratum of fishery policy that we should procure ships which would bring in fish when the sea was rough, so that the proprietors could sell their fish on a dear market, I begin to despair.  Does Deputy Calleary ever ask himself why fish is scarce when the sea is rough?  Because those who have the boats cannot sail on the surface, and, as yet, Deputy Calleary's ambition of equipping fishermen with submarines has not been realised.  There is only one ship that can go to sea in rough and stormy weather, and that is the submarine. If Deputy Calleary has in mind that revolutionary innovation for the fishermen of North Mayo, then God help the fishermen of North Mayo in the counsellor they have chosen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened, Sir, with alarm and dismay to the tone of the debate as conducted by the Minister and the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I was responsible for fishery policy before this House for several years and I laid it down again and again from the Front Government Bench that the primary purpose of the fishery policy of the Government of this country was to secure the well-being of the proprietary fishermen of our west, north and southern coasts and that our aim was to ensure that the fishermen would own their own boats, go to sea with their own crew and share amongst themselves on an equitable basis the proceeds of their labour.  To that end, and to that end only, was the Government of this country prepared to justify relatively high prices for fish to the consumers in this country.  I emphasised also that we were prepared to say that it was legitimate to charge relatively high prices&mdash;bearing <Col N="1204" /> in mind the superior quality of the fish the consumers get in this country when they were getting it from our own fishermen&mdash;in order to protect the legitimate interests of the 1,613 fulltime fishermen and their families who were engaged in this business.  Remember, there are many part-time fishermen also.</P>
    <P>If I started a factory with a chimney on it and smoke coming out of the top of it and planted it in the immediate vicinity of Dublin, Cork or Limerick to employ 1,613 men, I would have been hailed as the saviour of the nation; but because we planted that &ldquo;factory&rdquo; all along the west, north and south coast of Ireland and got a livelihood for these fishermen, this business is regarded as &ldquo;a problem business,&rdquo; something that caused great anxiety to every Deputy in this House. It is providing a good livelihood for 1,613 families in the most inaccessible part of Ireland and is providing the consumers of this country with a better quality fish than is possible in any city in England.  I make no apology for that.</P>
    <P>If the price structure on our domestic market is to be maintained in order to bring in Swedes, Greeks, Norwegians and Icelanders, in order to fish from our shores and sell their surplus here, and wipe out the 1,613 families who are living out of this industry at the present time, then I think the whole thing would be a dirty &ldquo;cod.&rdquo;  Bear this in mind&mdash;when I was Minister in charge of Fisheries, I did not go out looking for people who wanted to install trawler companies here.  I was chasing them away.  I remember two international trawler companies coming to me, on the one day, asking a licence from me to set up a trawler company based upon this country, with a guarantee that they wanted nothing from the Government but access to our domestic market on the terms then existing, and undertaking to export the surplus.  I told them to go to blazes, that by decided policy of our Government we had reserved the domestic market for fish for the coastal fishermen and that we did it because we knew of no other way of getting a decent livelihood for the 1,613 families who were getting a good living out of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> What is all the claptrap about getting foreign trawlers?  Put a notice in the papers to-morrow that foreign trawler companies can base operations on this country and you will have half a dozen of them clamouring at your door.  Let us realise this.  I had two of them coming to me in one day and on half a dozen other occasions and I ran them.  I did not want them. There was one firm in Dublin that had four old crocks of trawlers which they used bring in here and take the cream of the catch for themselves to the grave disruption of the rest of the market here and my principal aim was to get rid of them.  I was told, when I was in office, by this particular company that not all the money in the Bank of England would compensate them for the staggering loss that would be involved if they went.  Yet I was scarcely six months out of office when they went out of business after trying to persuade me to give them £250,000 compensation.</P>
    <P>There is more tripe talked in this House about the fishing industry by people who know sweet Fanny Adams about it than on any other topic except agriculture.  It is a mystery to me why the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are afflicted as they are with every crank, fraud and cod in the country who has persuaded himself that he can run it and knows all about it.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the landings of wet fish in 1957 increased to 41 per cent. more than in the previous year. I wonder will the Minister be able to say as much at the end of 1958.  I hope he will, and that there will be an increase of 41 per cent., but before we go to town on that happy event, ought we not ask ourselves, if 100,000 cwt. of that increase was represented by herring, what does the problem of marketing herring involve here?  In one of the flightier moments of the Minister's address he informed us there was an unlimited market in Britain for herring&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>Why did we not collect all the herring available and deliver it <Col N="1206" /> in the last 12 months to Great Britain if there is an unlimited market there? There is an unlimited market in England for herring when we have not got it, but when we get it very often there is a glut of it on the market and you cannot put herrings in a glass case, take them out and sell them, as Deputy Calleary would like to do, when there is a scarcity.</P>

Is that so?&rdquo;  Does Deputy Calleary know that our people have been salting herrings for seven centuries?</P>

      <P>For goodness' sake! Here is the pattern of expertise produced for us; he has seen a salted herring.  The Deputy would want to see a lot more than one salt herring before he proposes to reform the fishing industry of the country.  Are we going to conduct a thorough research into the habits and customs of herrings?  There are Deputies who believe that the Minister is going to sea like an ancient Viking quite oblivious of the fact that research has been proceeding on the shoaling of herring from the dawn of time and nobody has found the answer yet.  Is there an expert, Scandinavin, Antartic or otherwise, who can tell me or anybody else why herring shoal at Dunmore East all of a sudden and after two or three years you do not see a herring in the vicinity perhaps for a period of seven years?  Is there anybody in the whole world who can tell me why it is that at one time mackerel infested Dingle and suddenly disappeared?  If there is, I never heard of him.  I do not believe there is anybody in the world <Col N="1207" /> who knows the answers to the question: how, where and when do herring shoal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>They know some of the answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They know they are herring and that they swim.  They know they shoal and we all know that, but where, how and when I do not believe anybody knows.</P>
      <P>I am not condemning the Minister for contemplating any revolutionary departure in trying to control that.  I once advocated the fertilisation of Galway Bay with superphosphate of lime in the belief that it would increase the plankton content of that confined belt of water in the hope that that might result in perennial shoaling of herring and increase the wet fish population of that confined area.  I remember the hoots of derision from some of the Fianna Fáil wiseacres.  &ldquo;He is going to try to blow the rocks out of Connemara and the fish into Galway Bay&rdquo; they said.  I do not complain about the Minister strenuously, eagerly and energetically pursuing any constructive course but what maddens me about the Minister's supporters is that one would imagine, listening to them, that no one has ever thought of this until he did it when I know there are men who have devoted their lives to the welfare of our fishermen with zeal unmatched by any member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The demand for herring alone is far above our capacity to supply.&rdquo; What does that mean?  I think these phrases are fraught with dynamite because they are so ambiguous.  Does the Minister really mean that we can freely sell at remunerative prices all the herrings we are capable of landing in a fresh state in the British market? Of course he does not mean that at all. He means that if the herring shoal at the time we want them to do so, in a place where we can reach them and if there is a scarcity of herring at that period in Great Britain there are 50,000,000 people in Britain, a great number of whom eat herring.  That is a very different proposition from saying that there is in Britain a demand <Col N="1208" /> for herring alone far above our capacity to supply.  If it were as easy as that, we could haul the herring in, send it over to Great Britain and sell it, but if we did that at certain seasons and in certain circumstances we would find it would cost a great deal more to haul it in and ship it to Britain than the British would be prepared to pay for it.</P>
    <P>Instead of making general statements of that kind the Minister would be very much wiser to try to state precisely and clearly what is the problem of marketing herring in a situation like Dunmore East.  I believe that the problem is relatively simple of solution. I believe it can be true to say that our capacity to use an unlimited quantity of herring is real and easily assessable and it was in that conviction that I arranged to have a fishmeal factory built at Killybegs because I believe the key to the solution of this problem is to set up a fishmeal factory in a suitable centre, bearing in mind that the procedure is constantly fraught with the danger that the herring will desert the coast on which you place the factory. If they do, you &ldquo;have had it,&rdquo; but you cannot help that.  You must take that risk.  I think you probably ought to build another fishmeal factory in the vicinity of Dunmore East.  You must take the risk of doing that.  It is like buying the sire horse for the National Stud.  You must expend £100,000 or maybe £150,000 in the knowledge that you may be buying a cab-horse and you will not know that until perhaps two years afterwards.</P>
    <P>When you build a fishmeal factory you may spend the money uselessly. That is a risk you must take.  But if the risk comes off and when the fishmeal factory is built and the equipment installed, you can then say to the fishermen on that coast: &ldquo;Land all the herring you like.  The sky is the limit.  Sell as much of it as you like or, as you are fit, as we say in Northern Ireland, at fresh prices, that is to consumers who are prepared to pay prices of fresh fish, and these are usually the best prices. Then sell as much as you can to the curers.&rdquo;  These are the people dear to the heart of Deputy Calleary.  &ldquo;When that demand is exhausted then come to me and I shall take a ton, 100 tons, <Col N="1209" /> 1,000 tons or 10,000 tons at the price which will enable me to sell fishmeal on the international market without profit.  I shall convert, process and market your entire surplus of herring no matter what size it is, but I can only do that at the price which the international market will pay for fishmeal. And remember, not for white fishmeal but for herring fishmeal.  That is the keystone of the Norwegian fishing industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we are not prepared to face that fact and build upon it there is no future for herring fishing in this country.  Anybody who wants to build up the idea that there is a market here for all the herring our fishermen can catch, as the Minister did, knows that it is all my eye and Betty Martin.  It is all cod and dangerous cod.  If you get it into the minds of your fishermen that there is an unlimited market for all the herring they can catch you are not telling them the truth.  If they act on your advice they will experience bitter disillusionment and they will not believe you again.  I tell the fishermen now that there is not a fresh fish market for all the herring they can catch at fresh fish prices but there is an unlimited market for all the herring they are able to land at the three price levels I have mentioned&mdash;(1) fresh market fish prices, (2) the fish curer and (3) to sell the surplus for fishmeal and there the sky is the limit.  That is the truth about herring fishing in this country and that is how we can build a growing and valuable trade for the herring fishing of this country if we go forward resolutely with this plan and tell no lies.</P>
    <P>In column 894, of Volume 169, we have the Minister saying that we have adopted two of the off-shore fishing vessels operated by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to accommodate four trainees on each.  These are the old German trawlers.  Have we still got the German trawlers?  They were the worst things ever brought into this country.  The engine fell out of one of them before ever it got here and in another the engine fell out after it went to sea.  We never had more than one of them at sea at the same time. When I was left responsible for them <Col N="1210" /> we were wondering whether we should sell one of them, immobile, as it stood, or whether we should spend £30,000 on refitting it, re-engining it and selling it in a mobile rather than in a static condition.</P>
    <P>The fact is that these German trawlers were bought by my predecessor between 1951 and 1954.  When I came back to office they were there.  I went down and had a cup of tea on one of them and a very nice cup of tea it was. I think that, in dealing with these trawlers, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara had in mind the illusory idea of Deputy Bartley who really believed that he was cut out to be a fishing magnate. The fact of the matter is that those things never moved out and he never got the chance of going down to Galway, taking command of Bartley's trawlers and going to sea standing in the prow of one of them like Lord Nelson.</P>
    <P>The more sane people in An Bord Iascaigh Mhara said that they would use these boats for training fishermen up to the point where they could get their master's certificates and that those who had that certificate would then be eligible to take charge of the boats with the more modern equipment which would be delivered from the shipping yards for the board. There was some sense in that because when we came to operate the Gaeltacht boat scheme the first boat was allocated to Donegal.  We then sought to find suitable allottees for it.  They were to be native Irish speakers, coming from Irish&mdash;speaking homes.  We got three excellent fellows but then we discovered that while they were all eminently qualified to take a relatively small boat to sea when they were confronted with the 50-foot boats, with all the navigation aids that had been provided, they did not know how to take them to sea.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the larger size of these boats attracted the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and he refused to let them go to sea unless they were in charge of a man with a master's certificate and then we found that we had not got a single Irish-speaking fisherman in Donegal who could qualify for a master's ticket.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1211" /> What we did then was this: we got the services of an officer of the Naval Service and asked the Minister for Defence to allow him to take the boat to sea with the allottee and his crew on board on the understanding that, if after one year's training the allottee qualified for his ticket, the naval officer would then hand the boat over to him to use.</P>
    <P>The naval officer faithfully discharged his duties.  The allottee qualified for his master's ticket and took the boat and then, I believe, the naval officer resigned from the navy and became a fisherman himself and took two boats to sea.  He exchanged his uniform for the fisherman's jersey. That is like the bank clerk who stood behind the counter in a bank where fishermen kept their accounts.  He watched them for three or four years; then he jumped the counter of the bank and now has a fisherman's jersey on him.  Instead of standing behind the bank counter he is now coming to the bank.  He is growing in prosperity and status, but that is by the by.</P>
    <P>I am endeavouring to explain the justification the board has in mind for maintaining these three trawlers.  They were regarded generally, but it was never said to me by anyone in An Bord Iascaigh Mhara as &ldquo;Bartley's Folly&rdquo; but it was hoped out of that folly to salvage something by way of instructing mariners.  I do not believe in that.  The Minister is now going to put Bartley's Folly to sea again and put four trainees on each boat.  I do not know which is the better way, whether it is better to train men on their own boats as we did at Helvic and in Donegal, or whether it is better to hope to get four chaps to come from Connemara and Donegal to the North Wall, and live down a side-street off the North Wall while they are being trained on these boats.  I think my way is the better way.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme I operated they were trained in their own boats.  They were trained in the ways of their own boats and in the handling of their own boats.  They will now be trained on Bartley's Folly and, if I know anything of the performance heretofore of &ldquo;Bartley's triplets,&rdquo; the performance <Col N="1212" /> of any boat from an Irish boat yard will differ fundamentally and radically. If they do not, the poor allottees will spend a considerable part of their lives on dry land while the boats are in the repair shops.  I give the Minister this advice: sell Bartley's triplets and start off again.  If you want to train fishermen consider again the device which has been employed heretofore of choosing the allottee on his skill and reputation as a hardworking fisherman and, having chosen him, furnish him with the necessary skill and instruction on his own boat until he is qualified, on the understanding that if he does not qualify within a reasonable time another allottee will be chosen.</P>
    <P>At column 897 of the Official Report, the Minister is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am convinced that the operation of boats issued on hire purchase is not completely satisfactory. In good weather conditions many boats are not fishing long enough to pay their hire purchase charges although similar boats fishing in the same waters are able to discharge their obligations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I must confess that comes as a revelation to me.  I was unaware of such a situation obtaining anywhere and I would be grateful if the Minister would disclose how and when that situation developed.  Frankly, I never heard of it when I was in the Department of Fisheries and, without mentioning names, I should be obliged if the Minister would mention some specific cases of boat men in arrears, and indicate to us where this accumulation of arrears is due to culpable negligence on the part of fishermen.  It may be so. I am not making the case that all fishermen are angels or archangels and that they are incapable of misdemeanour. They are all human like the rest of us.  They are not perfect but it does surprise me to hear there are allottees of modern boats who are not fishing them with sufficient diligence to enable them to pay what is due.</P>
    <P>At column 897 of the Official Report the Minister is further reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Much better results could be expected from boats of say, 72 feet in length.  We are the only maritime <Col N="1213" /> nation without middle water trawlers and this state of affairs cannot continue. We must proceed to provide some larger boats which will successfully engage in fishing at greater distances from our coasts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to warn Deputies that if you travel that line your logical end is steam trawling, and steam trawlers mean the ultimate obliteration of the 1,613 whole-time and part-time fishermen who are at present fishing their own boats on the West, North and South coasts of this country.</P>
    <P>The reason is perfectly simple.  If you operate steam trawlers you must land fish in sufficient quantity that you will not only supply the entire domestic requirements of fish but have a large surplus to export.  If, with one fleet of steam trawlers, travelling 14 days to the fishing grounds, spending seven days on the fishing grounds, and travelling 14 days back to port, with a cargo of ice on the way out and a cargo of iced fish on the way home, you maintain that in steady sequence you will flood this market with fish with only a small part of an economic fleet for whom this market will be relatively small.  Their profits will be made on the regular distribution of their surplus, off-loaded in Great Britain, France or at whatever other port happens to be convenient to the trawling ground where they operate.  With a flooded market the 50-foot boat has no hope at all.</P>
    <P>I may be outdated but, as recently as two or three years ago, a decision on policy was taken that of the various sizes of boats, 30-, 40-, 50-, 60-, 70-, 90- and 100-ft. boats, bearing in mind our portal facilities and the circumstances of the men who were conducting the trade, the 50-ft. boat was the safest, most efficient and most accessible to the kind of fishermen whose interests we were concerned to promote. If you want to substitute for that an entirely different type of boat then the logical end is the steam trawler.</P>
    <P>I want to remind Deputies of a matter about which I reminded them once before, but time has a short memory.  I remember standing on the pier at Rathmullen when a steam <Col N="1214" /> trawler put in.  The local marine surveyor was called on board, brought down to the hold where there was a sack lying in the corner, and was asked to perform his functions with dispatch because the trawler captain wanted to get on with his job.  The function assigned to him was: &ldquo;Get that carcase off my boat.  That fellow broke his neck yesterday.  I want him off my boat.&rdquo;  I still remember the marine officer asking: &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; And the answer: &ldquo;I do not know, his name is Jack; we picked him up in Glasgow.  I know nothing about him; I care nothing about him.&rdquo;  The man was dead and the skipper only wanted to have the body removed.</P>
    <P>If that is what we want in lieu of what is known at the moment, the owner operators of the 50 foot boats, then get the trawler fleet, get the Icelandic captain, get the Scandinavian instructor, operate 700 miles from the coast of Ireland and, in my judgment, you will have thrown away something which for this nation is a precious asset, and you will get something which, in my judgment, will be a curse on those condemned to go down to the sea in ships.  There are two points of view I agree but I am happy to feel my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party share my point of view.  If the modern minds of Fianna Fáil prefer steam trawlers to the fishing life we have known, then let them go to it but I would be surprised if the fishermen of Ireland endorsed that policy.</P>
    <P>In this country we have reduced the science of passing the buck to a finer science than almost any other country in Europe.  We have now called in the F.A.O. to survey the harbours.  At column 898 the statement occurs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It now seems essential to develop a few of them specifically as fishery harbours with the necessary berthage, slips and shore installations including cold stores, freezing equipment, production of ice, reduction plants, etc.  We have looked for guidance in this to F.A.O. and on their recommendation have employed a Swedish engineer of international repute to advise us on which harbours could best be developed in a large way as fishery harbours.  He <Col N="1215" /> is at present in this country working on the problem.  This does not mean that the other harbours should be abandoned; far from it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does not it make a cat laugh?  There is in the Fisheries Section at this moment, to my certain knowledge, an exhaustive illustrated survey of every potential fishing harbour on the coast of Ireland which was completed not four years ago.  Now we are going to get F.A.O. to do it all over again.</P>

      <P>I wish Deputy Oliver Flanagan were beside me.  He used to have me smothered in portfolios of photographs as long as this Front Bench, giving every angle of every potential harbour along the South and SouthWest coast.  There were so many of them that I freely confess I never got round to studying them all but I saw a great many of them and I am perfectly certain that Deputy Blowick, the former Minister for Lands, saw them too. What has become of them?  Are we to photograph all the harbours again, only this time with a Swedish camera, or it may be that we are going to do it all in technicolour to make it look more life-like?  Whatever we are going to do, it is pretentious cod.  It is all there in the Department and has been there for years but we did not make a song and dance about it.  To give credit where credit is due, I think it was Deputy Bartley who got it done. I am not taking credit for it.  It was there, or in process of being done, in my time.  Certainly, some of them were there and, if the Minister does not know about it, let him consult Deputy Bartley and he will tell him.</P>
      <P>At column 899 the Minister is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the last six months a number of quite large projects have emerged, some of which I expect to come to fruition.  The construction of a commercial fishmeal factory at Killybegs is already well advanced.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Observe, he does not say that the construction of a commercial fishmeal factory <Col N="1216" /> started in the last six months but do you remember that the Taoiseach did not say at Westport that he would not reduce the food subsidies?  What he said was: &ldquo;Somebody will say that I am going to reduce the food subsidies but they say all sorts of queer things about me.&rdquo;  You listened to that.  You paid your money and you took your choice.  The Minister for Lands, Mr. Childers, does not say that a fishmeal factory was started in the course of the last six months.  Here is what he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the last six months a number of quite large projects have emerged some of which I expect to come to fruition.  The construction of a commercial fishmeal factory at Killybegs is already well advanced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Would you ever expect from that declaration that the construction of a commercial fishmeal factory at Donegal was all settled and arranged before the name of Deputy Childers as Minister was ever heard?  You would not. It does not matter who arranged it, so long as it is put there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>The Deputy has the glorious confidence of every Fianna Fáil politician in the shortness of public memory and, whatever he said on last year's Estimate, that is what he said on this year's Estimate.  Let us read it again:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the last six months a number of quite large projects have emerged some of which I expect to come to fruition.  The construction of a commercial fishmeal factory at Killybegs is already well advanced.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The note that I put beside that on my copy of the Official Reports is: &ldquo;Disingenuous.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with the desirability of putting a fishmeal factory at Dunmore East because I think that is now probably as good a herring port as we are likely to pin point, with the present information at our disposal, in the South-East of Ireland but we have got to remember that the herring may leave Dunmore East to-morrow and <Col N="1217" /> that Dunmore East may not see them again for another seven years or that they may be back in six months.  That is a chance we have to take and I think we ought to take it.</P>
    <P>At column 901 the Minister is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have been told that in a developed fish industry up to 14 people are employed on shore for every one on a boat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Between yourself and myself, I do not think that means anything at all.  It just sounds well.  He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It may be necessary to invite landings from foreign trawlers to secure adequate supplies of some fishery products for the export trade.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I just do not know what he means by that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  If he means that, if he places a new fish-meal factory at Dunmore East and that the supply of fish does not come to expectations in the initial stages, he might buy fish afloat to bring it in to keep the factory working rather than allow it to stand idle, I can understand that but if he contemplates purchasing fish for distribution in this country I regard such a departure as wholly undesirable. I believe he is toying, possibly, with the idea of canning fish.  I do not know what the merits of that are.  We tried time and again to can herrings in this country and it did not work but I am bound to tell the House that I was told by people who ought to have known that it would work and they did put very substantial sums of money into it and lost it but it may have been that they had not the necessary know-how.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember one man coming to the Department and inquiring from us as to whether we could guarantee supplies of herring if he undertook their canning and I remember An Bord Iascaigh Mhara saying, &ldquo;Do not touch that, Minister.  We do not handle herring&rdquo; and saying to them, &ldquo;This will not do. Here is a man prepared to give large employment&rdquo;&mdash;I think it was in Waterford&mdash;&ldquo;to put his own money at risk and the only requisition he makes of <Col N="1218" /> the Department is that we would guarantee a steady supply of herrings.&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;I do not care what it costs, I believe we ought to be able to say to him, &lsquo;Yes, we will guarantee supplies to your country of such quantity of herring as you may require for economic operation&rsquo;.&rdquo;  We did.  But, despite the performance by the Department of their part of the undertaking, I think money was lost and the experiment had to close down.</P>
    <P>I do not say by any means that that is conclusive evidence that the thing cannot be done.  It is being done in other parts of the world and I do not say that it could not be done here, but it is not as easy as just saying, &ldquo;Let us can herring&rdquo; because there seem to be very substantial snags in it.</P>
    <P>I turn now to that part of the Minister's speech which dealt with inland fisheries.  Deputy Calleary is gone. Deputy Calleary was talking last night and, in the fullness of his heart, he poured forth a flood of praise upon the Inland Fisheries Trust.  Hoping to help him along, I said, &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; I declare to goodness, he nearly leaped out of his breeches.  He shook his gory locks at me and said he would not be intimidated.  I was quite alarmed.  I was only trying to give him a little colleague's support but he resented it.  He was quite vexed.  The truth suddenly dawned on the man that he had put his foot in it up to the hock because, of course, I started the Inland Fisheries Trust and he did not think of that when he suddenly commenced to praise it and in the middle of his eloquence, this thought came to his mind and he became passionately angry and shook his gory locks.  However, I am sure he realises that his fury is ill-judged and misplaced.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see the progress made by the Inland Fisheries Trust and I make bold to add my voice to that of the Minister, in saying that the Minister speaks perfectly truly and most fortunately in stating emphatically in public, as I do, that there never has been, there is not now, and, so far as I know, there never will be, any purpose in the Inland Fisheries Trust to nationalise the fisheries of this country. The whole basis of the Inland Fisheries Trust is to collaborate with <Col N="1219" /> the local angling associations.  So far as I know, and the Minister confirms it, the Inland Fisheries Trust does not want to function in any area where they are not welcome invitees of local fishing interests.  They want the local angling association to be the prime moving factor in the improvement of the fishing waters of their particular area, and in growing measure to realise the ready willingness of the Inland Fisheries Trust to help them and to work with them, but never to supplant them.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, in that connection, that because we began the Inland Fisheries Trust with our minds focussed on brown trout, we never intended that the Inland Fisheries Trust should touch salmon or sea trout; but before we were at it very long it became clear that, valuable as the trout fisheries were, there was immense potential value for a tourist trade in the coarse fishing; and fortunately the versatility of the trust proved to be such that they were able to equip themselves to help on in that work, too.</P>
    <P>From the beginning, I had impressed on the Inland Fisheries Trust the desirability of building up the canals as suitable and desirable centres of coarse fishing.  It is common knowledge that in the midlands of England, the canals are crowded every Saturday afternoon and Sunday with people from urban centres, and that the passion for coarse fishing there is so strong that there is an understanding amongst all those who fish on the canals of the North Midlands of England, that they never keep a fish they catch, because if everybody kept his fish there would be no fish left.  Therefore, everyone solemnly goes out, hooks his perch, hauls it out most carefully, removes the hook, pats the perch on the back and puts it in again.  You may catch the same perch half a dozen times in the day and not know it.  But the sport is so rare and so desirable that they all sit there, catching these old friends of theirs, stroking them on the back, and putting them back in the water again. In our case, they can come here and enjoy our fishing, as free as the flowers in May, certain that any perch they <Col N="1220" /> can catch they may keep or give to their friends or do what they please with, because there is a great abundance.</P>
    <P>Could Deputies believe that in the early stages, when we cleared the coarse fish out of the trout waters of this country, they were bought and conveyed in tanks from the West of Ireland to the Manchester Ship Canal and put out there?  When that traffic was put on, I suggested to our friends at home that if it was desirable to ship them in tanks to the Manchester Ship Canal, it would be, in my reasonable submission, very much more desirable to ship them to the Royal Canal or the Grand Canal and let them loose there. That idea, I think, has been followed&mdash; but, in fact, they have been very largely transplanted to lakes and rivers which are determined by local angling interests and by the experts in the Fisheries Trust to be more suitable for coarse fish than for trout.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can afford to neglect the canals.  The canal has two immense advantages.  One is that it is a clear fishing water&mdash;and the man who fishes with the cork and worm likes a clear country with which to launch the cork and no bush behind him to get involved in.  It is not a very elaborate proceeding, but it is highly skilled.  You have to know just on what level the cork should be when you pull the string.  I did it with the cork myself and greatly enjoyed it.  The canals have that advantage that they are not encumbered by wood.  Again, there is a towpath their whole length; and therefore one can travel freely and they provide a stretch of fishing water which passes through an area in Ireland which has relatively few other tourist attractions.</P>
    <P>Two things are required.  One is that the canal should be, in certain stretches, in some measure cleared up &mdash;not to excess, because the weed growth is valuable from many points of view.  Apart from that, I think very little requires to be done, except perhaps in certain stretches to remove the excess of mud where the canal has fallen into desuetude.  The main thing is to maintain the water as good coarse fishing water and to stock it mainly with the proceeds of our clearance <Col N="1221" /> operations from trout waters, where the removal of coarse fish is the primary desideratum.  I hope that will be done.</P>
    <P>This is not the time, Sir, to deal with the suitability of certain stretches of the canal to provide bathing amenities. That relates more to the Department of Local Government.  Some day I hope we shall be able to convert the canal, not only into splendid fishing waters but, in the City of Dublin, into some of the finest public bathing pools that a city could boast of.  That scarcely comes within the Minister's responsibility, but it should not be forgotten. If they are preserved for the purposes of fishing that justifies their retention even if it were not possible in the city to use their amenity value for the poor of Dublin as public bathing pools.</P>
    <P>The last thing to which I want to refer is mentioned in column 911, where the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In conjunction with Bord Fáilte, the Inland Fisheries Trust and the E.S.B., I am working towards a means whereby all the interests may prosper and in this endeavour every opportunity for joint consultation will be taken.  A decision on this problem will be soon forthcoming.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In relation to that paragraph, I wish first of all to pay a very high tribute to An Bord Fáilte on the splendid progress which has been made in the development of our trout fishing and our coarse river fishing and coarse lake fishing.  That progress could never have been made by the Irish Inland Fisheries Trust without the inspired co-operation of An Bord Fáilte.  I have rarely experienced any greater measure of satisfaction in approaching colleagues, as they then were, of the Department of Fisheries seeking co-operation, than I did when we approached An Bord Fáilte.  We found a degree of inspired understanding, courage and preparedness to invest in something which they readily recognised as a real tourist asset to this country.  I am sure that the Inland Fisheries Trust would be the first to say that a great measure of the success they have achieved&mdash;and it is remarkable&mdash;has been due to the unstinted and wholehearted co-operation of An <Col N="1222" /> Bord Fáilte.  I feel no doubt than An Bord Fáilte would say the same of the Fisheries Trust.</P>
    <P>I wish I could say the same of the E.S.B.  I am delighted to hear there has been a change of tune there.  I got more trouble from the E.S.B. in fishery matters, while I was Minister, than I did from any other combination in this country.  It is right to say that.  Now, I am yielding to none in my admiration for the job the E.S.B. has done in the sphere of its own technical achievement, providing power and light throughout the country.  But its fishery administration was a pest.  If it has been reformed, I rejoice; if it has not, I shall return to this topic hereafter. Perhaps those concerned might note that I shall consider myself a good deal freer to speak from this side of the House than I conceived myself to be when I was on the other side, but that unhappy contingency need not arise if the hopes expressed by the Minister in the paragraph I have just read out are realised.  There is nobody more willing than I to let dead dogs lie, but I want to be quite certain they are dead before I finally turn my back on them.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister success in this work, subject to two limitations.  The first is that he will not constantly promulgate the idea that nobody gave a damn about fishing or did anything about it until he bobbed up on the surface.  That is silly and it is calculated to cause people to offer him opposition who ordinarily would wish to help.  Secondly, my good wishes are with him for his success if he is truly the servant of the fishermen on our coasts who own their boats and operate them themselves.</P>
    <P>In that connection, let us remember that we used to call them inshore fishermen but that description is now entirely out of date.  A man operating one of the modern 50- to 56-foot boats that he has from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara at present can stay at sea for a week, if it be expedient to do so.  He can sail in any weather in which it is safe for a trawler to put to sea.  It is therefore quite illusory to speak in the present context of inshore fishermen. They are probably few and far between.  Ultimately, I confidently <Col N="1223" /> anticipate that every one of those permanently employed in fishing on our western and northern and southern shores will have boats capable of taking them as far as they want to go and certainly of remaining at sea for days on end, where efficient fishing may require that procedure.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is lured by the <i>fata morgana</i> of establishing a trawler industry based on this country, then everything I can do to impede him will be done.  I am certain that the day on which such an enterprise is put in hand marks the beginning of the rapid obliteration of the 1,613 prosperous families at present operating fishing boats on the coast of Ireland.  Nobody could conceivably justify the present set-up except as a means of maintaining that superb factory with its scattered employment, in every case based on a home and a family and in every case providing the workman with a splendid standard of living not only in the country but often in the parish where he was born and his father and grandfather before him.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, do not let us forget the boatyards.  Do not let us forget Fanny's Bay in Donegal.  Do not let us forget Baltimore in West Cork.  Do not let us forget the boatyards employing men in the remotest part of Ireland where there is no conceivable possibility of providing alternative remunerative employment.  Do not let us forget that in those boatyards the men are getting not only good living and good pay but a training which equips them to take up responsible positions in ship building yards in any country of the world.  If they want to go abroad, they can do so with the assurance that they have permanent and high-class employment in their own parish, if they remain at home.</P>
    <P>It is unthinkable to me that all that should irrevocably be thrown away.  If you once lose it, you can never recover it.  Break up that pattern of life and nothing you can do can re-establish it. It appals me that all that might inadvertently be destroyed in chasing some daft idea that we should establish a steam trawler fleet based on Ireland. Subject to that, the Minister has my <Col N="1224" /> best wishes, but also the assurance that I shall keep my eyes open and if he tries to substitute trawlers for the owner fishermen of Ireland, I think we will be able to defeat him but I hope he will not be so foolish.</P>

      <P>I have very little time, before the House adjourns, to make any substantial statement on this very interesting debate.  Deputies on all sides have been extremely helpful. There has been very little criticism which is not interesting and I feel encouraged to go on with what is a most tremendously difficult job.  I was accused by Deputy Dillon of trying to take credit for various aspects of fishery policy which, in fact, had been initiated before I came into office.  I felt it was necessary to say a great deal about the fishery industry, to emphasise a great many factors in connection with it because I think development is in arrears and that we have a long way to make up.  I want to get as many people as possible to think about it and talk about it intelligently and constructively because only in that way can we, I think, make progress.</P>
      <P>I should like to assure Deputy Dillon that all the plans that he examined and all the tremendously difficult and complex task of assessing markets assume the preservation of the 1,600 permanent fishermen in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As owner fishermen. Indeed in so far as any expansion is concerned, I think we show a common attribute with some other smaller countries, namely, that proprietor fishermen are better than trawling companies run by business men, though there may be some exception to that.  I see the possibility of very considerable expansion in markets available to our fishermen.  If there is any one produce that one examines to-day in the way of a food product being sold on the European markets, I cannot see any signs of the kind of difficulties arising that have arisen, for example, in connection with butter and bacon.  I believe the fish market will be a fairly lively one for a good number of years ahead.  I think most of <Col N="1225" /> those who are much more expert than I am believe it also.  Therefore, I believe there can be some quite large expansion in the intake of fish, cured, canned, fresh, deep frozen, both for our home needs and for export.  In connection with that, I believe it may be necessary for us to have larger boats &mdash;and about that, I had better speak to-morrow at greater length.</P>

      <P>Could I assist the Minister? I do not think it fair for me to break the thread of his discussion, but will he inquire into the representations which I made at a meeting of F.A.O. with regard to the international marketing of fish?  I said to the Committee of O.E.E.C., rather than to F.A.O., &ldquo;Can you procure an international market for fish?&rdquo; I agree with the Minister that there is no scarcity of fish in the world.  There is plenty in the sea to catch.  The trouble is to get it marketed.  Perhaps the Minister would inquire as to whether we ever got any answer from O.E.E.C. as to whether or not there is an international market for fish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. S. Brady Mr. S. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to impress upon the Minister the gravity of the situation which has arisen in the Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown area, as a result of flooding that has occurred frequently, especially during the last 12 months.  This flooding has caused serious damage and loss of property to numerous people in the constituency.  I am informed that when some of these people sought redress from the local authorities they were told that they had no responsibility, <Col N="1226" /> and in some cases their letters did not receive even an acknowledgment.</P>
      <P>During the recent very severe flooding I heard it stated that the people who were most seriously affected were told by somebody that nothing could be done for them; that the Minister for Local Government refused to allow the local authorities to spend rates on this work and that the Government refused to make a grant to relieve their distress.  I want the Minister to realise that while these officials are apparently concerned to pass on the responsibility to somebody else, the people in these districts are suffering very serious hardship, so serious that it is very difficult for one to describe it.</P>
      <P>My own belief, having gone through these areas several times, is that engineers, surveyors and other officials, blundered very seriously when they permitted development on these lands which were known to be subject to flooding.  These lands formerly became an extensive lake during winter periods.  When houses and roads were constructed naturally an extra strain was placed upon the small rivers and the water could not be carried off quickly enough during heavy rains.  It is quite obvious that these rivers should have been attended to before housing development was permitted. Not only was that not done but the rivers were neglected and even fallen trees were not removed.  Worse still, the course of the rivers was diverted and in many cases rivers are now running at a right angle.  In many instances the river was piped, and in most places that I have examined, the pipes are totally inadequate to take the extra water that flows through these rivers as a result of the building development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, where rivers pass under roads, a most extraordinary thing has been introduced.  The river or the open space, was utilised for the service pipes&mdash;gas mains and water mains&mdash; with the result that these form a grill to catch branches and other obstacles that are carried down by the water, thus adding to the danger of flooding in these places.  Again, it is observed that several pipes that are supposed to take the surface water during flood <Col N="1227" /> time enter the stream or river at right angles and therefore cause an extra break in the flow of the water.  One would have imagined that the engineers would have at least taken the trouble to put bends in those pipes so that the water would enter with the flow of the river.</P>
    <P>The fact that most of these houses carried grants, in many cases both Government and local authority grants would lead one to expect that they would have been built under the closest supervision.  Instead of that, we find most glaring defects, such as, in some cases, downpipes from a number of houses delivering the drainage off roofs, not into a shore, but on to the ground.</P>
    <P>Let me deal now, very briefly, with the actual flooding that took place recently. As I have said, this flooding has occurred several times within the last 12 months.  In previous cases it was observed that some rooms were flooded to a depth of nine, or perhaps 12 inches, doing considerable damage to carpets, flooring and furniture. During the recent flooding, however, the damage was of a much more serious nature.  Rooms in some cases were flooded to a depth of four feet.  The water entered through the bedroom windows at the back, and at the same time, the flood water was entering the front of the house from the roadway. In one case there were seven young children in the house.  In the next house there were five.  Fortunately the water had disconnected both gas and electricity, or there might have been very serious consequences, particularly from electric shock.</P>
    <P>In some cases, the houses were divided into an upper and lower flat, and the people in the lower flats were in grave danger of drowning.  In one case, there were four young children; in another case there was an elderly invalid.  She was rescued by the people. In the midst of their own distress, they remembered this old lady.  In order to rescue her from the floods, they had to burst in a partition and take her out into the upper storey of the house.  To add to the plight of the people, this happened during the early hours of the <Col N="1228" /> morning and, as I have said, there was no light and, worse still, it was discovered that not only was there flood water in the houses, but that the sewers had delivered sewage widespread around the place.</P>
    <P>I hope that in this brief statement I have given the Minister sufficient information to convince him of the necessity of sending a competent person to investigate this whole problem. I am convinced that the major portion at least of this flooding was caused through the negligence of some officials.  I urge the Minister to do everything possible to find out who is responsible and to see to it that the matter is remedied as soon as possible. Many people have suffered severe loss; others have lost everything they possessed.  I hope the Minister will not rest until he investigates the matter to satisfy himself as to where the responsibility lies.</P>

      <P>In the short time available to me, I should like to impress upon the Minister the gravity of the problem raised in the Parliamentary Questions put to him to-day and in the discussion to-night.  Unless one saw what happened, it is not possible to believe that such serious flooding could have occurred in what are generally regarded as developed areas.  This flooding is peculiar to these areas because of their close proximity to the mountains.  The heavy rainfall experienced in the past few months has aggravated a problem already liable to cause not merely loss but suffering, and in fact on this occasion it was providential that there was not a loss of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Dun Laoghaire Corporation and the county council have submitted a scheme to the Minister's Department.  I would urge that the Minister, in collaboration with his own officials and the officials of these local authorities, would endeavour to get a scheme that will provide a remedy.  Nobody expects abnormal flooding in certain circumstances not to cause trouble, and, maybe, some damage; but in these areas we have mentioned, this problem is a recurrent one.  It is recurrent for a number of reasons.  One is the fact I have already <Col N="1229" /> mentioned: their close proximity to the mountains.  The out-fall flows on to the lower lands in which the whole constituency is situated, coming from the higher range of mountains in proximity to the area.</P>
    <P>The other reason is that a number of these areas have been rapidly developed for building.  They have been developed from conditions which were formerly rural and they are without the services one normally associates with developed urban areas.  As the Minister will understand from what Deputy Brady said, these streams became choked and, in addition, the rainfall and surface water in many cases emptied into the streams, aggravating the existing normal flow of these streams when there is a flood. At the same time, some of the sewage disposal pipes became flooded and the sewage erupted through the pipes and flooded into the gardens and, in some cases, into the houses.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the problem of dealing with this matter quickly and understand the many questions that have to be considered, but I strongly urge on the Minister to do, in collaboration with the local authorities concerned, two things: one, to provide whatever speedy remedy is possible by means of cleaning the rivers and removing debris from them, examining, wherever possible, the drainage and sewage pipes and, secondly, the more important thing, to approve, or if necessary, in consultation with the local authorities concerned, to have a scheme provided which will ensure, as far as engineering and technical skill are concerned, a proper system of drainage for this entire area.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself saw the new scheme in Dun Laoghaire which deals with part of the area.  Within the past ten or 15 years, this whole area has been developed for building at a greater rate than the existing services were able to deal with.  This problem is very serious.  I need not mention the areas to the Minister any more. He is aware that almost all of the constituency has an area or areas in the places mentioned badly affected by flooding.  The people are living in constant fear because of the unprecedented rainfall there which, according <Col N="1230" /> to the meteorological office figures, was the heaviest rainfall in the country in recent weeks.  I should be glad if the Minister would give the matter his urgent attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should say I am aware from the Press reports of the great hardship and inconvenience that have been caused in the areas just mentioned, in and around Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown, Dundrum, Churchtown and these other places.  I should like to assure the House, the Deputies concerned and the residents of those areas that I am fully alive to the problem that has been facing them and to the hardships they have undergone recently as a result of the flooding which, to no small degree, has been accentuated by the unusually heavy rainfall we experienced last month.</P>
      <P>It is true that flooding has been recurring in increased volume and a number of times over the past few years.  I take it that this, apart altogether from abnormal rainfall, has been brought about by the rapid development that has taken place and the rapid building up of these areas that has gone on in the past.  I should like at this stage to amend what I said in reply to the questions earlier to-day when I stated that we in the Department had not received any proposals to deal with this problem.  I should like to amend that and let the House know that to-day, some few hours before I answered that question, plans and proposals were received in my Department.  As a result of the receipt of those plans, we are in a position now to initiate discussions which have been in the mind of the Department for some time, between the technical advisers, the consultant, the corporation and our own people in the Department.  This discussion we hope to bring about next week, with a view to trying to formulate what may be a proper and a comprehensive plan for the relief of the flooding mentioned here to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it should be said that the <Col N="1231" /> suggestion made by Deputy Brady&mdash;in regard to the Department and the Minister for Local Government being responsible for holding up any scheme to relieve this problem&mdash;is entirely untrue. The position has been that, over the years, since first a consultant was appointed, we have been awaiting firm proposals from the consultant or, through the consultant, from the corporation. At no time until now, have we had what we could regard as concrete proposals; and until we got these proposals, there could be no question that the Department should enter into the detailed planning of a job which, in the main, is the responsibility of the local authority.</P>
    <P>For some years prior to 1957, the matter was being dealt with, but not in a very expeditious manner.  It was not being treated as a very urgent problem.  While a consultant was making various suggestions and various reports, the local authorities concerned did not seem&mdash;at any rate, as far as the records of my Department are concerned&mdash;to get down to the job as if it were a job for them at all.  Since they got around to the idea that this is, in the first instance, a job for local authorities, I think much more progress has been made.  This progress has culminated in some firm basis of proposals having been received in my Department to-day.</P>
    <P>The difficulty of the terrain in this area&mdash;Dún Laoghaire&mdash;Rathdown, Dundrum and, to a lesser degree, the Churchtown area&mdash;in the case of drainage, is well known to the Deputies from the constituency&mdash;and indeed I suppose to many others.  I think it is fairly plain at this early stage that the remedy will not be of a minor character, that it cannot be such, and that it is more likely to be of a comprehensive drainage nature.  That may be <Col N="1232" /> rather discouraging, of course, to those who have suffered in the recent past; but, from the point of view of the Department, we will have to look at the proposition with a rather longer term view than would be, possibly, the popular view just now.  We must try to get together with the various officials and technicians and consultants, and hammer out a proper, comprehensive scheme which will not only remedy the worst of the flooded areas that we now know of but which will prevent any flooding in other areas in the surrounding neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>I can only say that, so far as my Department, my officials and myself are concerned, we shall be only too willing to co-operate in every possible manner to bring about the early initiation of a proper and planned scheme for the relief of this flooding, which has caused all this hardship.  To the people who would like to see an immediate remedy, I can only say again that we will bring it to the attention of the local authorities in so far as they can do anything about keeping the existing streams clear.  If foundation there is in the allegation that these streams are allowed to become blocked up by fallen trees and other debris, then we will bring that allegation and that complaint to their notice.  I am sure they, on their part, will make every effort to make the best use possible of the existing drainage. Then we can look forward to getting a proper scheme going in the not too distant future.  I hope it will result in relieving the flooding in this and adjoining areas in the years to come.</P>
