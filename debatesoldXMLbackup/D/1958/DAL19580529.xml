    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That Section 11 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the discussion last night, I want to make a suggestion to the Minister in regard to Sections 10 and 11 both of which deal with capital.  I have the uncomfortable feeling that the capital structure of C.I.E. is becoming like the income-tax law. It has been so frequently changed that it becomes almost impossible to find out what it truly is.  The Minister said yesterday that the aim was to get rid of capital liabilities prior to 1950 and that the capital of the new board should be regarded as capital invested <Col N="876" /> since 1950.  In that regard Deputy Norton directed the attention of the House to the burdens taken over by C.I.E.  It may be no harm to refer to paragraph 23 of the Beddy Report where it was pointed out that railway rolling stock consisted of 405 locomotives with an average age of 51 years, 680 passenger coaches with an average age of 48 years and 11,700 wagons with an average age of 35 years.  There was, of course, also the permanent way, the stations and hotels and so on.</P>
      <P>Do I take it now that it is the Minister's intention to wipe out substantially all the rolling stock to which I have referred, the permanent way, the hotels and other properties which C.I.E. took over in 1950 and to leave as their capital, which we shall expect to have remunerated under their current operations, only the expenditure of a capital character undertaken since 1950?  If that is the purpose is it not desirable from the point of view of the public, of the Board of C.I.E. and of other interested parties, the trade unions catering for the employees and the customers of the transport system who ask for special rates, that there should be set out in plain and simple language the amount of capital which now constitutes the capital of the company and which ought to be remunerated inasmuch as it was spent on modern up-to-date equipment which should be able to earn a fair return?</P>
      <P>If that course commends itself to the Minister is there not something to be said for greatly simplifying the form of the balance sheet of C.I.E.?  I understood the Minister to say yesterday that as the total write-off amounted to something like £15,000,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>£16,500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is for the board of the company to deal with its balance sheet for the purpose of allocating what assets are to be cancelled as against that reduction in the total liability of the company thus leaving the balance sheet as set out on page 77 of the Beddy report still containing figures like 3 per cent. transport stock, 2½ per cent. transport stock, 5 per cent. transport stock and 4¼ per <Col N="877" /> cent. transport stock, totalling in all £23,000,000.  Would it not be a simpler thing to determine that the total stock of the company was £8,000,000 or whatever it is and show that in the balance sheet so that in successive years we might relate the earnings of the company to the capital which we knew was invested, not in engines 51 years old but in the most modern equipment any railway company in the world is in the position to acquire?</P>
      <P>I am always afraid that we shall be drifting into a long period in which everybody accepts it as normal that, no matter what the railway company has, it is expected to lose money and at the end of the year present its bill and says: &ldquo;We have lost that much&rdquo; and that any reduction or any refusal to meet the loss is met by saying: &ldquo;We have no alternative but to do so.&rdquo;  That is a very dangerous frame of mind for everybody to get into.  If we have spent the capital now appearing in the balance sheet on the best equipment that money can buy we ought to be able to earn a reasonable return.  Unless that is set out on the face of the balance sheet I am afraid that essential fact will be lost sight of by more people than the board of C.I.E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the balance sheet of the company will require to be reconstituted on the enactment of this measure.  The precise method by which its capital liabilities and assets should be displayed on the balance sheet is a matter on which, no doubt, the board will be advised by its auditors.  I do not know if there is any need to put on them a statutory obligation to make the changes which will obviously be necessary in the new circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, let us be clear on the realities of the situation.  The board has not, in fact, been remunerating its capital.  The position up to the present has been that when interest became payable on any of these stocks the board, being unable to pay the interest, applied under the provisions of the 1950 Act to the Minister for Finance and got the money wherewith to pay it.  The money was subsequently voted <Col N="878" /> by the Dáil and became a liability of C.I.E.  When Deputy Norton uses the phrase &ldquo;£16,500,000&rdquo; he will understand that of that £16,500,000 something like £4,500,000 represented a liability of C.I.E. in respect of interest on stock paid from the Exchequer, a liability which was not reflected in any assets of the company.  Therefore, when I talk about wiping out capital liability I am thinking of a smaller sum which does represent an actual capital liability, money spent at some stage upon the acquisition of capital assets.</P>
    <P>It is true that C.I.E. emerged from the war with decrepit rolling stock in their railway system and indeed in their road transport system.  It was not until 1953 that it was put in a position to undertake the systematic replacement of that out-of-date rolling stock by new equipment.  There is no point in going back over past events. I had hoped that the re-equipment of the C.I.E. system would follow immediately after the war.  Indeed, it was with that aim in view that the Transport Act of 1944 was passed while the war was on.  But as it happened when the time came in 1948 the then Minister for Industry and Commerce felt he had to have a committee of inquiry before any proposals of the board could be approved.  The board were in fact instructed not to spend any money on capital account and even to cancel certain orders that had been placed for new equipment.  Consequently there was a delay which was only partially corrected when the Transport Act of 1950 was passed.</P>
    <P>Deputies can go back over the debates on the 1950 Act.  Some of them will recollect that the general criticism at that time was that the particular job which seemed to be necessary in relation to the railway system of C.I.E. was not in fact made possible by that Act, that is to say, the re-equipment of the system with new engines, new carriages and new wagons of a modern type and capable of efficient operation.  It was not until I brought the 1953 Transport Act to the Dáil and got it passed that the systematic re-equipment of the system began.</P>
    <P>It was hoped then that the new <Col N="879" /> equipment to be procured by C.I.E. would so reduce its operating costs that not merely would it go a long way towards wiping out its existing revenue deficiency but would also enable it to meet the interest charges on the new capital invested in the re-equipment programme.  That has not proved to be so.  The cost of operation of C.I.E. keeps on mounting and even though the actual savings on fuel and maintenance contemplated in 1953 have been achieved, the mounting cost in other sections of the board's accounts has nullified the effect of these economies and left the overall financial position of C.I.E. more or less unchanged.</P>
    <P>At that stage C.I.E. had to carry the responsibility for remunerating the new capital raised by the re-equipment programme in addition to the capital liability which had been given to it under the 1950 Act.  The Beddy Committee recommended that its liability in respect of capital investment undertaken prior to the 1950 Act should be wiped out and that only capital invested since that date should now appear as a liability of the board.  In effect, that is what is being done.  The reduction of its capital liability by £11,500,000 achieves that result.</P>
    <P>Since then the board has spent on capital account approximately £10,000,000&mdash;£9,750,000.  I must perhaps correct that to some extent.  The board spent more on capital account but the additional capital liability which it incurred was £9,750,000.  Some of the additional capital expenditure was financed out of their depreciation provision.  The capital expenditure on head of that reorganisation programme is not yet completed.  It is still proceeding.  There are some liabilities accruing on capital account which will have to be met in this year. But it is contemplated that by the 1st April, 1959, the board's liability on capital account will be approximately £13,500,000, all of which will represent expenditure incurred in the re-equipment of the undertaking since 1950. It will have no liability of any sort whatever on capital account in respect of any expenditure incurred prior to 1950.  We are wiping out £11,500,000 <Col N="880" /> of its capital liability by transferring the 3 per cent. 1955-60 stock to the Exchequer and releasing it from any obligation of repaying advances to the board from the Exchequer for capital purposes.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the wiping out of its interest liability, which the board was unable to meet in the past. Therefore, the board will start off on 1st April, 1959, in the position that it will have that reduced capital liability and a subvention fixed at £1,000,000 per year from the Exchequer which will enable it to meet the interest in respect of its existing stocks, which, for the information of Deputy Norton, amounts to about £450,000, and the balance will meet the revenue deficiency which, it is anticipated, will still be experienced for some two or three years to come.</P>

If they have occasion to incur new capital expenditure, they will put out a new stock issue and will, of course, be responsible for that.  I assume, however, that the board will not incur any new capital expenditure, unless they can see the effect of that expenditure in the form of economies or of revenue by which it may be remunerated.</P>

      <P>We may assume in respect of the £13,000,000, most of which is being made available by the Government or with a Government guarantee, that C.I.E. will be expected to produce an annual return sufficient to remunerate that capital and convert it from deadweight into gross debt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the Bill and the White Paper which accompanies it.  The Exchequer is taking over liability for the 3 per cent. transport stock 1955-60.  That is £9,900,000. In addition, they are wiping out liability to repay capital advances, which represents £1,800,000.  That makes a total of roughly £11,500,000. That leaves C.I.E. with a liability for all transport stock issued after that date, amounting to roughly £13,500,000.  That will be the capital on which it will have to continue to pay interest; the accepting of liability for the 3 per cent. 1955-60 stock and cancelling liability to repay advances of £1,800,000 means, in effect, that you are relieving C.I.E. of the liability for depreciation charges.</P>

      <P>I understand that, but at the end of March, 1957, according to the balance sheet, there were accumulated losses of £7,500,000.  I presume there is another £2,000,000 on to that now for 1958.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is £9,500,000.  The Minister is writing off £16,500,000, which leaves £7,000,000 over and above, which, I presume, the board will apply to writing off the old railway lines and the rolling stock to which reference has been made here. That, in turn, will relieve them of depreciation charges, which were quite substantial, on that old stock.  For the 12 months to 1957, they paid almost £1,000,000 in depreciation charges and, according to the Beddy Report, their suggestion of writing off rolling stock and railway lines would relieve C.I.E. of a further £350,000 per year.  It seems therefore&mdash;I may be wrong in this&mdash; that, in effect, the reorganisation scheme suggested will relieve them of interest charges of £631,000, which are referred to here in the White Paper, and depreciation charges of something over £300,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>£974,000 depreciation for 1957&mdash;that, presumably, is taken into account when assessing their losses.  It represents an accumulation year after year in the appropriation account.  Is that not correct?  By this reconstruction, not alone are we relieving them of interest charges of £631,000, but we are also relieving them of depreciation charges of £308,000.  Therefore, they are saving nearly £1,000,000 per year and, on top of that, it is proposed to give them £1,000,000 per year and, unless something very unforeseen occurs, that should put matters straight for them.</P>

      <P>There would be no question of preparing a new balance sheet as at 31st March, 1958.  It would be 31st March, 1959, which will be the <Col N="884" /> effective date from which this scheme will come into operation. For this year, their deficiencies on revenue and their cash needs generally are being met out of a Vote.  There is an item in the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce for that purpose.  It is only from 1st April next year that this new financial arrangement comes into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Russell may be misled about the depreciation aspect when referring to C.I.E.  The method of ascertaining depreciation so far as C.I.E. assets are concerned is the most involved science in the world.  Only one or two people know the secret of it.  It is most complicated.  It is not as if you are in a private company where you buy a machine and say: &ldquo;There are ten years of life in the machine and therefore we will write it down as 10 per cent. for each year and then it is gone.&rdquo;  That is too simple for C.I.E.  It is a most involved scheme.  You do not merely write down the depreciation value of what is installed but the figure is arrived at by some notional reference to the orthobox way of writing down depreciated assets and then the cost of maintenance and the whole system on which that plant operates.  If you were trying to get down to the basis of this, you would want a long period of study in solitude to be able to understand the techniques of writing down C.I.E. depreciation assets.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Russell talks of writing down £10,000,000 or £11,000,000 in fixed assets because their liabilities on the other side have been wiped out, it does not necessarily mean it is saving C.I.E. a proportion of a sum of money represented by not having to write down the depreciated assets which are now being wiped out.  It is perfectly illusory.  While you go through the whole exercise with C.I.E. about writing down assets, the fact remains that you get nothing out of it in this respect because of the complex formula they operate.</P>

      <P>They probably apply a different system of depreciation to different assets.  I am sure they write <Col N="885" /> off a bus on the basis that the normal life of a bus is, say, from ten to 15 years and try to ensure, adding in depreciation as a working cost, that the net earnings of the bus will be sufficient.  I do not know how you apply that to a permanent way.  In that case, what matters is the maintenance expenditure.</P>

      <P>This will be good for Deputy Russell's soul.  Every group of technical persons tries to build up a mystery.  It is as old as the Middle Ages.  I remember a time when, if you asked any question about credit, the answer was: &ldquo;Ah, you do not understand banking.  It is a most complex procedure.&rdquo;  The truth is that it is the customary moneylenders' racket.  If you ask the doctors: &ldquo;What is wrong with me?&rdquo;  They will tell you: &ldquo;It is not good for you to know.  We will fix you up.&rdquo;  Railway directors belong to the same coterie.  They build up a vast mystery and then they present their bill to the Oireachtas and say: &ldquo;You would not understand.  We write this off in a way that no human creature can understand.&rdquo;  My reply to that is: &ldquo;Why the hell do you do that?  Is it not time you got somebody to put the matter in a form which any rational person can understand?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the need for mystery?  Why must a railway company or a transport company handle its depreciation in a way which no rational creature can understand except two or three individuals? My reaction is: &ldquo;To hell with it.  If that is their way of doing business, let them send for proper accountants to put their accounts in such a manner as to make it possible for us, who are charged with the care of the money of the taxpayers of this <Col N="886" /> country, to understand this business, provided we are prepared to give it attention and care.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All I am troubled about is this.  I have seen this happen in Dáil Éireann many times.  Somebody says: &ldquo;Nobody could understand it&rdquo; and everybody shakes his head and says: &ldquo;That is that.&rdquo;  I say that is all cod.  It is a common device practised by people who want to become a charge upon the public purse to say that their affairs are so complex that they are quite unable to explain them to anybody, but the net result is that they want £7,000,000.  I think that is wrong.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the discussion, I put this simple request to the Minister: &ldquo;When all this is through, what will the balance sheet, which is set out on page 96 of the Beddy Report, look like?  What will the capital issues liability be?&rdquo;  I do not propose to press that question further now.  I think point and force have been lent to my request by the subsequent discussion which I think reached its climax when Deputy Norton told us &mdash;I think, truly&mdash;that under the existing system only two or three people in these two islands understand what goes on in the processes of accounting which are considered appropriate for the transport company.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to reassure us by telling us that the Government, on our behalf, will say to the transport company: &ldquo;Cod. That will not wash any more. Accounts ought to be prepared in a form which is comprehensible to rational people who are prepared to take the trouble to study them.  It will not do to tell us that your accounting procedures are incomprehensible except to two or three specialists and that these are always in your own employment.&rdquo;  I think general public <i>malaise</i> will grow if we are faced with the fact that we are to receive annual bills for deficiencies in transport revenue and no adequate explanation of how these deficiencies are arrived at.</P>
    <P>I suspect, as I believe Deputy Russell suspects, that, in the transport company, as in many other companies, depreciation is a figure that can be <Col N="887" /> used either to pad or to bleed a balance sheet.  However, I do not agree with Deputy Russell that you may expect depreciation materially to fall after you have re-equipped a railway company.  I think depreciation on run-down assets is liable to be much less than depreciation in the early years of a completely newly-equipped transport company because the cost, in capital value, of new diesel engines is far greater than the capital value of 50-year-old steam locomotives.  I assume that somebody in the Revenue Commissioner's office understands how transport accounts are kept and how depreciation is calculated and that they will have to justify to somebody the rate at which they are depreciating assets.</P>
    <P>I can well conceive that the depreciation appropriation in the annual accounts of C.I.E. could be a good deal higher after the re-equipment programme that took place in 1950 than it was in respect of the antediluvian equipment they had prior to that date.</P>

      <P>Allowing for the suggestion, as Deputy Norton said, that this is a very complicated procedure, which I appreciate, I refuse to believe you can write down assets of any undertaking, whether a railway or anything else&mdash;taking last year's figure of £24,000,000 down by some £8,000,000 or £9,000,000&mdash;without its making some appreciable difference to the depreciation difference to the depreciation figure.  It is a very complex calculation, but nevertheless C.I.E. have been paying £1,000,000 a year depreciation charges on assets estimated to be valued for £24,000,000. If you write off £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 of those assets, or wipe them out, you must affect the depreciation charge. Of course as Deputy Dillon said, if you spend more money on new diesel engines and equipment, obviously this charge will go up again.  I am merely taking it as on 31st March, <Col N="888" /> 1957; and I still think there should be a saving in depreciation charges due to the capital reconstruction which the Minister proposes to carry out in order to help C.I.E.  Anything which Deputy Dillon says on that will not change my viewpoint one iota.</P>
      <P>With regard to the auditing of C.I.E. accounts, the firm of auditors which looks after those accounts is a well-known and prominent one, which should be able to arrive at figures understandable when presented to the public who take an interest in these things.  It is a responsible firm and I do not think we need look any further than the accounts presented.  I shall not labour that point any further.</P>

      <P>Whenever the board ceases to provide or permanently reduces any transport service by rail or inland waterway or substitutes.</P>
      <P>One of the questions raised here during the previous debate was whether the wording of the Bill was adequate to provide for compensation for railway employees rendered redundant on the closing of a railway station on a line which remained open.  It was certainly intended that the Bill should provide for compensation in such cases, but on examining the section there appeared to be some doubt as to whether the wording was adequate to secure that aim.  The purpose of this amendment is to put that beyond doubt.  The suggestion was that compensation was payable only where a line was closed down.  This amendment makes sure that compensation will be payable if any service is closed down, such as a railway station.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(6)  The Minister may by Order extend the provisions of this section to any case in which, within five years after the passing of this Act, the services of an officer or servant are dispensed with or he is transferred to another position because of redundancy arising from any comprehensive scheme for the reorganisation and more economical operation of any department of the undertaking agreed between the board and the trade unions representative of the employees affected by the scheme, <Col N="890" /> and may by Order amend any such Order.</P>
    <P>I want to make a statement on this amendment.  The effect of it is to ensure that where redundancy occurs otherwise than on the closing of a line or the withdrawal of service, because of a general scheme of reorganisation of any section of the board's undertaking, which produces a permanent lowering in the number of people required for the operation of that section of the undertaking, compensation will also be payable provided there was a scheme of reorganisation agreed to by the trade unions and accepted by the Minister as adequate to justify his making the Order bringing this provision into effect.</P>
    <P>I discussed this matter on Tuesday last with the trade union committee which has been dealing with this Bill and they suggested a verbal change in the amendment, to make it clear that the term &ldquo;any department of the undertaking&rdquo; would include any category of workers or any sort of subdivision of a department.  I am prepared to accept that amendment, as it is in accord with the idea I have in mind.</P>
    <P>I raised with them, however, another aspect of the amendment.  Since I drafted it, I have had some doubts as to whether it is reasonable to insist that prior trade union agreement should be given to a scheme of reorganisation. It is clear that, irrespective of what appears in this Bill, the C.I.E. management will be entitled, and expected, to examine and act on every possibility of reorganisation which will help to reduce losses.  It is undesirable from my point of view&mdash; which I think would be the viewpoint of the Dáil&mdash;that compensation should be payable only to workers made redundant by such a scheme on condition that the trade unions agreed to it.  We all know there are many trade unions catering for C.I.E. employees and in respect of some categories of C.I.E. workers there may be two or three unions involved.  One can see circumstances in which one union might agree and another might not and, as the amendment now stands, that may preclude my making an Order <Col N="891" /> to apply the compensation provisions &mdash;assuming that the C.I.E. Board decided to go ahead with them even though unable to get complete unanimity amongst the unions.</P>
    <P>The trade unions tell me they would welcome the deletion from the section of the requirements of prior trade union agreement and I will move to amend the section further to that extent on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand the Minister as saying that the trade union representatives agree to the deletion of the prior requirements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They welcomed the deletion.  My view is that effective reorganisation, which brings about a reduction of working costs, the carrying on of the railway end of the undertaking upon the basis of employing in it only that number of workers which is the minimum essential for its proper operation, requires not merely a decision of the management that that should be the aim of their efforts but also the assent of the trade union that that is to be the objective of transport policy.</P>
      <P>We are in the situation that we are trying to put the railway organisation of this country on a basis which will ensure its permanency, in so far as any human activity can be described as permanent.  We are trying to give to the workers who will be employed in that organisation the feeling of security in their occupation which they cannot have at the present time.  I have been trying to ensure that that approach to the problems of railway maintenance would be common to both unions and management.  Therefore, I was thinking in terms of a joint examination of the possibilities of these economies, and a joint approach to all the problems involved with that objective in mind of bringing the labour costs of operating our railway services to the minimum which efficient operation would permit.  I think that is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recognised since I started to prepared this amendment, following on discussion with trade unions concerned, the difficulty which would be <Col N="892" /> experienced in any trade union executive where they had formally to agree to an arrangement which would involve redundancy for some of their members. Therefore, I shall not insist on formal agreement, but I think agreement should be the aim, that this joint approach should be made, and the two parties to the industry should get together with a view to working out arrangements which will bring about that lowering of costs.</P>
    <P>The trade union representatives said to me that that, of course, implied there should be consultation between the management of C.I.E. and the unions in relation to these matters.  I accept at once that implication of emphasis upon the desirability of a common approach.  Agreed action does imply consultation and I do not see any difficulty in ensuring that that consultation will take place, and that the effort will be made to get whatever reorganisation measures are possible brought into effect with the goodwill of all concerned, provided, of course, there is that common recognition of the need to reduce losses on railway working, if railways are to be preserved as an integral part of our transport system, and if those who are employed on railways are to be given that security of occupation which at present they do not have.  I, therefore, move this amendment in its present form but will move its further amendment in two respects on Report Stage &mdash;the reference to departments of the undertaking to include categories of workers as well as departments, and to delete that requirement of prior trade union agreement to reorganisation schemes.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty which will emerge in that regard and which perhaps I should mention now.  I am thinking of reorganisation schemes prepared in advance, schemes which will reduce the operating costs of C.I.E. by more than the costs of compensation to the workers who may be made redundant. There must be a gain by reason of the reorganisation scheme, and it may be necessary for me as custodian of public funds in this regard to make sure that the casual type of redundancy which inevitably arises in a major organisation employing 20,000 <Col N="893" /> workers will not be passed off as a reorganisation scheme, and that purely temporary reductions in the volume of work will not be so regarded either &mdash;reductions in the volume of work which in a railway undertaking may mean redundancy now and re-employment of workers at a later stage.  The type of reorganisation I have in mind is one that will have permanent consequences on the board's finances, and where the saving in costs will be such as to justify the putting on the taxpayers of this country the obligation to pay the generous compensation which is provided in this Bill to workers who may be made redundant.</P>
    <P>It would be unreasonable to provide compensation for the closing of lines and not to provide it for methods for working the lines as economically as possible.  I do not claim to be a transport expert.  Supposing there was a branch line railway which was losing money and which was employing 40 workers.  Supposing C.I.E. said: &ldquo;We cannot make that line pay, we think it can never be made pay&rdquo;&mdash;that would mean 40 workers would be redundant. They would be entitled to compensation under this Bill as it stands, but if C.I.E. said they can keep that line open by employing only 30 or 25 workers, as the Bill stood the ten or 15 workers rendered redundant would not be entitled to compensation, but under this amendment they would be entitled to compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me there are three prerequisites for the prospect of a successful railway undertaking in this country.  The first is competent management, the second co-operation between that competent management and responsible trade unions, and the third the need for public support to maintain railways as part of our transport system.  It was my experience in the Department of Industry and Commerce that trade unions catering for railway workers constantly complained about the frustration which they experienced in trying to get consultation with C.I.E.  That situation reached a stage in which I felt it necessary to assemble the directors of C.I.E. and put to them the need for close consultation with trade unions in <Col N="894" /> order to bring about a better spirit and better climate of understanding than appeared to be then present.</P>
      <P>I found the trade unions suspicious of C.I.E. management and I felt and said that as long as an atmosphere of that kind continued it was not possible to get the best out of management, on the one side, and the best out of trade unions on the other.  Standing back and looking at things objectively I always felt there were good grounds for the trade unions' feelings that they were not able to get frequent consultation, the open-hearted consultation, which they desired with C.I.E. management. This is not the time to apportion responsibility for that.</P>
      <P>What we ought to do is make up our minds that in future that kind of atmosphere will be eradicated and that the management of C.I.E., under this Bill, must be encouraged to carry the trade unions with them in their activities to present a better, more efficient and more economic transport system to the country.  Anything the Minister can do in that respect or anything the House can do in that regard to bring about the utmost co-operation between unions and management, which is so essential to provide more economic transport services than we have had in the past, will be welcomed. It is absolutely essential in any reorganisation such as C.I.E. contemplate that the maximum measure of co-operation should exist at top levels.</P>
      <P>I concede at once, however, that there are big difficulties in regard to such consultation in C.I.E.  There are very large numbers of trade unions catering for a whole variety of workers, and when they all attend a conference it can become quite formidable.  Formidable conferences of that kind comprising people with different sectional interests do not make agreement easy. It is because you have that hybrid character of organisation on the trade union side that need for consultation and carrying them with the management is more necessary than if you have got to deal with a single organisation in a single industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think C.I.E. have shown very great talents for managing the <Col N="895" /> peculiar difficulties inseparable from that type of trade union organisation, experienced in the railway system, which takes the form of a very large number of unions.  In Britain and other countries they have resorted to the idea of the working party as a kind of management-trade union combination which studies proposals affecting the industry and services.  These have been responsible for very valuable reports and have been responsible also for injecting a new understanding and a new sense of responsibility into management on the one hand and the trade unions on the other.  It might be well worth while getting that position examined so that some kind of committee could be established, representative of management and the trade unions in the railways, to try to give the community a better service, to try to make the undertaking more economic than it is and, at the same time, to try to make railway employment more stable and wages and conditions better than they are at present.</P>
    <P>Railway wages and conditions are by no means ideal and it could be very well argued that C.I.E., apart from getting subsidies in the form of cheques from the public purse, is also getting a subsidy in the form of low wages and unsatisfactory conditions so far as the workers are concerned.  The trade unions have a natural interest in building up an efficient transport service because it ought in the long run mean better conditions and wages, a better service for the community and taking off the backs of the public the constant liability of providing substantial subsidies for the maintenance of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>I do not think a railway system can live in a healthy climate when it has to have these frequent financial injections to the tune of £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 a year, not do I think it conducive to the growth of harmony and efficiency that there should be these frequent financial, surgical operations on C.I.E., when capital is written down and large slices of assets written off.  Anything which gives C.I.E. some form of freedom from these constant financial convulsions would <Col N="896" /> bring about a better atmosphere for the operation of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>I am at one with the Minister when he accepts the principle that there should be full co-operation between the trade unions and the management. That should be put strongly to both sides.  It is essential that the management should carry conviction to the unions that what is being done is done with a view to promoting a better transport service in which the interests of those who operate the service will be a matter of considerable importance to those responsible for those operations. With co-operation between the management and the trade unions, I could see a much better future for C.I.E. than if the feeling of discontent, distrust, and frustration continued on the scale which I experienced in my relations with C.I.E. and the unions catering for these workers.  I hope the Minister will emphasise that the community expects that consultation to take place and that be will be able to create a climate of co-operation and understanding which, as I said before, must in the long run pay dividends to the workers of C.I.E. and to the community at large.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke a moment ago of the abracadabra which transport companies try to build up in order to puzzle everybody and make their whole system of accounts a mystery.  I agree with what the Minister and Deputy Norton said but I think there is another side to the story in regard to labour relations.  I agree with the Minister and Deputy Norton that in this day and age in which we live no substantial enterprise can be successfully carried on without full understanding between the management and the trade unions representatives of the men.  I think the trade unions are an indispensable asset to a well managed firm provided all parties are prepared to act reasonably.  When Deputy Norton came to analyse the difficulties of conducting labour relations with the employees of C.I.E. he adverted to a fact to which I think the Trade Union Congress ought to address their minds.  It is extremely difficult to maintain satisfactory trade relations if, at every conference you call to discuss <Col N="897" /> them, there are 15 or 16 trade unions all appearing to represent the employees of one enterprise.</P>
      <P>People are human and if you have 15 or 16 trade unions it is quite likely that one trade union will bargain with another trade union to this effect: &ldquo;If you will help me to get the concession I want, I will stand with you to help you to get the concession you want.&rdquo; You have practically no firm basis on which to conduct intelligent and genuine negotiations with the trade unions representing the men.  I think that situation developed in the engineering industry in England to a point in which a step had to be taken to try to get some joint body to represent all the multifarious sections and negotiate for them.  Unfortunately, in England the Communists have got control of that particular body but the fact that the Communists have got control of that body does not invalidate the principle that if you have a group of decent unions, which being craft unions are small and numerous, amongst the personnel of the staff of a body like C.I.E., they could make a great contribution to the kind of improved labour relations to which Deputy Norton referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They could combine all the trade unions into one plenipotentiary negotiating committee.  If the unions would take that step then I think this House and the Government could say with much stronger conviction to the management of C.I.E.: &ldquo;We will hear with dismay and strongly disapprove of any failure on the part of the management of C.I.E. to establish satisfactory labour relations with the employees of C.I.E.&rdquo;  Until there is such a plenipotentiary body representing the multifarious body of craft unions that cater for the employees of C.I.E.  I think it is not fair to throw all the blame for misunderstandings that may have arisen and distrust that may exist between the trade union members on the management of C.I.E. I am quite certain that distrust and misunderstanding are not desired by the management of C.I.E.  I cannot conceive of any manager wanting to function on a basis of distrust of his own employees.  It is a matter of the utmost possible satisfaction for anybody <Col N="898" /> administering a business large or small to arrive at a stage when there is an atmosphere of mutual trust not only between the individual employees and management but especially between the trade union representatives of the employees and the management.</P>
    <P>I could expatiate on that at some length but I emphasise that it is of peculiar satisfaction to a management to feel that they are on terms of mutual confidence with the trade union representatives of their employees. I do not think it possible for C.I.E. or anybody else to arrive at that happy stage so long as they are required to negotiate with 16 or 17 trade unions all of whom claim the right to be represented at any general conference to discuss conditions for the whole body of employees of C.I.E.</P>
    <P>I should be interested to hear from Deputy Norton, if he felt free to say so, whether there is any hope that the Trade Unions Congress or the Congress of Irish Unions would be able to promote some plenipotentiary body which would represent the unions catering for the workers of C.I.E. so that responsibility might be squarely fixed on the right quarters for good trade relations in the future.  That is the first point.</P>
    <P>The second point which arises on this amendment is the whole question of redundancy.  I want to submit to the House that compensation for displacement of a worker from what he has regarded as permanent employment after the worker has passed the age of 35 or 40 years is impossible.  There is no use giving a man of 43 or 44 years of age, who has spent 25 years of his life in the railway company, a lump sum and telling him to go out and do the best he can.  Some of them may scramble into alternative employment but a considerable number will get no employment.</P>
    <P>Suppose you were approached tomorrow by a man who has been 25 years a railway porter, a worker in a machine shop or something of that kind; that he was 43 or 44 years of age and was looking for a job and for the same job you had applicants who were 22 years of age, malleable fellows who could fit into the organisation and take their place in the ordinary <Col N="899" /> hierarchy of seniority, who is going to choose a man of 43 or 44 years of age and give the job to him?</P>
    <P>I think people do not appreciate the immense hardship it is to disrupt a man's life, particularly when he has arranged his whole family affairs on the assumption that he has permanent employment of a specialised type and to come to that man in middle age and say: &ldquo;Look, there is a lump sum; go out and start life over again.&rdquo;  I do not believe any man can do it.  I do not believe you would ask a doctor at 42 years of age to look for work as an engineer or a lawyer or turn his hand to something completely new at that age and believe he would have any prospects of doing it.  It would be easier in a learned profession to do it that it is in a trade or craft such as the employees of C.I.E. fill.</P>
    <P>I want to impress upon the Minister that far from encouraging anybody to deal in terms of redundancy and compensation, all the pressure ought to be on the railway company and on the trade unions to avoid redundancy altogether.  By that I do not mean sitting down and saying that the existing number of men must continue to be employed no matter what the services are.  What I mean is that there retires from the service of C.I.E. a certain number of men.  That ordinary annual retirement would very quickly effect a reduction in the total staff employed by C.I.E. if recruitment were suspended.</P>
    <P>I know that means a good deal of adjustment and a good deal of co-operation, between the unions on the one hand and the management on the other, in order to fit redundant men into alternative jobs in the railway set-up but it can be done.  I would not hesitate in endorsing an arrangement whereby, if redundancy arose, and you had a man declared redundant who is entitled to £8 per week and the only vacancy available was in a post which ordinarily carried a remuneration of £6 5s.  I do not think it ought to be impossible to say to that redundant man: &ldquo;You will work at the £6 5s. job but we will continue to meet your present scale of pay until you graduate <Col N="900" /> out of the railway service&rdquo; rather than say to him: &ldquo;There is a lump sum.  Now you are 47 years of age, go and find another job.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As far back as 1950 I understood in any case that recruitment by C.I.E. was virtually suspended and that this device to which I refer was to operate.  I remember Deputy McGilligan, who was then Minister for Finance, speaking very strongly on the unspeakable hardship it was on a man in middle age to have his whole normal career disrupted and an illusory compensation handed to him.  But although that understanding was arrived at, I never saw since the slightest evidence of that scheme being put into operation.  As far as I could see, C.I.E. was daily recruiting staff every year on much the same scale as they recruited it in the past.  Has the Minister himself seen any evidence of an attempt to absorb staff in the way outlined by me or has he not been struck by the fact that the recruiting of staff seems to go on cheerfully? Far from suspending and manning vacancies by redundant staff we are building up a staff all the time.</P>
      <P>One of the most striking things in the Beddy Report is that it takes almost exactly the same number of clerical employees in the service of C.I.E. to-day to look after the operations of the railway company, the total employment in which has dropped by 4,000 since 1928.  The clerical staff seems to be rising steadily or certainly to be maintained.  However, the operation of that scheme to avoid redundancy is quite impossible without the active co-operation of the trade unions, and if trade unions do not agree with the view I express&mdash;and I suspect they do &mdash;there is no prospect of getting it to function satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we could get the co-operation of all the trade unions I believe we could avoid men being thrown out with compensation and secure for them enduring employment up to the normal end of their term.  At the same time, we <Col N="901" /> might get from the Trade Union Congress some method of avoiding the difficult situation mentioned by Deputy Norton in which you have 16 or 17 unions all represented in the conference room, with one board of directors or management trying to arrive at a basis of mutual confidence with them all, which as far as I know in my industrial experience is a virtual impossibility. If you are dealing with one body of plenipotentiary trade union delegates who are reasonable men, it is possible to achieve that basis of confidence which is the principal desire of the management of any enterprise, large or small.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot claim to put the trade union point of view, but I should like, from some experience in negotiations at particular times, to put an aspect of the points raised by Deputy Dillon which should be taken into consideration.  The first point is that we have a big number of trade unions.  We must work from the existing scheme of things and take that aspect into account.  It is a case of safety in numbers because if there are various craft or trade union organisations working in a system like C.I.E. and they have the prospect of direct negotiation or consultation so that they can report the exact result of conferences to their members, who are the people affected, and each craft can put its own viewpoint to the management, there is a better chance of retaining the confidence of the members and, in many cases, of avoiding disastrous fightning strikes which occur very often because the people affected feel that they have not available to them direct negotiation for the remedying of grievances.  From that point of view, the fact that each craft is represented is a safety valve in negotiations.  That has been my experience.  It is a desirable thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would take some time to achieve what Deputy Dillon has suggested.  It might be ideal, if it could be achieved, but it is practically impossible at the moment.  We must, then, take the units that are there and deal with them and with their grievances and try to give them an opportunity of negotiating <Col N="902" /> through their own representatives. That is the first point raised by Deputy Dillon.  His suggestion is ideal but is unattainable at the present time, with the existing scheme of organisation.</P>
    <P>Redundancy is always a very difficult problem.  It must be dealt with.  It is through the goodwill of the trade union leaders and their various representatives, the confidence that their members repose in them and the attitude in which representations are met by the management that will bring about the desirable results which the amendment proposed by the Minister is designed to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a first prerequisite to negotiation, that is, to put the undertaking in a sound and healthy condition.  Up to the present time, C.I.E. has been dragging on year after year, as Deputy Norton says, with doses of financial assistance. That created an atmosphere in which there could not possibly be useful and healthy co-operation between management and workers.  The first thing this House, through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, must do is to show the trade unions and their representatives that C.I.E., through efficient management and the co-operation of its employees, is in a position to run the national transport undertaking efficiently and economically.</P>
      <P>I am quite certain that if the workers see that the undertaking has a reasonable chance of success, that their employment is secure and the opportunity of earning a decent living assured, they will co-operate with the management.  It is quite impossible to expect more than a limited degree of co-operation between management and labour where the undertaking cannot be run efficiently and economically. It does not matter what business it may be, if labour and management get the impression that they can carry on only as a result of charitable donations and a low standard of wages for the workers, there can be no co-operation between the two arms of the undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Putting first things first, the first task of this House is to see that C.I.E. is given a chance to pull its weight and <Col N="903" /> to be efficient.  Thereafter, there is a good deal to be said for Deputy Norton's suggestion.  A working party or joint industrial council or, perhaps, a series of industrial councils, if it is not possible to have one group catering for all trade unions, would seem to be a very feasible way of ensuring co-operation between management and workers.  The first prerequisite is to show the workers that the management, first, are in a position to run the undertaking and, secondly, are competent to run it efficiently. That is why I suggest, putting first things first, that the House should apply itself to ensuring that this scheme, either in its present form or in an amended form, will go through.</P>
    <P>The question of compensation is always a difficult matter to assess. There is a good deal to be said for Deputy Dillon's point of view.  It is very difficult, particularly in the circumstances of our country, to take a man in middle life out of a position he has occupied for perhaps 20 years and expect him to get alternative employment. The only possibility I see is that, in the general reorganisation, assuming that C.I.E. will engage more actively in road transport as opposed to rail transport, men who are redundant on the railway will be given an opportunity of equal employment in the new developments.  We must face the fact that there is bound to be some redundancy.  In all justice, those who are declared to be redundant are entitled to fair compensation based on two things&mdash;length of service with the company and the age at which they are obliged to leave the company's employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that C.I.E. have successfully created the impression that, because of the multiplicity of unions within the organisation, any form of joint consultation or co-operation is well-nigh impossible. They appear to have successfully sold that idea to very many people.  We know, of course, that even in this country there are industries in which there are almost as many unions catering for the various workers as there are in C.I.E. and where there appears to be no such frustration in the minds <Col N="904" /> of the employers or employees regarding labour relations as exists in C.I.E.</P>
      <P>Does it not strike people that the unions catering for workers in C.I.E. are continually complaining about lack of co-operation and the need for joint consultation when the same unions have no such complaints about transport undertakings such as the Ulster Transport Authority and the G.N.R.? The same problems arise, the same types of workers are employed, the same grades of workers are employed and there is exactly the same number of unions catering for workers in each of these transport undertakings as in C.I.E.  Yet, the trade unions have not at all the same complaints to make regarding co-operation and joint consultation with the G.N.R. and the Ulster Transport Authority as they have in regard to C.I.E.  Is it not rather significant that, down through the years, the trade unions have had to say that they were not being treated as they should be treated by the management of C.I.E.?</P>
      <P>In the Beddy Report, it is stated that there was a regrettable absence of friendly co-operation between the management and the trade unions. Quite obviously, they appreciated that it was essential in the running of a successful transport concern to have that co-operation. Apparently, C.I.E. in their submission, had stated that the unions connected with C.I.E. were interested only in rates of pay and conditions of service and that in no way were they anxious to co-operate in the management and the good running of the concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be no harm to keep the record straight in this regard.  The impression has been created, that perhaps it is the trade unions' fault that we have not had this co-operation and that we have not had successful joint consultation in the railway industry.  As far back as 27th August, 1956, the Provisional United Trade Union Organisation wrote to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce and pointed out to him a long series of complaints and grievances which they felt had militated against the efficient running of C.I.E. and against <Col N="905" /> the harmonious relations that should exist between them and the management. The Minister at that time called a meeting, presided over by the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  At that meeting, both sides freely accepted the principle of joint consultation, and all that had to be done was to set up the necessary machinery to implement that principle. That was in August, 1956.  It has not yet been set up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would summarise the matter for the Deputy if I quote a letter which the Provisional Trade Union Organisation wrote to the Minister subsequent to the issuing of the Transport Committee's findings, and which I already quoted at column 1496, Volume 164, of the Official Debates of 5th December, 1957:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the 22nd August, 1956, the secretary of the Provisional United Trade Union Organisation wrote to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce drawing his attention to the series of complaints and grievances which had been brought to its attention and which militated seriously against achieving improved efficiency in C.I.E. and harmonious relations between the board and its employees.  At a meeting convened by the Minister and presided over by the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce, held on the 2nd October, both sides agreed to accept the principle of joint consultation between C.I.E. and the staff through the provision of regular means of consultation between the management and the staff and affording opportunities for co-operation ... The official statement issued after the meeting stated that the management would take all possible steps to implement this principle of joint consultation and that both sides undertook to approach the concept of consultation in a spirit of harmony and co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not until the 24th November, that the chairman of C.I.E. requested the Provisional United Trade Union Organisation to appoint <Col N="906" /> representatives to discuss with the board the way in which the question of joint consultation should be approached.  A meeting for this purpose was held on the 11th December at which the chairman of C.I.E. outlined the board's view as to how joint consultation should operate and the machinery necessary to this end.  On the 12th February, 1957, the Provisional United Trade Union Organisation wrote to the chairman of C.I.E. requesting that discussions with the unions concerned with the setting up of joint consultation machinery for rail operative and rail shop grades should commence as soon as possible, but it was not until the 10th April, that a meeting for this purpose was convened by C.I.E.  At the meeting the trade union representatives set out at some length the unions' proposals on joint consultation and a document incorporating these proposals was submitted to the chairman at that meeting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was 10th April, 1957.  The joint consultative machinery has not been set up since, despite the fact that on all occasions the unions have displayed their desire to set up that machinery. It was through their initiative that the Minister at that time called the meeting between the trade unions and the management for the purpose of setting it up.  Right down through the years, the present Minister and the previous Minister will agree, there has been a series of complaints from the trade unions regarding this notorious lack of co-operation and consultation between the management and the trade unions.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I can illustrate my point in this way.  We are in this House to-day discussing a Transport Bill which provides, amongst other things, for compensation for workers who become redundant because of reorganisation. On last Saturday, Whit Saturday, a group of C.I.E. workers were called before the boss and told that because of the reorganisation, as and from 1st June next, they were being reduced in grade and their pay was being reduced accordingly.  I understand that a similar group in Limerick received the <Col N="907" /> same message, on Whit Saturday, when it was impossible for them to contact their trade unions over the week-end, at a time when this House was discussing what compensation might be payable to them in such a case and without consulting the unions in any way.  They were only a small group of nine or ten people, but it illustrates the manner in which labour relations have been handled from day to day right down through the years by the management of C.I.E.</P>
    <P>I am glad to know that the Minister and everybody in this House are unanimous that there should be joint consultation and better co-operation towards harmonious working between the two sides of the industry, but from past experience I have my doubts whether it is sufficient for us all to express these sentiments and whether it will even suffice for the Minister to urge this joint consultation.  It is not much use accepting a principle, if the principle is not implemented.  I do not think it is possible to write into the Bill an obligation on the management of C.I.E. to set up some definite joint consultative machinery between the management and the staff, but if it were possible to write it into the Bill, I would certainly wish it to be written into it.  As I say principles are accepted, but not implemented and labour relations with C.I.E. down through the years have been notoriously bad, and it is significant that the unions have no such complaints to make regarding other transport concerns where they cater for the workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the views expressed by Deputy Casey and Deputy Dillon regarding the joint consultative council and also in relation to redundancy.  I shall take the joint consultative council first. Such a council is long overdue.  I have had the personal experience of acting as chairman of a body charged with the solution of disputes between C.I.E. and at least 12 trade unions.  I must admit that the delegates from the trade unions gave me, as chairman, every co-operation in my endeavours <Col N="908" /> to hammer out a reasonably good solution.  I am sorry to have to state that I did not get the same co-operation from a member of the C.I.E. management.  Most of the members of that management are all right, but the particular individual to whom I refer did not co-operate.</P>
      <P>The present Minister, his predecessor and other Ministers for Industry and Commerce spent much time trying to bring about harmonious relation in an endeavour to make C.I.E. a paying proposition.  The livelihood of the employees of C.I.E. depends upon their employment in C.I.E.  I do not know any employee of C.I.E. who would do anything which might jeopardise that employment.  There is urgent necessity, however, for establishing harmonious relations and goodwill between employees and employers in relation to C.I.E.  Some lead should be given in that regard.  I do not like to be uncharitable to anybody.  Unfortunately, my own experience has been that, instead of goodwill, I was faced with opposition.  Self-appointed dictators should be sent to some kind of school to learn something about human relations.</P>
      <P>I have come up against the same kind of thing in concerns other than C.I.E.  This is a small country and there is no reason why we should not have goodwill and a common understanding between employer and employee.  I have a great respect for the majority of the members of the Board of C.I.E., but one unworkable cog in a machine will upset all the works.  It is most disconcerting to find oneself up against an individual who, when one is trying to hammer out agreement, will take it upon himself to say: &ldquo;You can go to hell, or wherever you like.&rdquo;  It is only in this House that we have an opportunity of ventilating that kind of experience and publicising what we think of such individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very little use, as Deputy Casey has said, talking about setting up joint consultative councils if we do not have people of goodwill on both sides.  It has been my experience that, provided one shows goodwill, one will find a reasonable approach.  There is good in every organisation.  Redundancy <Col N="909" /> can cause a lot of hardship and it is in relation to redundancy that we shall need a joint consultative council. There will be, of course, the normal wastage that takes place in all big concerns.  No man who has given long and faithful service to C.I.E. should be made to suffer.  He should not be dismissed with a paltry pension in recognition of that faithful service.  He should get a full pension.  Otherwise, he will be looking for home assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spent years trying to solve the problem of C.I.E.  He has spent years in consultation with experts, with C.I.E., with the trade unions and all others concerned.</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy Norton quite silently.  Redundant employees with long service should get full compensation and they should not be dismissed without consultation with the trade unions concerned. If at any time the Minister finds this joint consultative council is not working properly, then he can nominate people competent to bring both sides together to find a solution for any difficulties that may arise.  A number of C.I.E. employees live in my constituency. I am familiar with their grievances and many of these grievances could be eliminated by goodwill <Col N="910" /> and a common understanding as between management and employees.</P>
      <P>I must pay tribute to the present labour relations officer.  He is doing an excellent job.  I have found him courteous, co-operative and helpful. It is men of his calibre we want if we intend to make a success of C.I.E. The lead must come from the top. Those who fail to follow the lead can be dealt with, and anyone who does fail is not worth his salt.  An honest effort must be made and where there is an unworkable cog in the machine that cog must be replaced.  I trust the points I have raised will get sympathetic consideration and I endorse the sentiments expressed by the two previous speakers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>In round figures, 18 or 19.  I appreciate that the amendment brought in by the Minister is an improvement on the Bill as introduced. This amendment is the direct result of talks with trade union representatives and the Minister's proposal to further amend on the Report Stage had the agreement and approval of the trade unions.  It is understandable, as the Minister has explained, that the trade unions would find themselves in a very awkward position if they had to openly, if you like, agree to the dismissal of workers in relation to schemes of reorganisation.  I suggest that events which occurred in Cork and Limerick on Whit Saturday give cause for reconsideration.  On Whit Saturday ten or 12 men were reduced both in status and in wages on the mere statement of a superior officer without any consultation with a union. As Deputy Casey pointed out, that was done at a time when the employees concerned could not get in touch with the union.  That kind of action gives unions second thoughts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that, prior to a further amendment on the lines indicated on the Report Stage, it might be desirable for the Minister to meet again the representatives of the unions and discuss the matter in the light of what happened over the weekend.  I appreciate, <Col N="911" /> and the unions appreciate, that this was not a scheme of reorganisation which would come within the scope of the particular amendment.  It is obvious that there is a general fear that co-operation will be lacking. Irrespective of whether or not trade unions will be formally asked to agree to reorganisation, I suggest a further amendment to make it clear that, before any reorganisation takes place, the unions must have knowledge of it, even if they are not asked to give prior consent to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is to a large extent based on hypotheses.  I suppose, because of its very nature, it has to be so based.  One thing that has struck me very forcibly is the degree of realism reached in the course of the discussion.  We cannot close our eyes to the fact that C.I.E.'s biggest liability is redundancy.  Anybody using the C.I.E. system between here and Cork cannot but be struck by that obvious feature.  It is apparent in every station along the route.  Deputy Dillon mentioned a simple solution and one worthy of consideration.  It is gratifying to find Labour representatives here who would apparently be quite satisfied with some arrangement on the lines suggested, namely, a negotiating committee to consider the problem.  What amazes me is that C.I.E. did not themselves advert to that possibility over the years.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to recruit young people into C.I.E. at the moment.  Any vacancies that occur should be reserved for redundant employees.  They should be diverted into these vacancies with a guarantee that they will not suffer financial loss or personal inconvenience. Possibly some amendment along those lines could be enshrined in this measure.  If the railways are closed, then alternative transport will have to be provided and it should be possible to absorb redundant employees into such alternative transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's announcement that he is prepared to make certain changes is welcome particularly in so far as he has indicated that one of the changes to be made will ensure <Col N="912" /> that those affected&mdash;not just by the closing of the branch lines but by reduced working on the branch lines&mdash; will not suffer.  I take it reduced working in any section will come within the scope of the Bill as a result of the Minister's amendment.</P>
      <P>On the question of consultation, it is important to have, and it would be valuable to insist on, the prior agreement of the trade unions as far as workers becoming redundant are concerned. He has indicated that he expects C.I.E. will be in constant consultation with the trade unions in relation to reorganisation.  One remark made by the Minister caused me some concern, particularly in view of the information that Deputies have given the House in relation to the manner in which C.I.E. management can operate without consultation or without any prior notice.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that, in general, the Bill was to deal with the position of workers who become redundant because of the introduction of a comprehensive scheme.  He said he could visualise, however, conditions under which there might be redundancy in some sections, due to a reduction in working, and in such circumstances he felt it would be his responsibility to ensure that the workers affected would not get the protection of this Bill.  I would ask the Minister to consider that position again.  It is possible that the operations and decisions of the board might lead to redundancy which, on the face of it, might appear to be casual, but which in fact would be of a permanent nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very interested in Deputy Dillon's brief advice to the trade union movement as to how they should conduct their affairs.  It appeared to me to come strangely from Deputy Dillon who, I have always gathered, is the advocate of the individual in this House.  He suggests to members of trade unions, who have a deep personal concern with the operations of C.I.E., particularly when those operations might result in their becoming redundant, that they should pass over their rights and responsibilities from their own officials and <Col N="913" /> committees to a plenipotentiary committee. Deputy Dillon makes everything very simple indeed.  I do not know whether Deputy Dillon has ever attended a conference with a large number of representatives, either of trade unions or of employers.  The fact that there are 17 different spokesmen does not necessarily mean that 17 different points of view are expressed at such a conference.  It often means that, although 17 different bodies are represented, the representatives of which have the duty to report back to their own organisations, there may well be only one effective point of view put forward.</P>
    <P>The difficulty of disposing of problems between management and workers within the C.I.E. organisation is not because there are 17 unions but because on the other side there is a reluctance to invite and welcome the active co-operation of the 17 unions representing all grades in C.I.E.  If the management of C.I.E. were prepared to have normal negotiations and consultations, I feel there would not be any great difficulty arising from the fact that the workers of C.I.E. are in a number of different organisations. The Minister can testify to that himself. In respect of certain clauses in the Bill, he had discussions with the trade unions, and, through them, the C.I.E. workers, and I do not think he had seven, eight or 15 points of view put forward to him.  If the powers that be in C.I.E. would follow that example, there would be much less trouble.</P>
    <P>We realise that the question of redundancy is a very serious matter for any individual worker, no matter in what part of C.I.E. he is employed. I think it is fair to say that if it were reasonably possible to ensure the operation and development of C.I.E. on the basis of keeping all those workers in full-time employment, it would be welcomed here by every Deputy.  Deputy Dillon suggested that recruitment should be stopped.  He said that a number of employees would be due to go out on reaching pension age, thus leaving gaps which should be filled, not by recruitment but by transferring <Col N="914" /> workers from the various grades.</P>
    <P>That suggestion might be examined, but I think there would be quite a number of difficulties and problems to be faced.  You are not dealing with a very simple organisation.  There are specialists in the various grades, the signal grades, clerical grades and the road undertaking.  There are craft workers in a number of these grades who have reached their present position because they have served their apprenticeship to their trades.  I am sure the Minister realises quite well that it would be difficult, if not impossible, in the case, say, of a redundant checker, porter or linesman, at a time when there was a demand for a skilled craftsman, to transfer such an unskilled or semiskilled man into that category.</P>
    <P>The same position could occur in connection with, say, the signalman. There are so many separate and distinct grades in the service that it would not be easy to make this transfer. Certainly, in proposing to adjust matters by way of such transfer, the representative unions would be involved and consultations would have to take place at I think all levels.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware of those difficulties and I do not think it necessary to point them out at any great length.  However, if it were possible to maintain the employment of as many of the existing employees of C.I.E. by that means, at the highest level, the very fact that the Minister brings this matter before us in this Bill would make it appear that he visualises that, even so, there is inevitably bound to be some redundancy arising from a change in methods, a change in services and a change in operations and that, therefore, this Bill is to deal with the situation of workers affected by such changes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment, we welcome the Minister's indication that he proposes to make some changes that will widen the scope of and give protection to further sections of workers. Again, I suggest that the importance of more active steps by the management <Col N="915" /> of C.I.E. to obtain the co-operation and assistance of the trade unions should not be overlooked.  I have no doubt but that, if C.I.E. want co-operation and assistance, they will get the whole-hearted co-operation and assistance of the various trade unions representing workers in the concern.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 13, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for the payment of compensation to employees who become redundant because of the switch-over from steam to diesel traction, the closing of a branch-line or now, as the section is amended, reorganisation.  Such compensation is payable only if a person becomes redundant for any of these three reasons within five years of the passing of the Act.  I am at a loss to know why the five-year stipulation should be here. From the discussion we have had so far on the Bill, it is quite apparent that none of us think all the worries of C.I.E. will have passed in five years' time.  The general view appears to be that in five years' time, while we all hope and expect that very great improvements will have been made and that C.I.E. will be well on the way towards the goal of being able to provide a proper transport system economically, very few of us feel they will have completed the task at the end of that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section stands, anybody who becomes redundant for any of these three reasons within the five years gets compensation.  Anybody who becomes redundant, arising directly out of the closing of a branch line or reorganisation or dieselisation after five years, according to this section, gets no compensation at all.  It may well be that a particular branch line may be quite economic for the next five years and that C.I.E. will leave it open.  However, there may be changing circumstances. Some circumstances may be brought to bear on the situation in five years which will make that line uneconomic and C.I.E. may be forced to close it.  According to this section, people who become redundant on the closure of that branch line get no compensation <Col N="916" /> because they did not become redundant within five years of the passing of this Bill, when enacted.  I am at a loss to know why the five-year stipulation was put in there.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at it between this and the Report Stage to see if he cannot qualify it in such a way as to cover people who would become redundant because of circumstances such as those I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are saying to C.I.E.: &ldquo;We expect you to make an effort during this period of five years to get the undertaking on to a basis where it will have eliminated losses and be able to continue to operate in an economic way subject only to such fluctuations as may arise from time to time because of changing conditions.&rdquo; We are also saying to C.I.E.: &ldquo;If, in the course of that reorganisation effort, you find you have to reduce permanently the number of persons employed on railway operation then we will not merely legislate to ensure that these persons will have a right to compensation on quite a generous basis compared, say, with the compensation payable in similar circumstances to employees in other public services but, also, we will place the whole cost of that compensation on to the shoulders of the taxpayer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am not saying that, at the end of five years, there will not be a compensation scheme.  I do not contemplate, however, that it will be a scheme which will involve making the taxpayer meet the cost.  I should hope that, at the end of that period, C.I.E. themselves would be able to carry the cost of any further compensation arrangements relating to redundancy which might then be considered necessary.  Indeed, it would I think be a normal practice in an organisation of this size to deal with any such problem, if it arises at all, through the normal wastage which occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular scheme of compensation&mdash;that is, compensation at these rates, the full cost of which will be carried by the taxpayers of the country &mdash;is a five-year scheme.  I am not saying there will not be any compensation scheme after that but, at that <Col N="917" /> stage, if the reorganisation is completed, the idea should be that we should get back to a more normal arrangement under which the cost of any future scheme of that kind would be a charge borne upon the company's funds and not by the taxpayer.  These are special arrangements applicable to this undertaking and no other undertaking and applicable to this period only.  We can justify it to the taxpayers on the ground that in the long run they will also save provided the reorganisation is completed and the losses are eliminated.</P>
    <P>When the reorganisation is completed and, as I hope, C.I.E. is established on a more secure economic basis then we can consider the legislation that may be necessary&mdash;if it is requisite at all to cover that in the future&mdash;but at that stage I would contemplate that the compensation provision for future redundancy of any special character would perhaps, say, be related more to that of employees in the Government service and particularly that the cost would be a charge upon the company and not upon the taxpayer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's point of view.  I am glad to hear him say he visualises compensation for people who will become redundant even after the five-year period.  I think it is not unreasonable to say that compensation should not be payable by the taxpayer but should be put on the shoulders of C.I.E. I think it is right that after the five-year period they should be charged with the expenses of redundancy but does the Minister not think it would be desirable to write that into this Bill&mdash;that the State would carry the compensation for five years and that subsequent redundancy which would arise after the five-year period would be charged to C.I.E.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That implies a little more optimism than I have.  My view is that we should give C.I.E. aims and powers to make their position better within this five-year period.  If at the end of five year we find the effort has failed, we could contemplate such an arrangement as has now been introduced in the Six Counties, the revision of the whole of transport policy, and <Col N="918" /> we could not contemplate the burden of any compensation being imposed on whatever transport organisation would be left at that stage.  I am hoping that we will see an economical transport system in operation which can look after its affairs from that on, but if it should be the reverse situation, it seems to me likely that Government financial help will be needed to deal with it.</P>
      <P>There are two objectives I have in mind and I do not want any of them put on the long finger.  I am saying to the company and to the trade unions that, provided they tackle this job in the five-year period, we taxpayers will help; we will give the redundant workers generous compensation but, if it goes beyond the five-year period, we will have to have another look at it.  However, the situation at the end of that time may be all right and we can go back to the normal practice of putting these charges on the company. On the other hand, it may be the situation that this programme may not succeed and we will have to think in a more fundamental way about our transport policy.</P>
      <P>The whole idea of the Bill is that within the five-year period they should make these efforts and it is to everybody's advantage that they should be made.  I do hope that at that stage the burden of compensation will be one for the company.  It may be at that stage that the compensation arrangements will be less generous than those contemplated in this Bill.  We are giving inducements to everybody to start tackling this job as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that as it stands the company, the unions and everybody concerned, would have every reason to try to get decision completed during this five-year period.  If the company were <Col N="919" /> going to close down a branch line they can say: &ldquo;Provided we close it down within the five-year period we will have this compensation charge transferred from our funds to the Exchequer,&rdquo; and the unions can say: &ldquo;If we co-operate in getting the thing done in that period we will make sure our workers will have a statutory right to compensation.&rdquo;  I admit we cannot allow decisions to go to the last stage, but if we decide to continue this arrangement a very simple one clause Bill would do it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may not discuss it at this stage. The amendment has been ruled out of order because it is outside the scope of the Bill, since it relates to the employees of a company other than C.I.E.  This Bill deals only with the reorganisation of C.I.E. and any amendment dealing with reorganisation of another company, or a supposed effect the reorganisation of C.I.E. would have on another company would not be relevant.  The Irish Railway Clearing House, as far as the Chair is aware, deals with a variety of transport and shipping companies, and acts as a liaison between them and it is not seen how the internal reorganisation of one of these companies could directly affect its operations. If, for instance, a number of the transport companies were being amalgamated, the position of the employees <Col N="920" /> of the Irish Railway Clearing House might conceivably be worsened as a result of that amalgamation, and an amendment on the proposed lines might be in order.  The present Bill does not effect any such amalgamation which would bring the clearing house into the picture.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), after &ldquo;period&rdquo; in line 17, to add &ldquo;and such service shall not cease to operate until, and unless, an alternative service shall have been provided by the board or by persons desiring to provide alternative transport&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister would clarify the position, perhaps I could withdraw the amendment.  The position under this Section is that the board shall not terminate a service or close a station to any or all classes of traffic, unless at least two months before doing so the board has published notice of its intention, and that notice shall indicate the new or additional road transport services, if any, which the board proposes to provide in the area.  If the board does not propose to provide them, they shall state that applications <Col N="922" /> for passenger licences may be made by any person desiring to provide them.</P>
    <P>If C.I.E. closes a service and does not wish to provide an alternative service, and publishes the notice I have mentioned, it would appear that a period of two months could elapse before the alternative service would be provided.  The district concerned would be without a service, due to insufficient time being allowed to private interests to provide it.  I want to provide that, until that alternative service is provided, C.I.E. will continue to provide the service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Deputy can have thought it out very carefully.  The effect of the amendment would be to ensure that C.I.E. could not close a branch line or station&mdash;in circumstances where they did not propose to operate an alternative service themselves&mdash;unless someone came in and said: &ldquo;We shall provide the alternative service.&rdquo;  If there were any local opposition to the closing of the branch line or station, it is almost certain that any person who would come in and say: &ldquo;I shall provide the alternative service&rdquo; would be most unpopular.  Pressure would be put on him not to provide it, because under the Deputy's amendment, if he did not do so, C.I.E. would be compelled to maintain an uneconomic service. The only way is that proposed in the Bill.  Under the proposed arrangements, they must give two months' notice, and wherever there would be objection to the closing, I cannot see circumstances in which an alternative service would not be provided.  To put in a provision which says that circumstances could in fact arise in which C.I.E. could not close a rail service, no matter how much money it was losing on it, would be completely unreasonable, and that is the effect of the Deputy's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4), page 7, line 24, to delete &ldquo;,if any,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is to compel C.I.E. to provide and keep a service going.  It visualises circumstances arising where they would close a branch line.  This is to ensure that if C.I.E. exercise that power, it will provide some other form of service. It will be the only undertaking which can be compelled to provide it. It is important that a public transport service should be available for the citizens in various parts of the country. It may be true that in certain circumstances some other concern would be prepared to provide it, but that might be done at a prohibitive cost to the citizens and the service may be entirely inadequate for those in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many parts of the country, and even parts of urban areas, where a single service cannot be economic, as it is serving a restricted area and a relatively small number of families. Nevertheless, those families are entitled to be afforded reasonable transport facilities.  If C.I.E. are permitted to close a branch line, without <Col N="924" /> providing an alternative service, the citizens may well suffer varying degrees of hardship.  That occurs whether it is the case of the carriage of passengers or goods.  No private transport service would operate unless it were to be profit making.  The Minister has indicated&mdash;and the House supports him&mdash;that he hopes, by certain changes, C.I.E. may be able to run as an economic unit, but the opinion has been expressed even by the Minister himself that it is only a hope.  It may be realised but I think the Minister would not like to make any prophecy.</P>
    <P>In this regard, there is a problem which will affect rural areas and communities more than others.  It appears to be most unfair to give to C.I.E. the power to close a branch line and deprive the people served by those services and, at the same time, to say to C.I.E. there is no obligation upon them to make any other means of transport available for goods and passengers in that area.  It is unfair to leave the citizens who will be contributing their measure of support to this £5,000,000 to the pleasure of an individual or company prepared possibly to operate a transport service on the basis of a profit without very much regard to what charges are imposed because the people will be completely dependent on and at the mercy of that individual or company.</P>
    <P>This is one of the general charges regarding the whole question of public transport, that it has been looked upon as a means of making a profit rather than as a means of giving service to the citizens.  This amendment is to ensure that if C.I.E. decide to close down a branch line, there will be an obligation on them to provide alternative transport in the particular area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister for an explanation in relation to the administrative method of procedure under this section, which must obviously have a very great bearing on the amendment?  As the section is drafted, if C.I.E. decide to close a branch line, they give two months' notice, and if they do not propose to provide an alternative service, anyone who is interested can apply for a <Col N="925" /> licence to operate in the area.  Is it the intention of the Minister to restrict the licence which he will give, to one person, to one licensee, or not?  I think it should be put very strongly that it should not be so restricted. If there is to be any monopoly in transport services in any area, it should be a State monopoly or not a monopoly at all.</P>
      <P>As the section is drafted, it is on the administrative method of dealing with the licensing of an alternative service that I would like this information. If two people apply to provide a service, will they both be given the appropriate licence if C.I.E. is not to provide a service?  If only one is given the licence, then that person will be the monopolist and in the position of being able to fix charges as he likes for the people in that area.  I do not think that is a situation we should allow to arise.  If it is understood that there will be no restriction to a single licence, then if he fixes his charges too high he will know there is danger of somebody else coming in to provide a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite possible to give a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer to that question.  In so far as the provision of an alternative road passenger service might arise, I would normally contemplate a single licence.  I do not think it is likely to arise often. I do not think it would be practicable to have two operators in an area where C.I.E. did not think they could make a service pay at all, under their method of operation.  In the case of freight services&mdash;and it is the question which is most likely to arise&mdash;there will be the right to carry freight for reward already held by a licensed road haulier. Normally, I would consider it preferable to meet such a case by extending the scope of the licence of the existing haulier, if that should prove to be necessary, to meet any particular problem that arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation is most likely to develop in circumstances where C.I.E. decide to close down a small intermediary station upon some line.  If a branch line is to be terminated, it is to be assumed that C.I.E. will have a <Col N="926" /> very lively interest in meeting the transport requirements of the area served by that branch line.  It is almost inconceivable that C.I.E. would not wish to utilise in full its right to provide alternative services.  The question is most likely to arise where some small station is no longer able to promote sufficient traffic.  If there is a transport problem in the area, which is not being met by existing services or licensed operators, it can be met by giving a new licence.  That is all we are taking power for here, to give new licences in these circumstances and releasing C.I.E. from the obligation that they must provide an alternative service.</P>

      <P>No, in circumstances where some service of a particularly local character is required which C.I.E. do not wish to provide.  The position is that at the moment C.I.E. cannot close a rail service without providing an alternative road service, whereas if a station had not been there, we could give a licence freely to a private operator. C.I.E. will not have to provide an alternative service, no matter how uneconomical it is.  We are taking power to do what we can now do, if no railway was in the area, to give a new licence or extend an existing one.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is giving hostages to fortune.  Once this Bill is passed by the Oireachtas, then its administration is in the hands of the C.I.E. board. Deputies cannot ask questions here on the day-to-day administration of C.I.E., once this Bill is operated by the directors of C.I.E.  What is the purpose of the Bill?  It is to enable the board to terminate any service of trains for passenger and merchandise, or either of them.  The board was told then they might not terminate the service, unless they were satisfied its operation was uneconomic or that the prospects of its continued operation would be uneconomic within a reasonable period.</P>
      <P>Every branch line is virtually uneconomic to-day because the heavy loss of C.I.E. is on the railways side.  The Dublin bus services and the provincial bus services make a profit.  C.I.E. road services make a profit.  All that profit, plus a subsidy of £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 depending on the year, is to be poured in to keep C.I.E. going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it relates only to railways.  Under our existing legislation, if C.I.E. closes a branch line, there is a statutory obligation upon them to provide alternative road services. In this Bill, we are tearing up the present statutory obligation which rests upon C.I.E. to provide alternative road services in lieu of the terminated rail service.  We are saying to <Col N="928" /> C.I.E.: &ldquo;If you do not like to provide an alternative road service, you need not do so.  Instead we will see if anybody else in interested in running a merchandise service or a bus passenger service over that route.  If anybody is so venturesome we will give him a licence to operate.&rdquo;  That is what is envisaged by the Bill.</P>
      <P>When you are dealing with a situation where most branch lines are probably uneconomic by any orthodox standard of accountancy, C.I.E. directors can be deliberately embark upon a policy of amputating all these branch line arms of C.I.E.; give notice of their intention to do so and there is no obligation on them to provide an alternative road service.  I agree that C.I.E. may say: &ldquo;We cannot make a success of that branch line, operating it as a rail service, but we think it would be a much better proposition economically, if we operated a bus service on the route.&rdquo;  C.I.E. will naturally want to substitute a road service for a train service in such circumstances.  There is no obligation on them to do so, unless they feel they will be economically rewarded by providing the alternative road service.</P>
      <P>So far as the public in that area are concerned, it may mean that if C.I.E. closes a branch line, there is no obligation on the only statutory body we have providing public transport, C.I.E., to provide an alternative road service.  The question as to what service will be provided, if any, depends upon the financial avarice of some people who may be willing to provide a bus service or a merchandise service, depending upon the reward they will get from its operations.</P>
      <P>It is a pretty big jump in this Bill to remove from C.I.E., the national transport authority, the responsibility of providing an alternative road service where they close a branch line. I think that one of these fine days many people in rural areas will wake up to read a notice by C.I.E. that they propose to close a branch line and there is no compulsion on them to provide an alternative road service.  I think the Minister is going too far in that respect, at this stage at all events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ought to give this new Bill a <Col N="929" /> trial, say, of 5 years.  With the new freedoms they get under the Bill and the generous financial assistance they get under the Bill an opportunity of operating in these new circumstances should be given to C.I.E.  If they close a branch line&mdash;that possibly may be inevitable in the light of the economics of branch line operation&mdash;we should not allow C.I.E. to get away from its present statutory obligations to provide an alternative road service.</P>
    <P>I think that is far too big a step, and far too drastic a step.  I am afraid it will mean for rural communities living in isolated areas that C.I.E., not having the obligation to provide an alternative service, may leave people in those areas to fend for themselves. The Minister is giving C.I.E. far too much power in this respect.  What the House has got to remember is that, once it passes this Bill, then its administration and all the decisions taken, so far as the closing of branch lines is concerned, will rest not on the House, not on the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but on those who will constitute the board of C.I.E.</P>
    <P>I do not know who they will be.  We have no experience of them.  We do not know what their mentality will be but the House is giving hostages to fortune if they give the board power to close down a branch line without the statutory obligation to provide an alternative road service.  We are taking this step too quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly contemplated that C.I.E. will in the future eliminate from the rail service any branch or stations which are uneconomic and where there is no prospect that they will become economic.  When they have decided to close a branch line or station, the question of alternative transport facilities in that area arises.  C.I.E., as the law stands at present, are obliged to provide alternative road services.  That has been a deterrent for them in some instances in effecting economies which they would otherwise have wished to bring about.  If they were not to provide an alternative road service, can we reasonably be sure that a road service suitable to the area would be provided? <Col N="930" /> The pressure is in that direction. This is not a case of trying to force people.  The entire pressure is for an extension of privately-owned transport services.</P>
      <P>There are at the present time a number of bus services operated by private companies in areas where C.I.E. were not prepared to provide a service.  Where they were not prepared to provide a service, a licence could be issued.  The only complication that arises in that regard is where the particular area has been served by an uneconomic railway.  If there was no rail service, there would be no problem. C.I.E. would provide the service. It was because there was a railway that the question arose.</P>
      <P>C.I.E. have the first claim with regard to the provision of transport services, but if they decide not to provide a service, somebody else can get a right to do it.  That will be given in the form of a licence under the Road Transport Act.  A passenger licence carries with it the control of charges made on passengers.  In the case of freight services, there is a number of privately-licensed hauliers who have got rights in respect of whole districts. In so far as there are not a sufficient number of them to provide the transport requirements of an area and where C.I.E. are not prepared to provide the requirements, licences will be given.  The problem is not to induce people to apply for licences.  Rather will it be to limit the issue of licences to the number which will permit the people concerned to get livelihoods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is certainly the denationalisation of C.I.E.  The Minister said the mere fact that they would have to provide such a service did not in the past stop them from closing down the rail service.  They would have had to provide the service at a loss.  Who will make a profit out of it if C.I.E., with all their organisation, getting everything at first cost, cannot make a profit out of the road service?  How is a private person to do it?  We know very well how it will be done.  It will be run on a cheap scale, without giving the amenities to the people that is expected of the service <Col N="931" /> provided by C.I.E.  The alternative will be that some private people will exploit the public of the area in the provision of a passenger or road haulage service at a charge which they will determine.  That is not, to our mind, what this Bill should be doing.  It is the complete reverse.  It is the end of C.I.E. as a national service and the introduction of private enterprise to exploit people who will be in the position that they cannot retaliate.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell us under what conceivable circumstances the private lorry owner could provide a service?  As I see it, C.I.E. will close a branch line and will have the first option to provide an alternative road service.  If they feel that it would be an economic proposition they will proceed to provide both freight and passenger road services.  The only conceivable set of circumstances in which they would refuse to do so would be where they felt that it would not be a paying proposition.  As Deputy Kyne pointed out, if C.I.E., with their vast organisation and facilities, cannot make a service pay, how does the Minister visualise that some private individual, starting from scratch, could feel that he could make it pay?</P>

      <P>The position will be that where C.I.E. close a branch line and feel that they cannot provide an alternative road service as it would be uneconomic, the people of the are will be left high and dry without a service.  At that stage, this House will <Col N="932" /> not be able to compel any private enterprise to provide a service.  The only transport organisation that we can compel to provide a service is the national transport organisation.  Our legislation up to now has been so designed that, even if it were uneconomic for them to do so, they have been compelled, as the national transport organisation charged with providing services, to provide that service and we should not deviate from that principle.  If we do, the dangers outlined by Deputy Norton will definitely arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the other way round.  The rail service from Cavan to Bundoran has closed down because of the Six-County Government decision in respect of their rail services and last week or the week before I issued a licence to a private firm to operate a seasonal bus service from Cavan to Bundoran.  C.I.E. having examined the position, decided that they were not interested.  Probably they felt they could not make it pay.  This private person thinks he can make it pay.  It is up to him to show whether he can or not.  By reason of the power I had to give that licence to a private individual in circumstances where C.I.E. was not providing a service, the people are getting a service that they would not otherwise have got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not clear that if C.I.E. abandon a railway line and say that it does not pay them to provide an alternative road service, the local people will be dependent upon the ability of some person to provide an alternative service for them?  I agree that, so far as the transport of merchandise is concerned, there is always a substantial collection of applications in the Department of Industry and Commerce for an extension of the area of operation and of the type of goods they are entitled to carry.  So far as that is concerned, probably the transport <Col N="933" /> of merchandise would be alternatively arranged all right.  I am not too sure that that is the position with regard to bus services.  There are only a few private bus services operating in the country.  I never heard anybody paying glowing testimony to their efficiency.  I suspect that that is not due to modesty alone.  If C.I.E. will not provide an alternative road service, we have to rely on some fellow being able to box the compass of accountancy in such a way that he will run an alternative service.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the passenger side. That person will run an alternative passenger service and the assumption is that that kind of person will be forthcoming. C.I.E., with all their transport talents and advice and long tradition and interconnected services, cannot make a &ldquo;go&rdquo; of a road passenger service in a particular area when they close a railway line but this unknown warrior, who has never been in the transport business before, comes along and says: &ldquo;I know where I can buy a second-hand bus and I shall run the bus and carry people.&rdquo;  The assumption underlying this section is that that kind of fellow will come forward. Of course, he may make a &ldquo;go&rdquo; of the thing financially by working people for 12 hours a day, in conflict with the Road Traffic Act.  He may pay them low rates of wages.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>C.I.E. can easily run ten-seater buses and, if ten-seater buses are economic, there is no reason why C.I.E. should not have them.  In the main, as the Minister well knows&mdash; as the Department well know, in any case&mdash;a lot of these privately-operated lorries are made possible of operation only because of the fact that people <Col N="934" /> work very long hours and are paid low rates of wages and no decent standards in respect of conditions are observed by many of those who employ labour for the operation of these lorries.  I agree that there are notable and noteworthy exceptions but quite a substantial number are operated on the basis of working people for ten and 12 hours a day and paying them low rates of wages, and no overtime. They have to take whatever the employer cares to give them.  Their operation is made possible only in that way.</P>
      <P>If C.I.E. is not compelled to provide alternative road services in lieu of a closed branch line, the people in the particular area will have to depend on that kind of fellow coming forward to carry at least passengers, whatever about goods.  I do not think that is treating the people fairly.  It is making third-class citizens of people who live in these areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about giving a licence to somebody to operate a bus service from Cavan to Bundoran.  You will get these exceptions, I know.  It seems to me that that would be a reasonably profitable route.  I do not see why C.I.E. would not be interested in it.</P>
      <P>Let us take an example close to home.  C.I.E. at present run a bus from the City to Rathfarnham and on to Whitechurch.  Suppose they say that it does not pay to run the service from Rathfarnham to Whitechurch and that they will stop at Rathfarnham, anybody who wants to travel on that bus can exercise himself in the future by walking from Rathfarnham to Whitechurch.  That is possible under this Bill.</P>

      <P>There does not seem to be much difference.  If you are deterred or prevented you do not do it; that is the gravamen of the case.  C.I.E. are getting powers which are far too wide. Many people stand in the danger of getting a raw deal under the provisions of this section and their sole hope of deliverance from inconvenience and hardship is the possibility that some individual may be found who can operate a bus service.  I am suspicious of a bus service operated by one individual who buys a bus on hire purchase, and who runs a service, working people ten and 12 hours a day.  I have never seen these services to be satisfactory and I do not think it a propersubstitute <Col N="936" /> for nationally owned transport such as C.I.E. is providing.  The Minister should keep upon C.I.E., for at least another five years, the obligation to provide an alternative road service.  We are travelling far too quickly and it is the public who will suffer for it.</P>

      <P>There are about 30 firms carrying on private bus services at the moment on routes on which C.I.E. are not prepared to operate.  I have never heard a complaint about one of them and some of them we know to be quite satisfactory services which have met a public need that C.I.E. was not prepared to fill because of certain difficulties about their equipment, their organisation methods or something of that kind.  The reason, for example, why C.I.E. would not run the service to Roundwood was that their standard bus would not run up the hills on the route.  That service was given to a private company.  It is being satisfactorily run and C.I.E. do not want to take it over because it would mean a different type of equipment. There are many small services run with small buses which do not need a conductor and on which it would be uneconomic to have a conductor.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>()  When the Minister grants a merchandise licence following an application made in accordance with sub-section (5), he shall grant adequate extensions of the conditions specified in such licences in respect of standard vehicle unladen weight, area of operation and classes of merchandise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> The purpose of this amendment is to enable the Minister to grant adequate extensions of the conditions specified in the licences.  I think most of us are familiar with the changes that are to be seen in the type of lorries and equipment at present in use compared with lorries and trucks of, say, 25 years ago.  As the law stands at present, under the 1933 Road Transport Act, although power is contained in that Act to grant certain extensions in particular cases, the overall weight is restricted, and in most cases the maximum overall weight is 2 tons 15 cwt.  In some cases, the extension varies for certain equipment, but, as I understand it, the present position is that modern trucks may have two-speed gear axles, helper springs, power-assisted steering, sack-loaders and more recently containers, which present a new aspect of the problem. Quite a number of lorries are now provided with containers.</P>
    <P>A specific case has brought this question very much to the forefront where a lorry owner was requested to weigh the lorry with the container and notice has been served on him drawing his attention to the relevant provisions of a Statutory Instrument, No. 13 of 1958, which was made by the Minister for Local Government and which obliges the owner to weigh the lorry in accordance with the relevant section of that Order.  I would, therefore, suggest to the Minister that adequate extensions should be given which will enable modern equipment to be used and enable lorries to be used that have these added facilities which make them weigh more than such lorries weighed 25 or 30 years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I also have tabled a motion to refer back this Vote and my reasons for doing so I hope to make clear in the course of the debate.  In listening to the Minister's opening speech, I did not know whether to be amused or amazed at the attempts he made to defend the record of this Department.  Unfortunately, there has been in our country for the past 35 years a reprehensible tradition for successive Taoisigh to appoint to this most important Department of State, probably the most important Department of State, the intellectual light-weights of the different political Parties, and the consequence of that policy over the years has been the end product of the Department's record in the education of our society and the creation of an educational system in our society.</P>
      <P>I say I was in doubt as to whether I should be amused or amazed at the Minister's attempt to defend the Department of Education.  It has without a doubt created as ramshackle. manifestly and demonstrably unjust an educational system as probably exists in Europe and in civilised societies generally.  Last year, the Minister clearly had little or no responsibility for the Estimate that faced him and the policy he had to enunciate.  Since that time, he has had an opportunity of bringing himself up to date on the facts of the position in his Department and so it has been all the more disappointing that a man such as he, whom all of us know to be a humane and sensitive person, an intelligent and educated man, after his 12 months' study of the position in his Department, should come in here and try to defend what I think I will show is indefensible, that is, the record of his Department's activities over the past 35 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been an unfortunate development in our political history that the younger generation seem to feel &mdash; I listened to the former Minister for <Col N="941" /> Finance, Deputy Sweetman, express this view &mdash; that they must appear to be willing and anxious to take on the burden of explaining away the product and results of the blundering leadership of the older generation over the past 35 years.  I do not think they need necessarily do that.  As I say, the disappointment in these circumstances is all the greater in that the present Minister, a young man, should appear to be content to follow in this tradition, that the Department of Education should be accepted amongst us as a sort of political Limbo. The penny catechism tells us that Limbo is a place or state of rest in which we suffer for a time before we pass on.  The Department of Education is a place or state of rest in which one need do little, or perhaps nothing, except allow time to pass.</P>
    <P>In this brief, the greater part of which was clearly a Departmental brief, the Minister discussed the evolution of the whole educational system here and mentioned, in passing, how little those of us who criticised it seemed to understand the intricacies and delicacies of that process of evolution. I am afraid I am one of the people not particularly impressed by this question of evolution.  I think it was Henry Ford who said that all history is bunk, and Napoleon said something about history being a collection of lies agreed on by society.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that all these things are irrelevancies.  Detailed analysis of the reasons why a particular system has evolved is irrelevant and certainly unimportant compared with the importance of the question of what the system evolved into.  We are more concerned with that because what it evolved into affects too closely the daily lives of too many people, young children, young adults, young people generally and society as a whole.  Just to preoccupy ourselves with what the Minister describes as the valiant struggles of his predecessors, the late Senator Moylan, Deputy Mulcahy and others in the Department of Education, is irrelevant.  We are not concerned that they struggled valiantly. We admire their valiant struggling and wrestling with the problems, but we must consider here whether they succeeded <Col N="942" /> or failed.  My contention is that they failed.  They failed in the primary function of an educational system which, it seems to me, is to develop the latent talent of the whole population to the maximum.</P>
    <P>Admittedly the Minister is correct when he says that the problems &mdash; I have no illusions about this, either &mdash; in the Department of Education, the problems facing us in this country, are problems which will not be solved overnight, but 35 years is a very long night.  We have not even begun to solve the problems of our educational system.  One of the most frustrating and irritating things about the Minister's statement is the appalling complacency which has epitomised these pronunciamentos so long as I have been interested in the question of education, at any rate, and probably for long before that also.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with Departmental responsibility.  I do not join with those who talk of Departmental policy. Government Departments, as such, have no direct influence or power in the final determination of Government policy or Departmental policy.  That is the very special function of the individual Minister and he must not derogate to his Department the responsibility which he himself must shoulder.  The civil servant in a democracy has no direct power or function in the final determination of policy and the general tendency which has developed in recent years of talking about Departmental policy and putting the blame for the defects in that policy and the failures of that policy on the Department is, in my opinion, a mean attempt to evade putting responsibility where it really belongs, namely, on the shoulders of the Minister concerned, be he the present Minister or a former Minister in some other Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take responsibility for policy.  The failure of the language revival is due to ill-considered Ministerial policy.  If our children are semi-literate, or illiterate, it is because of ill-considered Ministerial decisions over the years.  It is a cowardly thing for people to indulge in this forms of attack on those who are not in a position either to defend themselves or to <Col N="943" /> reply.  I make no imputation on the people in the background who have to carry out their function under the authority of the political head of their Department.  Anything I say is directed against the failures of successive Ministers in successive Governments.</P>
    <P>The Minister's main contribution in this Estimate is confined to the removal of the ban on married women teachers. That is his sole contribution to the creation of a just, equitable and efficient educational system in our society.  He has been critical of his critics.  He appears to be irritated by his critics.  He says in the course of his speech: &ldquo;It begins to be a matter of concern that persons who should know better rush into print or engage in public outpourings without first ascertaining the facts.&rdquo;  I hope to give him a number of facts, facts upon which I shall base my case against the Minister.</P>
    <P>We politicians are prejudiced in many of our political views.  In order to support my contention as to the failings of the Minister, I shall quote an authority for which the Minister appears to have a considerable regard. He has referred in his statement to the I.N.T.O. attitude on the language as being a definitive one in relation to the language.  I am sure he will equally accept it as being definitive in relation to the whole question of education to-day.  We all have a right to our political opinions, but they may be biased, and I should like to quote now a few statements made from time to time by the I.N.T.O. to support my contention that our system of education is much more seriously defective than the Minister appears to think.</P>
    <P>The I.N.T.O. compiled an excellent little booklet called &ldquo;A Plan for Education&rdquo; and some of the things they said in it are, I think, relevant. At page 15, they said: &ldquo;There must be a reform of our educational system if we are to survive as a nation with a distinctive culture.&rdquo;  They say: &ldquo;Other countries have found it necessary to recast their educational system&rdquo; and they mention Britain and Northern Ireland.  They say: &ldquo;Ireland needs a new deal in education.&rdquo;  Further: &ldquo;Primary education should be the foundation stone and not the poor <Col N="944" /> relation with the largest classes, the poorest buildings and equipment, the worst paid teachers.&rdquo;  They go on to say: &ldquo;There must be a natural progression from primary to post-primary based on the aptitude and ability of the pupil.&rdquo;  Further: &ldquo;There must be an extension of compulsory schooling for all to the age of 16, with the provision of further education for those who wish to avail of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody could controvert those statements.  They also say, and I think this is significant in view of the persistent complacency of successive Ministers for Education in relation to our educational system: &ldquo;Our whole educational set-up still suffers from the hardships which beset it all through a century ago.&rdquo;  But the most serious of all the charges is: &ldquo;For the vast majority of our citizens formal education still ends at the primary schools.&rdquo;  That is probably the most serious failing of our educational system and the egregious complacency of successive Ministers for Education in face of those facts is something I find it difficult to accept. It was in some ways understandable in a generation which had grown up in different circumstances.  They interpreted conditions of life as they were in their own time.  They might be forgiven for having a different attitude to education generally.</P>
    <P>I do not think there can be any defence for the Minister's self-satisfied apologia for the Department of Education. He has been critical on foot of the suggestion that there have been critics of the educational system generally who have not bothered about the facts, &ldquo;without first ascertaining the facts,&rdquo; as he said.  May I let him have some facts about our educational system?  A few Departments lend themselves more to this reproof of the failure of the Department than the Department of Education.  However, plenty of facts are available to demonstrate clearly to anybody with an open mind, an objective mind, that the Department has more failures than the Minister was prepared to concede.</P>
    <P>The first and most important recommendation made by the Council of Education, which does not appear to <Col N="945" /> have influenced any Minister in the Department of Education, is the perfectly reasonable suggestion that about 30 children is the most reasonable size of a class.  The I.N.T.O. carried out a survey.  They found that there was universal agreement on the question of the size of classes.  As far as its planning is concerned, and certainly as far as the Minister's recent declaration of policy is concerned, it would appear that the Department of Education is relatively unconcerned with that recommendation or with the reasons why it was made, that is, that the desirable figure for a class should be in the region of 30 children.</P>
    <P>In 1947, the average number of children in a class was 35.  In 1956, far from the Department of Education or successive Ministers attempting successfully to deal with the high figure for classes in schools, the number was 37.  This is not a simple question. There has been a very widespread depopulation of rural Ireland and, consequently, there are many rural schools with a relatively small number of children in the class.  Consequently, the figure in city areas such as Dublin, post-war, does not hold.  In the Dublin County Borough, the average figure in 1957 was 47.  An average figure of 47 means that there are classes in which there are 50, 60, 70 and possibly more than 70 children.</P>
    <P>I tried to find out by way of parliamentary question the greatest number of children in any class in the country or in the cities.  The Minister has given me to understand that he has no knowledge or that he cannot find out if there is a class, say, of 100 or 110 children.  I think that is very wrong. It amounts to irresponsibility on his part that there could be such a class in the city area and that he is unaware of it.  I do not know of one myself. However, where you have an average figure of 47, I think any figure is possible.  Consequently, under circumstances such as those, the Minister should take pains to find out whether there is an excessive number of children in any particular class in the city area so that, in that particular case, he might take very special measures to deal with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> There are many obvious objections, even by people who are not professional educationists, as I am not, to overcrowded classes.  Incidentally, the average figure for secondary schools is relatively tiny.  It is something in the 12-20 region; I am not certain, but I know it is very small, and rightly so.  It is clear that, in an overcrowded class, there are many obvious consequences &mdash; the possibility of ill-health, the great strain on the children and on the teachers.  A teacher has to face the difficulty of keeping order in a large class with a number of children of different temperaments, different backgrounds and different degrees of intellectual ability.  That leads to the position where the teacher has a chance, it seems to me, of deciding whether he will bring the class along at the rate of the most backward or the slowest child or else go ahead with the brightest children in the class in order to try to get good examination results.  The consequences are obvious.  By going ahead at the slowest rate, the intelligent child is slowed-up unnecessarily.  By going ahead at the rate of the fastest child, the backward child ends up illiterate. That seems one of the obviously serious consequences of the big class.</P>
    <P>I understand that, because of the number of small rural schools which we have, in two-teacher schools in rural Ireland the teacher has the difficulty of trying to be responsible for a number of classes.  Clearly, where there is a relatively small number of children and only two teachers he has to be able to teach the different classes in these schools.  Consequently, there is even a greater case in the Republic for the small class than there is in many of the continental schools which are very big and where, because they are big, they can have more teachers and, because there are more teachers, they can break down the number of classes for which they have to be responsible. Everything is against the high figure we have at present for the average number of children in a class.</P>
    <P>One of the by-products of overcrowded classes is that too many children do not reach the standard which is aimed at by our primary schools &mdash;<Col N="947" /> and, God knows, that is not a very high standard.  I understand that the number of children who do not reach the sixth standard or who do not pass the Primary Certificate, between the two of them, is something in the region of 20,000 children altogether.  Twenty thousand and 500,000, presumably, is not relatively high but I think it is, nevertheless, too high.  There is a good case why the Minister, on many counts, should try to deal with the question of overcrowded schools.</P>
    <P>The other point, which I shall deal with later, is the fact that, out of the overcrowded school, follows the consequence that the teacher must rule, practically inevitably, be fear.  That brings in the question of corporal punishment, and so on.  The teacher can hardly be blamed.  I am completely opposed to corporal punishment but it is understandable in certain circumstances if he is to prevent bedlam breaking out altogether and to keep some sort of order.  Possibly he must resort to some form of corporal punishment. I could not agree with it under any circumstances, as of course he should not be placed in that position and, if he is, the child should not be the one to get hurt because we have failed to remedy that situation in the school.</P>
    <P>The Minister's sole contribution to the solution of that problem has been the inconsiderable suggestion in relation to the married teachers.  It is a relatively unimportant suggestion. He appears to be awestruck and overcome by the audacity of the suggestion that the ban should be removed.  I have an open mind on this question and do not want to be dogmatic about it. However, the Minister has done it, for better or worse, and presumably it is acceptable.</P>
    <P>I understand there are about 400 teachers who will be released, for the improvement of the average number of children in the schools.  Am I right in saying that, if these 400 are put into teaching circulation, it will reduce the average number of children-teaching by about half of 1 per cent?  There are 13,000 teachers and 400 injected will, <Col N="948" /> if my mathematics are right, improve the position by about half of 1 per cent.  Would it follow that the average number will be reduced from 37 to 36½ or 36?  If so, it does not reduce the average to the 1947 figure.  If the Minister thinks this is a particularly audacious achievement, he ought to accept that it is really a relatively unimportant one.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that he has failed to give any answer or policy on the question of school building.  He made a passing reference to the Board of Works and said, on page four of his statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only limiting factor is the capacity of the Office of Public Works in the matter of dealing with their end of the school building programme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Their end of that programme, as shown in February, 1958, in replies to Parliamentary Questions asked by me, is that the grants sanctioned by the Department of Education but not spent by the Board of Works, in 1953, amounted to £1.9 million; in 1955, £3.2 million; and in 1957, £3.9 million &mdash; nearly £4 million.  That was work which had been sanctioned by this Department but where the money was not spent by the Board of Works.  Obviously, there is an important factor there &mdash; the incapacity of the Board of Works to deal with the matter of school buildings in the light of those figures.  I do not know how the Minister can continue to accept complacently the complete failure of the Board of Works to deal with this question.  It is clearly one which has not been dealt with by the successive Ministers.  In 1947 &mdash; ten years ago &mdash; there were about 600 schools which needed rebuilding.  In 1952, the late Senator Moylan said there were 400 schools absolutely derelict. In 1955, he said that 1,000 schools were unfit for human habitation and his break down of the figures then was 800 requiring replacement and 200 requiring major repairs.  That still comes to the figure of 1,000 which would probably be accepted by most parents and medical officers as being unsuitable for use as schools.  That 1,000 compares with 600 in 1947.  If you take the smaller of the former Minister's figures, <Col N="949" /> it means 800 requiring replacement in 1957 as compared with 600 in 1947. Those are incontrovertible Ministerial facts which add up to one thing, the demonstrated incapacity of the Board of Works to deal with this problem of school building, providing new schools where needed, and replacing those which need replacement.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister tolerates this position.  The reason for this complete failure, for the fact that there are at least 200 &mdash; and more than likely 400 &mdash; requiring replacement now, after ten years of effort by the Board of Works, is the lamentably low rate of building.  The figures for the output of the Department over the years, on a nine-year period, are 46 to 56.  The average figure is between 46 and 50 schools a year built by the Board of Works in a nine-year period.  Side by side with that, we must consider the fact that the average life of a school is about 100 years.  I understand that the number of schools which come into need of replacement each year is about 50, so successive Ministers have been marking time and making no progress. It is no surprise, then, to find that the 600 in 1947 is 800 or 1000 in 1957.</P>
    <P>All that surprises me is that the Minister, who must be much more closely aware of these facts than I could be, could come to the Dáil and try to defend the activities of his Department over 35 years and join with the late Senator Moylan and with Deputy Mulcahy in appearing as the people who valiantly wrestled with their job.  It is up to him, surely, to alter the irrefutable facts which face him, that his Department has not successfully wrestled with the defects and has not succeeded in seeing that the children go to school in conditions of reasonable comfort in which their health will not be jeopardised, where it will be possible for them to study under good lighting conditions, good seating conditions and good and safe sanitary conditions, so that they may be properly educated and so that the unfortunate teacher may have an opportunity to teach in a school he need not be ashamed of, where he will not feel, as so many do, a sense of utter disillusion and frustration at <Col N="950" /> having to teach in some of the hovels we see around us.</P>
    <P>If there is a net gain of 50 schools a year &mdash; I understand there is not, but even if there is &mdash; and if 1,000 are needed, it seems to me that, without bothering with redundancies, it will take from 15 to 20 years before these derelict, dilapidated or defective schools will be replaced.  That means, taking eight years for a child to go through, two generations of children who must sit in these schools and suffer.  It also means these teachers must spend their lives teaching there. I do not know how a Minister with any sensitivity or understanding of human problems &mdash; as I conceive the Minister to be &mdash; could contemplate this position and give to us, as his contribution to this serious matter, the removal of the marriage ban.</P>
    <P>There is the practical side of it that the children will be better and more efficiently educated and that the teachers will be more efficient and under less stress and difficulty.  There is another consideration which would commend it.  A lot of social building has been going on over the past 25 years, magnificent social building which the Minister for Lands recently regaretted because it had gone to vast slum clearance, the replacement with houses, the magnificent housing projects, due to the activities of successive Ministers, including the late Deputy Murphy, and also including Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Seán T. O'Ceallaigh when they were Ministers. This, together with the hospital building programme, is coming to an end. Therefore, there is a good case for a reconsideration of the rate of school building.  It is social building, but the Minister for Lands would not care for it because it is non-productive capital investment; but most of us here on all sides would not share his point of view and would think it necessary and desirable building.</P>
    <P>Since it is needed, first of all, on humanitarian grounds, as well as on grounds of efficiency, there is a good case for increasing the school building rate.  Furthermore, there is a great falling off in the building trade generally.  I understand all the arguments <Col N="951" /> about too much non-productive capital development being undesirable in our society, but with the falling off in hospital and house building programmes, there is a good case to be made for reconsidering the whole question of the school building programme.</P>
    <P>The building trade is going through a tremendous depression at the moment.  Many fine building firms, small and large, are having a tough and difficult time.  Unfortunately, in the past ten years we have lost many of our skilled craftsmen &mdash; builders, carpenters, painters and others &mdash; probably for good, and we are losing more. Many builders find they must go out of work altogether.  Here is a sum of £3,800,000 sanctioned by the Departmen and presumably available.  Presumably, the Government would find the money if the bottleneck of the Board of Works could be overcome. The work of building schools is necessary from the points of view I have mentioned, but it would help also to resuscitate the building industry and keep a hold on more of our craftsmen. I recommend the Minister to reconsider the matter.  There is no difficulty in getting the work done.  The building trade is waiting and can cope with it.  The craftsmen will be found. Houses and hospitals were built and these schools can be built also, if the Minister really wishes to do it.</P>
    <P>As to the suggestion that the shortage of trained teachers could be dealt with by the removal of the ban, it should be remembered that all the Minister is doing in rescinding this Order is the revocation of what was clearly a mistaken decision on the part of one of his pedecessors.  This is really the removal of a mistake made by one of his predecessors.  That is relatively unimportant, except that I think that it should be borne in mind, if the Minister feels that his name will go down in history as having made a notable contribution to the advancement of our educational system.  It is merely rescinding a mistaken decision of one of his predecessors.  I do not want to go into the question of its wisdom.</P>

      <Col N="952" /> I welcome it because it seems to me it will ease to a very slight extent the serious need for additional teachers. On the question of the need for a greater number of teachers, the facts clearly show that the Minister in his decision has made only the most miserly contribution to easing this problem.  The position is that there are 13,000 odd teachers altogether and of these, 10,000 odd are trained and the rest are untrained.  That is a very high percentage of untrained teachers. Of these 3,000 untrained teachers, 60 per cent. have been teaching for 13 years or over.  It seems to me that this is a very long time to permit that position to obtain.  In passing, I should like to say that I know untrained teachers who are, so far as I can judge, of the highest calibre and excellent teachers in every way.</P>
    <P>I think after 13 years of teaching, under the circumstances in which an untrained teacher must teach &mdash; of a relatively poor salary, insecure conditions of employment, and the conditions regarding superannuation and pension rights &mdash; that most of them tend to become very efficient teachers.  Consequently, I do not want to be taken as criticising them in any way.  There are, however, these 3,000 untrained teachers and the Minister has not suggested that he is going to discontinue this practice of recruiting untrained teachers into our educational establishments.  He tells us that he will add into circulation about 400 married teachers and he has refused so far as I know to consider a suggestion which I made and which I would like to make to him again on this question of the untrained teacher.</P>
    <P>We must accept one of two things. Either the untrained teacher is as good as the trained teacher, in which case it would seem to me that you should not ask anybody to train as a teacher, and if he is not as good as a trained teacher, then you should not continue to recruit him to teach our children. You have got to make a clear-cut decision on this question.  I know that to a certain extent it is not as simple as that.  I know that there has been this apprenticeship system in the past <Col N="953" /> in most of the professions over the years.  It existed in dentistry, law and medicine.  It was a clear condition that one could apprentice oneself to an apothecary and then in time was accepted as qualifying.</P>
    <P>That has held on too long in the teaching profession.  I believe the time has come when the Minister must make a break and must come to his final decision that the trained teacher is obviously the only teacher who should teach our children, who should be allowed to teach our children.  At the same time, there is a human problem in relation to untrained teachers and the human problem clearly cannot be dealt with in an autocratic or harsh way.  Would he not consider that in the 60 per cent. teachers who have 13 years or more we must accept those who have ten years or more, as trained teachers, accept them into the category of trained teachers and give them the status of trained teachers?  That would give him about 2,000 additional trained teachers, which is a substantial number. As to those who have not qualified after ten years, give them a period of five or ten years in which they must become qualified.  The third point is to refuse to recruit any more untrained teachers.</P>
    <P>I do think that there is an irrefutable case for some final decision on those lines, at this stage of the development of our educational system, to accept those ten years as being practical training and as adequate training in present circumstances, and those with under ten years' practical training should become trained in a formal way in the training schools, and lastly that we cease to recruit untrained teachers.  If we continue to accept the &mdash; unacceptable to me &mdash; anomalous system that you have people teaching children who are untrained, who make no pretence at being trained, and who are working side by side with people who have gone through all the difficulties, expense and delay of the training colleges in order to become trained teachers, then, as I said before, either the trained teacher is the most desirable person to teach our children or he is not.  If he is, <Col N="954" /> then we must logically take this this decision in relation to the untrained teacher.  If you do not take this decision, I do not think the decision in relation to the marriage ban will go near solving the problems, that is, if we are to bother ourselves about the recommendation of the Council of Education.</P>
    <P>If we are interested in establishing a good educational system, and if we want to carry out what is the professional and well-considered recommendation of a responsible body like the Council of Education, that you should reduce the present overall average figure of 35 or 36 &mdash; 47 in the Dublin County Borough &mdash; in the school-rooms, down to the 30's, we will need 4,000 teachers in addition to the 13,000 who are teaching at present.  The Minister's problem then seems to be that in addition to the 3,000 untrained teachers, there is also need for 4,000 additional teachers to carry out the recommendations of the Council of Education, so that the real needs of the Department of Education are that we should train an additional 7,000 teachers.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to deal with Questions Nos. 15, 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>In September, 1956, the Commissioner approved of a proposal that the room known as the library at Garda headquarters, which had previously been used for a variety of purposes, should in future be reserved for conferences, selection boards, examinations, lectures and similar official purposes.  In pursuance of this decision instructional classes which were being held in the library were changed to other rooms, and a room was allocated for the use of a Catholic organisation which had been holding its meetings in the library.  Various items of equipment were removed from the library to other rooms and arrangements were made to have the picture referred to moved to the room allocated for the use of the Catholic organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No protest or representation of any kind was received by the Commissioner until this year, when an individual member of the Force made a suggestion that the picture should be replaced.  On inquiring into the matter then, the Commissioner ascertained that the Catholic organisation were not using the room which had been placed at their disposal, and that while the <Col N="964" /> picture had been removed from the library wall it had not been hung in the new room, but had been left behind a screen in the library.  He then directed that it should be restored to its former position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole of this matter of the immediate needs of the educational system depends on the importance that the Minister attaches to the recommendations of the Council of Education.  If his attitude is to dismiss or ignore them as being unimportant and not worthy of serious consideration, then his declaration of policy in his Estimate statement is understandable.  If, on the other hand, he recognises the Council of Education as composed of persons of the highest standing in the educational world, whose opinion is worthy of consideration, then it seems to me that he has a responsibility to outline in his statement of policy even a long-term series of proposals which could be accepted by most of us as being likely to deal with the problem before us.</P>
      <P>Of course, the Minister's answer to me might be that, if we are prepared to take a sufficiently long view, his proposals might be considered to solve the problems before us, particularly if they are taken in conjunction with the likely rate of continued emigration from the country and the existing educational system which will, no doubt, provide us with 30, 25 or possibly 20 children in a class.  However, I do not think the Minister has that solution in mind as one most likely to commend itself to him in the treatment of our educational problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you set up a council of this status and authority, consisting of persons of <Col N="976" /> the highest sense of responsibility and if they do make a recommendation of any kind, you are bound to accept it. If you do accept it, then in order to get the rate of pupils per class which they recommended as being the most desirable, 30, then you have to find 4,000 new teachers and in addition to that you have to train 3,000 or else accept the suggestion I have made to the Minister in relation to the 3,000 untrained teachers.  These are the hard facts which the Minister said nobody had quoted.  The hard facts are that you need 7,000 trained teachers in order to implement the recommendation of the Council of Education.</P>
    <P>In order to meet this suggestion of the Council of Education, the Minister has put forward this very lame solution to the problem by repealing the marriage ban, which will give you 400 or 500 teachers.  Then, by increasing the annual recruitment rate, you will get something in the region of 80 teachers.  In order to understand the full implications of that we must remember that the output from the training college in the years 1956-57 was 400 teachers and that the wastage, through retirement from age and other reasons, was 340 odd, which gave you a net gain of about 60.  Sixty plus the new 80 teachers, which I assume is an additional 80, gives us about 140.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Sixty is not a net gain.  The Deputy is under a misapprehension there.  That figure is reduced by the number of new posts becoming necessary to be filled.  It is a point against myself and in favour of the Deputy's argument.  Sixty is not a net gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I am under a misapprehension.  Let us say the net gain is 100 new teachers into the college in the year.  Am I right in suggesting that one would take 70 years in order to provide 7,000 teachers and to implement the recommendation of the Council of Education at present rates in relation to the training colleges?  I do not know how the Minister could accept that rate of training in the colleges.  It is quite clear to me that as in the case of the <Col N="977" /> school building programme, it is grossly inadequate and the situation can only be remedied by a revolutionary approach to the problem. However, it is not by any means insoluble.  There are many possible solutions to it.  The most important and immediate is the one I have suggested which would give him an additional 2,000 trained teachers, that is, to recognise the 60 per cent. untrained teachers who have been teaching for ten years or more.  That would bring the total figure up to about 15,000.</P>
      <P>At present there are about 111,000 children in our schools who are being taught by untrained teachers.  That is a considerable proportion out of the 500,000 children who are in our schools. I do not think I am over-colouring the picture in any way.  These are incontrovertible facts.  They may be slightly one way or the other but, broadly, they are true and do point to a very grave defect in the educational system.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister has only two courses open to him, either to increase the number of training colleges very much&mdash;indeed, to double, treble or quadruple them.  That is not insuperable. It is merely a question of buildings and personnel, of neither of which is there a shortage, in order to provide the teachers in a relatively short time. The other suggestion is to accept the 2,000 untrained people to whom I have referred.  I do not think he could make many mistakes in relation to those teachers.  A number of them I know myself are persons who are effective and efficient teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did suggest that the I.N.T.O. were not in agreement with the suggestion about these untrained teachers.  I do not know whether or not that is true.  However, in view of the seriousness of the situation and the grave need to deal once and for all with the question of untrained teachers, would he not consider asking them to think this matter over once again?  The dental, legal and medical professions are no longer hampered in this respect.  When I was in the Department of Health I was responsible for making that final break with the old apprenticeship system in the dental profession, but the time has <Col N="978" /> come when we should abandon this apprenticeship type of training for the teaching profession and insist that within a reasonable period, say ten of 15 years &mdash; some figure fixed by the Minister &mdash; there shall be an end to the recruitment of the untrained teacher and that all our children shall be taught by trained teachers.  That seems to me to be a reasonable proposition.</P>
    <P>It is based on the thesis that the only person fully competent to teach a child is a fully-trained teacher.  If we do not accept that, we abandon the whole idea of training our teachers and that would seem to imply a criticism of trained teachers.  I believe this is a problem which the Minister should consider seriously.  It should not be a particularly costly one to solve.  It is a simple administrative question.  If tackled, its solution would bring tremendous dividends in the advent of smaller classes and the facilitating of teachers who are at present very much overworked in the very big classes which are so frustrating and which permit conditions to arise which are dangerous for the children.</P>
    <P>There is also the awful side-issue in the fact that the bright child may be retarded in his progress, through having to wait for the slowest child, or the slightly retarded child may find it cannot keep up with the rate of progress set by the more intelligent children in the class.  These are side-issues of the problem which, leaving aside the others involving school buildings and scholarships and other things, are matters I should like to see getting attention.  I think this is a relatively minor problem and I would ask the Minister to consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not realise there is a very big difference between the dentist teaching apprentices to be dentists and the teacher training children not to be teachers but giving them some basic education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, of course, accepting apprenticeship.  I do not think apprenticeship was very valuable or useful for medicine, or law, or for dentists and I think we all accept now that in dentistry, law and medicine, <Col N="979" /> there is a fixed curriculum which is desirable and at which we have to aim, and equally we have come to that point in education; but because there are 3,000 untrained people, 60 per cent. of whom have been teaching for ten years or more, there is a human problem to be solved also at the present time.  These teachers are there and we must try to assimilate them into the whole teaching profession generally and see that the problem does not recur.  I think the time has come to tackle that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is accepted but the analogy is hardly right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pursue it beyond where it applies.  On the question of teachers' salaries it is easy to be irresponsible and ask for higher salaries all round, particularly when one has no responsibility to provide these salaries and I do not want it to be suggested that I am doing that.  I do not know whether the teachers' salaries are comparable with those paid in similar professions.  The case on one side is that the teacher has to work a much shorter time in a year than those in comparable professions. That, of course, is no fault of the teacher and not a justification for a lesser salary than the competent man should be given.  I understand that, judged by salaries payable in comparable work, the teachers' salary scales are rather low.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I am not in a position to judge whether the salaries are equitable or not, but I suspect if one wants to get the best type of person into the teaching profession, one has to make the salary and emoluments as attractive as possible, so as to ensure that the intelligent, talented and educated individual whom one would like to attract into the teaching profession is not distracted into other openings available in science, engineering and other professions.  We must avoid the position in which those best qualified to be teachers take up other callings and the teaching profession is denied to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we must agree that many teachers are people who, like nurses or <Col N="980" /> religious, have a vocation.  Personally, I believe one could not teach, unless one had a vocation for it, and I think at least a small percentage must have this vocation for teaching and they constitute the most desirable people for the profession.  At the same time, there must be a number who go into teaching because it offers a reasonable standard of living, reasonable conditions of work and surroundings, and that must also be borne in mind.  If a person goes into a profession because of a vocation, it is very unjust to exploit that as is done in the case of the nursing profession.  The idea is there that these people will do this work because they feel it is creative and answers some need that is in them, and then we pay them less.</P>
    <P>I have a relatively open mind on this, but there seems to be a current of feeling within the teaching profession that they could be better paid and that teachers can make invidious comparisons with other professions.  The Minister's experts are probably the best people to judge the merits of the case, but there seems to me to be a palpable injustice in the situation where we have primary and secondary teachers who have comparable qualifications paid at different rates of salary. It should be decided that where the qualifications of individual teachers are the same or comparable, there is an unanswerable case for paying the same rate of salary.  The differential between the different groups should be reduced and I think that would lead to a diminution of the feeling among members of the teaching profession that the primary schools are the poor relation of the whole educational system.</P>
    <P>I do not see that you can divide the educational system into four categories: primary, secondary, vocational and university.  I do not think we can divide them on a classification of degrees of importance because each in its own particular reach is a facet of the composite picture of the totally educated individual.  Each part of the system that turns out the complete man has an equal importance.  Consequently, our attitude should be that in each aspect of education the contribution <Col N="981" /> of the teachers, whether primary, secondary, vocational or university, is equal and they should be paid at relatively equal salary rates and certainly not within the very wide disparity of salary rates paid to them at the moment.  I believe that the greater injustice lies in the disparity between the pay rates of two people equally well qualified than in the disparity between the different types of teachers, primary, secondary, vocational and university.</P>
    <P>I think the question of the school leaving age is the greatest defect of all in the Department of Education.  I might be considered to be a prejudiced person on this.  I am prejudiced in so far as I have very strong views on the ideal of education in any society. I think the ideal of an educational system in any society is that that educational system should be designed to develop to the fullest the latent talent of every individual in that society and that that responsibility should be the responsibility of the community as a whole and should not be left to devolve on any individual person within that community.</P>
    <P>On this matter again, the excellent booklet published by the I.N.T.O. makes a considered investigation into the educational system and then, in the form of the &ldquo;Plan for Education&rdquo; which they compiled, they say this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Equality of educational opportunity, it is quite clear, is still denied to the majority of our people, and both secondary and university education, which in practice are denied to the vast bulk of the population.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, they say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the numbers of scholarships are so few as to be negligible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then they make the remark:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why, then, should there be &lsquo;castes&rsquo; in Catholic Ireland?&rdquo;  said the Bishop of Clonfert in an address, outlining a scheme of social services, during which he had to remind his hearers that &lsquo;all kinds of work, if good and honest, are honourable&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It also says that we are very far behind <Col N="982" /> most of the progressive countries in the provision of adult education.  As far as this country is concerned, most of the research and experience in other countries might never have taken place.  That is all incontrovertible on the basis of facts available to the Minister.  The position is that the vast majority of our children end their education at the age of 14 or 15 at the latest.  As I said, there are about 20,000 of them who do not even reach the standard of education which we lay down to be achieved in the primary school.  So you can imagine the 20,000 who leave our schools with nothing more than the fund of knowledge which would be available to a child of 14 or 15.  That child has got to hew its way through the tremendously competitive world of to-day, earn its living, found a family, educate, clothe and feed that family.</P>
    <P>The position is that 20 per cent. of our children go to secondary schools and 11 per cent. to vocational schools, so that 30 odd per cent. of our children get some sort of post-primary education. That leaves two-thirds of the 500,000 of our children ending their formal education at the age of 14 or 15.  Surely that is a most disgraceful fact?  Surely that is one of the indefensible truths about the ministerial educational policy over the past 35 years?  Two-thirds of the children of our society are sent out into the world with a store of knowledge accumulated when they were 14.  Cast your minds back to that time.  They are sent out to compete for work against the children of Great Britain, the Six Counties, America and other societies. It is quite obvious they have no chance of competition on equal terms when their education ends at the age of 14 or 15 and when the young boy or girl they are competing against has had the advantage of the grammar school, continuation schools and technical schools in Great Britain or the secondary schools and the university education which is available to most of them now in the British Welfare State.</P>
    <P>Equally, here at home, what chance has a child who completes his education at the age of 14 or 15 in the race of life against any of us who have been <Col N="983" /> fortunate enough, through some unpredictable act of God, of faith or whatever it is, to acquire a profession? What chance has such a child of attaining success, creating any kind of wealth or opportunities for himself or for his children?  Do we not know that the dice is loaded in the most unfair and unjust way against these children &mdash; two-thirds of the children, of the population of our schools who are turned out every year to try to earn their living?  I believe it is a grossly unjust situation that gives some of us these tremendous opportunities and denies to thousands of other children the opportunities that a sound education would give them.</P>
    <P>Pádraig Pearse said &mdash; and this was quite a long time ago &mdash; that our very division into primary, secondary and university crystallises a snobbishness partly intellectual and partly social.  Of course it does.  There is no doubt in the world that we are suffering to-day from a perpetuation of the idea wherein a certain class of our society is assured of a continuation education in secondary school or university, a tiny minority.  From that, it is obvious that it has been decided and agreed to perpepuate this class-tiered society, this kind of social <i>apartheid</i> in which a child born into particular circumstances in life can never hope, except by a miracle, to leave that stratum into which it was born.  The labourer's child will be a labourer; the doctor's child will be a doctor; the barrister's child a barrister, and so on.  That stratification is inevitably perpetuated in the system enunciated by the Minister in his opening statement.</P>
    <P>There is a complete rejection of the principle embodied in the Proclamation, a complete rejection of the principle of cherishing all the children of the nation.  There is a complete rejection of the aims and objectives for which the Citizen Army fought and died and a complete negation of the democratic programme of the First Dáil.  One can forgive the older generations for defects for which they were not, after all, responsible.  I cannot easily forgive the Minister for accepting, as he seems to accept, this continued <Col N="984" /> stratification of society into the unfortunate many and the privileged few, the unfortunate many who can never better themselves and who have no choice over the circumstances in which they are born.</P>
    <P>The wealthy minority have the world open to them.  They have the opportunity of advancing themselves and, in turn, of advancing their children.  So it goes on.  It is an acceptance of a system which is being rejected, or is in process of rejection, by most civilised countries to-day.  Here, in this backwater, we continue to accept it and we continue to send out the thousands of children to whom Deputy Dillon referred yesterday, the emigrants about whom he said that it was possibly a good thing that they did emigrate.  I do not want to enter into that issue.</P>
    <P>To-day two-thirds of our children are emigrating to labouring jobs in Britain and elsewhere.  It is a shameful thing they should go out unprepared, unqualified and without any technical ability or skill.  It is a shameful thing that we should continue that system in our society.  It is a shameful thing that we should replenish the pool of unskilled labour, taking our place with the backward countries like the West Indies and Africa.  It is a shameful thing that our children should do the dirty work which the British, quite understandably will not allow their own children to undertake.</P>
    <P>This educational machine has been built up over 35 years by successive Ministers.  A society has been created in which two-thirds of our children have absolutely no chance to better themselves.  That is a betrayal of our trust.  It is a denial of the objectives of those who established this society. It is a retrograde step on the part of the Minister that he should be prepared to continue that system and quite unprepared radically or fundamentally to change it.</P>
    <P>One of the ways in which autocratic or totalitarian societies seek to exploit cheap labour is through the medium of defective education.  That is particularly so in the case of the Salazars and the Francos and of the British in the <Col N="985" /> days of their Colonial Empire.  The ambition was to foster a high illiteracy content.  That had the result of making people resigned to their lot and resigned to doing coolie work, and it is coolie work our emigrant boys and girls are doing to-day.  It is a disgraceful that our Minister for Education should perpetuate that system.</P>
    <P>The system has another advantage. One of the sad truths to-day is the deterioration in the concept of democratic Government.  One of the inevitable consequences of an illiterate electorate is a deterioration in the effectiveness and the efficiency of the whole democratic process.  Democracy cannot survive in a society which is largely illiterate or only semi-literate.  It connotes failure on the part of those who conceived the democratic ideal that the democratic process should not be given every opportunity to function properly.  Where a semi-literate electorate is denied access to full knowledge and to the development of the full man, that electorate cannot use in the fullest and most perfect way the democratic process of Government. Indeed, it is a wonderful achievement on the part of successive Ministers for Education that they could take a people as talented, as intelligent, as gifted, as witty, as understanding and as resourceful as our people are generally accepted to be and to have created out of them this pool of halfeducated, semi-literate, untrained and unskilled people.</P>

Where you have the contrary, <Col N="986" /> democracy cannot operate at its optimum.  I am trying to defend the right of the electorate.  It is wrong to attempt to make cheap political points.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe anybody who leaves school at 14 or 15 years is denied access to so much further or fuller knowledge of philosophy or the way of living that he must be in a seriously defective position when he comes to understand, to assess methods, to consider and decide upon the terribly complicated problems which face the average society in our modern very complex system of life.</P>
      <P>Because of that, I believe that one of the greatest contributions that could be made by a Department of Education to the perpetuation or the saving of the most precious thing in the whole world &mdash; the democratic idea of life, the right to differ, to debate, to discuss, to hold contrary and different politics and policies &mdash; would be to ensure for the masses the fullest possible access to knowledge of world history, ideas, thought, and so on.  If this had been available in other countries, presumably many of the things facing us to-day would not be facing us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Minister must at least consider, or should have considered, the extension of compulsory education to the age of 15.  Two-thirds of the children leave school at 14 without any further education.  Please do not take me as being superior about this business of further education.  It seems to me to be a complete accident that any of us get any further education. It is no tribute to ourselves, but a pure accident.  I have the greatest sympathy with those who are denied it and it is because I want to see these things changed that I refer to them.  There should be further education for people after 14.  There are 500,000 children in the primary schools and a mere 66,000 children in our secondary schools. Surely that points to a tremendous defect, a tremendous failure, in our <Col N="987" /> educational system?  Admittedly, there are 90,000 children in the vocational schools.</P>
    <P>With regard to the expansion of secondary school opportunity, there are about 200 centres for secondary education.  Those 200 centres for secondary education are largely located in the eastern part of the country.  The result is that the talented child in Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and the western seaboard is practically inevitably denied secondary school education, even with the best will in the world on the part of the parents of such a child.  It is left entirely to what is described in the Department handout as &ldquo;private enterprise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The work done by people who look after secondary education is as good as it could possibly be, in the circumstances. I merely believe they should not be asked to do it.  I am not concerned so much with foundations such as Jesuit institutions where the wealthier people send their children and where the fees more or less compensate for the running of the school. I am concerned more with schools run by people such as Christian Brothers, Marist Brothers, Patrician Brothers, and so on, who try to give secondary education to the children of relatively poor people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And the diocesan colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>And the diocesan colleges.  These groups come forward and say: &ldquo;We are prepared to make our teachers and other people available to society generally in order to give a secondary school education to the children of the not-so-wealthy.&rdquo; Most rational societies that understand their good fortune would be more than ready to facilitate these people in every possible way and put at their disposal the institutions within which they could give this education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the curiosities of the present time, I suppose, is the enthusiasm of the Department of Industry and Commerce practically to hand over to foreign industrialists factories, industries, or to facilitate them with tax remissions of one kind or another &mdash; tax-free grants, free profits grants, and <Col N="988" /> so forth.  Every possible encouragement is given to these people to come in here and establish industries.  At the same time, when these groups I have mentioned try to establish foundations or colleges for the purpose of providing a secondary education for children, every possible impediment, it seems to me, is put in their way.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase of 100 secondary education centres in the past ten years.  That is not to the blame of these people.  I think an improvement of 100 centres is a very creditable effort in the circumstances, with the cost of building as high as it is at the moment, with the very complex type of institution a secondary school is.  It is a great achievement.  However, I do not think they should be asked to do these things.  Their sole contribution should be to accept the responsibility of providing a secondary school education, provided we make available to them the funds for the building of the schools.  We should be damned glad to get them to do these things.  I cannot understand any other attitude of mind.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should go around subsidising the provision of buildings for the wealthier, exclusive, publicschool type of institution.  They are more or less well able to look after themselves.  The Minister should be able to devise some system whereby secondary school educational facilities are made available for the different groups of brothers, and others, who decide to provide secondary school education without handing away public money to people who can recover their expenditure in the form of fees, endowments, and so on.  A decision of that kind is long overdue and badly needed.</P>
    <P>At present, there are 66,000 children who can go to secondary school. Practically exclusively, these children have parents with enough money to pay the fees &mdash; and, admittedly, the fees are relatively small where these brothers are concerned.  The number of scholarships available is about 5,000, that is, about 5 per cent. of the total number of children at these schools. It might be said that 5,000 out of 66,000 makes it quite clear that we have failed gravely again there to make <Col N="989" /> available to the talented children the education they need.  Talent does not strike only the families of rich parents; it is an unpredictable gift which might be found in any house or home.</P>
    <P>There is that tiny percentage of scholarships available, 4 per cent. of fairly miserably endowed scholarships, available to the children of the poor. That means that only a tiny percentage &mdash; it is less in the lower income group and lower in the middle income group &mdash; can get secondary education. That seems to me to be completely unforgivable.  Where there is a talented child, it seems to be a positive sin &mdash; I am not very well up on sins, and so on &mdash; and a denial and frustration of a God-given talent in the rejection of something wonderful given to an individual.  The failure to develop that talent is an indictment of the community.  It might be said that because these scholarships are available we have discharged our responsibility, but that is not true.</P>
    <P>A scholarship may be from £15 to £50 a year.  To the poor or to the less wealthy family, the sending of a child to a secondary or vocational school is a big imposition on a parent.  It is a wonderful tribute to many parents that they insist on sending them. Where there is a family with five or six children and the parent decides to send one to a vocational school or where the child is fortunate enough to get a scholarship into a secondary school, not only is the parent denying himself in trying to provide for the child on the small sum provided by the scholarship, but he is also denying himself the earning capacity of that child over the three or four years he will spend in the secondary school.</P>
    <P>At the age of 14 a child may earn £2 or £3 a week, or at least £1, and where there are four or five children it may mean from £10 to £13 a week. The parent must deliberately decide to deny his family of that supplementary income which would improve their standard of living.</P>
    <P>It is a deliberate sacrifice which we demand of the individual but which we do not demand of the higher income group, where they need not make such <Col N="990" /> sacrifice at all.  Why do we put this imposition on a section of our society and demand this sacrifice when we do not demand it from other sections? Parents should not be asked to make any addition to this sacrifice.  The parents has to feed and clothe the child during that time and also feed and clothe the others who are not going to school.  If the child gets through a secondary school education, unless he can go to a university, the value of his education may be negatived.  Indeed, it may have done damage, inasmuch as he may have wasted years which might have been better used in developing some trade or craft.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think the failure of the Minister to increase the number of scholarships under his Department is very regrettable.  I believe that scholarships, which amount to about 500 at the moment, should be increased to at least 2,000 per year and that ideally the child should be in a position to choose at the age of 14.  The less intelligent children could stay on or be encouraged to stay and the others should be given a choice of going to a vocational school or a secondary school, depending on where the talents lie &mdash; whether in a craft, a trade, or a profession.</P>
    <P>This is not an outrageous proposition. It is one which is practically universally accepted now.  It is about time we, in a new, young community, were prepared to accept it and face the responsibility and the cost involved. The costs are not so considerable or outrageous and the returns would be immeasurable.  We would feel content that we had given a full measure of social justice to the young people and we would have created a fund of wealth in the knowledge that we had given or imparted to the young people &mdash; scientific and professional knowledge, or skills and crafts, the cumulative effect of which must be to increase national wealth and national prosperity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under scholarships, is the Deputy including county council and vocational scholarships?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It includes the whole lot, as far as I am aware.  The Minister <Col N="991" /> may correct it if I am wrong. About the only reasonably cheerful facet of the educational system is the vocational side, which is extremely well organised.  It is limited in its scope and needs to be greatly widened, but the basis of its organisational locally in different groups shows that local authorities have done a very creditable job throughout the country.  They should, like those responsible for secondary schools, give every facility for expansion of their activities to provide vocational education for any child who can accept it.  I am surprised that the Minister made this suggestion in his statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At the same time, I urged on them that in all reason there seemed to be a good case for increasing their income from students.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The people who try to avail of vocational education have very limited means.  It would be very regrettable if the Minister's suggestion were accepted in the country.  I know the fees are low in vocational schools, but when the Minister is considering the fees he should bear in mind that in addition to the small fee that may be paid, the parent is denying himself the £2 or £3 weekly income the child may earn and also the food and clothing costs in maintaining that child.  If these are added, it will be seen that in the two or three years during which the child is training in the vocational school, the amount paid is quite considerable in relation to his income.</P>
      <P>It may be said the fees are negligible, but those considerations should be borne in mind.  It is a considerable sacrifice which parents make to help their children, to lift themselves out of the awful rut of the untrained, unskilled worker, or the menial degrading jobs, to which so many of our children have been committed for the rest of their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In contradistinction to the recommendation of the Minister, I would suggest that all fees be abolished in the vocational schools.  That would be a reasonable sequel to the suggestion I made earlier, that the school-leaving age should be raised to 15 and that the <Col N="992" /> opportunity for vocational education be given to all children.  If it is made compulsory to have vocational education for those fit or suitable for it, it would have to be free.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned only with trying to equip the child, either in its hand or in its mind, to compete with other children in a competitive world, where there have been tremendous advances in scientific and technical knowledge and where the unskilled worker must be the most under-privileged of persons and his family must continue endlessly to be that with no future at all.</P>
      <P>As to our universities, there again the entrant is a privileged person, the son or daughter of a wealthy person. There is practically exclusion for the child of the lower income group or lower middle income group.  He simply cannot pay the fees or the parents cannot deny themselves the possible potential income of the child which would be earned in some of the dreadful dead-ends jobs into which so many children are put.  The child may have considerable latent talent but, through no fault of his own, he is denied admission to post-primary and higher education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a system of scholarships into universities.  The percentage of scholarship holders is only seven, that is, 7 per cent. of the total.  All we do is scoop the cream off the lower middle income group, so that some of the workers' children, some really talented children, cannot come up from that stratum of society in which they would otherwise continue to make their contribution towards the perpetuation and advancement and expansion of the particular section of our society which, I am afraid, successive Governments have continued to represent themselves as primarily interested in.  It is a <Col N="993" /> fiddling token&mdash;7 per cent. of the total. The rest are children of wealthy parents.  Is that the aim or objective? Was that the aim or objective of those who worked to establish a free society here &mdash; James Connolly or Liam Mellows?  Did Pádraig Pearse wish to see the perpetuation of that privileged society?</P>
    <P>The late Deputy Moylan, when Minister, said that the national primary school was designed by the British for the express purpose of providing more labourers and it anticipated no change in the social system other than the greater comfort of the ruling classes. I think he was quite right.  To what extent did we change that system or make any serious attempt to alter the position whereby the national primary schools would continue to provide more labourers?  Two-thirds of our people at the moment are labourers and are designated, irrevocably and irredeemably committed, to being labourers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I welcome the interruption. The position as I see it is that that number of children who go to secondary schools is 4 per cent. of the total and the number going to universities is 7 per cent. of the total of 90,000 in the vocational schools.  I believe that in these circumstances there is a very high percentage of our children who get no post-primary education and certainly no finished craft or trade or profession within the educational system as we have established it to-day.</P>
      <P>It is clear that where a child has not these opportunities, where there is such a tiny percentage of scholarships to post-primary education, and where the poor parent is faced with the responsibility of sending out his three, four or five children to vocational schools and trying to pay even the relatively small fee of the vocational school, that is an unnecessary burden and a burden which the Minister should do everything in his power to relieve.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that when the Minister suggests that fees should be increased he is wrong.  I think that instead of doing that, he should abolish these fees and facilitate the conscientions parent who wants to try to give his child as good a chance as he can in the business of earning a living.  In passing, I do not know whether it is the Minister's responsibility or not, but it is clear that something should be done about the school medical examination. Possibly, it is the responsibility of the Minister for Health, but it is clear that the system is defective and that the number of inspections is negligible. In this service, 149,514 were examined out of a total of 479,000. That is possibly a matter for the Minister for Health, but if the Minister for Education has any control, or any say, or any influence in this matter, it is one in which he should take some steps to have it dealt with.</P>
      <P>In this business of school buildings, and the question of scholarships, in the improvement of educational opportunities and of providing equal opportunities for all children, it is quite clear that the Minister has overlooked two big facts in defending the activities of successive Ministers and in trying to give the impression that there has not been a colossal failure on the part of successive Ministers in relation to our Department of Education.  One fact is that he has not made any attempt to reduce the average size of the classes to 30.  That would create a very considerable problem for him if he tried to do it, as a much greater back-log of work would have to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> Secondly, he has omitted to take into consideration the fact that over the past 35 years we have seen about 750,000 young, virile people emigrate from the country and that the job of the Department of Education, if it was properly carried out, should have been to create a service to cater for all these people as well.  If it was not for the fact that these 750,000 people emigrated, that many of them did not marry and have families, it is clear that the litany of failures which they must admit in the activities of the Department of Education over the past 35 years would be a very much more serious one altogether, and that the real failures of the Department of Education is very much greater and more serious than the figures which I have put show.</P>
    <P>In a situation in which even with such a tremendous emigration figure, even with the falling population and the rural depopulation that has taken place, there is a real need for 7,000 teachers instead of the few hundred it is proposed to provide, and the very few scholarships, the completely inadequate number of universities and training colleges, all of these problems would have clearly increased if the people who have had to emigrate remained at home.  I should like to deal with the question of the language.  The Minister did not discuss the language question.  He left it to a commission which is the favourite pastime of successive Governments not only in this country but in other countries.  I will not put ideas in the Minister's mouth which he did not express.  The language has almost got to the stage now when it is no longer a controversial question.  That is possibly a good thing.  The appallingly intensive and positively bigoted attitude to the critic of the language policy is nothing like as intense as it used to be.  Consequently, I think that one can have a very much more healthy debate on the question of the revival of the language.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Dillon the other day apologise for a subsequent attack he made on the language in relation to women Garda.  He prefaced his remarks by giving himself a testimonial as to his interest in the language.  It seemed to me that that <Col N="997" /> was an understandable but regrettable necessity.  Unless one can profess a love for the language, one is not permitted to discuss or criticise the policies.  I say that because I wonder whether I should put on record, like Deputy Dillon, the fact that my attitude to the language has been set out. I hate doing this.  We should be able to discuss the matter without having to apologise in advance.</P>

      <P>Is that so?  I do not recall that.  It is most unlikely.  On the question of the language, I should like to say that the language is a very beautiful language.  I should like to see it preserved, but I believe that there are a few hard and harsh truths which have got to be faced by the members of the older generation who, I believe, have an intense love for the language.  I think the easiest thing to do is to put all the blame on them for the fact that the language revival has <Col N="998" /> failed.  I am quite certain that most of us will accept that the language revival movement has failed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the language revival movement has failed, I think they can consolve themselves with the thought that it is quite possible the movement could never have succeeded; that it is quite possible that the attempt to restore the language as the spoken language of our people as a whole was something that could never have been achieved, even with the most enlightened policies in relation to the movement.  To that extent, they may take a little comfort in the fact that the policies used by them were ineffective, not entirely due to the fact that they were mistaken policies but to the fact that we have the influences of a strong language driving out a weaker language.  We have the influmendous effects of the radio, the newspapers and now television.  In addition, we have the effect of intercommunication between people, the expansion of travelling facilities and the influx of tourists in tremendous numbers.  Then, there is the fact that they started in a position in which, with the exception of the Gaeltacht areas, the Irish language was not the language of the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to those circumstances, together with the failure of economic policies, widespread emigration and all the social and economic consequences of these economic decisions by Ministers over the years, it really was inevitable that it would fail. It is conceivable, although not necessarily so, that the language could have been preserved.  I doubt whether it could ever have been revived in the way Deputy Mulcahy and the present Taoiseach wanted it to be revived, as the spoken language of the people.  It possibly could have been preserved in the state in which they found it when they started, as a by-product of a prosperous economy in our society.  But, in the circumstances of the rural depopulation, in the circumstances of the headlong depopulation of the Gaeltacht areas in particular, it seems to <Col N="999" /> me that the position that we all accept or admit to-day was nearly an inevitable one.</P>
    <P>There is another fact which I think the older generation must face.  The language was to them a very special thing, something which English could not be to an Englishman or French to a Frenchman.  It had a very special connotation in the minds of most of the older generation because it represented to them a badge of nationality at a particular phase in our history and, because of that they developed a very special regard for the language.</P>
    <P>That phase in our history has passed.  Through their joint efforts, a certain measure of freedom, a certain measure of relief from oppression, from occupation by foreign troops and all that it meant to them, all that they felt about it, has meant that the impulse which created the interest in and love for the language which they had is no longer present, certainly not to anything like the same extent in my generation and is present to a negligible or no extent at all in the next and succeeding generations. Consequently, the attempt by the older generation to impose a way of life or to create a love or a high regard for the language, the attempted insistence on the restoration of the language in the universal way that they had in mind, the attempt to inculcate that into a succeeding generation, could not possibly succeed and certainly has not succeeded.</P>
    <P>It is a very common thing for one generation to try to impose its will or its wishes on a succeeding generation, but all our experience shows that you cannot dictate to the next generation in the conventions which they observe, the dances they do, the songs they sing, the books they read, their pattern of behaviour.  All these things have changed throughout the whole course of history.  It does not prevent each generation trying to impose its will on a succeeding generation and it does not prevent the succeeding generation refusing to accept that imposition.</P>
    <P>That is happening here.  It has happened to a certain extent with my generation, in spite of my own <Col N="1000" /> interest in the language.  In spite of my own wish to see the language more widely spoken, certainly to see it preserved &mdash; it would be a very regrettable thing were it to disappear altogether &mdash; in spite of that, whatever feeling our generation may have, I do not think there is any doubt at all that the next generation simply will not understand what the older generation are talking about when they try to put across this idea that the retention of the language as the spoken tongue of our people is a pre-condition or a prerequisite or an inseparable part of nationality.</P>
    <P>That may be a sad truth.  It may be something that causes pain and most of us must have sympathy with those who feel so strongly, but it is one of the inevitable results of history, an inevitable result of the fact that a generaction is growing up which does not understand the real implications of the language.</P>
    <P>The language is more than a means of communication between one person and another.  It was something that you brandished before the occupying troops as something which determined your nationality of which you were particularly proud.  That aspect of the language may persist in the Six Counties, but it does not persist here in this part of the country.  In consequence of that, there is not the same dynamic insistence on the part of the new generations that the language shall be the spoken tongue of our people and, try as hard as they like, the generation that is passing on cannot impose from the grave their will on the next generation and must accept that the best they can hope for is &mdash; I believe it anyway &mdash; that the language may be preserved as it is, possibly extending in small pockets and small groups.</P>
    <P>Remember, in the major Parties there was this very fervent belief held by the leaders of the Parties and because they had the tremendous power of political leaders, they were in a position to insist on and impose their will on the people, irrespective of whether the people were at one with them in this anxiety to restore the language as the spoken tongue of the people or not.  That is passing.  I do not know of a generation of politicians who <Col N="1001" /> are likely to be anything like as powerful a group of politicians as those who are passing on, or who will be in a position to insist on imposing their will in the way they have done.  It does not matter now whether they were right or wrong.  I am merely saying that I do not think there is any of us here who is likely to have the same insistence or the same dedicated interest in trying to restore the language as the spoken language of our people.</P>
    <P>There are various other considerations in the language question.  The anxiety of the new generations growing up is not the creation of artificial barriers between people but the eradication of barriers between nations and between societies, the ending of the chauvinistic, intensely-dedicated, nationalist attitudes of the past century.  There is a tendency towards the internationalisation of society, towards the creation of a society in which class and creed and race and colour become relatively negligible, certainly negligible barriers between people.</P>

It is not possible to give comparable figures in respect of actual expenditure in 1928-29, 1938-39 and 1948-49 because of changes in the content of Votes and Sub-heads of Votes, variations in treatment, as between capital and non-capital services, in relation to many heads of expenditure and because current expenditure did not, in fact, coincide with revenue receipts in these years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if the Agricultural Wages Board may, under Section 17 of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, make a new wages Order or amend the Agricultural Wages Order, 1956, so as to (1) fix special rates of wages in each case for (a) horticultural workers, (b) dairy workers, (c) tractor drivers and (d) agricultural learners or apprentices; (2) define as &ldquo;overtime&rdquo; time worked (a) before or after a specified hour in a day, (b) after a specified number of hours in any day, (c) after a specified number of hours in any week, (d) on a specified day such as Sunday, <Col N="973" /> St. Patrick's Day or Christmas Day, (3) fix differential or graded overtime rates for (a) overtime worked in excess of two or more hours, (b) special areas, (c) special classes of workers, (4) prescribe the number of working hours per week or per day so as to very according to (a) area, (b) special class of workers, (c) season or other period; (5) reduce or increase the normal hours of work in respect of specified days, weeks, months, areas or classes of workers; (6) prescribe (a) special minimum rates of wages and, (b) different overtime rates in respect of specified days, weeks or months and; (7) fix a special minimum rate in respect of (a) a townland, (b) a specified part of a townland and (c) a specified farm (of farms) in a district or townland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers of the Agricultural Wages Board in the matters mentioned by the Deputy are fully set out in Section 17 of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if there is anything in the Agricultural Wages Acts, 1936, which prevents the Agricultural Wages Board from (a) having consultations with the Central Statistics Office as to the value of farm workers diet, (b) inviting organisations representative of agricultural workers and agricultural employers to attend meetings of the board, and (c) giving public notice of its proposals so as to enable organisations representative of agricultural workers and employers to submit observations on or objections to the board's proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards (a) the reply is &ldquo;No.&rdquo;.  As regards (b) while there may be no express prohibition in the Act against such invitations they would appear to be inconsistent with the spirit and framework of the Act.  As regards (c) I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave him on the 20th May to a similar inquiry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agricultural if he is aware (a) that any workman employed in agriculture for <Col N="974" /> which no minimum piece-rate had been fixed could complain to the Agricultural Wages Board for Ireland that the piece-rate of wages would not yield to an ordinary workman the appropriate minimum time-rate and (b) that the Agricultural Wages Board for Ireland (established under the Corn Production Act, 1917) had powers to direct employers to pay workmen the difference between the piece-rate earnings and the appropriate minimum rate; and if he will state whether the Agricultural Wages Board have the same or similar powers under Section 17 of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to the relevance of the reference to the Corn Production Act, 1917.  So far as the Agricultural Wages Board are concerned, the provisions of Section 17 of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, appear to me to enable the board in their discretion to ensure that the earnings from rates for piece-work would be not less than those based on the prescribed minimum rates for time-work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state the provisions of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, and the Agricultural Workers' (Holidays) Acts, 1950 and 1952, which exclude agricultural workers employed by his Department from the protection of those Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that, in the absence of express provision, agricultural workers employed on State farms under my Department do not come within the scope of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, or of the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Acts, 1950 and 1952.</P>
      <P>These workers are, of course, in fact, paid wages higher than the rates of wages current in the districts in which the farms concerned are situated, and receive the benefits of the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Acts.</P>
