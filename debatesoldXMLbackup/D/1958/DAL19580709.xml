      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether his attention has been drawn to reports of the presidential address delivered at the recent annual general meeting of the Irish Medical Association; and, if so, whether there is any evidence which would indicate that, as is stated in those reports, there has been a lowering of standards in the making of local appointments to medical posts or that the findings of interview boards for the filling of such posts have been rejected in favour of low-placed candidates with political or administrative backing as against professional standing.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he <Col N="140" /> will state the weekly rates of wages required as at mid-May, 1958, to equal the value of the minimum rates fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board for female workers as and from 1st March, 1954.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the information required in respect of Counties Dublin and Kildare.  Minimum rates of wages have not been prescribed for female agricultural workers employed outside of these counties.  The weekly wage rates shown in the statement represent the statutory minimum rates prescribed under the Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) Order, 1954, adjusted in proportion to the change in the Consumer Price Index between mid-February, 1954 (the nearest date to 1st March, 1954, for which the index was computed) and mid-May, 1958.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Adjusted&rdquo; minimum wage rates for female agricultural workers for a &ldquo;week in which 48 hours' work is done (exclusive of work on Sunday or weekly half-holiday).&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain cottage industries in this country, notably those in Aran, which produce a perfectly distinctive commodity.  Can the Minister suggest no device that could be employed to protect them as we would protect Waterford glass, for instance, if somebody set up an inferior imitation and sought to sell it as the original?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is the point.  The problem here is that you have a commodity, like the criss, which is not only characteristic of the island but also has a characteristic design. The individual cottage producers simply do not know how to set in motion the appropriate procedure for <Col N="142" /> charging somebody with a false trade description.  An industrial concern, whose product is well known&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting this case to the Minister.  I am asking the Minister does he not agree that, in the case of a cottage industry which is of its nature unequipped to defend itself under the law, there is a case for the Minister for Industry and Commerce taking initiative where, naturally, he would not take initiative if the offended person had his right at law which was perfectly easily enforceable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the discontent caused by his Order to discharge or to remove to the county home incurable patients from the Galway Regional Hospital; and if he will reconsider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not made any Order for the discharge or removal to the county home of incurable patients in the Galway Regional Hospital.</P>
      <P>As I indicated, however, during the course of the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Health, the duration of the bed occupancy in the Galway Regional Hospital seems to be excessive in some cases.  There were, for instance, last February, 106 patients in the hospital who had been there for two months or more.  One patient had been there for six years; another for three and a half years; five for about two years; nine for 18 months; 17 for nine months and the remainder for varying periods up to six months.  Twenty-two of these patients were 70 years and over, and there were 12 between the ages of 60 and 70 years.  That, as I explained, is one of the reasons why there is a shortage of beds in Galway Regional Hospital.</P>
      <P>This hospital cost approximately £2,100,000, the whole of which was provided out of moneys under the control of the Minister for Health.  It was erected primarily to accommodate persons who are acutely ill and in urgent need of hospital treatment.  It is the duty of the health authority to use the beds of the hospital for this purpose, and there is no justification for diverting them to a use for which they were not intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Minister's reply that those acutely ill will be discharged?  It is most unchristian and unfair to the people that they should be discharged in that condition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main purpose of the Bill, which is rather technical in character, is to bring our copyright law, regarding translations of literary works, into conformity with certain international conventions to which this State is a party.  We passed an Act for that purpose last year, Section 8 of which was intended to deal with this matter, but that section has been found to be faulty and at variance with our obligations under a convention which we have ratified.  The purpose of this Bill is to put that situation right.</P>
      <P>This country has, since 1927, been a party to the International Convention which is generally known as the Berne Convention.  The basic principles of the Berne Convention are that literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works generally are protected in each of the contracting States without formality, that is to say, without any such requirements as registration; they are protected for the duration of the author's life and for 50 years after his death; and works published in one country which is a party to the convention are protected in other contracting countries as if they were works published there.</P>
      <P>Copyright in a literary work includes the right to authorise or not to authorise a translation of that work. The early versions of the Berne Convention permitted, however, an intrusion into the author's rights over translations.  There was a provision that a contracting State could make a reservation to the convention, enabling it to authorise after ten years a translation of a copyright work published in another country of the union, into its own national language or languages unless in the meantime the author of the work had made or authorised a translation into that language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this country subscribed to the convention in 1927, we made such a <Col N="151" /> reservation in respect of translations into the Irish language and the later revisions of the Berne Convention have provided that countries, with such reservations about translations, could maintain them.  Section 10 of the 1929 Act, enacted to deal with this matter, provided that, in the case of a work first published in a country of the Berne Union, an author's exclusive right to translate it into the Irish language ceased after ten years, if he had not arranged for a translation to be published here within that time. This meant that after ten years, the author's work could be translated into Irish by anybody without obligation to make any payment to the author.</P>
    <P>In 1952, there was another international convention on copyright, in Geneva, under the auspices of U.N.E.S.C.O.  The countries concerned in that convention included many which are not members of the Berne Union.  Of most importance to us was the fact that the United States of America participated and have now ratified the convention. Hitherto, copyright in works published in the English language could be obtained in the United States only by registration and printing there.  Under this convention, which we propose to ratify, works of nationals of contracting countries and works first published in these countries can claim copyright in the United States.  That is an important advance in reciprocal international copyright and is of potential advantage to authors and publishers in this country who may sell on the American market.</P>
    <P>The reasons for having a separate convention, including the United States and other States, are that the United States retains a system of registration in their domestic legislation for their own authors, and the minimum term of copyright provided for between the contracting States of the Geneva Convention, which is the author's life and 25 years after his death, is less than the term applying amongst members of the Berne Convention.</P>
    <P>The Geneva Convention also provides for a member State to place a limitation on authors' rights over translations. <Col N="152" /> In this case, a contracting State can provide for the compulsory translation of a work into its national language or languages, after a period of seven years.</P>
    <P>We find ourselves in difficulty by reason of the fact that there are two different codes to be incorporated in our domestic legislation.  The particular problem that arose in that regard was the provision of power for the compulsory translation of foreign works into the Irish language.  It is an arrangement that would be very difficult to administer and likely to cause much confusion and uncertainty for authors and translators.</P>
    <P>We reviewed the necessity for having provisions in our law limiting the rights of foreign authors over translation of their works into the Irish language. The experience of the Department of Education during the period in which that section of the Act of 1929 has been in our law has been that no difficulty ever arose in coming to satisfactory arrangements with the owners of copyright for translation into Irish of works required for that purpose.  The provisions of the Act were in fact never used and no necessity is seen for the continuance in our law of provisions for compulsory translation.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will agree that very strong reasons would have to be advanced to justify the curtailment of part of an author's right which, otherwise, our law and the laws of the countries subscribing to the Berne Convention recognise as having a duration of the author's life and 50 years after his death.  Such reasons do not now exist, and this Bill will remove this curtailment.  To meet any possible case of a translation having been made under the provisions of our existing law but not published before this Bill is enacted, a saver is being put in to permit the publication of such a translation without infringement of copyright within three years of the commencement of this Act.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable us to ratify the Geneva Convention and the latest version of the Berne Convention made in 1948, without recourse to reservations in the matter of translations. Ratification of these conventions is necessary to give our authors, artists <Col N="153" /> and composers the widest possible measure of protection for their works throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not make any other substantial change in our copyright law.  This law which dates from 1927 does, in my view, require substantial amendment but it is not proposed to undertake that now.  The need for substantial amendment arises out of developments in connection with broadcasting, television and sound recording&mdash;developments which were not contemplated when the law was made. Because of the peculiarly international character of the things which are the subject matter of copyright, it is necessary for us to keep in line with international practice in this matter.  As far as can be seen at present, it will be necessary for us to provide protection for broadcasting and television, to give protection to performers against the unauthorised filming or recording of their performances, and generally to overhaul and codify this law which is now spread over five Acts of the Oireachtas.  It is a complicated subject. I think it will take some time before we are in a position to do it.  In the meantime, the views of interested parties are being invited with a view to the preparation of proposals to submit to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There is in the present Bill at Section 3 a minor provision requiring an author's name to be mentioned when quotations from copyright works are given in reviews in newspapers and magazines, or where passages are included in anthologies for use in schools.  This amendment is being made now because it is required by the terms of the Berne Convention.</P>
    <P>Opportunity is also being taken in the present Bill to clarify a matter concerning the making of rules in relation to court proceedings regarding patents and trade marks.  As the definitions in the Act stand, rules which can be made by the Minister could mean rules of court.  The Superior Court Rules Committee have represented that it is undesirable that the Minister should have power to make rules of court, and the definitions in this respect are being altered, so that rules of court may now be made by that committee.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say if a specific case arose or is this Bill a precautionary measure?  If so, was it found that our legislation was defective, <i>per se,</i> or was it in conflict with the Berne or the Geneva Conventions? Towards the close of the Minister's remarks he referred to records.  Does this apply to records or to recordings made for rebroadcasting?</P>
      <P>Section 3 says that in the case of a criticism, review or newspaper summary if any quotation from a particular work is made, the source of that quotation must be given.  Do the ordinary copyright laws apply to that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that a specific case arose.  What happened was that when we examined the terms of the Act passed last year, and the other four preceding Acts, in relation to the provisions of the Geneva Convention, we found that we could not ratify that convention without changing our laws.  The purpose is to bring our law into conformity with both conventions.  Records are not dealt with in our copyright law and one of the things we have to keep in mind in any general revision of the law is to cover all types of development that have taken place in recent years.  The requirements about giving the source of a quotation apply only in respect of copyright works, for authors whose work is still protected.</P>

      <P>Yes, they deal with the one matter.  The Minister tried to assure me, on the Second Stage, that there was no need to insert the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; or &ldquo;houses&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;lands&rdquo;, where it appears in the relevant sub-sections.  He said that undoubtedly when this Bill referred to the transfer of lands it included the houses or premises on the lands.  In that respect can the Minister assure me that the G.N.R. Board is the owner of all the lands on which these houses are, because if they are not it could happen they might not be the owners in some particular cases and it would not necessarily mean the houses were transferred to C.I.E.? The word &ldquo;lands&rdquo; in that instance would not include houses or premises <Col N="157" /> because the G.N.R. Board might not own the land in question?</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact I think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce owns the land at the moment.  On the particular point raised, this amendment is unnecessary to provide that the term &ldquo;lands&rdquo; includes houses on the lands.  That is covered by our Interpretation Act. The Interpretation Act of 1937, Section 12, provides that in every Act which we pass wherever the term &ldquo;land&rdquo; is used it will be interpreted as including hereditaments, buildings and premises of any type.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (4) says that &ldquo;the assets...of the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee...shall vest in the board as from such date as may be so agreed&rdquo;.  The Minister, when he was speaking on the Second Stage, said there was no permanent agreement, that this railway was owned jointly by the G.N.R. Board and the British Transport Commission, and that it would need legislation to vest part of the undertaking in the Minister. Assuming that this railway would close down, would it be the intention of C.I.E. to carry out repairs or maintenance work for the rolling stock of this undertaking at the Dundalk Engineering Works?  If this railway closes down would there not be additional buses required in that area which should obviously be maintained in Dundalk?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That fence is on the next circuit of the course; we have not come in sight of it yet.  We did not find it possible to make any final agreement with the Minister of Commerce <Col N="159" /> in Belfast regarding the half share in the ownership of the County Donegal Joint Railways Committee which the G.N.R. Board held.  The effect of the provision in the Bill and of paragraph 5 of the agreement which is scheduled to the Bill, is to leave the door open for further agreement regarding the concern to which the British Transport Commission, which owns the other half of the County Donegal Joint Railways Committee, must also be a party.</P>
      <P>The position is that this railway undertaking in Donegal is jointly owned now by the G.N.R. Board and by the British Transport Commission.  It is, like all our railways, operated at a loss; and of course that is the problem because the loss has, up to the present, been shared equally by the two owning bodies.  However, the railways, as Deputies know, are almost entirely situated within our territory. The original share capital of the undertaking was converted into British transport stock and a statutory annual interest charge of £10,000 is payable by the joint committee to the British Transport Commission who, in turn, pay out to the shareholders.  That interest charge was also shared equally by the two owning bodies in common with the operating losses.  In 1957, the losses, after charging interest, amounted to £27,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another railway there, the Letterkenny and Strabane Railway, which, although it has a separate legal existence, is operated by the joint committee, who own the entire capital, with the exception of guaranteed shares amounting to £17,500 held by outside shareholders and guaranteed by Donegal County Council and Letter-kenny Urban District Council.  Under the scheme of apportionment drawn up under the 1953 agreement, provision was made that the G.N.R. share of the interest charge, that is to say, £5,000 a year, should be shared equally by the North and South and that operating losses, excluding the interest charge, should be shared on the ratio of the mileage of the lines in the two areas, which left us with 97 per cent. of the losses.  No provision was made for the apportionment of the Great <Col N="160" /> Northern half share of capital expenditure which, since 1953, amounted to £14,000 and which represents expenditure almost entirely upon road services which operate in our territory.</P>
    <P>The people in Belfast take the view that they should not be required to contribute anything to the undertaking which is outside the Six Counties and outside their control.  They realise, however, that the interest charge upon the stock is a statutory one and will have to be a joint responsibility until permanent arrangements can be made in agreement with the British Transport Commission.  That would probably require legislation both here and in Britain, and possibly in the Six Counties also.  Meanwhile, the Ministry of Commerce will continue to bear half of the Great Northern share of the interest charge.  They are also prepared to bear half of the Great Northern share of capital expenditure up to the transfer date.  After that date, C.I.E. will bear the Great Northern half share of the operating losses, excluding interest.  We have hitherto met 97 per cent. of the Great Northern share.  C.I.E. will also bear the Great Northern half share of capital expenditure after the transfer date, which will almost exclusively represent expenditure on the road services within our territory.  This provision of the Bill is identical with the corresponding provision which has appeared in the Belfast Bill.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 8</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 not moved.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>As it says, the section arranges &ldquo;for the definitive transfer of the Dundalk works to the Dundalk Engineering Works Ltd.&rdquo;  This transfer has been brought about to enable that company to carry on certain engineering activity.  I should like to stress at this stage some relevant points about this proposed transfer. In previous statements in the House, <Col N="161" /> the Minister expressed a very strong, confident hope that employment would be more or less maintained in Dundalk, subsequent to the amalgamation with C.I.E.  I should like to impress on the Minister the importance of one fact, that is, that assuming the Heinkel car project and the foundry project were in full stride at present, it would, possibly, provide employment for only about 350 workers in Dundalk.  That leaves a balance of about 650 for whom work must be found.</P>
      <P>I admit that the amount of railway work which will be done in Dundalk according to the Minister will provide a fairly substantial amount of employment, but it is doubtful whether it will fill the gap, whether it will absorb the balance of 650 men looking for employment.  I should like to take this opportunity of asking the Minister to do what he can to exhort and advise other State concerns, such as Bord na Móna, the E.S.B. and maybe the Sugar Company, to get as much work as possible done in the Dundalk Engineering Works.  As I see it, as the men see it and probably as the Minister sees it, there will be a terribly uphill fight to maintain full employment there.  I venture to say it will be impossible to maintain full employment, but naturally, for obvious reasons, we all want to keep unemployment and dismissals at a minimum.  It will require the combined efforts and co-operation of everybody, both workers and management, to save this concern.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister could the word &ldquo;chattels&rdquo; in sub-section (1) of Section 8 by any stretch of the imagination include lorries? For its future operation, this company obviously needs a number of lorries. The nature of its work suggests that such will be the case.  It may be that the G.N.R. Board and, subsequent to the passing of this Bill, C.I.E. may find a surplus of lorries on their hands. It may not be so, but if it is the case, would it not be possible to include lorries in that word &ldquo;chattels&rdquo;?  It would help in some way; it would be a gesture; it would relieve the company of spending money on buying a new fleet of lorries which they will eventually need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> The Minister also referred to other subsidiary companies which will be operating within the confines of the Dundalk works and if possible at this stage I should like him to give more details about their prospective operations. I should also like to know what he meant when he said that a sum of about £1,500,000 might possibly be invested in the whole concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy quoted me as having expressed the hope that all the workers formerly employed at the Dundalk works when controlled by the G.N.R. would continue to be employed in the future.  I do not think that is an accurate quotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed the intention, which is being fulfilled through this Dundalk Engineering Works organisation, of endeavouring to procure the establishment at Dundalk of a series of commercial operations which would be adequate in their scope to employ the same number of workers as were formerly employed there.  Obviously no individual is being guaranteed work for the rest of his life but the board are reasonably confident that the plans they have made will be adequate to ensure that there will be carried on at Dundalk various commercial activities which should develop to a stage at which an equivalent number of workers will be employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned that the original idea of one company carrying on a number of operations has been departed from and the intention now is to have subsidiary companies set up, each of which will be concerned with a particular aspect of these activities.  The Deputy mentioned three of these: the production of Heinkel cars; the operating of a commercial steel foundry and the general engineering activities.  There are two other projects, about which I am not in a position to make a statement and relating to which the Deputy and people interested in Dundalk must await an announcement from the board <Col N="163" /> which they will make when they deem the time to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>I said that the plans, as I know them, will involve an investment in equipment, stocks, buildings and working capital to an extent which is now estimated at about £1,500,000, but that investment will be spread over different activities and will enable operations to be carried on by each of the separate organisations there.  It is difficult to make any precise statement, as the Deputy will appreciate, because there are matters that are going on at present and we are in the middle of the transition period and we can only talk about plans which have yet to be finalised.  As soon as things are definitely fixed and arranged precise details will be made known.</P>
    <P>The Bill, of course, provides for the transfer of the land including the buildings at Dundalk to the Dundalk Engineering Works.  It also provides for the transfer of chattels, that is to say machines, stocks of materials and lorries, the movable equipment generally which is there at the workshops, to the board, but for that they will have to pay and the payment will be made to the former owner, namely the G.N.R. Company, and will be part of the assets of the G.N.R. which will be subsequently divided.  The amount of the payment has yet to be determined and if there is any disagreement between the board and the company as to the chattels to be transferred and the payment therefor the Minister comes in under the terms of this Bill to settle the question.  But the term &ldquo;chattels&rdquo; as used covers all equipment utilised at Dundalk Engineering Works except the buildings and land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister previously expressed the opinion&mdash;with which we <Col N="164" /> all concurred&mdash;that the success of the Dundalk Engineering Works depended largely on its ability to secure large contracts from outside the country and said that they were actively pursuing that policy.  When he was questioned on the matter previously he was unable to indicate whether they were meeting with any success in that direction.  Would he now like to indicate what the prospects are?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy understands that, so far as the Heinkel car company is concerned, the scale of operations will require that some 90 per cent. of the production must be exported and I believe that orders for substantial numbers of these vehicles have already been secured.  So far as the steel foundry is concerned, I think that will be mainly interested in internal orders initially because of course there is no commercial steel foundry in the country and it represents a substantial addition to our industrial equipment.  But it will also be available to do work of that character for anybody abroad who wants it done where they can quote competitive prices.  The general engineering works will be engaged to a substantial degree in doing for C.I.E. that part of the activities which were always done at Dundalk for the part of the G.N.R. organisation which C.I.E. will take over, and that will represent a substantial amount of business for them but to keep that section of the works fully employed they will obviously need more than that business. They will get it wherever they can get it, inside or outside the country.  I know they have tendered for various contracts outside the country but I have not heard that they have succeeded in getting any contract yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Stage the Minister said the public would be invited to subscribe for the purpose of buying shares in this company.  It is hardly likely that the public will subscribe for a while until they find out how the company is faring.  Does the Minister intend to come to its assistance with extra finances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is that <Col N="165" /> there will be a public issue of shares.  I think the Deputy is probably right in forecasting that, at this stage of the undertaking, the public is not likely to come forward with sufficient capital to meet all the requirements of the undertaking and that means a proportion of these shares will remain in the hands of the underwriters.  The shares will be underwritten and that ensures that the Dundalk Engineering Works will get the capital, but the shares will be held by the underwriters and will be retained by them so long as they think that the prospect of a successful sale to the public does not exist.  As soon as they believe an opportunity of disposing of them presents itself, because of the success of the Dundalk works and its ability to earn a profit, they will sell.</P>
      <P>The reason for adopting that procedure rather than advancing money is to emphasise, in the first place, the private enterprise character of the undertaking and make quite clear that this is a company which is to be financed by share capital and that the return on that capital will depend on the commercial success of the undertaking, and secondly, because it is thought likely that in the case of some of these subsidiary companies, private interests may be associated with them. I think there is little doubt some private capital will be forthcoming, and will represent the association with the undertaking of commercial interests that can contribute to its success.</P>

      <P>I do not know if I get the point.  The agreement provides for the division of the G.N.R. undertaking, including all its assets and liabilities, between the Minister for Industry and Commerce here and the Minister of Commerce in Belfast.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce here therefore assumes all the liabilities of the G.N.R. Board which are apportioned to us under the agreement, but the effect of the sub-section is to set out these liabilities in so far as they concern the part of the undertaking which is being transferred to C.I.E., and hand them over to C.I.E.

      <P>Salaried staff only are eligible for membership of the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund.  The G.N.R.

The position of foremen was also doubtful and the Parliamentary Draftsman thought, in view of these questions, it would be prudent to extend the provision to include both officers and servants and that is the purpose of all these amendments.</P>

      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 7 is to ensure the existing obligations of the G.N.R., under the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund in respect of staff who are members of that fund, will be binding on C.I.E. when the G.N.R. Board is dissolved, and when C.I.E. become a special subscriber to the fund.  C.I.E. have decided to become a special subscriber to the fund in respect of G.N.R. staff and existing pensioners who are members of that fund as soon as the necessary British legislation can be secured.  I understand from the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund Corporation that if British legislation is initiated before the autumn of this year, it will be possible to have it enacted before 1959.  The corporation is prepared to co-operate with C.I.E. in becoming a subscriber to the fund and in securing the necessary British legislation.  The insertion of this amendment will avoid further transport legislation here next year when C.I.E. becomes a special subscriber.  The cost of the British legislation will be borne by C.I.E., but, I understand, it is not <Col N="169" /> likely to be more than a few hundred pounds.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) (a) The obligations, whether obtaining legally or by customary practice, of the outgoing board under the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund in respect of every person who, immediately before the transfer date, is entitled to benefit under that fund and who was resident in the State when he first became so entitled shall continue to be binding on the outgoing board and, after the dissolution of the outgoing board, shall bind the board.</P>
      <P>(b) All moneys from time to time required by the outgoing board to discharge its obligations in respect of any such person shall on demand be paid to it by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I should say a few words on amendment No. 13 to help Deputies to understand the problem.  The amendment has a twofold objective.  Firstly, it ensures the statutory and customary obligations of the G.N.R. Board, in respect of existing pensioners of the Railway Clearing System Superannuation <Col N="170" /> Fund, will continue to be binding on the G.N.R. Board between the transfer date and the ultimate dissolution of the G.N.R. Board later on. Secondly, it provides that these obligations will be binding on C.I.E. when C.I.E. become a special subscriber to the fund, after the dissolution of the G.N.R. Board.</P>
    <P>Obligations in respect of existing pensioners arise in section B. of the fund.  Section B. covers members, including existing pensioners, who were members of the fund prior to 1941, when the fund was reorganised. Improved benefits were then introduced and contributing bodies with employees or existing pensioners in that section of the fund have guaranteed the solvency of the section for a period of 60 years from 1941 and must make good by way of annual payments any actuarial deficiencies arising following on periodic actuarial valuations.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a continuing liability of the G.N.R. Board, in common with other contributing bodies, to that section of the fund, in respect of existing pensioners as well as serving members.  The existing provision in Section 14 (2) (b) of the Bill covers liability in respect of existing members only.  It does not cover the liability in respect of existing pensioners.</P>
    <P>This amendment is made at the request of the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund Corporation, who were consulted to ensure that the terms of the Bill were in order, so far as the corporation is concerned. The existing statutory and customary obligations of the G.N.R. Board in respect of existing pensioners of the fund will bind C.I.E. when the G.N.R. Board is dissolved and when C.I.E. become a special subscriber to the fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appreciated here that the section, as amended, now appears adequate to safeguard the rights of the staff in regard to superannuation and pension, particularly in view of the fact that a phrase is brought into it referring to their entitlement by customary practice.  I take it that this section also endows on transferred members other rights they have, outside pension or superannuation rights.  I may help by giving this example.  In the clerical grade of the G.N.R., there is the special executive staff who are catered for by a particular trade union which is recognised by the G.N.R. Board.  The board has always recognised that this trade union has the right to negotiate as far as grades of pay and salaries for these special class clerks are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their counterpart in C.I.E., the special and executive clerks, although belonging to the same trade union, have not the same rights.  That has been denied to them by C.I.E.  C.I.E. <Col N="172" /> has consistently declined to recognise the trade union as the negotiating body for that category of salaried employee.  I think it may be taken that the C.I.E. Board will be rather inclined to adopt the same attitude towards those special class clerical staff who are transferred from the G.N.R. Now, those people enjoy this right under the G.N.R. Board and I take it that this right, which arose out of customary practice, is safeguarded in this section and that they will bring with them into C.I.E. that right of their trade union of negotiations with the C.I.E. Board, as far as their rates of pay are concerned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a situation about which I do not know anything and consequently I am not prepared to express an opinion.  The general law requires that the C.I.E. Board shall arrange the conditions of employment of its workers in negotiation with trade unions representative of the workers. I do not think I need go any further than that.  If any question arises about the representative status of the trade union, they would have to establish it themselves; and I should imagine that in the circumstances described by the Deputy, they would not have any difficulty.  So far as the law is concerned, there is a general obligation on C.I.E. to arrange conditions of employment of workers in negotiation with trade unions representative of those workers.</P>
      <P>I hope that there will be a general desire to facilitate the introduction of arrangements which will be workable in the future.  It is quite clear that there will be a great deal of detailed negotiation required to carry out this amalgamation of the two organisations and ultimately get a coherent system working for C.I.E.  I am sure that everybody concerned will be approaching that task with the desire and intention of getting over any difficulty of that kind that may arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I may take it, without referring to a specific case as I did, that the Minister's view on this section is that it is designed to ensure that transferred employees from G.N.R. to C.I.E. will carry with them whatever rights they had?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter which clearly must be settled between the C.I.E. management and the trade unions.  Some Deputies may be aware that a rather difficult problem arose in that connection following the termination of the Sligo and Leitrim Railway, where some workers formerly employed on that railway were taken in by C.I.E. and there were divergent views held as to how they fitted in and what seniority they brought with them.  It is quite clear that, in this particular instance, in the amalgamation of these two concerns, the problems of seniority will have to be adjusted by agreement between the company and the trade unions.  I would not attempt myself to lay down rules which should guide them in doing that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>They are still, in theory, employees of the G.N.R. although seconded to D.E.W.  They will become, in theory, employees of C.I.E. Presumably C.I.E. will not want them.  They will continue to be employed by the D.E.W. and their compensation will be abated so long as they are.  I hope I have made the matter clear.  It is rather complicated.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to safeguard the position of staffs who have accrued rights in any of the pension funds listed in the scheduled agreement on page 12&mdash;members of these funds who are not transferred to the C.I.E. but who are seconded under sub-section (2).  I may help the Minister by quoting an example.  There are at the moment some female clerks who were originally members of the Female Clerks Provident Fund and who subscribed to that fund and who are entitled on retirement to benefits from that fund, but who at a later stage of their career with the transport concern transferred to the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund when that was thrown open to female staff. These people are not being transferred but are simply being seconded for duty to C.I.E. because of their membership of the R.C.S. fund.  On that account, they do not appear to be covered by the section as it stands at the moment.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (9), line 30, to delete &ldquo;not&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meaning of this sub-section as it stands is that officers or servants of the G.N.R. Board, when they are transferred to C.I.E., will not be eligible to become a member of the C.I.E. pension scheme, if they are at present members <Col N="175" /> of the G.N.R. scheme.  I do not think it is wise or right that there should be such discrimination between the present C.I.E. staff and the new recruits, shall we call them, who are being transferred.  I assume that in the C.I.E. pension schemes, as in the G.N.R. schemes, there is an age limit under which a person is debarred from joining a particular scheme, if he is over a certain age.  If the Minister's reason for framing this sub-section is to safeguard the C.I.E. funds, that age limit would suffice.  We must remember that these officers and servants who will be transferred next September or October will become C.I.E. employees. I think they should be entitled to the same rights as the present C.I.E. employees enjoy.  It says they will not be eligible to become a member of a superannuation scheme established before the transfer date.  What about after the transfer date?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point. The effect of the provision is to preclude a member of the G.N.R. staff who is a member of an existing superannuation scheme from becoming a member of C.I.E. pension scheme established before the transfer date.  The effect of the Deputy's amendment would be to make a member of a G.N.R. scheme transferred to C.I.E. eligible for membership of a C.I.E. scheme also and thus qualify for both the G.N.R. and the C.I.E. pension, which would, indeed, make him more favourably circumstanced than existing C.I.E. employees; but while sub-section (9) of Section 15 is designed to preclude members of G.N.R. schemes from membership of existing C.I.E. schemes which would, as I have said, make them more favourably circumstanced than existing C.I.E. employees, the next sub-section empowers C.I.E. to introduce an amending scheme for G.N.R. workers transferred to them.  C.I.E. will thus be in a position to bring about parity in the schemes applicable to the former G.N.R. workers and to existing C.I.E. workers.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment which the Parliamentary Draftsman considered to be desirable in the interests of clarity.  Section 16 provides, in the case of staff transferred to the Dundalk Engineering Works, for the continuance of the funds listed in the scheduled agreement.  These funds are more appropriately described as pension or staff funds.  That is the phrase which is set out in Section 15, sub-section (1) of the Bill and in paragraph 7, sub-paragraph (a) of the agreement. The amendment, therefore, avoids the possibility of ambiguity.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that, in the case of G.N.R. personnel transferred to the Dundalk Engineering Works, membership of pension schemes will not be affected by the fact that they were transferred to the Dundalk Engineering Works in January last, when the works were leased to the Dundalk Engineering Works.  The whole intention of Section 16 of the Bill is to preserve the pension rights of staff transferred to the Dundalk Engineering Works.  The G.N.R. Board have, however, obtained legal advice to the effect that, under the rules of the pensions fund for wages staff, membership of the staff transferred to the Dundalk Engineering Works terminated on the date that they ceased to be employed by G.N.R. and became employed by the Dundalk Engineering Works.  If that opinion was correct, it would, of course, defeat the whole intention of the section and, to remove any doubts in the matter, we have prepared this amendment to make it quite clear that these pensions rights are preserved and carried over.</P>

      <P>(a)  where, as a consequence of the vesting on the transfer date of the part of the undertaking of the outgoing board within the State, the board, within five years after the passing of this Act, dispenses with the services of an officer or servant (including an officer or servant transferred or seconded under Section 14) or transfers him to another position in its service;.</P>
      <P>Section 17, sub-section (1) (a), as introduced, would entitle the G.N.R. staff to compensation only where they suffer loss of employment or worsening of conditions as a result of the amalgamation of C.I.E. and G.N.R. undertakings. This matter was referred to in the Second Reading discussion and I undertook to introduce an amendment to deal with it.  It may happen that, where a post which will become duplicated is retrenched as a result of amalgamation, it will be the C.I.E. employee rather than the G.N.R. employee who will be let go.  The effect of the amendment is to ensure that compensation provisions will apply alike to both C.I.E. and G.N.R. staff who are rendered redundant by amalgamation.  We took the opportunity of the introduction of the amendment to improve the wording of the sub-section so as to refer to the vesting of the part of the G.N.R. undertaking within the State in C.I.E. rather than the vesting of the whole undertaking in C.I.E., which is not quite accurate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (1), page 9, to add to <Col N="181" /> the sub-section the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(c)  where the board ceases to provide or permanently reduces any transport service by rail or inland waterway or substitutes diesel for steam traction or where an Order is made under Section 9 of the Transport Act, 1958, in relation to a specified level crossing and as a consequence thereof the board, within five years after the passing of that Act, either dispenses with the services of an officer or servant (being an officer or servant transferred or seconded under Section 14) or transfers him to another position in its service;.</P>
    <P>This proposed sub-section is a repetition of Section 14 (1) of the Transport Bill which we have just disposed of. The amendment was found necessary, in order to meet drafting difficulties in applying to G.N.R. staff after the amalgamation precisely the same compensation provisions as will apply to C.I.E. staff under the Transport Bill. To that extent, it is a drafting amendment only and does not alter the intention of the Bill in any way.</P>
    <P>The Fourth Schedule of the Transport Act, 1950, as amended by the recent Transport Bill, contains the compensation provisions applicable to C.I.E. staff and requires adaptation in applying it to G.N.R. staff for the reason that compensation under the Schedules as they stand is calculated by reference to past services with C.I.E. and its predecessors but not to past services with the G.N.R. Board and its predecessors.  The necessary adaptation is provided for in amendment No. 23.  In order to apply the adaptation to G.N.R. staff who will become redundant after amalgamation as a consequence of the reduction of services or reorganisation of services, it is necessary to bring such staff within the ambit of Section 17 of the Bill, which is done by this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied about the statement which the Minister made in relation to the application of compensation to people who are supposed to qualify under sub-section (2) of this section.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This section applies only to an officer or servant who at the date of his dismissal or transfer was employed in a permanent capacity... by the board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I submit that the present employees of the Dundalk Engineering Works qualify for compensation under that sub-section, if only for the reason that at the date of their dismissal last January they were employed by the board.  They are not employees of the board at the present time but they are former employees of it and this section relates to employees and former employees of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said some time ago that he was providing compensation for C.I.E. employees on the understanding that they were not coming back to work in the transport concern.  That is fair enough, but he also said that the aim is to keep the Dundalk Engineering <Col N="184" /> Works men in employment.  I would assume that that is the object in relation to C.I.E. workers as well.  He went on to say that his obligation was fulfilled when he put them in employment.  I hold that the Dundalk Engineering Works men, because up to last January they were G.N.R. employees, are entitled to compensation. Perhaps in the course of the past few months some of the employees in the Dundalk works would have been dismissed if the Dundalk Engineering Works had not been set up last January but at the present time you will find the G.N.R. men in the Dundalk works classed as G.N.R. employees and under the ordinary provisions of this Bill they would be entitled to compensation if they were dismissed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said also on the Second Stage that a C.I.E. man takes the pension with him if he finds employment in a non-statutory body.  I presume that is because it would be too difficult to keep track of an ex-C.I.E. man's movements.  If he found employment with some private concern, you would not know whether he was in fact employed by it or not. However, the Minister said that it would not do to provide compensation for Dundalk Engineering Works men because that would act as an inducement to them to leave their employment and that the arrangements must be such as will encourage the workers to stay on the job.  They are anxious to stay on the job but the danger is that they will be dismissed in a very short time.  It is to meet that contingency that I ask that this section be applied to these men and that they be compensated in common with the other G.N.R. employees who will be entitled to compensation if they are dismissed by C.I.E.</P>
    <P>As I have said, that sub-section entitles them to compensation because they were actually dismissed.  I have here a dismissal notice, one of a number which were issued to the G.N.R. employees last January when the Dundalk Engineering Works was set up, and these men have received legal opinion that they are entitled to compensation even if they are reemployed by the Dundalk Engineering <Col N="185" /> Works immediately they are dismissed by the G.N.R.  I should like to ask the Minister, comparing the G.N.R. works in Dundalk with the C.I.E. works in Inchicore, what would happen if it were found necessary as a result of any proposed reorganisation of C.I.E. to dismiss a number of workers in Inchicore?  Would they be entitled to compensation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let there be no ambiguity of any sort about this.  If the G.N.R. Board had dismissed all these Dundalk Engineering Workshop employees last January, on the grounds that they had no work for them because branch lines had been closed down or for any other reason, they had no statutory right to compensation under any legislation.  It would have been quite easy for me to have let the situation develop until next September, to do nothing whatever in the way of organising additional employment and merely provide that the workers who would no longer be required by C.I.E., when the workshops had been handed over to C.I.E., would get compensation.</P>
      <P>I decided, instead of solving the problem there, by allowing the works to close down and paying retirement pensions, to organise employment at Dundalk that would keep the workers busy.  I think that was the best arrangement in the interests of the town of Dundalk as a whole and in the interests of the individual workers in particular. We cannot have it both ways.  To the extent that that effort succeeds in getting them employment I think any obligation there is upon the community as a whole to help out in a difficult situation arising from causes outside our control will have been fully discharged and indeed more than fully discharged, because I do not think it will be contended that the community as a whole has any greater obligation to unemployed men in Dundalk than in Drogheda, Clones or anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Or Inchicore.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Inchicore or anywhere else.  Furthermore, it would be a complete impossibility to carry on a commercial undertaking of the type that is being organised in Dundalk on <Col N="186" /> such a basis as has been suggested, where each worker would gain an advantage by losing his job in that workshop, if he finds a job somewhere else. There is no similarity between the situation there and the situation of a worker employed on a branch line or in the Inchicore shops who is permanently put out of his employment.  The purpose of the compensation arrangement there is to get them to leave their employment and to make provision for them when they leave.  You cannot compare those arrangements with those applied to a worker who it is desired should stay on the job, who is required on the job to enable it to be successfully organised.</P>
      <P>I will concede that the possibility might arise that some of these former G.N.R. workers employed at Dundalk might not be adaptable to the new type of operations which will be carried on at Dundalk, that they just could not be fitted in to any of the organisations that will be established there.  If that happens the Dundalk Engineering Works should have resources to enable them to make some provision on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis for these workers.</P>
      <P>If that situation arises, however, it will arise very quickly.  It will arise as soon as the management of these undertakings at Dundalk can assess their employment needs and the practicability of utilising the available labour there to meet these needs.  As soon as that transition stage is over, the workers in the Dundalk Engineering Company's employ will be in the same position as every other industrial worker in the country, secure in his employment as long as he gives satisfactory service there and so long as the undertaking employing him is in a position to get business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that I served the best interests of Dundalk and of these workers by trying to meet the problem in that way, by the organisation of alternative employment there rather than thinking in terms of compensation payments which would obviously have been far less than workers could earn in wages in employment, and it would, of course, have left the town of Dundalk in a very serious commercial situation.  Now that that has been <Col N="187" /> done, I feel sure these workers will accept that the effort to get employment for them was the right course to have followed rather than to be thinking in terms of disemployment and of compensating them on their disemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the <i>ex gratia</i> lump sum which the Minister says it is his intention to pay these men, why does he not make it statutory? He says he does not want that because he wants to deal with each individual case on its merits.  Could the Minister not deal with each individual case on its merits even if it were statutory?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Once it was statutory you would have a new situation altogether.  The management at Dundalk will be concerned to try to fit every worker in.  Their first aim will be to fit the worker in.  It will be in the odd cases, where some special circumstances make that impossible, that some question of <i>ex gratia</i> payment will arise.  Once you start giving workers a statutory right, they then have a choice.  I do not think they should have a choice.  They should have the opportunity of work, if that can be given to them, and no choice of refusing the work just because of some cash alternative.</P>

      <P>It is not quite the same, but I think we can dispose of the difference when talking about it. The effect of the amalgamation on the staff of the Irish Railway Clearing House was discussed, perhaps irregularly but nevertheless discussed, on the Transport Bill.  I indicated that there would be difficulty in enacting legislation here to impose any statutory obligation on an organisation of this kind which included in its membership bodies located outside the country. The matter has since been the subject of discussion with the Railway Clearing House.</P>
      <P>I was informed that the committee of the Clearing House, at a meeting held last month, passed a resolution asking that provision be made in this Bill for compensation to staffs of the Clearing House who were rendered redundant owing to the dissolution of the G.N.R. to the same extent as staff of the G.N.R., the cost of compensation to be borne by the Committee of the Clearing House.  I am not clear that this amendment is required to enable them to pay that compensation or what the effect of including this provision in the Bill may be but, as they asked us to include this provision in the Bill, I am doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parties to the Clearing House include not merely C.I.E. and the G.N.R., but the Ulster Transport Authority, British Railways, B. &amp; I., other cross-Channel shipping companies and various organisations.  The expenses of the Clearing House are apportioned on the basis of clearances. <Col N="191" /> I think Deputy Casey's amendment was mainly to achieve the same purpose as this.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion about provision for compensation where staff may be disemployed in the Clearing House because of some reorganisation in the Clearing House itself.  In this Bill, we are concerned only with the consequences of the amalgamation of the G.N.R. and C.I.E.  It is by no means clear what the effect of any legislation we might pass would have so far as bodies located outside the country are concerned.  For example, we could not tell British Railways or the B. &amp; I. to make payments in this regard.  The fact that the Railway Clearing House asked for this provision is an indication that they intend to make compensation provisions  their own resources.  I think they asked for it because they wanted to have it applicable to the very elaborate rules on compensation set out in the Transport Act.  Clearly, we would be going entirely beyond our proper sphere if we were to extend the section so as to cover anything except the consequences of the amalgamation of the G.N.R. and C.I.E.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister has tried to deal with a very difficult situation.  When I mentioned reorganisation I was referring particularly to reorganisation to be forced on the Irish Railway Clearing House by reason of the fact that that part of the G.N.R. would be taken from them. As far as possible, the Minister's amendment meets the case which the trade union wished to make in this connection and I would express my appreciation for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When you established a railway clearance system appropriate to the situation in which you had, perhaps, 15 railway companies, originally designed to avoid all the elaborate machinery of book-keeping and rendering of accounts between one railway company and the other, gradually the other railway companies begin to disappear whereupon Parkinson's law begins to operate.  Here is the railway house.  Now we proceed to create one of the railway clearing houses.  Where we have now, in effect, only one transport authority in Ireland dealing with a number of other transport authorities, a very limited number of transport authorities outside Ireland &mdash;the Ulster Transport Authority, the British Transport Authority and possibly one or two shipping companies&mdash; does the necessity for this elaborate machinery survive?  Suppose we were starting now, would the Minister exhort C.I.E. to set up a railway clearing house?  I think he would not.  I think he would probably say to them: &ldquo;You can transact your business like anybody else, pay your bills&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might consider this.  The railway clearing house system was set up to deal with the problem of a number of railway companies whose wagons frequently passed across one another's tracks.  Therefore it was extremely difficult to operate it at all, on the ordinary commercial system of bills rendered and accounts paid. This elaborate machinery which we have was characteristic of the 19th century. I submit to the Minister that there is a danger, in the new situation in which we find ourselves, of Parkinson's law operating.  When the machinery is there work will be found to make it continue to tick.  I suggest that as we are always talking about bringing in new methods and streamlining production, when we are trying to make this whole business approach an economic working, it would not be inappropriate to seek expert advice as to whether the whole <Col N="193" /> system of railway clearance might be allowed to peter out gradually.</P>

      <P>I want to make this point.  I have a constitutional horror of redundancy.  I have said in this House before, and I believe the Minister and the Deputy agree with me, that redundancy is the greatest evil which could ever hit a man at middle age.  Our aim and object should be the absorption of railway men into suitable employment.  It is no good giving a lump sum to a man at the age of 45 <Col N="194" /> or 50 and telling him to go and look for other employment.  He will not get it and his problem is very often seriously misunderstood by those who think that he should be able to get work.  If we, and C.I.E., made up our minds that railway clearance, in the old sense, was clearly unnecessary then we could put our hands to the task now of gradually giving these men some analogous employment, with the purpose in mind of ultimately giving them all suitable, alternative employment and then institute a new system which would make the Railway Clearing House unnecessary. That is all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Government decided in January last, as the House is aware, that if the estimated quantity of native wheat likely to be delivered to the mills from the 1958 crop exceeded 300,000 tons dried, it would be necessary to introduce a scheme which would spread fairly over all wheat growers the difference between the prices realised for the surplus and the cost of the wheat in the purchasers' stores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> From the information at present available, it appears that there will be a surplus of wheat from the 1958 crop and the purpose of this Bill is to empower the Minister for Agriculture to implement the proposals already announced and discussed in this House. Briefly, these proposals are that a levy will be deducted by the purchasers from the price of all millable wheat marketed; this levy will be paid into a fund to be managed by a board to be set up under this Bill and will be used to meet the cost of the disposal of the surplus wheat.</P>
    <P>Before going on to the terms of the Bill, I think I should mention that the requirement of 300,000 tons of dried native wheat was related to a higher rate of consumption of flour than the present rate.  The production of flour during the current cereal year is approximately 10 per cent. less than in the same period last year and in the circumstances there is little likelihood that the requirement of 300,000 tons will be increased.</P>
    <P>The most important sections of the Bill are Sections 2, 3 and 4.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the deduction of the wheat levy from the standard price by the purchasers and for the transmission of the sums involved to the board which is to be set up under the Act.  This section also provides for a payment of the levy to the Minister in the event of the board not being in operation before the commencement of the 1958 harvest.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the fixing of the rate of wheat levy by the Minister. It is intended that before fixing the levy the Minister should consult with the board to be set up, but provision is also made for consultation with representatives of the growers in the event of the board not being in operation before the levy appropriate to the 1958 crop is determined.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the establishment of a board to be known as An Bord Gráin.  The primary function of this board will be to collect the wheat levies and to arrange for the disposal of surplus wheat to the best advantage. It is intended that the board shall consist of a chairman and not less than <Col N="197" /> four or more than eight other members to be appointed by the Minister for Agriculture.  It is intended that wheat growers and other interests concerned will be represented on the board.  I may mention at this stage that I have had consultations with representatives of the flour millers, who have indicated to me that they are not disposed to be represented on the proposed board. They have, however, informed me that they will be prepared to co-operate in the purchase, handling, drying and storage of any surplus wheat on behalf of the board provided moneys are advanced to them to enable such purchases to be made.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that in addition to the general powers being given to the board to purchase and sell surplus home-grown millable wheat and to collect the wheat levy it will also be empowered&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) to invest moneys under its control; (b) to arrange for the carriage, drying, handling and storage of wheat either by providing itself with the necessary facilities or by arranging with the owners of such facilities to use them on behalf of the board; (c) to provide itself with such offices and premises as it considers necessary and to equip and maintain such offices and premises; (d) to borrow, with the consent of the Minister, from time to time such moneys as it considers necessary; provision is also made for the guaranteeing of a loan to the board by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance up to a maximum of £3,500,000; (e) to appoint such and so many persons to be its officers and servants as it thinks fit (an officer of the board will be authorised to inspect and to make copies of records of all purchases of wheat.  This power is necessary in order that the board may ensure that levy is paid on all purchases); (f) to require wheat purchasers by notice in writing to furnish to the board in such form and at such time or times as it may specify returns disclosing the date of purchase of any wheat and the quantity, quality and condition of wheat purchased.</P>
    <P>It is provided in Sections 20 and 21 that the board shall submit to the <Col N="198" /> Minister each year a copy of its accounts, including the balance sheet, certified by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, together with an annual report, and that such accounts and report shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated already, the primary function of the board is to collect the levy and arrange for the disposal to the best advantage of the surplus wheat which may arise.  I would like, however, to direct the attention of the House to Section 7 of the Bill, which provides that the Minister for Agriculture may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, from time to time by Order&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) assign to the board such additional functions as he thinks fit in relation to cereals (excluding wheat imported for milling), cereal products and animal feeding stuffs; (b) make such provision as he considers desirable or necessary in relation to matters ancillary to, or arising out of, the assignment to or fulfilment by the board of functions assigned to it under this section.</P>
    <P>This provision is being included in the Bill in view of the fact that Grain Importers (Éire) Limited will probably be wound up in the near future.  As the House is aware, that company has fulfilled a very useful function since 1939 in arranging for imports of wheat and coarse grains and also in operating various schemes introduced for the purchase and disposal of home-grown cereals.  When this company was set up in 1939, it was intended that it should operate only for the emergency period. Due to various circumstances, however, it has been continued in operation and its directors, who have given their services without fee, are anxious to be relieved of their responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed that the business of importing wheat for milling will revert to the usual trade channels.  There is no serious difficulty involved in this proposal as the quantity of wheat to be imported can be estimated with reasonable accuracy and may be restricted by licence issued under the Cereals Act. The position in regard to coarse grains presents a more difficult problem having <Col N="199" /> regard to the difficulty in determining from time to time the quantities to be imported and in regulating the price of imported grain in relation to the price of home-grown cereals. While it may be possible, in consultation with the interests concerned, to arrange for the import through the usual trade channels, of such limited quantities of coarse grain as may be required, it is most desirable that some central organisation should be available to implement such schemes as may be devised for the marketing of home-grown cereals.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to mention that the board will be concerned only with millable wheat.  Wheat which is not up to milling standard by existing regulations will not be purchased by or on behalf of the board.</P>

      <P>This Bill ends the guaranteed price for wheat.  It was the object of the Government of which I was a member to try to extend as far as possible the principle that if industrialists were to get the benefit of security for their profits by the high tariff system in operation here and if industrial workers were to secure the benefit of fixed wages as a result of industrial agreements entered into by their trade unions and employers&mdash;all of which must ultimately be paid by the farmers&mdash;the farmers would get on their side some assurance that if they laboured for 14 hours a day for seven days a week in a good many cases, commonly six days a week, they would get a sure and certain price for what they produced.</P>
      <P>We extended that guarantee from wheat to beet, barley, pigs and milk. It is now, by this Bill, being swept away in respect of wheat, for no man knows what the price of wheat will be this year.  I gather that the price is to be reduced from the price fixed by our Government of 78/6 per barrel for wheat of 64 lb. bushel weight and 22 per cent. moisture or less by 6/- a barrel, but no one can tell what the reduction will be next year when the deficit on the realisation of what is described as surplus wheat in this Bill has been completed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is a bad principle to set up here a system whereunder the industrial employer, the industrial worker, the civil servant, the Civic Guard and the soldier, are all guaranteed an income related to the cost of living, on the assumption that the farmer who works the land will make his contribution to each of those charges; and that each of those types of person&mdash;the industrialist, the industrial worker, the civil servant, the soldier and the Guard&mdash;is to be guaranteed a limited working day for a wage strictly related to the cost of living; but that the farmer, and the farmer alone, is to be told that he must work an unrestricted day, for a reward the dimensions of which he does not know.  Having worked 14 hours a day for six days of the week, in the belief that his product will realise 78/6 a barrel, the farmer is to discover, when the time comes to harvest it, that by an arbitrary decision taken by the Minister for Agriculture, after consulting the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the <Col N="201" /> price of 78/6 can be reduced by any amount&mdash;nobody knows how much. That is wrong; that is unjust.  That in itself is bad enough, but what is peculiarly gross in this Bill is that it represents a shameless and disgraceful repudiation of the pledged word of the majority Party in this country to the voters at the last election.</P>

      <P>I want to listen to Deputy Killilea, so that we can mark well the sentiments which inspire the Fianna Fáil Party.  On the face of this Bill, there appear the words &ldquo;Schedule&mdash;An Bord Gráin.&rdquo;  The Minister has gone all Gaelic in his middle age. &ldquo;Gráin&rdquo; in this context, I gather, is the genitive of &ldquo;grán&rdquo;.  But the word &ldquo;gráin&rdquo; has another meaning and it can be translated by many suitable words in English.  Here is a selection of some of them.  It makes this word peculiarly suitable for endorsement on the cover of this Bill.  &ldquo;Gráin&rdquo; means disgust, dislike, abhorrence, aversion, hatred, shame, horror, ugliness and reproach.  Was it ever better chosen for endorsement on the cover of a Bill? &ldquo;Gráin ort!&rdquo; means &ldquo;Shame on you!&rdquo;&ldquo;Tá gráin agam ort&rdquo; means &ldquo;I loathe you.&rdquo;  And it is the Minister who chose that word.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an inspired choice, for it most aptly describes this shameless transaction.  Let it be remembered as the policy of hatred, shame, ugliness and reproach, and it will be that to Fianna Fáil so long as it is there.  For what is the purpose of this board?  The purpose of this board is to do the dirty thing that the Minister has not the courage to do himself. There is only one purpose in setting up this board and that is to cut the price of wheat.  When I had to cut the price of wheat, as I believed it to be my duty to do, I did it and I faced the music and I set the price and told the farmers that was all we could afford to pay.  I told my own Government the price would have to be paid and that the Exchequer would have to meet the cost; that and no more.  But what is this disgusting instrument aimed at doing?  It aims to say that the Minister for agriculture has set the price at 78/6 a barrel and that he and the Minister for Industry and Commerce will arbitrarily determine that 300,000 tons of wheat are what are required and that any wheat over and above that becomes the responsibility of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> The board is constituted, not of representatives freely chosen by the producers of wheat, but chosen by the Minister for Agriculture and he commits to their care the disposal of what he declares to be a surplus.  When they have disposed of that surplus, they will report to him the loss and he will lend them the money to meet the loss, with the proviso that he will then fix a levy and at that stage he extends to them the courtesy of consultation. He will consult with them as to how much the price of wheat must be cut in order to pay the loss they made on the sale of wheat, until eventually the farmers are forced into the position of saying that it was they who cut the price of wheat; that it was they who lost the money on the sale of the wheat.  And it is to meet the loss they made that the Minister must put the levy on in order to recoup the loss made, not by the Minister, but by the farmers into whose hands he committed the sale of the surplus wheat.</P>
    <P>When I contemplate the despicable fraud of which the Fianna Fáil Party is capable, I so well remember the Milk Costings Commission; I so well remember the unfortunate creamery farmers being called in by the late Deputy Tom Walsh who was the Minister's predecessor and mine, and being told that all their troubles were over, that he was going to place their affairs in the hands of the Milk Costings Commission which would resolve the problems and settle the difficulties for evermore.  And they swallowed it and the whole dirty, fraudulent farce of the Milk Costings Commission dragged its nauseating course along, until eventually the report emerged informing us that milk could be produced in this country at anything from 2½d. to 1/9 a gallon.</P>
    <P>The farmers were then told to read that and then come back and make their representations.  We have not heard a word from them since.  When that disgusting device was first conceived in the minds of Fianna Fáil, I remember saying to our dairy farmers: &ldquo;You are being fraudulently dealt with; you are being led up the garden; this is a completely fraudulent device to betray you.&rdquo;  But they accepted it <Col N="204" /> and they believed it was going to confer a benefit upon them, but the end result has been that the price of milk has been reduced by 1¼d. officially, but it is common knowledge throughout the creameries of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely we cannot discuss the price of milk on this Bill which deals with wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is common knowledge that there is another 1/2d. a gallon coming off the price at the instance of the creameries, in order to meet the conditions imposed on them by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>In exactly the same way, a board is being established here which wipes away all certainty about the price of wheat and which transfers on to the farmer the obligation of realising the losses so that in fact they may be told, when the levy is fixed next year, that they cut their own throats and that the Minister for Agriculture had nothing to do with it.  If my summing up of the situation is correct, the proposal this year is to underestimate the crop and the deduction this year will be relatively trivial; relatively, I say, because if it is 6/- a barrel this year, it is nothing compared with what it will be next year.  But if they can be persuaded to accept the principle this year, the responsibility is squarely fixed on them in the years that lie ahead.</P>
      <P>I hate that kind of dirty fraud.  I hate the kind of Government that treats the people with contemptuous indifference, that jeers at them as they do them injury.  I hate the Government that treats the farmers as if they were hewers of wood and drawers of water in their own land.  I hate a Government supported by an absolute majority in this House that tramples on the rights of people who cannot defend themselves.  It is true that the entire requirements of wheat can be produced on 3 per cent. of the arable land of Ireland, but let no Deputy deceive himself.  The evil element in this Bill is not its direct impact on 3 per cent. of our agricultural land; it is the shameful principle that you defraud the people and trample on their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what is being done to the farmers and if the Government had the <Col N="205" /> honesty and decency to come out in public and say: &ldquo;This is what we propose to do and you can lump it or like it&rdquo;, I would have respect for them. At least, there is something to be said in defence of the Minister's action in declaring that he was going to reduce the price of pigs.  I thought he was wrong in doing it; I was sure he was wrong, but he did it honestly.  If he made up his mind it was the requisite thing to do, he did it honestly and he told his own constituents, some of them the most intensive pig producers in Ireland, that it had to be done and that he would stand over it.  That is decent and can never injure public life in this country.  You may agree with him or disagree with him, but it was honest and decent and judgment can be passed upon it without the feeling that you are struggling in a dirty mess of fraud and deceit.</P>
    <P>This Bill is dishonest, rotten and shameful, because in fact it is the production of a Bill of 25 sections and a Schedule as a smokescreen to cover up the fact that the Government are determined to reduce the price of wheat and to go on reducing it until it reaches a level which will evoke no more than the 300,000 tons they have made up their minds are all they will pay the farmer for.  It is not honest in my judgment.  That was what their policy was, to tell the farmers what prices would be and to say if they were not on the right level then they would be adjusted again, but it is disreputable to employ machinery of this kind in the futile hope that by this you can spare the blushes of Deputy Medlar, Deputy Maher and Deputy Moher not to speak of poor Deputy Corry.  I have never known him to blush and there was no need to spare his blushes.  Coming down to the details of this Bill I have certain comments to make.</P>
    <P>How does anyone defend the proposition that if this surplus of wheat is the property of the farmers, of the growers, they are not to be the people to choose the board charged with the responsibility of dealing with it? Surely, if they are fit to grow the wheat they are fit to choose the people who will dispose of their own property? <Col N="206" /> How is it that the Minister binds himself to consult about the size of the levy but not about the size of the surplus?  He says that he will consult the National Farmers' Association some time this month to determine what the likely dimension of the surplus will be. That is a laughable and grotesque decision because there is no living man who can tell to-day what the yield of the wheat crop will be next September.</P>
    <P>Some arbitrary figure will be arrived at which will justify a levy of 6/- a barrel on wheat this year, but next year there will be the ascertained deficit of this year's transactions, plus the informed estimate that is to be made in the light of this year's experience, and that will have to be met by the levy to be put on the price of wheat next year, which no one will know the extent of until July has been reached when all the wheat is grown. Did Deputies hear this interesting pronouncement by the Minister: &ldquo;It is intended that wheat growers and other interests concerned will be represented on the board.  I may mention at this stage that I have had consultations with representatives of the flour millers, who have indicated to me that they are not disposed to be represented on the proposed board.&rdquo;  They did not come down in yesterday's shower.  They will have nothing to do with the proceedings of this board. They are washing their hands for all the world to see declaring before the whole country: &ldquo;We have no responsibility for this.  It is the farmers unaided who have been elected to cut their own throats and we want no hand in the operation.&rdquo;  Why should they? If their own Minister is prepared to sharpen the knife, why should the millers accept the odium of whetting the blade?</P>
    <P>We now come, as far as we can, to what the Minister's intentions are and to what the functions of the board shall be.  Of course, the Minister is adopting the technique of his colleague, the Minister for Finance, and that is to come in here and tell the House nothing; then sit back and see what is going to happen.  He says: &ldquo;It will be noted that in addition to the general powers being given to the <Col N="207" /> board to purchase and sell surplus home-grown millable wheat and to collect the wheat levy&rdquo;&mdash;mark you&mdash;&ldquo;to collect the wheat levy!&rdquo;  Just imagine setting up a board of farmers, one of whose principal functions is to collect the levy which is to be determined by the Minister in consultation with them.  There is nothing like rubbing it in is there?  There is something almost sadistic in that arrangement.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will also be empowered,&rdquo; this paragraph goes on to read, &ldquo;(a) to invest moneys under its control; (b) to arrange for the carriage, drying, handling and storage of wheat by providing itself with the necessary facilities or by arranging with the owners of such facilities to use them on behalf of the board.&rdquo;&ldquo;To invest moneys under its control&rdquo;&mdash;that will be a very entertaining occupation for them.  See the picture, see them rolling in dough with nowhere to put it, and so being given powers not only to put it in the bank, but to invest it so that they may have the income from their surplus earnings.</P>
    <P>Who owns all the facilities in this country for drying, handling and the storage of wheat?  The owners are the boys who announced so graciously, who indicated to the Minister, that they were not disposed to be represented on the board.  They will be represented when it comes to drying, to storing, to handling, to housing and to unhousing.  That is a very favourite occupation of grain storage companies in this country.  You get paid for putting in each sack and you get paid for taking out each sack.  That is called housing and unhousing, and there is a fee payable every time it is done. These people are standing ready to correspond with this power of Bord Gráin&mdash;&ldquo;to arrange with the owners of such facilities to use them on behalf of the board.&rdquo;  It does not go on to say &ldquo;at a suitable fee&rdquo;.  That is understood.</P>
    <P>I remember when I was responsible for cold-storing butter in this country. I notice that procedure has been dropped now and the creameries are to go and make what bargain they can with the consumers in Dublin and Bray.  I remember what it meant to <Col N="208" /> me, when I was the only authority in the country to negotiate with the proprietors of cold stores for the storage of butter.  On one occasion I was told that the poor cold-storage proprietors could not keep the power on if the price was not put up, that if the price was not raised the next day somebody would have to turn off the power. When you have some hundreds or thousands of tons of butter on hands you pay and look pleasant, but I wonder what this board will do in negotiating with the owners of such facilities to use them on behalf of the board.  They can console themselves with this knowledge, that whatever the charges made by the proprietors of this accommodation may be, they will not compare with the levy which the Minister will make upon them after consultation with themselves.</P>
    <P>The board have power to borrow with the consent of the Minister.  They are to have the obligation to repay it.  I notice that the importation of coarse grain is to be returned to the normal channels; the importation of wheat is to be returned to the normal channels. I wonder what that means?  Does it mean that anyone can import wheat or that anyone can get a licence to do so, or does it mean that we will confine the importation of wheat to those firms engaged in the trade prior to 1939?  I invite Deputies to read the Flour and Milling Report.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting final paragraph in the Minister's speech which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Finally, I should like to mention that the board will be concerned only with millable wheat.  Wheat which is not up to milling standard by existing regulations will not be purchased by or on behalf of the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What will be done with the unmillable wheat?  Who is going to determine what is millable and what is unmillable? The board is going to have nothing to do with it.  There has been an argument going on in this country for quite some time as to whether wheat which had in it the potentialities of sprouting was millable or not.  The millers said it was not; the growers said it was and I said it was. The millers bought it and milled it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> I think many Deputies imagine that this board was set up to take the whole wheat crop which was not used to fill the 300,000 tons required by the Government's policy.  That is not so.  This board is charged with responsibility only for so much of the wheat crop as it is agreed is millable and nobody will define what millable means.  It largely depends upon what millers say it is. Will the Minister enforce or prescribe a definition of millable, and, if not, what are we going to do with the unmillable wheat?</P>
    <P>Remember that this board is to be charged with the responsibility of selling the surplus millable wheat as animal feed.  What is the farmer going to do whose wheat is declared to be unmillable?  These are questions to which we have no answer.  I do not believe we are meant to have an answer, but all this taken together means this: The whole principle of guaranteed prices for farmers is in the process of going down the drain.  I believe it is studied Fianna Fáil policy to send it down the drain.</P>
    <P>They no longer believe that the farmers are entitled to any guarantee. They believe it is too much of a nuisance.  It might prove too costly and in any case the farmers will not fight.  They avoided industrial strife by providing an all-round increase of 10/-; they avoided an upheaval in the public services by conceding the same thing to the Civil Service, the Army and the Garda.  They notified every industrial producer in this country that price control was ended and every distributor in Ireland knows that thereupon there issued a shower of notices from every protected industry in this country telling us that because of the increased cost of production prices must be adjusted upwards.</P>
    <P>The biscuit manufacturers were informed that they would get an annual subvention of from £80,000 to £100,000 a year out of the surplus wheat in order to help them to compete on the home market.  Every section of the community was given security at a higher level than they had hitherto enjoyed, except the farmers, who were told that they would take a certain cut in the price of pigs and who have learned <Col N="210" /> to their cost that they are now required to take an indeterminate cut in the price of milk and wheat.  They are fixed with notice by the Minister that he has no intention hereafter of providing any minimum guarantee for barley.</P>
    <P>I wonder what Fianna Fáil Deputies themselves think.  I shall listen with interest to Deputy Allen who for years championed the principle of guaranteed prices in this House and who boasted that he was concerned and dismayed to see any interference with it.  I shall be most interested to hear what Deputy Allen has to say now. Oh, he will say something!  He is a hardened old warrior.  He gets up and fights his corners as best he can.  He is not like the others who are afraid to show their faces.  At least Deputy Allen is here.  He will do his stuff and I shall be interested to hear what he has to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That cock will not fight. The plain truth is that we provided guaranteed prices for pigs, barley, milk, wheat and beet, and, while admitting freely that there certainly was not unanimity of opinion between me and other Deputies on the question of wheat and beet, I often said in this House that the test of a sound democratic Parliament was that a Government in office should have due regard to the feelings of the minority for the time being.  In deference to those feelings the first thing I ever did, as Minister for Agriculture, was to provide a five year guarantee for the price of wheat.  No Deputy can deny that.</P>

      <P>When I did that, I answered to the people for it.  This Bill is designed to do that and more than that, with this distinction: It does not fix a price which can be argued on the merits in this House.  It <Col N="211" /> fixes an unascertainable price level which nobody can discuss because nobody knows what it is.  It sweeps away the whole principle of security which we sought to establish and did with success establish in every branch of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I submit to the House that the effect of that is easy to see.  We fixed a price for pigs and at the present moment we are exporting approximately £4,000,000 worth of pig meat and the output is rising.  It is rising because the price was fixed.  We provided the Minister for Agriculture with powers under the 1956 Pigs and Bacon Act, if the curers try to smash down the price of Grades B and C pigs, to take steps which would compel them to pay a price properly related to the Grade A price fixed by the Minister for Agriculture for the time being.  The result of that stability in prices has been expanding production.  We secured a high minimum level for cattle prices in this country and the result of that guarantee has been an immense expansion in the output of live stock.  We linked the price of sheep to the guaranteed price of sheep in Great Britain and the result has been an immense increase in the numbers of sheep.</P>

      <P>That I ask and intend to secure.  I want to suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that, instead of persisting in this dishonest repudiation of all the principles of price security for the agricultural community which we have sought to establish here, he should withdraw this Bill, fix a fair price for wheat and stand over it. Naturally, that price must be related to the burden which the Exchequer can be reasonably asked to bear associated with the burden that the production of domestic wheat imposes on the consumer in this country.  Let that responsibility be faced.  Let the liability be estimated with reasonable accuracy, as it can be, in this year and with virtually certain accuracy in the years thereafter and let us restore to the producers of this crop the certainty which has proved so salutary in the production of every other category of agricultural produce under our Administration.  Take away from this and other crops the degree of certainty and security they have hitherto enjoyed and I warn you that you will see an immediate decline in production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should not be necessary to remind this House that but for the fact that there was an expansion of production last year which enabled us to increase our total exports, the bulk of which are agricultural products, by over £20,000,000, we would now be in the middle of an acute financial crisis.  I direct the attention of Dáil Éireann to <Col N="213" /> the fact that the trend in the balance of payments for the first five months of this year is in no degree reassuring. If, by the policy of this Government, the total output of agriculture is beaten down, we may well find ourselves in very acute financial difficulties 12 months from to-day and we will have no recourse open to us to meet them if and when they should recur.</P>
    <P>Confidence is the basis of expanding production.  Uncertainty is the one thing that can destroy confidence.  I ask any Fianna Fáil Deputy in this House, can he tell me with any degree of precision what will be paid for wheat 12 months from next September? We know with reasonable precision what the Government intend to pay for it this year but, when the full loss is realised on this year's crop, can any Deputy tell me what is the likely price in 12 months' time?</P>
    <P>We used to provide the farmers, not with one year's guarantee, but with two years' guarantee of a minimum price, on the understanding that it might be adjusted upwards if international circumstances required.  That was done in 1956 when transport charges for foreign wheat rose so steeply that the Government came to the conclusion that it was equitable and just that we should increase the price of domestic wheat by 5/- a barrel but there was the certainty that it would not come below the price that had been guaranteed at the beginning of a two-year period.  Is there any Fianna Fáil Deputy who can speculate as to what the price of wheat will be in 12 months' time?  Does any Deputy know with certainty what will be paid for it this year?  Does any Deputy believe that that board, as at present constituted and with the powers conferred upon it by this Government, can do anything for the agricultural community to relieve the situation in which they now find themselves?</P>
    <P>I want to go on record as saying that that board is set up for the purpose of deceiving our people and misleading them and I want to go on record as saying that it is rightly named &ldquo;An Bord Gráin,&rdquo; if we take the second meaning of that word, which is, &ldquo;disgust, dislike, abhorrence, <Col N="214" /> aversion, hatred, shame, horror, ugliness and reproach.&rdquo;  I end as I began. In respect of this Bill, I have to say to the Minister responsible for it: Is gráin ort é&mdash;it is a shame on him&mdash; and, on behalf of this Party, tá gráin againn air.</P>

      <P>When the Minister has left off reading the evening paper, perhaps he will hearken to some of the comments in this House in relation to the contents of the Bill that he introduced this evening.  As Deputy Dillon has pointed out, this is a face-saving effort on behalf of the Government similar to the setting up of a Milk Costings Commission on an occasion when the same Government was considerably embarrassed by the demands of farmers in relation to the price of milk. Time proved the shame which was behind the setting up of that commission and the complete abandonment of hope for those who thought that in that commission there was some advantage to the milk producer.  A similar policy of passing the buck is being followed on this occasion.  The buck is being passed to a board which the Minister is to appoint.</P>
      <P>We must consider this in the light of the conditions that prevailed in the country generally in the past number of years.  All Parties in the House appealed to the agricultural community to increase production.  By increasing production they have brought the country out of considerable difficulties in relation to the balance of payments. The people who responded to that call issued by all Parties in this House and by everybody in public life are to-day very critical when they find a fine imposed upon them for having increased production to the point that we now have a surplus of wheat.</P>
      <P>It is true that the dramatic increase in production has contributed greatly to the conditions that now exist.  The most stringent measures would have had to be introduced to protect the entire economy, were it not for the fact that our agriculturists responded to the appeal made so that not alone are we in a position to fulfil the requirements of our home market but to export the commodities we are now able to produce in abundance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> These results were forthcoming only after the producers were given certain guarantees in relation to prices.  It was a natural development from the fact that farmers realised that they had an assurance from the Government in office that prices would be maintained at a certain level.  It is now asserted by way of interruption by some of the Deputies sitting behind the Minister that they did not indicate 15 or 16 months ago to the electorate that it was any part of their policy to restore the price of wheat to the 80/- level which, particularly in by-election areas, they were very fond of naming to the electorate as the price which they thought was a fair price for wheat.</P>
    <P>During the Carlow-Kilkenny by-election campaign, I was present in the City of Kilkenny on the occasion on which the Taoiseach spoke in support of Deputy Medlar.  Most of the mystery that attended the campaign of the Fianna Fáil Party then was in relation to the identity of the future Minister for Agriculture.  The man who was presented at the chapel gates on every occasion in that constituency as the shadow Minister for Agriculture was Deputy Corry.  I was present that night in the City of Kilkenny when Deputy Corry was introduced as the next speaker to the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>I regret that on the occasion I mention I had not got a tape recorder with me so that I would have a recording of the solemn assurance given by Deputy Corry on that occasion, in the hearing of the Taoiseach. It was naturally well received by the farmers of Carlow-Kilkenny, many <Col N="216" /> of whom travelled considerable distances to hear these wonderful words of assurance from the man whom they thought then would become Minister for Agriculture, if Fianna Fáil were returned to office.  All the speakers on behalf of the Government Party were giving assurances to the people all over the country who were interested in the maintenance of wheat prices that a new dawn would break for the grain growers and in particular for the wheat growers, should there be a change of Government.</P>
      <P>To-day, we witness the complete jettisoning of all the assurances that were given by Party representatives throughout the country in the by-elections in Laois-Offaly, in Carlow-Kilkenny and in the subsequent general election.  There was a discussion in this House in relation to the wheat price, following the Minister's decision to introduce the married price.  We have information now that we did not have then.  We pointed out that this was a very strong Government, a Government that had assured all sections of the community that it was its intention to get cracking immediately on election to office.  The Minister then introduced this married price in relation to wheat.  On this occasion, I must say he did not speak with the confidence which he can display on occasions, but claimed that this was to some extent something that was advanced to him by the National Farmers' Association and which he thought should get a trial.  He did not then formally assert that this was the considered policy by the Government which the Government were sponsoring in entirety, but it was something to which they were committed because they had certain consultations with the National Farmers' Association in connection with the married price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It now transpires that the presentation of that proposal in the House was misleading to Deputies inasmuch as the National Farmers' Association were left under the impression that the extent of home-grown wheat they considered would be required for home consumption was at the level of 380,000 tons of dried Irish wheat.  Since then, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking for the Minister for <Col N="217" /> Agriculture and his colleagues, has indicated that they are formally wedded to the level of 300,000 tons, the level beyond which the Minister for Agriculture will not go.  Consequently in this Bill, the Minister has ensured that he will be the person to indicate to An Bord Gráin what the level will be.  They will have no voice in it.  He is the doctor who will examine the patient and decide where the trouble is. He will merely give to the patient the doubtful privilege of wielding the scalpel.</P>
    <P>Who can say what this board can achieve more than other organisations have been endeavouring to do in relation to the disposal of wheat?  The wheat producers in this instance are the body of people primarily concerned because if the efforts of this board do not succeed, it will react upon the producers who will suffer the consequent reduction in the price they will receive for their grain.  Yet, the Minister, in the appointing of this board, does not permit the direct voice of the wheat producers.  Surely if he is transferring to them the adminstrative responsibilities which will be transferred if this Bill goes through, he should have given them some voice in the determination of the extent of the surplus.</P>
    <P>It is true that this is a problem which has captured the interest of very many people in the country, and in particular, farmers' organisations. Different suggestions have been put forward to cope with the problem. They have not been given a trial and the people concerned have not been given a complete explanation as to why their ideas are not practicable, but they are presented with this proposal which presents an easy way for the Government to get rid of a commodity which is too hot to handle.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government could very well destroy the arrangements that exist at the moment for consultation with these bodies if they are to be recognised by this Government only as bodies which can be put forward as being the organisations which initiated particular schemes which the Government later adopted. This would give the Government an opportunity to say: &ldquo;We did not think <Col N="218" /> of it.  It was this organisation and that organisation that thought it up.&rdquo; Are they being fair to these organisations in unloading upon their shoulders the tremendous responsibility that is involved in the administration of these schemes?  If the board is set up and runs into serious difficulty, it will be an easy thing for the Government to say: &ldquo;We are not the people who made a mess of it.  It was those people who took on this responsibility.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are we being fair to them in inviting them into this situation and is there any danger that the Minister, or whoever succeeds him in the Ministry of Agriculture, may not obtain in years to come the same degree of co-operation as exists to-day because of the fact that a few years ago an organisation such as N.F.A. was invited into being by the previous Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon.  The farmers, particularly the young farmers, have advanced far beyond the stage of permitting themselves to be used as dupes in any such transaction.</P>
    <P>In relation to the various commodities farmers produce, I am far more perturbed by what is being done about the price of milk than wheat: I am more directly concerned with it.  The degree of confidence which existed as to the price farmers would receive is being entirely destroyed as regards the milk commodity and this proposal is to extend that uncertainty to wheat growing.  Whatever was expected by the dairy farmers in Fianna Fáil, there is no doubt that very much was expected of them by the wheat growers in consequence of the assurances they received throughout the country on so many occasions.</P>
    <P>The whole principle of the establishment of this board is wrong.  The method it is proposed to employ in its appointment is wrong, inasmuch as the producers have not the opportunity of directly electing the members of the board.  This board is being saddled with an immense responsibility.  We can look back on previous occurrences such as those in relation to the Milk Costings Commission to view the whole of this transaction at least with some scepticism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> There is no doubt that the people who have answered the call for increased production are already beginning to complain very bitterly of the fact that, having done so, the security they enjoyed in relation to milk has been removed and that the sum of a 1¼d. per gallon reduction in the price of milk has now been followed up by the reduction by another 1/2d. per gallon&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Increased production flowed from the guarantees given by the previous Government in relation to a number of commodities, including milk, beet, bacon, wheat and such like.  In this Bill, the Government are now removing the certainty which farmers enjoyed in relation to the price they would get for their wheat when the harvest came.  There is not a grower in the country to-day who knows what the price will be.  Even when he does, even when the price is indicated, he will not know that he will not, the following year, have to face a still greater reduction.  The Minister for Finance went down to his own constituency, and that of Deputy Allen, and mentioned that, we must accept ing mentioned that, we must accept that it is the Government's intention to do it.</P>
      <P>We see from the indications in this Bill that, over a two-year period, this board, when it is established and if it is established, must at the end of that period bring in a balanced budget, as it were.  There is no indication that the intention will be that the farmers will be assured, when they are paid for one year's crop, that they will not have a carry over to meet in the subsequent year's crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is the expressed intention of the Government, by this means, considerably to reduce the production of wheat, as they are deliberately doing in relation to milk, would it not be better to say it?  They are not saying it.  They want to slide into the position where they can point to some outside body and say: &ldquo;We have washed our hands of it.  It was the responsibility of someone else.  If they have not succeeded, <Col N="220" /> it is not the fault of the Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo;  It is an invidious position in which to put a responsible group of people and that is what the Minister wants to do.</P>
    <P>Last week, or the week before, the Minister indicated that there were also some minor additions to the blisters that the wheat grower is now asked to suffer.  He is asked to pay 6d. per bag per week in relation to the handling of wheat.  That is something he was not asked to pay heretofore.  When the previous Government gave 78/6 for wheat the costs of production-the rates they had to pay, the charges the normal person on a small farm had to meet&mdash;were considerably lower than they are to-day.  Since that figure was decided, this Government and private employers have come to the conclusion that, in consequence of an increased cost of living, in consequence of the reduced value of money, it was desirable that so many people in the community should get increases in their incomes to meet that increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Here, this Government are singling out the farming community so that not alone are they not to receive anything to meet the increase in the cost of living but they are to suffer reductions &mdash;the wheat growers, the milk producers and everybody, seemingly, engaged in agriculture.  Consequently, we are vigorously opposing the passage of this Bill.  We regard it merely as a face-saver.  The Government are trying to wriggle out of a hot problem. They look to this method of ridding themselves of this responsibility.  They are thinking of the day when there may be a considerable mess.  When it comes, they want to be in a position to wash their hands of any responsibility for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The few remarks I wish to offer in relation to this Bill will be offered, as much as possible, in a non-partisan way as regards the political past.  We are faced with the problem in connection with this Bill of whether we are sincere in our efforts to improve the status of agriculture. Whether we call it the Grain Board or An Bord Gráin to-day, we must face the problem in a realistic way.  I am <Col N="221" /> sorry that, when an important Bill such as this could be brought before the House, the Minister was not more realistic about what was necessary and about what should be done as regards the problem of surplus wheat and other grain.</P>
      <P>I believe the first mistake the Minister makes in this Bill concerns Section 3, sub-section (3).  The sub-section reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Before making an Order under this section the Minister shall consult with the board or, in the case of an Order made before the appointed day, with such person or persons, being a person or persons whom the Minister considers to be representative of wheat growers, as the Minister may select.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the first step which is not helping what could be a good measure. Why should it be solely, as it were, that under sub-section (3) of Section 3, the Minister will decide whether or not these people are suitable to consult with?  We in the Labour Party believe that is wrong.  We believe that when dealing with this problem, whether it be surplus or other wheat, the Minister should be prepared to discuss the matter with representatives of the growers.  I feel it would be fair and proper to leave it to the organised agricultural community to send their representatives to meet the Minister and not that the Minister should decide who is fit and proper to discuss the problem with him.  In my opinion, that is the first weak link showing the weakness in the chain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, we come to Section 6.  Surely I do not have to read it out.  In this section, the Minister mentions the purchase and sale of wheat by the board. I believe we are on the wrong track because the whole thing depends on the purchase of surplus wheat by the board.  It is our opinion in the Labour Party that it is vitally necessary that we have a grain board operating in such a way that a true spirit of co-operation can exist between all concerned, the growers, the Department and the millers.  In this case, the members of the board, whoever they may be, are certainly going to be put in a wrong position, because <Col N="222" /> they are allowed to purchase only surplus wheat.  It must, therefore, be admitted that this board is coming to life under most extraordinary circumstances and being handicapped in not being allowed to trade in wheat as a paying proposition, but only in surplus wheat which the Minister cannot get the millers to take.  Therefore, I consider Section 6 shows the drastic weakness enshrined in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8 goes much further and covers &ldquo;carriage, drying, handling and storage&rdquo; of wheat by the board and of course in sub-section (2) (c) it states the board &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister, may purchase or take on hire machinery, vehicles and equipment&rdquo;. If we could believe that the time might come when An Bord Gráin, or the Grain Board, would be in a position to erect its own suitable establishments and buy the necessary machinery, then I think it might be said that the Bill in itself might warrant sincere and genuine discussion in relation to its ultimate success.  However, I cannot be convinced that the Minister has even in his mind, let alone any intention of putting into operation, a system whereby the board will, at any time, buy its own machinery with the ultimate aim of operating in the same way as other State boards are able to operate. Therefore, I consider that Section 8 shows a further weakness in the board.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, there is no necessity to discuss, at any length, the other sections of the Bill.  There are 25 sections in it and most of them are what I would consider a &ldquo;dressing up&rdquo;.  I am very sorry that the Minister should introduce this Bill in such a way.  We would have thought, with the introduction of this Bill, that at least we would be going somewhere towards bringing agriculture into a true perspective whereby the organised agriculturists would be enabled to play a greater part in the improvement of agriculture than they are at present.  The tragedy is, however, that this Bill is, more or less, telling the organised agriculturists that they are not to interfere, that the Minister may consult but only with people whom he considers suitable as grain buyers.  Surely the Minister must <Col N="223" /> be satisfied when we say that this Bill cannot give us the return we hope for. I am very sorry that such should be the position.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is necessary to discuss further any other details.  I always believe that it would be much more helpful to the economy of the country if, when discussing anything pertaining to agriculture, we could leave out politics, leave out election promises and everything connected with them, and be more realistic in our approach.  The fact that the Minister, with the introduction of this Bill, makes it clear that it is he and he alone who will say who are to be members of such an important agricultural board, shows, perhaps without meaning it, a sense of complete irresponsibility towards these organised sections of the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>If such a board is to be set up, surely it is only right that the onus should be placed on the growers themselves to nominate persons on behalf of their organisations, and that they should have the responsibility of acting on such a board and by reporting back to their own organisations be in the position, as representatives of the agricultural community, of having a full sense of their own responsibilities to their organisations, and above all, to the community as a whole.  We know, and the people outside know, that very often the setting up of boards means only appointing some people to the board.  I am not throwing that in the Minister's face.  We all know that it applies to all Government in this country.  The setting up of a board means selecting these people.</P>
    <P>Why could we not change that system?  Why not say to the organisations concerned: &ldquo;The board is being set up; we want so many representatives and you may name yours.&rdquo; If the Minister approached this Bill in that manner, I believe he would then have the support of the Labour members in this House.  Unfortunately, in present circumstances, we could not give that support.  We could not find any pleasure in taking part in a discussion which will not help agriculture, any more than the passing of this Bill <Col N="224" /> will help the grain growers in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of surplus wheat which the Government, and the growers generally, have to face this year was brought about, I believe, by the Fianna Fáil Party; by the way they dealt with that problem during the last general election and by what has happened since.  At the last general election, the wheat growers were told by the Fianna Fáil people that if they were returned to power, the price of wheat would be restored to 82/6.  The Government was formed and by last autumn and the early part of 1958 had still made no announcement.  As a result, the growers believed that they were going to get a price of 82/6. Naturally, they could not be expected to think anything else.  Some time in the middle of January, this new scheme was announced and quite an amount of wheat was put in, on account of that line being taken, that would not normally have been put in.</P>
      <P>Then came the announcement that the price for top quality wheat was to be 78/6 up to a tonnage of 300,000 tons. The Minister has told us, and has said outside the House, that he is not too keen on this scheme.  He is, more or less, trying to put the responsibility on the National Farmers' Association which negotiated the scheme, but there is quite a difference between the scheme put up by the National Farmers' Association and the scheme we are to operate now.  The National Farmers' Association felt that our requirements in millable wheat were 380,000 tons.  Now it appears that agreement has been reached between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture for 300,000 tons and the Minister says there is to be a reduction in that.  The reduction which is to take place will have a very serious effect on the actual requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my biggest objections to this board is that it is to be asked to do only the most difficult things.  It is to be asked to do the unpopular things and it is to have responsibility for collecting this levy and for selling the surplus wheat.  If the Minister were sincere about this board, he <Col N="225" /> would give it much greater power. With the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the board should have a say in what the mixture of Irish wheat will be in the future.</P>
    <P>That is a matter that has been much discussed here and there were different opinions about it.  An all-Irish loaf was produced here.  It was received very well and the people believed it was successful. We know the millers and the bakers do not want that.  The millers will have a free hand with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and this new board will have no say in the problem.  The problem is a very big one and depends a lot on our surplus. If we can add more Irish wheat to the mixture, it will lessen our surplus. No attempt has been made in this Bill to meet that situation.</P>
    <P>There is another point in dealing with this surplus wheat.  In the present year, all the wheat purchased by the millers was naturally converted into millable wheat.  It was at a very high price by the time the millers were finished with it.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave us the price some time ago.  The average price for Irish wheat was 96/6 per barrel on the mill floor.  Although the average price for the farmer was 72/- per barrel, by the time the millers had got their costs for drying, storage and so on it had amounted to 96/6 per barrel. Some of that wheat has been sold for as low as £18 per ton; the loss has been as much as £20 per ton.  Some of it was sold in England for animal feed for £18 per ton.  If the new board has to face a problem like that, within two years there will be no problem of surplus wheat because the price will be so low that nobody will purchase it.  Perhaps that is the intention of the Bill?  I do not know.</P>
    <P>This wheat-growing problem should be tackled in a different way.  The high quality wheat should be handed over to the millers to convert into flour, while wheat which is not of millable quality should be converted into animal feed. The purchase price for the farmer would be a lower price on the bushel weight and moisture content.  It could be converted by the board and people in the trade at a much lower rate than that at which it would be handled by the <Col N="226" /> millers.  There is nothing in the Bill to ensure that will be done.  I hope it will be done because it would reduce the levy considerably.</P>
    <P>Another problem that should be tackled is the growing of wheat in large acreages on the conacre system.  No attempt has been made to put people growing such wheat on to a normal acreage.  With the type of farming they do, they can take a poor price but a farmer with land in proper rotation is entitled to a fair return.  It is these other people who are giving us the surplus we have to deal with.</P>
    <P>I am fully in agreement with Deputy Desmond in what he says about how the board should be appointed, If the Minister were sincere about the work of this board, he would have left its appointment to the farmers' organisations, to the wheat growers or the N.F.A.  They are the people responsible for producing this wheat.  They are the people who should nominate the board.  Yet it is the Minister who will nominate the chairman and members of the board.  I think it is a bad approach.  If the Minister were really anxious to see this board work, he would have left it to the wheat growers' organisations to elect the board.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister is sincere in this at all.  As Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Sullivan said, this is a way out of a very difficult problem for him.  Having promised the farmers that they would have no reduction, any reduction that takes place now will be the responsibility of the board.  The board will have two functions&mdash;the function of collecting the levy and the function of selling the surplus wheat. They will have nothing to do with how the levy is being calculated.  That is extraordinary.  It is clear the Minister is in no way sincere about this.  It is just a way out for him, and the farmers can put up with the consequences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>We all realise that the Government has a problem to face. I sympathise very sincerely with this Government or any other Government facing the situation that confronts them at the moment.  In fairness to the previous Government, when they were faced with the wheat problem in <Col N="227" /> 1954 and when, after the experience of the 1954 harvest, the then Minister for Agriculture came in here and drastically reduced the price of wheat, we felt very concerned about it.  But we must admit he did it in a courageous way, in a way damaging to his own prestige as Minister for Agriculture. Nevertheless, he faced the issue realistically and bravely.  The Government has faced this problem now but I do not think the present method is the best method of dealing with it.</P>
      <P>People abroad are very suspicious of boards and committees.  They feel, as I feel, that they are simply a way of evading responsibility and, perhaps, of sharing responsibility.  I do not know whether that was the motive behind the setting up of this board.  Certainly, some boards have given great results, like Bord na Móna and the E.S.B.  We cannot say the same of C.I.E. but then that body was faced with very involved and perhaps insurmountable difficulties.  My approach to this Bill is on the principle that boards do not appeal to the Irish people.  There is a Government in office and there is a Parliament, and the people expect that that Government and Parliament will deal with every problem confronting the nation without having to set up a special board.</P>
      <P>The Government would have been well advised to wait for another year, gain the experience of another year, then put it on trial and error and try to evolve some plan.  The Bill presupposes that this will be a permanent problem, that we shall be faced with a wheat surplus over a period of years. Is it wise or sound economics for the producers of this country to produce a surplus and then be levied on that very surplus in order to maintain a price for the surplus?  That is very debatable and controversial.  If the Bill is necessary, it is really premature at the moment.  We should allow some further time elapse and realise where we stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board will be set up shortly. The time is very short.  That board will have to provide drying and storage facilities and try to get contacts abroad for markets for our surplus <Col N="228" /> wheat.  The Minister has not told us how the board will be constituted.  He will nominate the board.  Like Deputy Desmond and Deputy Hughes, I think that, at least, the board should be composed entirely of people who are responsible for the production of wheat in this country.  If they are willing to act on the board, they should have full representation.  It is their problem and they might eventually be in a position to control the growing of wheat.  I am at one with Deputy Hughes on that.</P>
    <P>Cereal growing of that nature should be confined at least to farmers, to people already in possession of land. I do not see why other interests should be allowed to operate in the farmer's activity.  Over the years, there have been paid agents of wheat assemblers or of millers.  That is all unnecessary now, though in the early days there might have been some justification for it.  I do not see why agents should come along now and be paid agents' fees, as all that must come out of the pockets of the producers. These agents' fees come to a considerable amount at the end of the cereal year.</P>
    <P>Going back to conacre, if a person has the activity, the ambition and the initiative to take conacre land, he should be compelled to grow the cereal which is in short supply and his activity should be diverted from the growing of wheat, of which we already have a surplus.</P>
    <P>This House is now being asked to set up another State body.  I presume that the manager, whoever he is, will be a paid official of the State, and that his officers will be paid.  I suppose it is common sense and prudence that the members of the board will have their expenses paid.  That cost will come out of the levy which will be put on the producers here who produce that cereal.  It is contradictory and I do not think it is the right way to approach it.  Some other means should have been devised to control the supply of wheat to the point that would produce our own requirements, either through restricting the conacre people in their choice or by having some sort of contract system.  There should be some means other than the <Col N="229" /> present one&mdash;which I think will not be successful.  If it is successful, it will impact very heavily on the pockets of the producers.</P>
    <P>Coming from the Party opposite&mdash; they can take all the credit they like for it, as they have been the great protagonists of wheat over the years&mdash; no one will be more disappointed than their own followers.  They would expect more sympathy and more realism in a situation like this that confronts the Government now.  They would expect a better and simpler method of dealing with such a problem affecting the agricultural community.</P>

      <P>I think I am about the seventh speaker on the Opposition side to speak in relation to this Bill. It seems that the Deputies on the Government side have gone out of the House and run away from this Bill. They are afraid to come in and hear the debate in relation to the effects it is bound to have very soon on the wheat growers.  They seem to have left the House with a guilty conscience. We can understand that they have guilty consciences in relation to the adjustment of wheat prices, when we consider the mean, dishonest campaigns which were run, up and down the country, wherever it suited them, in relation to wheat prices at various times in years past.  It is only right now that I should challenge Deputy Allen and ask him if he is prepared to stand up here to-day to support this Bill.  Does he intend to offer any argument in opposition to the points made by speakers on this side of the House? Will he stand up and offer any excuses for the decision of the Minister and the Government to bring in a shameful piece of legislation such as this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This piece of legislation is designed purely and simply to set up a price-cutting board.  The Party opposite are ashamed and afraid to cut the price of wheat themselves, if they consider that the cut is necessary.  Instead, they come to the Dáil and ask for approval here for the establishment of a wheat marketing board, but in effect it will be a price-cutting board.  It is obvious that the Government have decided to run away from this question of wheat <Col N="230" /> prices, which they made a very live issue in the past.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of the present Minister for Finance.  No doubt, he has a lot to say in relation to the effects which obviously can be expected from this legislation.  Only on the eve of the general election, he shed crocodile tears in relation to a reduction of the wheat price.  Any foolish farmers who believed what they heard him say, believed that if the Fianna Fáil Party succeeded in forming a Government, the 1954 maximum price would be restored. After the general election, the present Government had a clear majority.  I remember that they were asked then if they would declare the price for wheat which they advocated during the election and in the years between 1954 and 1957.  Their reply was &mdash;and it was a lame excuse, since most of the wheat had not yet been planted &mdash;that the question of price fixing would not be decided until the following year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance at that time went to the trouble of bringing in the name of the great Deputy Corry, pointing out that the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government realised the national importance of growing wheat and that no doubt, having regard to the views of Deputy Corry, an adjustment of the price could be expected. But it did not happen.  Instead, every sneaky device which could be conjured up was used to depress the price of wheat and to discourage the growing of wheat.  It appears also that on this occasion the Minister disregarded any representations or views which the National Farmers' Association were prepared to submit for his consideration. It seems that he was consulting with advisers in relation to price-cutting on the one hand and carrying on communications with the N.F.A. without telling them what was happening behind the scenes.</P>
    <P>We have no undertaking that this proposed board will be a board comprising producers.  Let us remember that it is the producers who want to sell the wheat and that they ought to have a marketing board, but if there is to be one, let the producers do the marketing.  It is obvious from the attitude of the Minister and the general <Col N="231" /> trend of this Bill, that it is not intended to give the producers a full hand in selling the wheat surplus through this board.  Fianna Fáil have claimed down through the years that they were the protagonists of wheat growing as a national policy for this country.  It is strange that any advantages which came to the wheat growers came to them during the years when Deputy Dillon was in office.  When he came into office first&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It seems to have no further effective function and I have tried to mention prices.  That is why I mentioned the price of 52/6 per barrel.  When Deputy Dillon first came into office as Minister for Agriculture the price was increased in accordance with rising costs during those years until eventually the Fianna Fáil Party put 5/- on to the ceiling price of 77/6 and called the maximum price 82/6.  When Deputy Dillon on this occasion was leaving office the maximum price, as a general rule, was 78/6.  There were also opportunities for producers to get more than 77/6&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Previously we had a system whereby if farmers kept wheat until after the 31st December they got a rise in January and a rise in February. They will not get that rise under the new system and those rises added to the 78/6 left it at a fairly substantial figure.  It is obvious that growers will not get 78/6.  It is obvious they will start well below £3 a barrel now for the price-building.</P>
      <P>I have calculated this year the farmers will be cut by approximately £1,000,000 under this new system. Apparently, the Government is not prepared to take £1,000,000 away from the farmers but they are setting up a board to take it away from them.  Not alone that, but we will have financial adjustments to be met next year and the years following.  Not alone will farmers have to take an immediate cut resulting from the levy machinery but they will also have to meet retrospectively the financial adjustments because of the cuts in preceding years in increasing as the board functions over the period.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the Government is not prepared to approve of the baking of an all-Irish loaf.  A sample loaf was sent to all Deputies and probably to other people interested in the problem of producing such a loaf.  I think most Deputies will agree that it was a perfectly-baked loaf.  I think it was only 1 lb. weight and it was probably high quality flour but certainly, if it was baked from average flour, it was very palatable.  It is very desirable that every effort should be made to have an all-Irish loaf.</P>
      <P>If we want such a loaf and if the Government want it, why should we come in here to try to set up a price-cutting board instead of trying to see a way of producing an all-Irish loaf?  I know there will be distribution problems particularly in relation to a loaf of only one lb.  Apparently it is not possible to make a larger loaf with the native wheat, but my complaint is that no attempt has been made to provide an all-Irish loaf instead of imposing this cut now&mdash;and this board&mdash;without seeing if there is any alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> I think it very unfair and a brazen fraud on the growers to have this done at a time when the crop is actually beginning to mature.  The Minister should not have brought in this Bill this year.  If there was any Fianna Fáil Deputy with any backbone he would stand up here or in the Party room and ask the Minister not to bring it to the Dáil, and seek approval for it, this year.</P>
    <P>The Government seem to be preparing to divest themselves of all responsibility in regard to wheat prices.  We recall the very great efforts Deputy Dillon made in 1954 to sell every barrel of wheat grown that year.  He had a very tough battle with the millers and bakers but at least he fought on the side of the farmers and tried to get that wheat sold, used and cashed.  The Minister is not taking the side of the farmers.  He throws them&mdash;if I may so describe it&mdash;to the wolves in the matter of price-cutting boards such as this. It is just a barefaced swindle but the farmers will not be fooled by it.  It is certain the Minister will hear more about it in the country.  The farmers will not be so foolish as to blame the board for the drastic cut in prices that will take place.  They know quite well that the Government has decided to cut the price of wheat but are ashamed and afraid to do it.  They have set up the board and this machinery to carry out an underhand method of cutting the price.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the valuable contribution to the national wheat-growing policy made by people who used conacre.  They were enterprising people, particularly during the emergency years.  They saw the need for growing wheat here and saw opportunities to make profit from it.  In the present situation those people are being abandoned to the mercies of this board and it will not be economic for them to continue growing wheat in the future in an organised way as they did in the past.  We shall have a situation now in which the growing of wheat will be killed and discouraged, according as the price to be fixed goes down.  A quota system might have been a fairer way to deal with wheat growers and keep the price level in relation to <Col N="234" /> previous years.  A wheat grower who can prove a record over the past ten years, five years, or even three years, should be recognised by the Government for the contributions which he made in producing native wheat, but now such a grower will be completely abandoned to the mercy of this board.</P>
    <P>I feel the price should be based on the cost of production.  When we consider the price increases for wheat which were given since 1948, we must realise they were sanctioned because a case was made for each rise.  Each increase was necessary to meet various rising costs, but no regard is now being paid to the existing levels of cost.  The price of wheat is to be cut, regardless of the cost of production. It will be related to a set quota to be delivered to the mills.  In conclusion, I should like to challenge Deputy Allen, Deputy Corry, Deputy Egan and other Deputies here who gave tongue on wheat prices on various occasions in this House, when it was politically profitable to do so.  Now, when it is not politically profitable, I challenge them to stand up and defend this Bill.</P>

      <P>I remember standing in this House many times, advocating the growing of wheat to the same Opposition as is there to-day, though it may not have exactly the same personnel. When I first came into this House, only 21,000 acres of wheat were grown in this country but, thanks be to God, and to the Fianna Fáil efforts and the help of the farmers&mdash;thanks to their goodwill when Fianna Fáil taught them it was in their own interests and the interests of the nation to grow wheat&mdash;we now have 360,000 or 380,000 acres of wheat grown here.  That is a big change in approximately 30 years, a very big change altogether.  At that time, I would say Deputy Rooney was in swaddling clothes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accusing any Deputy, but I am delighted that, as a result of the efforts of Fianna Fáil, of the Fianna Fáil Government and its agricultural policy, the acreage of wheat grown now is roughly 400,000 acres compared with 21,000 acres 30 years ago.  We on this side of the House always believed that the land of this country was capable of feeding the human beings and animals of the country.  We still believe that, and it is because of that fact that the Minister for Agriculture has introduced this Bill to-day, to help the farmers to dispose of wheat grown surplus to the milling requirements of this country. That is the objective of this Bill and its only objective.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about the cut that may take place in this year's crop and about the price of wheat. The main reason for the introduction of the Bill is that during the cereal years 1956 and 1957, a large surplus quantity of wheat was left to be disposed of in some way or another. Deputy Dillon, when he left office, left a legacy to his successor of some 70,000 tons of dried wheat to be disposed of as best be could.  Last year, we produced an additional 70,000 tons and the Government, early this year, were faced with the problem of disposing of 140,000 tons of dried wheat remaining in the stores on which rent had to be paid.  The farmers and wheat growers were fully conversant with the problem, and they were concerned to know in what way those stores could be cleared so as to make room for the 1958 wheat crop.</P>
      <P>There has been much criticism, both inside and outside this House, during the past few months by members of the Opposition about what the Government were doing with that surplus wheat.  They were exporting some of it and selling some of it at home at a price which was a considerable loss to the community.  That was the line of the criticism.  Wheat costs approximately £37 or £38 a ton.  I may be wrong in the figure, as I did not get it from the Minister or anybody else, and I am subject to correction on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not far wrong.  It was being sold at home and abroad and the average price was less than £20 a ton.  Is that not so?  The question then arose of what was to be done with this year's surplus wheat.  It is estimated that there may be a surplus this year, and I hope the crop will be so good that it will give a surplus, whatever may be done about it. Assuming there will be some surplus, the cut in last year's price of 78/6 a barrel will be approximately 6/-, or 10 per cent.  We should be grateful, because it could be more.  A few years ago, a cut of 12/6 a barrel was made by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture at a time when we were not growing sufficient wheat and when there was no surplus whatever. We were not producing 300,000 tons of dried wheat, in 1953 or 1954, when he made that cut, and it was far more severe on the farmers at that time than the 6/- cut is now on the basis of their income to-day.  Their income has gone up considerably and we are all glad to know it.  Income from animals, cereals, milk and from all other things produced by agriculture has gone up.</P>

      <P>Their income has gone up very sharply.  The Fianna Fáil Government cannot be accused of ever advocating the growing of wheat to an unlimited amount in this country.  Immediately after the emergency in 1947, when they issued a policy statement, amongst other things, on agriculture, we were very often twitted across the floor of the House by Deputy Dillon and his colleagues that the aim of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1947 was to produce 300,000 tons of dried wheat of 75 per cent.  extraction.

      <P>There can be no doubt about it.  The records of this House will show that.  The proposals in this Bill are to set up a board.  Boards are objected to.  There are many boards in operation in this country which have been doing good work.  They give good service to the community.  You have the Sugar Board, Bord na Móna and a number of other boards which have given very good service.  I have no doubt that the board set up by the Minister will be weighted very well with representatives of the growers&mdash;at least I hope it will.  I am sure it will. I hope they will succeed in getting a good price for the surplus wheat.  The better the price they get, the less will be the reduction on the fixed price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be quite simple. Deputy Rooney suggested a quota basis.  If much thought were given to that, it might be found difficult to operate.  This may not be the best scheme in the world but wheat growing has become popular over the years.  All of us remember the emergency years. It is true that we lack artificial manures but the same 12,000,000 acres of arable land are here to-day.  We know the furore created in this House and outside it very often because compulsory powers were operated in an effort to compel a very small minority of the farmers who had very good wheat-growing land to help feed the community at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the same landowners who refused to grow even an acre of wheat during the emergency to help out the population of this country stayed out of wheat growing to-day&mdash;nobody invited them into it&mdash;we would not have any trouble.  They are free to grow it, if they like, but our memories are not so short that they cannot go back a few short years.  Many of the worst growers in this country and the growers who created all the problems for the mills by bringing in most of the <Col N="238" /> sprouting and seed wheat are those growers who would not grow an ounce of wheat on their land during the war. They would not be got dead on it. Some of them tilled their land.</P>
    <P>We remember all those things quite well.  I do not suggest that any member of the Opposition is responsible for that.  If we have a surplus of a cereal that must be sold out of the way of the coming harvest, that is what this Bill is for.  I believe the Bill is a useful and necessary Bill.  An announcement was made by the Minister for Agriculture in January last of the proposals that are in the Bill now before us.  Despite that fact, they grew the wheat.</P>

They ploughed the land, bought the seed, grew the wheat&mdash;more power to their elbows. They did not go out of the business at all.  They estimated that with the increased yields and the handy way of harvesting with combine harvesters and all the rest of it, there was still a profit.  We hope there is.</P>

There is no doubt about that.</P>

Take the case of the recent Galway by-election.  They do not grow much wheat there, but whatever wheat they grow there, it was not the wheat which influenced the people to vote for the Government.  It is time that kind of talk stopped.</P>
      <P>If Deputies opposite have any suggestion to make in regard to a better policy in connection with the selling of the wheat surplus to our requirements which will result in a better price for the farmers, such a suggestion will be considered.  All this nonsense was talked by Deputy Dillon.  It was a pity that distinguished strangers happened to come into the House at the time the Deputy got up to speak.  He might have spoken more to the point or to the Bill, instead of talking about corruption, dishonesty and so on.

      <P>I have the figures.  I do not say &ldquo;nearer to this or nearer to that&rdquo;.  That is the kind of speech we get from the Deputies over there. We will deal with the facts.  When I came into the House, I heard Deputy Allen saying that Deputy Dillon had left a legacy of 70,000 tons of wheat, as if the fact of having a surplus of 70,000 tons of wheat was a crime.  That proved beyond doubt that anything Deputy Dillon had done about the growing of wheat in the previous year and the years before that was met by the wheat growers, who responded with the greatest amount of wheat that has ever been grown in this country. Now we find ourselves with that surplus. <Col N="241" /> That should be dealt with instead of all this claptrap about what happened in County Kilkenny, when Deputy Corry, on the Taoiseach's platform, shrieked out: &ldquo;We did it before and we will do it again.  We will give you 80/- for wheat.&rdquo;  I do not know what the farmers were to get for barley.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen referred to the shocking price for conacre.  Many people bought conacre because they wanted to produce wheat, for the simple reason that they had contracted for combines and wanted to make sure that they would have plenty to cut, at least for themselves.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen said that it was never the policy of Fianna Fáil to grow a surplus of wheat.  I suppose Fianna Fáil put up more bills with &ldquo;Grow more wheat&rdquo; on them than would cover all the land in Ireland ten times.  Deputy Allen said it was a very severe blow when Deputy Dillon reduced the price of wheat.  Of course, it was a much more severe blow when Deputy Dillon reduced the price of wheat than it was when Fianna Fáil were reducing the price of wheat.  When Deputy Dillon reduced the price of wheat, he took responsibility for it and the Government to which he belonged took responsibility.</P>
      <P>If there are any reductions in the price of wheat in future, they are going to try to get the National Farmers' Association and this board to carry the baby.  The Minister can say: &ldquo;As far as I am concerned, I will give 72/6 and up to 77/6 and up to 80/- for bonus wheat, but, of course, as far as the surplus is concerned, that is not my affair; that is the affair of the board.&rdquo; This board will be set up; the members will be appointed by the Minister.  A press release from the Government Information Bureau referred to a committee to be set up representing growers and other interests concerned. Deputy Dillon mentioned that the millers did not want any of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am concerned with is the surplus. In disposing of this surplus, will they follow the policy carried out this year and give a whole lot of people a chance of making a good deal of money <Col N="242" /> in England out of this wheat and will they give the biscuit manufacturers wheat?  Wheat was sold in England at £17 15s. a ton while the best that could be done for the Irish farmer was to give it to him at £23 a ton in six-ton lots.  I should like to know the percentage of Irish feeders who could buy and store a six-ton lot of wheat.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil will devote every energy to ensure that the necessary acreage will be maintained.  The Party will, as soon as it is in a position to do so, once again guarantee to the Irish farmer a fair and economic price for his wheat.&rdquo;  I have heard Deputies saying that the price paid by Deputy Dillon&mdash;72/6 up to 82/6&mdash;was not an economic price.  Now, in face of rising rates, rising costs and so on, this year's price is an economic price because it is fixed by the sacred bulls of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>There has always been a political aspect and a political tinge about wheat.  Wheat has been taken to heart by Fianna Fáil.  It is their baby and they love it.  Three per cent. of the land of this country can grow all the wheat we need.  At last year's price, farmers could get £14,000,000 or £15,000,000 out of it.  They can get £50,000,000 to £55,000,000 out of live stock.  I have said before in the House that I am a live-stock man.  The test of time has shown that live stock have done more to improve the farmers' income than the wheat crop, but the two can be developed side by side.  It has been said that it was the people who did not grow wheat when it was required who are growing it now.  This State has been growing beet for some time under contract and I do not see why there should not be something done about growing wheat under contract. They could cut out some of the 700-acre, 800-acre and 1,000-acre wheat growers.</P>
    <P>When the Cumann na nGaedheal Government were in power, it was said: &ldquo;There is the fellow with his 1,000 acres, the rancher, his man and his dog&rdquo;, and that man was not allowed to stay there with his 1,000 acres, his man or his dog, but now we hear it said: &ldquo;We will have this man, his 1,000 acres, his man and his combine.&rdquo; How much work is that giving? <Col N="243" /> If the working farmer wants to grow wheat as a cash crop, that is a different proposition altogether, but it should be done in such a way that both the ordinary wheat grower and the ordinary taxpayer will not have to subsidise these gentlemen.  However, that is not a matter for this board.  It is one for the Minister, but if the Minister could bring about the situation that this board did not have to function, it would be a happy ending for him and for the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen said that this board would be able to get a proper price for the surplus.  From whom?  There is no need for the Minister to set up this board.  The proper thing to do when this surplus, whatever it is, comes in, is to offer it cheaply enough in ton lots to the Irish feeder.  If there is money to be lost on it by the State let it be gained by the hard-working farmers who are feeding pigs, fowl, calves, and so on.</P>
    <P>Everybody on the Government side denies that Fianna Fáil ever said they would not reduce the price of wheat. Deputy Allen must never have been within three miles of Deputy Corry's meetings in Kilkenny because otherwise he would have heard what Deputy Corry said there.  He was able to echo to the top of Tory Hill one Sunday morning I was there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry said there would not be any reduction in the price of wheat, but that it would be increased.  Now we find ourselves with a Bill the whole purpose of which is to set up a board which will impose a levy on the price of wheat.  That is in direct contradiction of what Deputy Corry said.  Fianna Fáil should be a little fair to themselves.  They should be a Government and say: &ldquo;We shall have to take responsibility for this. We have a surplus; we have to face realities and cut the price.&rdquo;  No, they will not do that.  They are doing a mean thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen resented my calling that kind of thing corruption and <Col N="244" /> fraud.  It is a fraud they are putting over on the farmers.  They are going to appoint representatives of the farmers to this board and those are the men who will have to do the dirty work.  If the members of Fianna Fáil are satisfied with that, I shall keep these Dáil Debates for another day and another time and I shall produce them against them.  Deputy Allen was quite satisfied and expressed great hopes to-day.  He would serve his farmer constituents better if he were brave enough to come in and say what is in his mind.  We had some of that on the Finance Bill from Deputies over there and the sooner we have a little more of it in relation to agricultural prices, the better.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a red light for which the farmer should watch out.  He will get a cut this year and he will get a cut next year.  Other boards will be set up to do the same thing.  He has already suffered a cut in relation to pigs and other items.  I am not afraid to make a prophecy, if Deputy Allen was able to make a prophecy.  If he thinks everything in the garden is rosy, I do not think so.  I am fully convinced the Government will underestimate this year and the following year the Minister will tell the board: &ldquo;You owe so much and you will have to raise so much to sell the crop that is coming in.&rdquo; I am speaking about the year after this harvest.  There will be nothing for the board to do but mulct the farmers or themselves in nearly three times the money that will be stopped this year.  If money is to be levied on the farmer to dispose of this surplus, let the surplus go back to the farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that we are now witnessing the end of a very unsavoury episode in our political life. This Bill is introduced by the Fianna Fáil Party as the Government, and in doing so they are, in effect, wearing sackcloth and ashes.  Some 15 or 18 months ago farmers in my constituency and elsewhere throughout the country were led to believe that voting for a Fianna Fáil candidate was an assurance of bringing up the price of wheat which would be no less than 82/6 per barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that, earlier this evening, <Col N="245" /> when Deputy Dillon was speaking, the Minister for Agriculture questioned whether any pledge had been given by Fianna Fáil to increase the price of wheat.  The Minister for Agriculture represents a constituency in which he can afford to reduce the price of wheat. I should like to remind him and other Deputies that in my constituency, and in Carlow-Kilkenny and other constituencies, 18 months ago there was not a farmer anywhere who had any doubt that Fianna Fáil stood for and pledged themselves, if elected, to increase the price of wheat from the maximum of 78/6 back to 82/6 per barrel.</P>
    <P>In the course of the last election campaign, the present Minister for Finance went on the radio, speaking on behalf of his Party, to tell the people that Fianna Fáil regarded the reduction in the price of wheat as unjust and that a Fianna Fáil Government would see that Irish farmers would get a remunerative price for wheat and other crops.  I would understand any Minister representing the Government if he came in here and honestly and candidly told this House that what he and his colleagues promised was not possible.  It is disedifying for any Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party to try to brazen out what in fact was a false pretence perpetrated on the people of this country just 18 months ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked to-day: &ldquo;Where are the pledges?  &ldquo;Here is a document with the bold heading &ldquo;Facts for Voters&rdquo;.  This document helped to elect a third Fianna Fáil Deputy in my constituency just 18 months or two years ago.  In this document the people of Laois-Offaly&mdash;particularly the wheat farmers&mdash;were told that a vote for Egan was a vote in protest against the reduction in the price of wheat.  I do not know whether there is any capacity for being ashamed still left in Fianna Fáil but if there is, every Deputy in Fianna Fáil should blush profusely at the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is intended to end the system for which Deputy Dillon fought consistently as Minister and succeeded in maintaining and extending&mdash;guaranteed <Col N="246" /> prices to farmers for their produce. On the enactment of this Bill, there will be no guaranteed price for wheat.  The farmers of Laois-Offaly were told 18 months ago that the Irish farmers had lost millions&mdash;that is the word which was used, &ldquo;millions&rdquo;&mdash; because of the price of wheat.  The people who told them that are now asking them to suffer gladly a measure which sweeps aside any guarantee for wheat prices and, in fact, tells them that the price they may expect this year&mdash;and it may get worse&mdash;will be a price substantially less than the &ldquo;unjust price&rdquo; fixed by the former Government.</P>
    <P>I thought the spokesman of the Fianna Fáil Party on this measure, the Minister for Agriculture, would give some explanation through this House to the country as to why Fianna Fáil and his colleagues have so speedily forgotten the reason they sought and got so many farmers' votes 18 months ago.  But no.  We are just told by the Minister that this is a Government plan which must be accepted.  We are told that the price for wheat, which is 6/- at least less, must be accepted now. It is no longer unjust although the rates the farmer has to pay have increased in the past 18 months; although the money he has to pay for his sack of flour has gone up; although the price he has to pay for any of the commodities he must buy has advanced. Nevertheless, the price of at least 6/- less is, according to the Fianna Fáil Party, no longer unjust.</P>
    <P>I do not know just how Deputies in the Government Party who represent areas in the country that produce wheat will face those to whom they promised so much 18 months ago.  It is significant that there has been a remarkable reluctance on the part of Fianna Fáil Deputies representing different wheat constituencies to contribute to the debate.  It is significant that none of them is now in the House. I am sure it will be noted in their constituencies that they have absented themselves from this debate.  I am not surprised.  One reason is that they pledged themselves to provide a price for wheat this year of at least 82/6 a barrel.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="247" /> Deputies will remember that, immediately the present Government was elected in March of last year, not surprisingly a parliamentary question was tabled to the then Minister for Agriculture.  It was tabled not by a Deputy from the Fine Gael Party, not by a Deputy officially in Opposition.  It was tabled by a Government Deputy&mdash; Deputy Martin Corry.  He asked the acting Minister for Agriculture, shortly after the Government came into office, when the increase in the price of wheat was to be announced.  Deputy Aiken stated, in reply, that the Government were satisfied that no announcement of an increase in the price of wheat, at that stage, could increase the acreage under wheat, because, as he said, all the wheat that was likely to be sown was already in the ground.  Did that indicate that the Government felt there was a surplus of wheat, or was it merely an effort to buy time and push off the evil day, to postpone the hour of decision?  That hour is now upon Fianna Fáil because they find now that all that was said in criticism of Deputy Dillon's tillage policy has been proven to be so much moonshine and nonsense.</P>
    <P>It is now clearly established that under Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, a balanced tillage policy was in operation.  We were growing as much wheat as this country could economically afford.  At the same time, our farmers were being encouraged to grow their own feeding stuffs, and if that policy had continued, we would have reached some sanity in relation to our agricultural policy.  Of course, Fianna Fáil Deputies opposing Deputy Dillon, were told to say, and got into the habit of saying, that the country's security was endangered because sufficient wheat was not being grown. Cant and nonsense, if practised consistently, always lead to absurdity.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil find now that having made all these speeches, they are embarrassed by the fact that Deputy Dillon's policy was so successful; they have to say it was never the policy of Fianna Fáil to produce a surplus in wheat.  I do not know what the policy of Fianna Fáil has been in relation to <Col N="248" /> wheat.  I suppose Fianna Fáil Deputies are expert in that, if in nothing else. They at least should know what the Fianna Fáil policy has been and what it is now.  Certainly the people of this country do not know it.  They thought they did and it is because they thought they did that so many Fianna Fáil Deputies in rural constituencies were elected to this House 18 months ago. However, we have now come to the end of what, as I say, is a very unsavoury episode in the public life of this country.  This Bill is introduced by a Minister who was pledged to increase the price of wheat.  That is why he is Minister for Agriculture; that is why Fianna Fáil are in Government at the moment, in so far as rural constituencies could bring that about. This is a Bill to end all guarantees for the price of wheat.  It is a Bill which will result in a reduction in the price of wheat in the next four or five weeks. It ends, I believe, for all time, the kind of propaganda that was so freely used some 18 months or two years ago.  To the extent that it ends an unsavoury episode it may be a good thing, but because it prevents, or seeks to end, the guaranteed price for the farmers, a policy which was successfully operated by Deputy Dillon, we, on this side of the House, will oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One would be inclined to think, listening to the debate on this Bill, that, as I said here on a previous occasion when this matter was being discussed, there was no problem at all to be met in this regard.  This House, I know, is an excellent place for repetition.  Many of the arguments advanced in the course of the speeches on a motion put down by the Opposition, and some of the contributions made on my Estimate, covered about the same ground as we have covered in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, one would think there was not a problem to be met, and yet the very people who are most concerned about this matter, because it affects them most intimately, recognised and freely admitted&mdash;not to please me, or to please the Government&mdash;that there was a problem.  Let us just think over some of the things that have been said during the course of this discussion, in <Col N="249" /> regard to some of the provisions in this Bill.  The case has been made that I am going to appoint the board.  The allegation has been hurled that there has not been consultation with the interested parties.  Is that not all very strange indeed, when one comes to consider the occasions on which there has been consultation and there has been acceptance by the Minister, as a result of consultation, of the propositions put to him by those whose interests were most acutely affected?</P>
    <P>The parties interested in this matter recognised there was a problem.  Any sensible person would have recognised it.  Not only did they recognise it, but they had been thinking of ways and means to find a solution for it.  I am sure they would not deny that.  Apparently, they had discussed every aspect of it and every approach towards the solution of the problem, and the scheme announced here is the scheme that came from their considered judgment. It was suggested to me but was not looked upon with favour by me. Simply because on that occasion I accepted the advice of those whom I consulted, I am blamed.</P>
    <P>In regard to the setting up of the board to implement the scheme, I am told that I should leave it to them.  I have left the scheme to them and I am blamed for it.  I suppose, if I were to leave the election of the members of the board to them, I would be blamed for it also.  It could be said, and rightly so, that while the farming organisations represent the majority of the growers and would be fundamentally interested in the composition of the board, there are also other interests who would be vitally concerned in its personnel.  Some member of the Labour Party made a criticism that the election of the board should be left to the wheat growers.  Even if that decision were made, there is no register of wheat growers.  There are no means by which a board could be selected from the wheat growers, even if it were thought to be a wise policy to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon accused me of being lacking in courage&mdash;lacking in courage because I accepted the scheme put up to me by those whom I recognised as being vitally interested in the matter. <Col N="250" /> I did so irrespective of what I thought of the scheme.  It was a reasonably well thought out scheme all right&mdash;I do not wish to tear the heart out of it because it is the scheme to which the Bill will give effect&mdash;but it had its defects.  I saw them; I know them now.  Personally, I would have preferred a more direct approach.  It is not because of any lack of courage or any fear of the consequences to myself or anybody else that I would hesitate to make a clear-cut decision in a matter of that kind or in any other matter.  I made the decision because of the importance of maintaining the best possible relationship between the organised agricultural community and myself and my Department and because of my desire to endeavour to maintain that relationship.</P>
    <P>Neither is it true to say, as has been suggested, that the figures mentioned in the course of my speech here were not mentioned in the course of the discussions. They were.  That figure of 300,000 tons of dried wheat was mentioned many times.  It is the proper figure, but, apart altogether from any criticism that may be levelled against it, I cannot be criticised for having misled people by not making it known to them during the course of these discussions.  Some Deputies who spoke saw it all; they saw the whole plan in advance.  They saw the 1958 plan and the 1959 plan. They saw the intentions of the Government and the Minister for Agriculture. It would be easy in 1958; harsh in 1959.  I was selecting the board merely for the purpose of transferring the baby.  The figure of 6/- per barrel was given here as the reduction that would probably be effected in 1958&mdash;it is not a case of probably; but that will be the reduction, according to their argument.  Why was that figure ever mentioned?</P>

      <P>I am talking about myself.  I had not the opportunity of seeing or reading any speech made by the Minister for Finance on this subject in recent times at all.  I am talking about the speeches I made on this matter and of the announcement I <Col N="251" /> made when the scheme was announced. In order to make the position as clear as possible to landowners and those who had taken conacre, I directed the officials of my Department to make a calculation, based on last year's acreage and yield, for the purpose of guiding those who intended to grow wheat.  I did that in the most deliberate fashion.  If you look up that statement, you will see it was clearly set out in one paragraph that, in the event of the acreage sown in 1958 not exceeding the acreage in 1957 and the yield therefrom being more or less the same as that of the 1957 crop, then, on that basis, according to this scheme, the reduction would be in the neighbourhood of 6/- per barrel.  If the acreage and yield were more, then the reduction would be greater; if it were less, then the reduction would be less. What ambiguity or doubt could there be in the public mind as a result of that calculation?  It would have been unnecessary if I had the slightest intention of deceiving anybody in this regard.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins could intervene more appropriately in a debate <Col N="252" /> on finance&mdash;not because he is a financial expert but because he likes the subject.</P>
      <P>I think I have disposed of all this &mdash;not that it really matters.  We hear a good deal of talk here that Deputies think is good politics.  I never thought that and I am here a long time.  I listened with interest to Deputy Dillon talking on the effect of political propaganda, when designed in a certain fashion, on the public mind and on parliamentary institutions.  I am not pleading with the Opposition on this matter.  If they want to be harsh and rough, I shall take it as they want it and try to give back my best.  A subject like this does not call for that approach from any section here.  Even from the political point of view, it does not serve Deputies to make statements here to the effect that a political Party has given such and such an assurance and, when they are asked to produce that assurance simply to say: &ldquo;Sure, we know you did it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If I may give political advice or a political lecture, I do not think it enhances the chances or opportunities of Deputies, to talk parrot-like about broken promises, saying they heard this Deputy and that Deputy say this and that at certain crossroads.  That amounts to using this House and the local papers down the country for the propagation of what I would call and what the intelligent public&mdash;that is, the whole public&mdash;would call real tripe.  If Deputy Dillon wants to use this discussion to give a lecture on parliamentary democracy and the effect of public men making certain pronouncements, or being accused of making them whether they made them or not, I would say to him that the best test in the long run is this.  I think it was in 1932 that Deputy Dillon came into this House first; I heard his first speech and I could almost repeat it.  This Party here first became a Government in 1932. That is a long time ago.  It is 26 years ago.  Broadly, we have maintained and retained the confidence of the majority of the people of the country over the greater portion of that long spell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I have already outlined to the House the main objectives towards which the Government has agreed constructional housing policy should be directed.  In association with financial and administrative policy, these objectives are, first, the eradication of the remaining blocks of unfit housing, in particular in the larger urban areas; second, the rehousing of persons displaced through clearance operations by re-development, as far as is practicable, of the cleared areas; third, the encouragement of persons whose accommodation is unsuited for their needs and who are not served by the local authority programme, to provide houses for themselves, either by purchase of previously occupied houses or by having new houses erected for themselves; and fourth, to activate expansion in the very essential work of maintaining and improving the existing stock of houses by reconstruction, repair and improvement, the provision of water and sewerage services and by conversion of houses which are too large by modern conventions for single families, into separate dwellings of adequate standards either for renting or for sale.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill are specifically designed towards the furtherance of the objectives I have enumerated.  In framing these legislative proposals, the Government have borne in mind the degree of progress already achieved; we have appraised the extent of the problems which remain and propose measures directed to the solution of these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My approach to policy on private housing is that our attention should in present circumstances be concentrated mainly on the needs of those in the lower income groups, including small <Col N="257" /> farmers, who do not come within the scope of local authority rehousing programmes and who find that the commitment of providing housing for themselves is too great, even with the backing of current grants and loan facilities. I think it is prudent, even essential, that additional facilities be made available for these groups.  Without a special effort by the State and by the local authorities, people of the standing I have mentioned will continue to live in unsuitable and perhaps unfit dwellings.</P>
    <P>It was from such circumstances that the main housing problems arose in the past, and which were vigorously tackled over the years by private and public enterprise with the assistance made available by successive Housing Acts.  The cost was enormous relative to national expenditure but the burden borne by ratepayers and taxpayers alike has produced and will continue to produce dividends immeasurable in the field of good health and good citizenship.  On this precedent, I have no hesitation in asking the House to approve further measures directed to the marginal groups below those already served by substantial State and local assistance.</P>
    <P>I propose that the State grant for a new house in an area where a public piped water-supply and sewerage scheme are not available be increased by £25.  This increase would automatically be reckonable for an increased supplementary grant up to £25 payable by the housing authority concerned.  In essence, the proposal involves additional grants of up to £50 for persons living in areas isolated from the amenities which, in the present day, we who enjoy them take for granted.</P>
    <P>In association with this measure, the Bill provides that the existing grant for the installation of private water-supply and sewerage system be increased from £60 to £75, or to £50 for water-supply and £25 for sewerage system where these are separately provided. It is proposed also that the reconstruction grants at present available to farmers and agricultural labourers be increased by £20 at each point of the scale which at present is <Col N="258" /> £80 for a house of three rooms, £100 for a house of four rooms and £120 for a house of five or more rooms.</P>
    <P>The supplementary grants at present payable by housing authorities are related to the State grants for reconstruction work undertaken by farmers and agricultural labourers and the provision of water and sewerage facilities by a graduated scale of valuation in the case of farmers and of income in the case of other persons.  The supplementary grants payable in respect of works which qualify for improving grants under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts are also graded according to income or valuation.</P>
    <P>The proposal before the House is that these scales be replaced by a provision enabling housing authorities to pay supplementary grants of equal amount with the State grants for these works, depending on the cost of the works carried out.  The proposal will also have the effect of raising the valuation limit for farmers qualifying for supplementary reconstruction grants from £35 to £50, the qualifying limit for the State grant.</P>
    <P>It is my earnest contention that the participation by housing authorities in assisting persons who were willing to improve the standard and amenities of their houses or to conserve through their own efforts dwellings which would otherwise deteriorate into unfitness, is of importance at least as great as the direct housing operations carried out by the housing authorities themselves.  I consider that those authorities who have refrained from or discontinued such participation by not paying supplementary grants might review the position.  It will pay them to do so, even if looked on as a mere matter of commercial prudence.</P>
    <P>Grants for repair and improvement works are mainly availed of in urban areas.  The existing legislative provisions achieved a creditable measure of success in inducing a substantial volume of this type of work.  Nevertheless, the procedure has not been wholly satisfactory, as Deputies who have been interested are aware.  The amendments I propose are, firstly, to increase the rates of these grants by £20, as is provided for in respect of <Col N="259" /> reconstruction grants and, secondly, to simplify the administration of the grants and to extend their scope.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that eligibility for these grants should be tested not by the suitability of the house for occupation by persons of the working classes or by agricultural labourers but by the essential nature of the works proposed for the purpose of providing suitable housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>I have arranged with the Minister for Finance that housing authorities may borrow from the Local Loans Fund for the purpose of making grants for repair and improvement works and housing authorities are being informed accordingly by circular letter.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in the financial part of the Bill enabling housing authorities to make loans for repair or improvement works, capital for which will be available from the Local Loans Fund.  The loans will be available for works which are essential for providing suitable housing accommodation. The incentive of loans in addition to grants will, I suggest, encourage the house owner to carry out essential works on his property whether he resides in the house himself or maintains it as a letting investment. It will also facilitate owners or prospective owners to carry out major conversion works on larger houses so as to provide additional rented accommodation of good modern standards, from which they may obtain an appropriate return on their investments.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed to make capital available to housing authorities to enable them to make advances under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts to persons in the lower income groups purchasing previously occupied houses.  Housing authorities will be notified of the scope of this offer in due course.  The existing definition of market value for this purpose is a simple one&mdash;the amount which in the opinion of the housing authority the house would realise if sold in the open market.  As Deputies are aware, the purchase price on this basis does not include stamp duty, legal fees and other costs incidental to the purchase of such houses.  It is proposed <Col N="260" /> to enable housing authorities to include all such costs for the purpose of calculating the amount of advance to be made, in the same manner as they may be included in the advance for a new house.</P>
    <P>There are many previously occupied houses on offer, particularly in the urban areas, and the availability of capital under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts will induce people to purchase these houses rather than reside in unsuitable flats or rooms or purchase new houses the commitment for which might be beyond their means.  Viewing this proposal in conjunction with the repair loans provisions, it will be seen that a person may obtain a small dwellings loan for the purchase of a previously occupied house and may also obtain a loan for the repair of that house if necessary. The proposals may encourage people living in rented houses to buy the houses from their landlords and carry out works of repair and improvement.</P>
    <P>I have given much consideration to the weight of representations made from time to time about the present system of rates remission on new grant houses, in particular to the impact on the lower income groups of the payment of full rates after a period of seven years in which only one-third of the rates assessment is payable.  I have decided to recommend to the House the replacement of this system for future houses by a graduated scale of payments over ten years, beginning with the payment of one-tenth of the rates in the first year and increasing by one-tenth each year.  In this way, there will be no sudden jump in the annual outgoings on the house.</P>
    <P>Before turning to other aspects of this Bill, I want to record appreciation of the efforts of those who organise genuine co-operative housing.  I feel there is scope for a great extension of activity in this field, particularly in rural areas where people can contribute largely by their own labour to the provision of houses for themselves.  I am satisfied from experience that the grants from the State and housing authorities payable under this Bill would, with a person's own labour contribution, enable the provision of new houses by co-operative housing groups <Col N="261" /> with minimum personal cash contributions.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains an important provision relating to the financing of rural housing provided by county councils. In county health districts, including villages and towns in which county councils build cottages under the Labourers Acts, an annual subsidy is payable to the housing authority at a rate up to 60 per cent. of the loan charges, subject to fixed capital cost limits.  Payment of the subsidy is not directly dependent upon the demolition or the repair of the previous accommodation of the persons rehoused, nor is it confined to agricultural workers.  The subsidy is available for the rehousing of members of the working classes in labourers' cottages in those towns, villages and suburban areas in which the county councils provide dwellings under the Labourers Acts.</P>
    <P>Two rates of annual State subsidy at present apply to dwellings let by housing authorities in urban areas.  The major rate, up to 66? per cent. of the loan charges, subject to fixed capital cost limits, is payable in respect of dwellings let to persons who had been living in overcrowded conditions or in dangerous or unfit accommodation which has collapsed or has been demolished, closed or made fit by order of the housing authority, or to persons in needy circumstances, who required housing on medical, compassionate or other similar grounds.  The minor rate of contribution, up to 33? per cent. of the loan charges, is payable for other lettings.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that this system of subsidy will in future apply to rural, as well as to urban, housing.  Where, for instance, a statutory operation such as the relief of overcrowding or the demolition of an unfit house is involved in rehousing an agricultural labourer or a person of the working classes outside an urban area, the higher subsidy rate would be payable under this Bill.  The lower rate of subsidy would apply where no positive action is taken towards eliminating bad housing conditions or the relief of overcrowding.</P>
    <P>In order that county councils will have all the powers of urban housing <Col N="262" /> authorities to deal with slum clearance it is proposed that they should be required to make by-laws relating to overcrowding in respect of houses intended or used for occupation by the working classes.</P>
    <P>There are two other provisions in the Bill relating to subsidy, neither of which makes any change as far as the financial position of housing authorities is concerned.  One of these proposes to compound the value of certain subsidies payable under enactments of half a century ago.  The intention is to simplify the method of extinguishing these old loans and to obviate the necessity for numerous annual calculations and numerous minor payments. In effect, the outstanding balances of certain loans will be reduced by the compounded value of the subsidies and certain investment funds from which annual dividends contributed to the subsidies will be surrendered to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the other provision is to give statutory authority for certain interest subsidy payments being made in respect of borrowings in the period 1948 to 1953.  This authority is sought at the instance of the Public Accounts Committee and does not affect the payments made to housing authorities.</P>
    <P>It has been the practice to renew the currency of the Labourers Acts from time to time for specific periods.  The ultimate intention is to merge the Labourers Acts in the Housing of the Working Classes Acts so as to form a single code.  The present Bill, like various previous Bills, makes its own contribution to this ultimate merger. It also provides for continuance of the Labourers Acts until they are replaced or repealed.  When the consolidation of these codes is completed, the new code will replace the complex collection of Housing Acts which we now have to deal with.</P>
    <P>The amendments proposed in the Bill relating to slum clearance operations are put forward in the light of the experience gained by housing authorities, who have found the existing provisions insufficient in some respects.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that owners of <Col N="263" /> premises which are the subject of demolition orders should be required as soon as the house has been vacated, to secure it against further occupation. The purpose of the provision is to prevent a recurrence of past experience of housing authorities who, having taken steps to clear an unfit house, found that the house had been reoccupied, thus hindering enforcement of the demolition order.  It is proposed also that a person who occupies or permits another person to occupy an unfit house which is the subject of a statutory notice requiring repairs to be carried out and has become vacant should be liable to prosecution and prescribed penalties.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that where land to be acquired by a housing authority by means of a compulsory purchase order includes dwelling-houses which are unfit for human habitation and are incapable at a reasonable cost of being made fit, the compensation payable in respect of the unfit dwelling-houses, if the Minister confirms the order, shall be site value less the cost of clearance. The Minister would have power, if he were not satisfied that a particular dwelling-house were unfit for human habitation and incapable at reasonable cost of being made fit, to exclude the premises from the &ldquo;unfit&rdquo; category, but to confirm the acquisition so that the compensation would be related to the market value.  It is proposed that &ldquo;dwelling-house&rdquo; should be defined as a building used wholly or principally for human habitation.  This provision contains no new principle.  It will have the effect of preserving the well-established principle that buildings which are unfit for human habitation should qualify for compensation at cleared site value.</P>
    <P>Provision is made widening the power which a housing authority has to close any part of a house let for human habitation so as to bring within this power any part of a house used for human habitation, whether or not the occupation is a letting.  It is necessary also to remove any doubt that service of a copy of a demolition order&mdash;not the original order&mdash;will be valid compliance with the existing statutory provisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> Housing authorities have power to extinguish public right-of-ways and easements in certain circumstances. The power does not extend to the acquisition of lands which, for technical reasons, do not come within the definition of clearance areas or improvement areas.  It is essential that the extended power be available to housing authorities and provision is made for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I have now outlined the main principles and provisions of the Bill and I commend it for the consideration of the House.</P>

      <P>When we analyse this Bill, we realise, in the first instance, that it is a Bill to facilitate people to repair their houses or to acquire second-hand houses.  That is really what it boils down to.  In other words, we have reached the stage at which we are satisfied that we have practically ended our building programme and, as the Minister pointed out yesterday, fewer houses were built in 1956 than were built in former years and still fewer in 1957 and fewer again in 1958.  I am glad Deputy Briscoe is here to note that.  I am not responsible for the building of fewer houses in 1958 than were built in 1957.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, we have now practically reached the end of our programme of building new houses and the Minister has rightly increased grants for the repair and purchase of second-hand houses.  We welcome the provision of additional facilities because they are badly needed. Since the Government abolished the <Col N="265" /> food subsidies&mdash;Deputy O'Malley may laugh&mdash;money has become scarcer and there has been less activity on the property market.  We are dealing now with people in the lower-income group and people of the working classes who have to live on a weekly wage and who have been unable to carry out absolutely necessary repairs to their homes as a result of the slashing of their weekly pay packet.  We welcome this belated effort on the part of the Government to try to restore, even in a small way, the amount in the pay packet and to bring it up to what it was when we were in office.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that those who wish to procure or acquire second-hand houses may now have access to the Local Loans Fund through the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, both for the purpose of repairing houses which they propose to buy and also for the purpose of procuring loans for the purchase of houses.  That is a very good thing, and I commend the Minister for having introduced it, but I think he will have to go a step further.  He will have to make the acquisition of that loan more simple than it is to-day.</P>
      <P>The Minister is catering for rural Ireland principally in this Bill.  I pointed out yesterday that in rural Ireland it is almost impossible to acquire a loan under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act owing to the legal costs of the acquisition of such a loan. I pointed out yesterday that to procure a loan of £300 in certain cases costs almost £40 in legal costs.  Again, I would appeal to the Minister, when considering this Bill on Committee Stage, to introduce a new section to simplify the method of procuring these loans and I would suggest to him that in rural Ireland the lodgment of the land certificate by way of equitable deposit with the local authority should suffice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the machinery through which one must go to procure a loan as visualised by this Bill.  First of all, the prospective purchaser must find a second-hand house that is vacant.  He must consult the vendor and find out what he wants for the house.  He may enter into preliminary negotiations and they may agree on a <Col N="266" /> figure of £2,000.  If there is an auctioneer present, you can rest assured that he will inflate the price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to the legal gentlemen afterwards.  Having agreed on £2,000, say, as the purchase price of the house&mdash;it may be the market value of it; I am certain it is&mdash; then the borrower has to go back to the local authority and say to them: &ldquo;I am buying a house.  I want to know are you prepared to give me a loan for the purchase of it?&rdquo;  The local authority have to fix the market value. Very often they will not agree with the price arrived at between the vendor and the purchaser.  It will be very difficult indeed for them to arrive at agreement and, unless some practical valuer is brought in, such as the local auctioneer, it will be impossible to put into effect the very good advantages which the Bill bestows on prospective purchasers.</P>
      <P>Having eventually agreed on the price, the purchaser has then to go to the local authority's solicitor and satisfy him as to the title of the vendor.  Vendors who have their property mortgaged are not anxious to disclose their title to the general public and it may be that the vendor would say: &ldquo;I am prepared to convey to you.  You can enter into whatever contract you wish with the local authority.&rdquo;  In other words, it must be first of all conveyed or transferred to the purchaser and the charges transferred back to the local authority and the local authority's legal adviser satisfied.  I am afraid most of the advantages of this Bill will go to the legal fraternity.  It is quite true.  I speak here as a Deputy, not as a solicitor.</P>

      <P>If this House got its way, some of them would be housed in other places.  The less we say about that, the better, at the moment.  Speaking seriously, I think the Minister could do something to benefit the would-be purchaser by simplifying the conveyance or charge or mortgage which local authorities may require before they will advance moneys under the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister states that he has given certain concessions by way of remission to rates to those who take advantage of the Bill by repairing their houses.  It is surprising how much we think of those who have to borrow or secure State aid for the repair of their houses, but how little we think of the individual who has sufficient enterprise to put his own money into the repair of his house.  If a man, even if he is a labourer, repairs his house, without seeking a State grant or a supplementary grant, his house is revalued forthwith and he has to pay, there and then, rates on the increased valuation.  That is very unfair.  Private enterprise is not encouraged in any way by that practice.  The Minister should consider that matter so as to encourage the man who is sufficiently independent not to seek from the State or the local authority a loan or grant for the repair of his house.  That would be a very good thing.  I question very much if there will be any benefit to those who repair houses under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I notice that it is to be spread over a ten years' period, one-tenth in the first year, one-fifth in the second year, and so on.  If we total that up, we find there is one-third of a year's rates remission over the entire period of ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, and even to-day £40 is a lot to the man down the country who wants to repair his house.  I do not think the Minister will confer on builders and repairers of houses the benefit which he thinks he will confer on them.  If he intends to graduate the scheme as he has suggested, he could have gone back to the old system of spreading it over a period of 20 years.</P>
      <P>The Minister has referred to some of the local authorities who did not implement the housing grants&mdash;I believe there are some of them&mdash;and he requested them to review the position. He could go a little further and compel them to implement that scheme by a simple section in this Bill.  He points out, and rightly so, how they could benefit by paying supplementary grants, and I think he should consider requesting those local authorities to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No reference was made by the Minister to houses which are let by local authorities at uneconomic rents, houses which are let at very nominal rents, having had no increase down through the years, but in respect of which cost of repairs is mounting year after year and becoming a burden on the rates. I remember endeavouring to persuade local authorities to sell these houses <Col N="269" /> for a nominal consideration to the tenants, but for some reason or other my suggestion was not adopted.  The Minister should go further and if the local authorities will not sell them he should make the tenants a present of them.</P>
    <P>I know tenants who pay 2/6 a week rent for local authority houses on which the annual outgoings for repairs, and so on, are somewhere in the neighbourhood of £13 to £15.  That is bad business.  If the local authorities cannot persuade the tenant to become a tenant purchaser, they should make a present of the house to him.  If the local authorities want to vest these houses in the tenants they must, first of all, put them into a state of repair and they must have the consent of the tenants beforehand that the houses have been put into a state of repair.  If the Minister is to give such tenant purchasers a grant for the repair of their houses and a loan to purchase, he should compel these people to become tenant purchasers, then abolish uneconomic rents and to remove that annual blister from the taxpayer of carrying out repairs to houses of this type.</P>

    <P>I welcome the Bill and I am very glad the Minister has seen fit to increase grants for the repair of houses.  I hope it will encourage people to repair their <Col N="270" /> houses.  I hope also that the local authorities will be encouraged to demolish slum buildings, have demolition orders carried out, clear these unsightly areas and rebuild on them.  If the Minister succeeds in doing that, he will be doing a lot of good, because, as I said years ago, we are now nearing the end of our housing programme, particularly with regard to new houses and we should taper off instead of having a complete stop some fine day.</P>

I expected to see a boom in the building trade when my colleague, the Minister, took over.  I remember that one of the first statements he made was that all the taps would be turned on.  I do not know where the water has been flowing, unless it is down the sewers, because there is certainly no sign of it outside.  I remember Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Larkin howling about the slump in the building trade.  I have not seen any revival in the building trade since the Government took over.</P>

That slump will continue, unfortunately, and I am very glad the Minister now recommends to Dublin Corporation what I recommended to them, that they should concentrate on building flats in the centre of the city and demolish unsightly dwellings wherever they exist.  In that way they would be doing something to house the people in the slums.</P>

      <P>One notable thing about housing legislation since this Dáil was established is that each Housing Bill seems to be a little more progressive than the last.  That, in itself, is a tribute to various Governments and indeed <Col N="271" /> to various Ministers for Local Government.  I think we can say of this Bill that it sets out to improve the facilities for house-building and house repairs.  While I, with Deputy O'Donnell, welcome the Bill, I am a little dubious as to what results it will achieve and as to what is the real intention in the Minister's mind&mdash;or, should I say, in the mind of the Government?</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell wound up his speech with some remarks about the housing slump which we have known over the past two years.  I have heard conflicting and confusing views on the house-building industry.  I heard a lot of airy-fairy talk about tapering off the work.  The unfortunate thing about house-building over the past ten years is that while we have had two or three slumps there was never any tapering off.  The building workers were just given their notice that house building would be stopped to a very large extent and they had to take the emigrant ship.  I must confess that that happened in the time of the inter-Party Government and more so in the period of office of this Government.</P>
      <P>My fear about this Bill is that it will be given to us in substitution for the revival which is necessary in the building of houses.  The Minister has available to him, as we had, what was described, I think, as a census of houses required in the urban and rural areas.  That census was pure bunkum. The 1947 census was a sham and a fraud thrown on the Department of Local Government by the majority of the local authorities and it meant nothing. There was a recent census, as I think the Minister told me in reply to a question.  I have my doubts as to whether that represents the true position as far as our housing needs are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thare are two important features to be rememebered in connection with housing.  The first is the provision of dwellings for people and families.  The second, and equally important, is the provision of employment for men who, over the past ten or 12 years, believed they would have reasonable security in the building of houses in <Col N="272" /> Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and in the provincial towns and rural areas.  Suddenly we, the Parliament of this country, told these men we would cut off a considerable junk of this industry. The tragedy is that they have to leave their country and seek employment in Great Britain.  I do not blame the present Minister entirely; we all have a share in that sort of behaviour.</P>
    <P>One of the important things in the house-building industry is that it provides the means for keeping Irishmen at home until we can put them to work in some other industry.  This also concerns those engaged on roads and different types of local authority works. The duty of the Government is to provide work on house-building and road-making until these people can engage in the industry which all of us promised and for which the Government say they have plans for the near future.</P>
    <P>I suspect there will be a further curtailment of house-building.  The Minister has said, and I think the Taoiseach has said over the past 18 months, that if money is needed for housing the Government will provide it.  I have heard that statement before.  It might be true.  The officials in the Department of Local Government are blamed for many things.  As distinct from every other Department, public representatives and the public generally divide the Department into two&mdash;the Minister and the officials.  Some of them pretend the poor Minister does not know what is going on, that he is being bamboozled by the officials.  In this case of the availability of money, I suspect the Minister has said: &ldquo;We can say this sort of thing to the local authorities but there are other methods by which we can effectively prevent local authorities from building houses.&rdquo;  The Minister may say that that is my bad mind.  The evidence is there in the correspondence which local authorities are receiving from week to week and from month to month.</P>
    <P>You can hold up the building of 50 houses, say, by a letter every month over a particular period.  There may be a query about the colour of the roof, the size of the window-sill or the <Col N="273" /> design of the chimney.  I believe these delays are designed merely to conserve money in a particular financial year and to prevent local authorities from building houses.</P>
    <P>I feel that this Bill will be a help to the house-building industry and will not be in substitution for the building we have had over the past three, four, five, or, shall I say, ten years.  If the Minister really wants to get houses built or to cut costs, I suggest that there should be much more consultation at local level.  He knows, and members of county councils and other public authorities know, there is too much of a distance between the local councils and the Custom House.  I do not blame the officials or the Minister for that; it has been the tradition and practice down the years.</P>
    <P>House-building, as between the Custom House and the local authorities, has been done by letter, apart from periodic visits by certain inspectors. They may see the town clerks, the county managers and the county architects.  In my opinion, much more consultation is needed to ensure that houses will be built and will be cheap.</P>
    <P>I got a suggestion from a colleague from County Wexford to-day which I shall now give to the Minister.  It is that in a scheme of, say, from ten to 50 houses as you will have in a provincial town and especially in the cities &mdash;there should be consultation between a representative from the Department of Local Government, the local authority, the builders providers and, above all, the workers.  If you have that type of consultation, I believe you will get much more co-operation from the parties I have mentioned.  Above all, you will get much more co-operation from the workers, as represented by the trade unions.</P>
    <P>The workers claim quite a considerable amount of the cost of building a house but they are never consulted. The architect may be fully qualified and the engineer may know all about his profession but the probability is that they are not able to saw a piece of timber or knock in a nail with a hammer.  All of us know from our Party meetings&mdash;whether Fianna Fáil, Labour or Fine Gael&mdash;that when we come to <Col N="274" /> discuss housing we get the carpenters, plumbers, masons and builders' labourers who, though they may perhaps do foolish things on other occasions, can suggest useful ways and means by which work can be shortened and cheapened.</P>
    <P>The Minister would make a tremendous impression on house-building if he initiated that type of survey. It would not be new but it would be new inasmuch as, to my knowledge, it has not been practised for about ten years since the late Deputy T.J. Murphy was Minister for Local Government He tried to establish in my county&mdash;I must say unsuccessfully, due to the non-co-operation of certain persons&mdash;a consultative council where the workers would be present and where the officials and the professional men of the local authority would consult with one another on how best to get the houses finished.  These are my general remarks on housing.  I hope to have a little more to say on the Estimate.</P>
    <P>I now come to certain points in the Bill.  I think it is a good Bill.  It does not take away anything from house-building either for the local authority, the private builder, the would-be builder, the house repairer or purchaser.  The increase in the reconstruction grants in respect of three-four-and five-roomed houses is, one might say, pretty reasonable.  Here again, there is a snag and I think every Deputy has met this difficulty.  These grants are purely theoretical.  It is in the administration of the grants that you will see the real effect of the section in question.  Apparently the amount payable is based on the price for which the work should be done.</P>
    <P>Whose opinion is invoked on the price that should be charged for the work done, I do not know.  He may be an engineer of the local authority or in the Custom House; I do not know. However, they say the work should have been done for, say £X, £Y, or £Z and pay the grant on that estimate. The actual cost of construction or repair can well be ascertained.  The cost of any material can be obtained from the builders providers.  Any normal foreman or professional engineer can well determine the average number of <Col N="275" /> hours taken to complete a job.  As far as I know, as I said before, the figures are purely hypothetical and certainly are not to the advantage of the applicant for the repair and reconstruction grant.  There is an improvement in the grants for the installation of water supplies and sewerage facilities.  I think they could be regarded as pretty generous in the rural areas, but may I make a plea to the Minister for a grant of some sort, however small, for those in the urban areas, or in city areas, who have occasion to provide sewerage and water supplies where there is not a main water supply and a main sewerage.  Many people have very great difficulty in doing that sort of work.  It is pretty expensive, especially in the city area, and I think the Minister could well afford to pay some sort of grant for such people.  I say &ldquo;well afford&rdquo;, because I do not think he is going to get many cases in 1958 in which there are no water or sewerage facilities in urban or city areas.</P>
    <P>Section 13, as far as I can see, authorises housing authorities to lend money for the reconstruction of a house.  The loan can be given to the extent of 75 per cent. of the market value of the house.  That is a bit high for such a loan.  It is for reconstruction and repair and it is not as if one were actually buying the house.  Seventy-five per cent. seems to be rather high, but perhaps the Minister will have an explanation for it.  Another objectionable feature of the Bill is that when the loan is approved, the house is to be vested in the local authority.  There could be some other arrangement whereby there would not be any necessity to vest in the local authority.  The man who owns his house and has to have recourse to the Government for a loan will not be so quick to do so when he realises that when he gets the loan, the house which is his property, and which has been the property of his family for 60 or 70 years, is now to be vested in the local authority.</P>
    <P>Section 15 appears to authorise an interest subsidy to local authorities on money borrowed after 1948.  I suppose it would be stupid to ask the Minister if there are to be retrospective payments. I think he made some general <Col N="276" /> remarks and said that it did not affect the existing financial arrangements with regard to loan charges, but he should make it clear, and if necessary make it clear in the Bill.  I welcome, as I think any person who builds a new house will, the graduated scale for the payment of rates over ten years.  Even though I think that over a period of ten years, the occupier would pay more than he would under the present system, it is a good thing.  I have an example here of a house upon which the rates would be £21.  Under the present system, his rates amount to £21 and the total payable would be £91. Under the new system, as proposed here, the total would be £94 6s.  I suppose with the new arrangement one should not complain about the extra £3 6s. 0d., but it is only right that it should be pointed out that, while the new system is attractive in itself, there will be a slight amount of extra money paid to the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I welcome it principally as a departure from the cry of the Department of Local Government and of other Departments, for a number of years, that everything should be new&mdash;the new hospital, the new house, the new this and the new that.  This is a departure and I think the first instance I saw of it was on one occasion when Deputy O'Donnell, as Minister, was in Bandon and he pointed out that a number of houses there would be better, if they were reconstructed, than the new ones which he was opening that day.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to incorporate in this Bill something further in connection with local authorities, that is, that in future when a new tenant signs his agreement for a new house, he should also sign a purchase agreement.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell in connection with what he said about the unbelievable burden that is now being thrown on local authorities by repairs to houses let at a very low rent.  I have seen a labourer's cottage for which the rent was 1/- a week, cost £160 to repair.  You would be a long time getting that back. Those people naturally will not purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what frame of mind <Col N="277" /> the Department of Local Government are in.  I freely admit that we have the same dilly-dallying with regard to houses now as we had when Deputy O'Donnell was Minister.  It is very hard to break a team off a bad habit and a bad habit has been instilled in the Department of Local Government of endeavouring to find reasons for delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the bad habit in the team that he has in his advisers, of holding up housing schemes, is very hard to eradicate.  I should like to know from the Minister if the ceiling for land valuation, in connection with the reconstruction of houses, is now abolished.  It is a pretty important matter for the constituency I have the honour of representing, where a man with 20 statute acres was above the limit for reconstruction grants in previous years.  If it is abolished, thank God for that anyway, but it was very late coming.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with what was said here about being near the end of the housing drive.  I can see housing schemes going on year after year for the next 20 years, and I think that even after 20 years, you will not have sufficient houses, and that is apart from the cities, in purely rural communities. Anybody who thinks otherwise is making a big mistake.  I heard Deputy O'Donnell say it would pay to give away the houses for nothing.  I wonder did he ever get a look at any of the purchase schemes sanctioned by the Department?  I hope to produce a few gems on the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall give an instance of what happens. I shall take two schemes of houses, side by side.  One happens to be in the urban area; the other in the rural area.  The houses were opened on the one day by Deputy Smith when Minister for Local Government.  All the houses have the same amenities and the rent is 11/- per week.  The amount sanctioned for the purchase scheme in the rural area was 9/- per week, and the amount sanctioned for the urban area, 33/2 per week.  I <Col N="278" /> should like the Minister to investigate who was the financial genius in his Department who sanctioned a scheme for increasing the rent on purchase from 11/-a week to 33/2?</P>
    <P>I remember when we came in here as young, foolish idealists, one of the first Bills we were proud to introduce here was a Bill to make the labourer as safe in his own house as the farmer in his farm.  But now we get officials of the Department rendering that unworkable. Here is a man with a rent of 11/-a week, having his repairs done by the local authority, and if he wishes to become the owner of his own house, according to the schemes sanctioned by the Minister he has to do his own repairs and pay 33/2 a week rent.  I hope to hand the documents to the Minister and let him examine them himself.</P>
    <P>I have the case of another scheme 45 years old.  We all know what kind of house that is.  The rent was 2/9 a week and, on the purchase scheme sanctioned by the Department, the rent was raised to 37/6 a week.  One of the excuses given to me was that the Minister has refused to continue to pay the loan charges on purchase.  I should like to have that investigated by the Minister.  However, that is a matter for the Estimate.  I came up specially for the Estimate but it did not come off.  I shall have an opportunity later.  I shall produce every document in the House.</P>
    <P>As far as the Bill is concerned, I am glad to see the question of reconstruction dealt with.  I wonder if the question I asked the Minister a while ago also applies to the local authority?  Is the local authority entitled to put a ceiling on valuation in regard to reconstruction? I have seen a case of a man with a wife and six children on a 25-acre holding whose valuation was £45. He was refused a grant from the local authority on it.  I should like to know how he would compare to-day with an agricultural labourer.  I would say he is worse off.</P>
    <P>As far as the Bill goes, it is a good Bill.  It is an improvement in that it shows a change of mind on the part of the Department, principally in regard to new houses.  We shall have a lot to say in regard to new houses on the <Col N="279" /> Estimate.  I have found that, although it might cost a bit to repair an old house, when you have it repaired, you have a house but you can never repair some of the things built by local authorities in the past ten years, apparently inspected, passed and sanctioned by the architects and inspectors of the local authority and by the architects and inspectors of the Department.  I have seen bills for the repair of labourers' cottages not seven years old amounting to £50, £60, and in some cases, £80, due to faulty workmanship. I have seen floors in labourers' cottages quite rotten after five years.  I wonder who passed the timber or what Local Government inspector came down and sanctioned the payment?  Could we get back on the architect responsible for it, who was damn well paid?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points I should like to make in connection with the Bill.  Like Deputy O'Donnell, I welcome any effort made in connection with this problem of housing.  I should like to say at the outset that I hope this Minister, or some Minister in the near future, will tackle the question of endeavouring to codify housing legislation.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for anyone to follow just what is in the Housing Acts and what is not.  Practically every year there is a new Housing Bill, and that Bill amends in some way or other the one that went before or the one that went before that again.  As this question of housing is one which vitally affects everyone in the country, it would be well worth the attention of the Minister's Department to set about bringing the whole housing legislation up to date in one codifying Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the position may be in regard to the tapering off of the housing drive because of requirements being satisfied I do not know; but whatever about new housing, there is no doubt at all that there is a very large field for improvement in this question of dealing with old houses.  In this Bill, the Minister and his Department are wise in dealing again with the question of repair and improvement grants in respect of old houses.  This is not a new thing.  It is already there, I think, <Col N="280" /> in the 1952 Act and in Section 12 of the 1954 Act.  However, the Minister, in introducing this Bill, has broadened out the provisions in Section 12 of the 1954 Act.</P>
    <P>I understand the 1954 Act limited repair and improvement grants to houses suitable for occupation by members of the working class.  I forget the precise definition.  In this Bill, the Minister sets about extending that definition and enabling these grants to be made in cases where he considers it essential for the provision of a dwelling or for making a dwelling habitable.  That is an advance which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not being too suspicious when I say it is a pity the Minister has included a provision which may entirely vitiate that advance.  In Section 11, where the old provisions of Section 12 of the 1954 Act are being amended, sub-section (3) continues and says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding the amendment effected by sub-section (2) of this section, grants by a housing authority under sub-section (3) of Section 12 of the Act of 1954 may, if the authority think fit&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>He is taking it out of his hands now and it is to be a matter for the local authority&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;be confined to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  persons of such class or classes, or</P>
    <P>(b)  persons executing works on houses of such type or types,</P>
    <P>as may be determined by the authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister says he is now doing away with the limitation imposed in 1954 and is making the grants available in respect of houses certified by the housing authority&mdash;or, on appeal, by the Minister&mdash;to be suitable for repair and improvement, where the Minister is satisfied that the works are essential for the purpose of providing suitable housing accommodation. He says that that is going in, to replace the limitation existing under Section 12 of the 1954 Act.</P>
    <P>In fact, it is not doing that, because in the self-same Section 11, the Minister says: &ldquo;Notwithstanding that I am <Col N="281" /> broadening out the definition, notwithstanding that I am removing the limitation, lifting the restrictions, nevertheless, if a housing authority think fit they may re-impose these limitations; no matter what the Dáil or the Seanad may think, no matter how favourably they may receive my proposals in Section 11, the housing authority may, if they think fit, restrict the grants to classes either of houses or of persons as was done previously.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Admittedly there is discretion.  I am not fencing about that.  All I am saying is that this section contains this test and provision which may entirely vitiate the work which the Minister is trying to do.  I hope it will not; I hope no local authority will think fit to go back to the narrow provision which existed under section 12 of the 1954 Act.  It is discretionary, but the power is being given to local authorities to go back to that.  That is why I say the section contains within itself provisions for destroying the advance&mdash;I am quite sincere in calling it an advance which could be made if sub-section (3) here were deleted.  I hope it is the intention to discourage local authorities from placing any restrictive limitation of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is a very large field for operations in connection with old houses, particularly in the City of Dublin.  I can speak only for the city, but I assume the same is true of Cork City and a number of big towns.  The operation of legislation of this kind on the older houses should have a definite effect on the employment situation and, therefore, from that point of view alone, if one were to disregard entirely the necessity for maintaining the older type of house and utilising them to provide suitable housing accommodation even if one were to disregard that important and even vital aspect of the situation&mdash;from the employment <Col N="282" /> point of view alone, it would be worth encouraging the operation of this section.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider before the Committee Stage&mdash;and I think it could be done in conjunction with this Bill&mdash;another aspect of the question of repairing and improving old houses.  As I understand the position&mdash;and I have not had an opportunity of rereading in any detail the 1954 Housing Act recently; I intended to do so in connection with this matter but did not get the opportunity&mdash;my recollection of the position is that if a repair and improvement grant is made under Section 12 of the 1954 Act there is incorporated in the Act a guarantee that there will be no increase in valuation by virtue of the work done under that grant.  I think I am correct in saying that that is the position.  I assume that will obtain also under Section 11 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that an anomaly is created here.  If a person, by virtue of getting the assistance of a grant, repairs, improves and extends his dwelling, then at least for a period of seven years he has a statutory assurance that his rates will not be increased by virtue of that improvement. On the other hand, if a person, without relying on any State or local authority aid, out of his own pocket decides to repair and improve his house, that person is faced with an increase in rates immediately.  He has no protection whatever and his rates will go up.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister, in relation to this Bill, to consider extending the provisions in favour of the person who is prepared to carry out repair and improvement work to his own house without having recourse to a State or local authority grant. That person should have at least the same consideration from the Legislature as the person who depends on a grant to carry out his repairs.  The same provision should apply to him so that if, out of his own pocket and at his own expense, he carries out the improvements he would get the same kind of assurance that his rates will not be increased.  If the Minister adopted the point of view which I am urging on him in this regard, it would <Col N="283" /> give very great impetus to work of this nature in the City of Dublin and throughout the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>May I briefly refer to the sliding scale in respect of rates?  Generally speaking, I think the idea is good, even if it is not new, but the cash value of the operation of this system as against the two-thirds remission for a period of seven years&mdash;which is niggardly&mdash;represents no great gain to those concerned.  I would urge, as Deputy O'Donnell did, that the Minister should go a little further because if he did he would do something that would be appreciated, something worthwhile.  If he had a sliding scale over 20 years rather than ten it would be something worthwhile.  While the present ten-years' scale is not a great improvement at least it has the advantage that the increase comes gradually rather than having a sharp increase at the end of the ten years.</P>
    <P>There may be problems in the application of the small dwellings acquisition procedure to older houses, houses which are described in the Bill, I think, as &ldquo;houses previously occupied&rdquo;. The idea is one which is certainly worth encouraging but its success or failure will depend almost entirely on how the Bill is operated by local authorities.  There can be difficulties in regard to the valuing of these&mdash;I am calling them&mdash;old houses, but they need not necessarily be old. The Bill provides that the local authority, when arriving at the market value, will also take into account stamp duty, legal expenses and so on, but whether or not the local authority will arrive at what I might call an auctioneer's valuation of the premises or some more restricted valuation I do not know.  The success or failure of that provision will depend on how the local authority approaches that question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it may happen that the house is being valued for the purpose <Col N="284" /> of the purchase under the extension of Small Dwellings Acquisition Act and it may be a house that has never been rented.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>But it may not have been rented.  I may have built the house ten years ago and occupied it myself and have it for sale now.  The Deputy may want to buy it under the provisions of this Bill.  There is no question of comparison of rents coming into it.  There are a number of factors which would come into the auctioneer's valuation.  The locality, type of construction and very often the particular builder who put it up&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would be all matters which would influence the valuation for the ordinary purchaser.  I do not know whether the local authority will be prepared to approach matters on that basis, if there are two houses side by side on the same road, one built by a particularly well-known builder whose work is well-valued and appreciated while the other is built possibly by an unknown builder.  The work may be equally good but a purchaser coming along to buy one or other of the houses, if both are on offer, will be prepared to pay more for the work of the well-known established builder.  That is a fact affecting the market value of that house.  If the Deputy, or any Deputy, reads the advertisements in the newspapers he will see&mdash;I am not going to mention any names&mdash;in the case of houses offered for sale in the city the statement often made: &ldquo;It is so-and-so built,&rdquo; naming the builder.  The approach of various local authorities to these questions will be important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to say any more on the Bill.  There are some matters which might be dealt with in Committee, but I would earnestly urge the Minister to consider between now and then the points that have been made, particularly regarding the sliding scale for rates remission and allowing an assurance of non-increasing rates to the <Col N="285" /> person who carries out repairs or improvements to his own house without the assistance of a repair or improvement grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this Bill will be an important and significant addition to the series of housing Acts which stem from the parent Act of 1932 which was the first serious effort made in our history to meet and defeat the housing problem.  We should feel proud of the excellent housing legislation enacted over the years.  In the main I think it compares more than favourably with any housing legislation in the neighbouring countries.  In England they have nothing like our generous housing grants or indeed our loans and I think a great tribute is due to successive Governments and the local authorities who afford such generous grants and assistance by way of loans to those who want to build their own houses or reconstruct them.</P>
      <P>The success or failure of this Bill will depend to a large extent on the cooperation of local authorities.  Many local authorities feel that their commitments for housing grants over the last six or seven years are very high already.  For example in our county we have borrowed £670,000 to pay housing grants and yet we have not cleared the payment of our housing grants up to September, 1957.  We estimate that we shall require another £150,000 to bring the scheme up to the 1st April, 1958.  In fact, we have had to suspend the scheme for one year in order to get a breathing spell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The avowed aim of this Bill now before the House is to conserve the existing pool of houses, many of which have been allowed to fall into disrepair for different reasons, and to encourage house owners and tenants to repair, improve, and reconstruct their dwellings.  There is a shift of emphasis <Col N="286" /> from the new house to the old house and that is a commendable feature of the Bill.  I believe if the emphasis had been shifted to the old house some 10 or 12 years ago many people would not have embarked on the costly experiment of building new houses. Rather, they would have tried to make do in many cases with the houses they had, but I suppose it is better late than never.</P>
    <P>Another effect of this Bill, when it becomes law, will be to provide useful employment.  It will, I believe, give a fillip to the building trade.  Some Deputies referred to the big boom in building which we experienced here after the war years and which continued up to 1954.  In my opinion that boom has now expired and there are many skilled building workers and semi-skilled workers who have been facing a lean time during the past few years.  I believe this Bill will provide some of them with useful employment badly-needed.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister proposes to give increased grants and I think that shows he has adopted a realistic approach to the problem.  In many cases the grants were rather niggardly and, though the increases now proposed are not very big, they will offer some encouragement to people who propose to reconstruct or repair their houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes in this Bill to obviate some of the cumbersome provisions that apply to grants under Section 12 of the 1954 Housing Act. He has taken a lot of the procedure away from local authorities, and rightly so, but I think he should go further and assume responsibility for certifying as to whether a house is at for repair and improvement.  He has left the certification to local authorities and, for the life of me, I cannot see why his own housing inspectors could not visit a house after an application is made, and certify whether after reconstruction and repairs it will be fit for human habitation or not.  The holding up of these grants in many cases was due to the failure of the local authorities to play their part, and my experience of Section 12 grants was that a long period elapsed before payment was made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> I would also ask the Minister to make it possible to pay the Section 12 grants by instalments, like the reconstruction grants.  As the Minister is aware, work had to be completed and certified as completed by Local Government engineers before any payment was made.  Why is it not possible for the Minister to adopt the same procedure adopted in regard to reconstruction grants and pay half the instalment when half the work has been carried out?</P>
    <P>The Minister is providing grants of £75 for water and sewerage.  I would urge him to make these grants available to unserviced labourers' cottages in urban areas.  In my town we have many of these old cottages and the tenants of these county council cottages, non-vested cottages, would install water and sewerage, which the county council has failed to provide for them, if grants were made available from State funds.  I believe the Minister should introduce a section to enable him to give grants to tenants of such cottages.</P>
    <P>Another innovation in this Bill is the provision of loans to people to enable them to reconstruct their houses, but why has a local authority to be satisfied that a house, if reconstructed and repaired, is fit for human habitation? Can the Minister's own inspectors not certify that a house should be fit for human habitation after a certain amount of work is done?  Surely the Minister's own housing inspectors, attached to his Department, can give the necessary certificate?</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have referred to the difficulty of determining the market value of an old house in respect of which a loan under the Small Dwellings Acts may be obtained.  In the Bill before the House last year there was a section which gave a right of appeal to the Commissioner for Valuations. If the Minister introduced a similar section into this Bill it would give great satisfaction to people who might feel they were not getting a fair deal from a local authority, people who might be led to believe that the local authority were not placing a fair market value on the house they proposed to reconstruct.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> The rates remission feature of this Bill is also one that will be welcomed. Heretofore, when the full impact of rates fell on a tenant after seven years he was rather hurt and embarrassed, as some Deputies described it, but now he is being put into the water little by little, until he is completely covered after ten years, and he may be cushioned against the shock in that way.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to address himself to the vexatious question of family income which has caused much confusion to local authorities when supplementary grants are allocated.  I have seen many anomalies.  In my own constituency I saw where a farmer with a £10 5/- poor law valuation and family income of £176 got a 50 per cent. grant, while another farmer with a £12 10/- valuation and a family income of £206 per annum got a 100 per cent. supplementary grant.</P>
    <P>These figures are extraordinary but, unfortunately they are true because in the first instance the local authority deemed that the farmer derived his income mainly from a source other than farming, so that the £10 5/- was equated, £1 with £6 13/-, bringing his income from all sources up to £350 a year which entitled him to a 50 per cent. grant.  The farmer with the £12 10/- valuation and the £206 income was deemed to have derived his livelihood mainly from farming so his income of £206 was ignored and the applicant qualified for a 100 per cent. grant.  The Minister should, I think, in this Bill endeavour to clear up anomalies of this kind which are very difficult to explain to farmers down the country. When one man sees another on a higher income and valuation getting a bigger grant, he wonders&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;what kind of Acts are passed by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Minister has increased the floor area to over 1,400 sq. ft. for houses to qualify for reconstruction grants.  He could do likewise with new houses and bring them up from 1,400 sq. ft. to 1,500 sq. ft.  I have been told that in the Bill before the Dáil the specific procedure for labourers' cottages will be abolished.  That procedure was availed of to a large extent in County <Col N="289" /> Galway.  Let us say that farmer Mr. A is approached by a neighbour Mr. B, and asked to give a site for a cottage. He knows the neighbour and says: &ldquo;I will give the site to the county council to provide a cottage for you.&rdquo;  In due course, the site is purchased by the local authority and the cottage is erected and not advertised because the cottage was earmarked for the person to whom the farmer gave the site.  I hope that there is no section in this Bill that will wipe out that procedure and I should like an assurance from the Minister that that procedure will not be interfered with.</P>
    <P>There is, too, in the Bill a very controversial section dealing with labourers' cottages, allowing for the dual occupancy of labourers' cottages, where two families can live under the one roof.  I do not think that will prove very successful, because, in the first place, to have two families under the one roof in a cottage will certainly cause friction.  Secondly, it will, to my mind, rule out the possibility of that cottage ever becoming vested.  You cannot vest it in two people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced another innovation whereby a loan can be got in the case of a house of previous occupancy.  I believe that will drive up the value of second-hand houses, as they have been called, all over the countryside.  You will have would-be purchasers competing against one another to buy second-hand or old houses.  While there is a lot to be said in favour of it, I have great doubts as to whether it will work.</P>
    <P>In no part of this Bill do I see any reference to the vesting of cottages.  I would ask the Minister to take this opportunity of doing something to simplify the procedure with regard to the vesting of cottages, but, above all, I would ask him to introduce some section which will make it possible for the local authority to recover possession of a vested cottage.  Every Deputy from a rural area knows that there are numbers of vested cottages all over the country the owners of which have departed for regions unknown outside the jurisdiction of the courts.  These cottages are lying unoccupied.  In my own area, there must be three or four <Col N="290" /> such cottages.  I was told by a Deputy to-night that in the County Westmeath there are 43 of them.  Nobody knows where the owners have gone.  These cottages are allowed to fall into disrepair and the local authority cannot do anything about them under existing legislation.  The Minister might feel it right and proper to do something about that matter, now that he has the chance in the new Housing Bill.</P>
    <P>Under Section 14 of the 1954 Housing Act a term of 15 years had to elapse, under normal circumstances, before a second reconstruction grant could be paid.  If a reconstruction grant was previously paid, in the case of the proposed replacement of a roof by a roof of slate or tiles a period of ten years had to elapse.  The Minister might consider reducing that limit of 15 to ten years, and the ten-year limit to one of seven years.  If he does not, he will defeat one of the aims of the Bill, that is, to encourage the preservation of old houses.</P>
    <P>I would also ask him to indicate at some stage what the supplementary grants will be, whether the grants will be graded under £12 10s. valuation, £12 10s. to £20 or £20 to £27 or whatever it will be.  There is some confusion about that at present and it might be well to clear the air about that matter.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill.  It is one which will be appreciated very much in rural Ireland.  It will do a lot of good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say that this Bill, like previous Housing Bills, might be described as a stepping stone.  The problem of housing has been for many years of such great magnitude that no Minister, no matter how well intentioned, no matter how capable and no matter what Government he represented, was able at any time to bring into the House a Bill, which would deal with all the requirements. Consequently, in successive years, fairly steady progress has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the statement of the Minister both in the explanatory memorandum and in his speech here to-day.  He said that the <Col N="291" /> Bill had four main purposes.  The first purpose which he indicated is one which will appeal to every Deputy and particularly to the Deputies from the cities and the major towns, that is, the object of eradicating the remaining blocks of unfit houses.  I am not familiar with the position in this regard in cities like Cork, Limerick, Waterford.  I have seen occasional references to the very bad housing conditions in those cities.  Certainly, I, like other Deputies representing the City of Dublin constituencies, particularly those representing the more central areas, am only too familiar with the urgent necessity of continuing to <Col N="292" /> attack the problem in a sharper manner.  Of course, the problem is one which the Minister has indicated he wants to deal with not only in principle but in Section 20 of the Bill he indicates that he is desirous of securing the assistance of the local authorities concerned by making certain changes in the legislation which will tend to ease the problem of acquiring and developing places in the central city areas for flat development.</P>
