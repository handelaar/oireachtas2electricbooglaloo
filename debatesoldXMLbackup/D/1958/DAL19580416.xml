      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been directed to the statement of the chairman of the E.S.B. that it was hoped that at some time the board would be able to finance its own development; if so, whether it is proposed that electricity consumers should pay more in order to finance such development; and whether he will make a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statement referred to.  So far as I am aware, no increase in electricity prices is contemplated and accordingly the last part of the Deputy's question does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this is a new development as far as the E.S.B. is concerned, would the Minister indicate whether he is aware of the methods which the board will employ to finance any future development, whether he has been consulted in the matter and what views he has conveyed to the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any new development.  The board has normally financed a substantial part of its development from its own resources, by reinvestment of depreciation funds, and so on, and I do not think anything further was intended by the chairman's statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister say nothing more was contemplated by the chairman's statement than the continuance of the policy in so far as the financing of its activities is concerned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that, as far as the future financing of the board is concerned, all that was intended by the chairman in his speech was to indicate that the policy pursued in the past, namely of using its own funds for reinvestment in its own development, will be continued?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the repeated occurring of fatalities at Custom House Quay, Dublin, he will initiate proposals for the erection of a protective barrier to obviate further loss of life there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the erection of protective barriers at the Custom House Quay, Dublin, is one for the Dublin Port and Docks Board and I have no power to interfere with the discretion of the board in the matter.  I am, of course, most anxious that all practical measures should be taken to prevent fatalities at the quay. I understand that various protective measures have already been adopted <Col N="177" /> and that further measures are being considered.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that two areas in County Donegal, namely, Derrydruel and Moville, are at present in course of development under the rural electrification scheme. Two further areas, Pettigo and Drung, have been selected for development.</P>
      <P>Further areas in County Donegal will be considered by the board for selection for development during the present financial year but it is not possible at this stage to say which areas will be selected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he proposes to grant any increase to civil servants who do not come within the scheme of conciliation and arbitration; and, if so, if he will state the amount of the proposed increase and the date from which it will be made payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The two main categories of civil servant which do not come within the scheme of conciliation and arbitration are industrial civil servants in all grades and non-industrial civil servants in certain grades.  Increases in the pay of industrial civil servants are governed by increases granted to their counterparts in outside employment.  I have not yet come to a decision regarding the grant of an increase in pay to non-industrial grades who do not come within the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) the estimated annual reduction in revenue from special import levies following the recent reduction and abolition of certain special import levies, and (b) the estimated annual revenue from increased customs duty which took effect on the 1st April, 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that the amendments to the special import levies and customs duties made in the Imposition of Duties (No. 28) (Special Import Levies and Customs Duties) Order, 1958, with effect from the 10th instant will cause a reduction of about £650,000 in the annual revenue from the import levies and an increase of about £600,000 in the annual revenue from ordinary customs duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the number of workers employed on minor employment scheme and rural improvement scheme jobs is, at an average, about six per job; and whether, as this labour content only makes a negligible contribution towards the relief of unemployment, and with a view to giving all unemployed men in a particular locality their due share of work, he is prepared to arrange that, when these schemes are being carried out in future, instructions will be issued either to rotate the men eligible for employment or, alternatively, to step up the number of men employed to a minimum of 12, and so ensure that the maximum labour content is secured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bartley) Gerald Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amounts made available annually for these schemes provide work for only a fraction of the total number of unemployed men.  The number of workers actually employed on each scheme is determined primarily by the number that can be economically engaged on the particular scheme.  Existing regulations provide for the changing of the <Col N="179" /> panel of workers at the end of each six-weeks period, but it is only in exceptional circumstances that schemes last that long.  It would not be practicable to adopt generally the suggestion in the last portion of the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that if county councils' central quarries were not used for these jobs, the labour content would be considerably increased?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is talking about something quite different.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the use of the county councils' central quarries for the purpose of providing materials for minor employment schemes which takes away from the labour content when machinery is used for the haulage of material.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">

In view of the uncertainty of the outcome of the present negotiations would the Minister not consider it prudent to follow their example?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no official information about what the Danes are doing and I do not think it would be <Col N="180" /> prudent to start such inquiries as the Deputy suggests at the present time.</P>

      <P>In County Wexford, the Land Commission have on hands 765 acres on six estates, particulars of which are set out in a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, will be circulated with the Official Report.  Schemes for the division of these estates are in course of preparation and there will be no avoidable delay in the disposal of the lands.  In the year ended 31st March last, an area of some 300 acres was allotted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether it is proposed to utilise the field known as the Balloch House field on the Courtown estate, County Wexford, for afforestation; and, if such is the intention, whether, since the field is arable, he will have the matter re-examined with a view to having the field allotted to a smallholder living in the immediate area of the estate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The field in question comprises about ten acres of neglected, semi-arable land.  It forms part of a compact forest block and some work preparatory to planting has already been carried out on it.  Its disposal would have an adverse effect on the forestry development of the surrounding lands and it has, accordingly, been decided to plant it.

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will consider payment of compensation to the Ballyshannon fishermen who have been deprived of portion of their livelihood as a result of the recent by-law which prohibits fishing in the Erne estuary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I may add that the by-law referred to in the question which prohibits all forms of fishing in the Erne estuary for the 1958 season only is designed to afford the depleted stocks of salmon in the Erne system some opportunity of recovery. The by-law is, therefore, one which in the long run must be of benefit to the fishermen themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="185" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the circumstances which necessitated this by-law were brought about, not by any action of the fishermen, but by the E.S.B. who are responsible for the depletion of the fish in the estuary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the responsibility of the E.S.B. for this condition of affairs is a matter which could be the subject of discussion between the fishermen themselves and the E.S.B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that some of the crews are families who have been depending on this fishing for generations as their main source of livelihood?  Would he not consider having some form of compensation paid to these families?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no funds available to me out of which compensation could be paid to any of the Erne fishermen involved, even if such compensation were deemed to be due.  The reason for that is that no right of fishing has been taken away as, for example, in the case of the abolition of fresh-water netting.  The public is being restrained in the public interest from fishing at a time which is critical from the point of view of the stocks of fish in the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if the by-law will extend beyond the present season?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That decision has not been made.  The by-law has only been made until September of this year and the matter will be studied to see whether the stocks of salmon going up the river will be sufficiently increased to enable fishermen in coming years to secure greater revenue than they did in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider, even at this stage, reopening the estuary for rod fishing because it is a serious blow to the tourist potential of the area to have it closed for angling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally I should like to do all I could to help the tourist industry but I have evidence of an overwhelmingly <Col N="186" /> significant character which indicates that stocks must be allowed to go up the Erne before I can ensure that the fishermen there will be able to fish with increased revenue in the future.  I have taken all the advice I could get on the subject and there is no conflict in regard to the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Two years ago I had to draw the attention of the House to the menace of &ldquo;Teddy-boys&rdquo; in the City and County of Dublin.  I am glad to congratulate the Minister, the Commissioner and the Garda for eliminating that menace, which had been the cause of so much annoyance to everybody. But at the same time I must appeal to <Col N="189" /> the Minister again to have the Garda in the City of Dublin supplemented by more plain clothes men.  Over the last few years we have had several instances of youths going around with knives and razor blades.  The Department and the Garda should take a firm hand in those cases.  Many innocent people have been badly injured by these blackguards who go around abusing people and bringing disgrace on the city and county.  There is only one way of dealing with it: put the Guards into plain clothes.</P>
      <P>Another burning question in County Dublin, to which a number of speakers have referred already, is the question of itinerants.  They have been giving a great deal of trouble around newly built up areas.  Their horses go into gardens on these new estates and cause an immense amount of trouble. It has been happening from Santry right around to Finglas and Ballyfermot. An immense amount of harm has been done to gardens by these horses being allowed to roam at will. We have sentimental people who will say that these itinerants are the knights of the road.  I do not mind if they are the knights of all the roads in Ireland, they have no right to allow horses roam into a garden and destroy it.  People who have kept their gardens nicely find when they go out in the morning that there are two or three hungry horses eating all they can.  No later than two days ago I had another report from the Walkinstown area.</P>
      <P>The House will have to consider what is to be done with these itinerants. While the Garda on any occasion I had to go to them always carried out their duty and moved them on and while the corporation have done the same, yet they seem to have multiplied over the years.  From the humanitarian point of view it is terrible to see these unfortunate animals trying to get some food.</P>

      <P>If you cannot make citizens of them, put them into homes. It would be better than have them going around rearing their children without education and giving them no chances.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The tinkers are not that far removed.  I do not expect the Minister can work miracles but I am forced to make this public protest on this very important question.</P>
      <P>Driving through the country and looking at some of the Garda stations, I find some of them are kept very well but some of the older ones are not so well kept.  We are trying to attract tourists to our country and I believe our Garda stations could be made more presentable.  While the Board of Works are responsible for looking after them, I believe a new approach in that regard could be brought about.</P>
      <P>Another type of building which always looks as if it is condemned is the old court house.  The very approach to these buildings puts you back into the dark ages.  They are uninviting and do not contribute very much to the scenic beauty of any town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister. Since he has taken over as Minister for Justice he has fulfilled the obligations of his office with dignity.  He is a very worthy person to fill the position. I hope the people will co-operate with the Department in trying to maintain the dignity of our country.  If this country is to survive and to develop, every man in it must appreciate his duties as a citizen.  When I say that, I mean that he must support the Minister in charge of the Department.  If that co-operation is not forthcoming, the dignity of our democratic institution cannot be maintained.  It can be maintained only if the people realise that they have a treasure which they should <Col N="191" /> protect.  The moment disrespect is shown for that institution the freedom that a number of our fellow countrymen have gone to premature graves to secure will go by the board.</P>
    <P>A section who want to put over a policy on the country have the democratic right to convince the people of the rights of that policy.  If the people as a whole support them, they have majority rule and the democratic institution is preserved.  But if there is a junta that decide that they have cures for all ills and take it upon themselves to say that if they were in control of the country they would do things properly, they have the democratic right to go before the people and to say that their policy is the best policy, politically and economically, but it is only when they get a mandate from the people that they have a right to put that policy into operation.</P>
    <P>If this country is to survive as a democratic nation those who are paid to keep law and order must get assistance from every citizen.  I say these things in all sincerity.  We cannot have it both ways.  Whether we like it or not, this Parliament must protect itself against any junta.  That can be done only by supporting the elected Government.  If I were on the opposite side of the House I would express the same view.  This is a very serious matter for every one of us and for the people.  This part of Ireland has had freedom only since 1922.  There has been turmoil over long periods.  We are gradually trying to achieve the object that all honest representatives desire, that is, to bring about the freedom of our whole country politically and economically.  The stand we have taken in that regard is gradually being realised both internationally and nationally.  Everyone in this House stands four square behind the Minister for Justice in the difficult task he has to do.  A Minister for Justice who does his duty cannot be popular.  We are here to see that that job shall be done and that the Minister shall get all possible encouragement.</P>
    <P>In trying to put down any kind of blackguardism the Commissioner and the Gardaí should get all possible <Col N="192" /> encouragement.  The blackguardly junta to which I am referring are pulling down the fair name of our nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been one decision of the Minister during the past 12 months with which, unfortunately, I could not agree.  It may be recalled that application was made by the Cork County Council for possession of what they believed and still believe should be their rightful property, the old prison in Cork.  Unfortunately, the Minister decided otherwise and that property, which would have been of much value to the Cork County Council and, incidentally, to the rate-payers, instead of being returned to the Cork County Council has been disposed of otherwise.  There is no use crying over spilt milk but I do wish to express my disagreement with the Minister's decision in that matter.</P>
      <P>On this occasion, as in previous discussions of the Estimate for the Department of Justice, reference has been made to the numerical strength of the Garda.  That is a matter of importance and in considering the position in relation to juvenile delinquency and other matters there must be close examination of the question as to whether or not the Garda force is undermanned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the strength of the force, I should like to draw particular attention to the number of men who are employed on what could be termed clerical work in the various stations. I am not saying that they have not work to do there but I would suggest to the Minister the possibility of transferring many men from the position of clerks in offices to outside duty.  Should it be found necessary to provide clerks in these stations, there are young boys and girls leaving school every year having the necessary qualifications for that kind of work.  There may be work of a secret nature to be done but I am convinced that there is a great deal of routine work done in the stations and that there is a fairly large proportion of men employed at that type of work who could be used to greater advantage outside.  I would ask the Minister to examine the feasibility of making some arrangement to obviate that position. <Col N="193" /> There is also the question of the barracks throughout the country.  The Gardaí in these barracks are in all cases doing their work but we often wonder if there is a shortage&mdash;and I believe there is&mdash;in Dublin and Cork cities, and perhaps in Limerick and other cities also.  Would it not be possible to transfer men from many of the country barracks, seeing that law and order is so well established in most country areas and seeing that so many people here and outside believe it is possible to do so?  They feel that it would be possible to have fewer Gardaí in the rural areas and transfer them to the cities and towns or to seaside places where we know the conduct of many so called visitors in the summer is such that it is almost impossible for the few Gardaí stationed in such places to deal with it.</P>
    <P>My third point is in connection with the supply of motor-cycles to the Garda, an innovation which I feel has proved highly successful so far as the men who have got the machines are concerned.  I understood that the force would be pretty generally supplied with motor-cycles and I remember once while coming here seeing seven or eight members of the force heading south on their motor-cycles.  I have often since wondered where did they go because as far as I am aware we can only find one motor-cycle used by the Garda in the whole of County Cork.  Again, the cycles supplied are of the light type which is not suitable for such work and we should remember that if we use Garda vans or cars with the name displayed prominently on top it gives warning to people such as those Deputy Burke spoke about, people with horses, and to the &ldquo;Teddyboy&rdquo; type.  If the Minister concentrated on improving conditions in all areas by the adequate provision of motor-cycles better results would be achieved than are possible at present.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have already spoken about some of the minor offences.  If members of the force, in Dublin, Cork or elsewhere were given freedom to act as they thought fit, I think the Minister would not have to worry about getting the money to increase their pay.  Daily and yearly in Cork and I am sure in <Col N="194" /> Dublin and elsewhere, offences are committed by motor cyclists, lorry drivers and motorists who ignore every rule of the road and at the same time ignore the rights of the rest of the community and their own responsibilities. If, in other countries police are empowered to fine such offenders on the spot, could it not be done here?</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan drew attention to many of the trivial cases taking up the time of courts but I am convinced that the Garda could be relied on, if given the right to act in many of these cases, to deal with them on the spot and they would not misuse their powers.  If such offenders were dealt with by direct fine and if necessary by endorsement, I hope the time would come when these people would at least play fair with the rest of the community.  I believe a large percentage of the offences committed by motorists show a complete lack of manners and I think the only way to treat them is to fine them heavily and regularly.</P>
    <P>As regards children who seem to be so frequently before courts, we must admit we cannot say we have a downward trend in relation to juvenile crime.  While nobody would wish for publicity in the case of children whose future may be affected by some wild, childish prank, it is essential that the responsibility of the parents should be so emphasised that they cannot evade it.  Many parents are helped in their evasion by the fact that while the child may be before the court and may be reprimanded, no publicity is given to the names of the parents of such children.  It is deplorable that parents can be brought to court, admit the lack of any form of control over their children and get away with it.  It is essential to take some further action as regards the future of the children of such parents.</P>
    <P>As others have mentioned, there seems to be a big problem not only in Dublin City but in many other places regarding vandalism and blackguardism by groups of youths who go about destroying property, stealing cars and doing all the damage they can.  This trend has appeared in the South-East, outside Cork City and it is a common occurrence for motor cars locked and <Col N="195" /> carefully parked to be stolen.  It is, therefore, incumbent not only on the Minister but on everyone else to try to bring such individuals to justice.  In doing so we would be doing service not only to the victims of these vandals but to all who are anxious to cooperate.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer to something Deputy Burke mentioned.  While the Garda force seems to be understaffed in regard to various problems and in dealing with offenders of the type I have described, we find that extra men are drafted off to help in another direction.  Money had to be found for that and for the extra equipment needed.  Without saying anything derogatory of the present Minister and his office, I have often said, and I repeat, that the younger generation consider it not alone a right but a duty to give credit to the people who played a noble part in the past, but we cannot afford to live in the past, and I do not believe that it is right to let things slide as they are doing.</P>
    <P>There is no use whatever in presenting certain forms to any individual to be signed.  That is not going to get us anywhere.  What is the remedy?  I cannot offer a clear remedy.  I am not saying that the Government should have one ready to hand, but I do believe that they should not continue to condemn people who cannot be placed in the same category as those who go about the country destroying property.  There must be a distinction between the two classes.  These men are no better, but they are not any worse, than the men who believed they were right in 1920.</P>
    <P>What I am worried about is what we shall do to put an end to the misfortune of having some of our own young people in jail without trial.  I know that cannot be an easy problem for the present Minister.  It may not be an easy problem for the Government but for the Minister, in particular, it must be very hard.  We shall not succeed in solving that problem by holding to the line to which Deputy Burke drew attention.  It is fantastic for us to speak of our hopes and desires in regard to democratic <Col N="196" /> government here while we hold these young people in jail without trial.  The remedy for that state of affairs must be found by whatever Government is in office here and that remedy will not be a real remedy while trial in the ordinary courts is forbidden to these people.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister again to put before his colleagues the importance of trying to bring this state of affairs to an end.  Too many young Corkmen and too many young men from various parts of the Twenty-Six Counties are now in a position in which they have hope neither for the immediate nor the distant future. These are young men who have been a credit to their employers and who believe that they are a credit to the country.  We are not striving for true democracy in government if we close our eyes to present conditions.</P>
    <P>Why is it that the people are not being made aware of the many difficulties? Many people outside may be led astray by the line of approach of a new Party.  Programmes may be put before them which will do nothing but lead them astray.  The people will wonder, and rightly so, why it is that nothing seems to be done about the position of the six north-eastern counties.  The Minister may tell us that they are doing everything possible. The Taoiseach of the inter-Party Government told us that, but why is it that all this is being done behind closed doors?  Why is it that the public, which is so anxious to know the true position, is being kept in the dark?  I would suggest to the Minister that this matter must get more serious attention, not only as regards the question of Partition but also as regards the problems in relation to the ending of Partition.  There is no use in saying that it will end some day.</P>

      <P>The Minister must be made to understand, in seeking the provision of this extra money for equipment, that the other side of the question has not been answered.

      <P>I should like to discuss, on this Estimate, a few points which arise out of questions I have asked here in the past.  The curious thing about the Department of Justice is that it seems to ignore the old axiom: &ldquo;Let justice be done but let it also appear to be done&rdquo;.  I should like to speak in relation to the question of appointments generally under the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The question which seems to me to be anomalous is that in relation to most of the other Government Departments an attempt has been made to establish a system of appointments whereby every citizen of the State would have an equal opportunity to sit for, and be appointed to, any particular job.  I think it was the Cumann na nGaedheal Government that set up the Local Appointments Commission.  The odd thing seems to me to be that they set up this excellent body for the making of medical, architectural, engineering and other appointments but they did not include under that system appointments by the Department of Justice in relation to the judiciary, in particular, and also in relation to the higher posts in the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of promotion to the higher offices in the Garda is not anything like an ideal system of appointment. I think that, from the beginning, it has been broadly on the old spoils system.  This seems to apply to all Governments since the State was formed&mdash;that promotion and preferment in the judiciary and the Garda have been a matter of the advancement of the political trustees of the Party in power.  I do not think that <Col N="198" /> anybody feels that this is the most efficient system of making appointments. It does not ensure that you will get the most efficient officers you may want for the job.</P>
    <P>In relation to the judiciary in particular they should be completely independent and above all political affiliations and associations.  I do not believe that a Cabinet composed as it is of the different individuals that form it&mdash;they may be professional men, tradesmen, ordinary civilians, whatever they may be&mdash;are the best qualified persons to make these appointments. I must confess that I myself felt my own inadequacy when faced with the question of making an appointment in relation to a county registrar, a judge or a justice or the promotion of a superintendent to a higher rank.  That is a wrong system of appointment.  I thought it was wrong then and I still think it is wrong.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Minister will give some thought to the altering of this anomalous position?  It is an anachronism, a retention of the old system of privilege which we used to have, where all the worth-while jobs went to a powerful minority.  All these privileges seem to be reserved to a powerful political minority, the political henchmen of the different Parties. This is most undesirable in many cases because it does lead to a sort of blackmail, the imposition of silence, an insistence on conformity with whatever political Party is in power.  In order that the individual may ensure that he will get promotion or preference when the time comes, he learns not to conflict with the opinions of the people who can make the appointments. Consequently this system tends to undermine the proper democratic ideals of a normal society.  You tend to get the development of sycophancy and conformity, insistence on orthodoxy, the rejection of heterodox opinions.  All these things are very undesirable.</P>
    <P>We all agree, I am sure, with the advance from the making of appointments in the old days by the boards of health.  Most of them were various forms of nepotism and jobbery and in <Col N="199" /> many cases went as far as outright corruption.  I am not saying that this situation obtains to-day in relation to judicial, legal or Garda Síochána appointments.  I make no such imputation, but the advance from those days when these appointments were made by the boards of health in a very unfair way was welcomed by everybody. The establishment of the Local Appointments Commission and the Civil Service Commission was a great advance towards the establishment of the right of every citizen to reach to every post by reason of his merit as an individual professional man, whether barrister, lawyer, solicitor, doctor, architect, engineer, or whatever he might happen to be.</P>
    <P>I believe that was the fundamental aim and ideal which it was intended to set up 35 years ago and under the system at present operated by the Department of Justice, that ideal is not achieved.  It is achieved in most of the other Departments and I cannot for the life of me see why the Department of Justice has not accepted this principle in its appointments.  I cannot see that the Government or the Minister has anything to fear if appointments are thrown open to all those who are qualified to enter for a particular post.  If a candidate is the best man he will get the job and surely that should be the only objective of the Minister.  Public money is involved and it should be spent with a due sense of responsibility.  It should not be used as a sort of political treasure chest which can be doled out by the victorious Party after a general election, money and prizes doled out from a sort of unending hospital sweep to the loyal Party adherents over the years.  This system gives too much power to a Party and it gives too much power to the hierarchy of the Party and to any individual in a Party who can decide on these things.</P>
    <P>This is particularly important in relation to the fact that people are chosen for their political affiliations and their stalwart support over the years.  This is injurious at all levels of the judiciary or of the Garda but it is particularly injurious in relation to the <Col N="200" /> District Courts.  Most of us, civilians, are prepared to go to the District Court because it is reasonably inexpensive. It has very wide jurisdiction and powers and consequently it deals with a wide variety of cases.  Therefore, it is most important that these courts should be presided over by a man who is as competent and as efficient as it is possible to find.  Where there is bad interpretation of the law in these District Courts it means that the average citizen is faced with the possibility of appeals to a higher court with the considerable legal expenses which are involved in these cases.  Most people tend to be understandably frightened of this and hesitate to avail of the facilities provided.  Consequently they are denied their due rights simply because the justice on the bench was appointed, not because he was particularly clever or talented or a particularly good lawyer, but because he happened to have a Party card and a long record or history of Party loyalty.</P>
    <P>In the case of these district justices appointments, the people who present themselves for these posts should go before an independent authority, something on the lines of the Local Appointments Commission, composed of persons competent to assess the merits of the candidates.  Such a body, independent of political Parties and of the Government in power, should be appointed to examine the credentials of these people and decide on their suitability for the posts.  There are very few people who have any illusions about that point at the moment and a more enlightened and more progressive outlook on the part of the Minister in that regard would be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In answer to a question recently, I was told that the appointment of a surgeon to the Garda was made as a result of a Cabinet decision.  I do not know the person appointed.  I do not know his qualifications and I wish to make it quite clear that I am casting no reflection of any kind upon him. He may easily have been the best man for the post.  What I am interested in is the principle of appointment.  If the desire is to get the best person for a post, why is the post not advertised, all the applicants considered and a <Col N="201" /> decision taken to appoint the person who appears best qualified?  Possibly the present incumbent is the best person, but why not make the choice for this responsible and important post from as wide a number of applicants as possible?</P>
    <P>These appointees are not paid out of political funds.  They are paid out of public moneys and those moneys should be spent with a due sense of conscientious responsibility to all our citizens, who earn this money hard enough. Citizens have equal rights and these people should have equal rights to any positions that may arise.  As I say, the present incumbent may easily be the best man.  The Cabinet is composed of diversified personalities, all good men in their own way, but not all competent to decide on the medical qualifications of individuals.</P>
    <P>The question of promotion in the Garda is causing a considerable amount of disquiet and dissatisfaction.  Whether that is justified or not, it is difficult to say.  One of the troubles in making an appointment or giving a promotion is that, if there are nine or ten applicants, only one person is satisfied and nine are dissatisfied.  At the same time, men who have served 15, 16, 17, 18 or more years should be able to be quite certain in their own minds that they have got a fair run when they go forward for appointment or promotion.  I understand there are cases of men with 18 and 19 years' service and absolutely unblemished records who have been passed over in favour of men many years junior to them in service and experience.  While it is possible that the appointments and promotions were quite justified, the system of appointment or promotion appears to allow the interpretation that unfair pressure, political favouritism, personal favouritism, bias of one kind or another has been used.  The Minister should examine the present system.  It would be well worth his while.</P>
    <P>One of the significant characteristics in relation to the Local Appointments Commission is that most people appear to be satisfied.  Those going before the commission know that everything possible is done to ensure that they will be fairly treated.  When I started in the <Col N="202" /> Department of Health, I was prejudiced against the commission, but, having gone into the whole system and seen the meticulous way in which they try to ensure fair play for everybody, I came to the conclusion that the machinery of appointment is as nearly perfect as it is humanly possible to make it.  There will, of course, always be disgruntled persons, but, by and large, it is a very efficient and just machine.  Furthermore, it has the added attraction that it leaves Ministers free from pressure of any kind in relation to appointments.  It is responsible to nobody but the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister would consider this whole question of making appointments in relation to the judiciary, especially in relation to the District Courts, in relation to promotion in the Garda Síochána to the higher ranks and in relation to the promotion of ordinary Gardaí to the rank of sergeant. The present system has gone on year after year and, for that reason, we tend to accept it uncritically.  It appears now to be an accepted part of Government.  It is a dangerous system and it is worthy of re-examination now. In making these remarks, I do not want it to be thought that any members of the judiciary are incompetent, inefficient, politically corrupt or amenable to any particular Party.  It is a tribute to them that they have such a high reputation for integrity and independence. At the same time, the system is one which is open to abuse and it should be changed.</P>
    <P>There is a sum provided here of £40 for executions.  This is a matter upon which I should like to touch very briefly.  The word is &ldquo;executions&rdquo;&mdash;a pleasant euphemism for &ldquo;hangman's expenses&rdquo;.  Would the Minister consider the whole question of our attitude to capital punishment again?  Taking a life is a terrible thing, but I have never been able to understand how anyone could think that one can balance that appalling crime by an equally terrible crime&mdash;the cold-blooded killing inherent in what is known as judicial hanging.  The killing of a man for killing another man is an anachronism which civilised society accepts as such. My own personal view is that anybody who is so completely amoral as to kill <Col N="203" /> a man must be out of his mind.  We have long since decided that persons suffering from mental disorder should not be punished in this way.  A murderer is a sick man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>I would suggest it is about time we did.  It is the use of the euphemism &ldquo;executioner's expenses.&rdquo; I should like to be more blunt and say &ldquo;hangman's expenses,&rdquo; so that we would all know what we are doing.  We are providing £40 of money to give to a person who, I think, must be essentially abnormal, for hanging another human being.  That helps it to pass through the House year after year practically unnoticed.  I do not think I am any more sensitive or humane than anybody else here or anywhere else.  I feel if the people knew this, if it were put down more bluntly, they would be very much more shocked at the thought, just as we would all be shocked if our names were to be drawn from a hat and one of us here had to do it.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the phrase is &ldquo;deficient enough to do it.&rdquo;  I recommend that point of view.  I think it is being generally accepted that the criminal, the murderer, is a psychopathic. He is a sick man, mentally deranged.  What he needs is hospital treatment.  Killing is no solution of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister questions in relation to drunken driving and I should like to know has he given any thought to the matter of the use of blood tests in attempting to assess the degree of intoxication of the individual.  As we know at the moment, this question is largely decided on the eloquence of the lawyer defending the person in the District Courts.  There are so many objective tests, tests which are essentially objective and difficult of interpretation, that if there is any test which is of a more scientific nature or character, which might give a more precise and accurate assessment of the degree of intoxication of the individual, the Minister might consider <Col N="205" /> looking into it here in order to see that a greater degree of fairness is used in the case of persons arrested on charges of drunken driving.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question&mdash;I do not think he has said anything about it&mdash;of what the Minister proposes to do about the recommendations in relation to the licensing laws and the use of these <i>bona fide</i> public houses where most of this drunken driving appears to originate.  From my own point of view, I am not a bit convinced that public houses should stay open later in the cities than in the rural areas. I have a relatively open mind on this. I should like to ask the Minister if he has come to any decision in relation to the opening of public houses in the rural and urban areas, the agreement to allow public houses in rural areas to open on Sundays as is the case in the cities.</P>
    <P>Very little notice appears to be taken by the Minister of the advances that have been made generally in the psychiatric approach to the care of the criminal.  The increase in crime which was referred to here by so many Deputies is, I believe, in many cases due to abnormal personality.  It has been shown that, in relation to children in particular, a very high percentage of children with abnormal personalities, psychopathic personalities, are children who come from broken homes or homes in which there are divorces, quarrelling parents or an unsettled environment.  The main point is that in these cases referred to, the &ldquo;Teddy-boys&rdquo; and young hooligans, many of them are persons who behaved in this way through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Desmond that in the children's courts more publicity should be given to the children than is at present given to them.  The general approach to the treatment of children in the courts is one of the very enlightening aspects of the whole judicial system in the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister's opening statement that the borstal is a corrective and not a punitive establishment is a very hopeful consideration and is an advance in relation to the whole <Col N="206" /> question of crime and the treatment of crime.  I do not know why, however, we should stop at the use of the corrective in relation to crimes in the borstal institutions.  Why is there not a greater use of psycho-analysis and psychiatric treatment in relation to the treatment of adult criminals in our prisons?  At present it appears our prisons are places to which people are sent for a stated period and then released.  Little, if any, attempt is made to find out the origin or reasons for the attitude towards society of these people, and, having found that out, to attempt to treat it.  When we have that more enlightened approach that the Minister says we have in relation to borstal, that is, that prison shall be a corrective, that criminals shall be treated as sick persons, persons who come from environments over which they had little or no control, then we will establish a penal system of which we can be a little more proud than we are at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters on which I should like to touch.  Reference has been made by many speakers to accidents on the road.  It is the duty of the various officers under the Minister to enforce the law as it stands.  The Minister is not responsible for the promotion of legislation governing road traffic but he is one of the Ministers consulted by the appropriate Minister, namely, the Minister for Local Government, on traffic legislation which such Minister proposes introducing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some two years ago, when I had the privilege of introducing the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, the present Tánaiste, then Deputy Lemass, appealed to me to bring in road traffic legislation as soon as possible and prior to my leaving office I had drafted a Road Traffic Bill. That Bill had been approved by the Government and, in my opinion, there were only two sections in it which could be controversial, namely, a driving test and fines on the spot.  It was my intention to introduce such legislation and to incorporate in it fines on the spot and a modified form of driving test.  I would appeal to the Minister to <Col N="207" /> approach his colleague and endeavour to have that legislation brought before the House as soon as possible and, if he does not agree with these two sections, delete them from the Bill and let the House debate them by way of amendment.  Road traffic legislation, which is very badly needed, is now long overdue.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Minister to see that the Garda enforce the law as it stands and, unfortunately, that is not happening.  Accidents are occurring on the roads day after day, night after night, and no effort is being made to check them.  I looked forward to the time when we would have mobile patrols on the roads, when some sort of effort would be made to protect the motorist and pedestrian from the careless and dangerous driver.  I understand that in every Garda district in Ireland at the moment there is a mobile patrol.  Most Deputies who live in rural Ireland see the duty which is being carried out by these gentlemen and, unfortunately, it is no help whatsoever to an improvement of road traffic.  I see, day in and day out, two or three Gardaí sitting in a car outside a barrack or at some crossroads, no effort being made to control traffic, no effort being made to prosecute reckless and careless drivers or defaulters.  No later than the other day I saw a Garda patrol car pass out a lorry without a number plate and two cars without tail lights and they made no effort to pull up and have these gentlemen prosecuted.</P>
    <P>It should be the duty of the patrol car to drop Guards here and there at strategic points who would hold up motorists, keep a check on them and ensure that they are prosecuted for offences which they may commit.  Particularly on what may be described as non-first-class roads, where we find lorry drivers causing obstruction by failing to give the right of traffic to overtaking cars, Gardaí could do a lot by being placed at strategic points to prosecute these men and, again, to ensure that lorries carry rear mirrors. Not only should they ensure that they carry the mirror but that the driver can see through it.  There is no use <Col N="208" /> in fixing a mirror unless the driver can see through and see what traffic is approaching from the rear.  Sometimes we see these mirrors parallel with the road, very seldom at right angles to it and very, very seldom placed in a proper position.  Gardaí in mobile patrol cars could do something there.</P>
    <P>We who practise in the local courts and read the local papers realise the fact that a number of road traffic accidents occur after dances in rural Ireland.  There is no reason why a patrol car should not visit these dance halls, particularly when traffic is dispersing from them, and ensure that the cars are not overloaded, as is happening in many cases, and ensure further that the cars are taxed and are properly lighted.  I have no time for a person who tries to &ldquo;do&rdquo; the Exchequer by failing to contribute what is due by him for the use of a vehicle and I can assure the Minister, from personal experience, that at least 5 per cent. of the cars in this country are not taxed for the entire taxable year.  The mobile patrol cars could do something to ensure that each citizen who uses the roads will make his proper contribution to the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of a spit and polish force but something could be done at the moment to sharpen up discipline in the Garda force.  In the City of Dublin there is at the moment a number of young men doing point duty, some of them excellent officers giving a very good example but some others who are a disgrace to the force by the manner in which they carry out the signals which they give.  Sometimes it is very difficult to know whether one is on nodding acquaintance with the Guard or whether he is signalling one on or telling one to stop when he gives a signal.  He should give the signal in a very positive manner, not in the haphazard manner which, to my personal knowledge, has caused a number of accidents in the city.  I should like to see some standard form of signal given by Gardaí on point duty in the City of Dublin and given in a very positive manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> As I have said, I am not in favour of spit and polish but I do like to see discipline rigidly enforced and one thing that the Minister should do is to ensure that the side pockets of Garda uniforms are sewn up.  There is nothing that looks worse than Gardaí down the country strolling along with their hands in their pockets.  If an officer, a clergyman, a Deputy or a peace commissioner is entitled to a salute from the Gardaí, let the Gardaí give it.  If the commissioner does not want these men saluted, cut it out of the regulations but, if they are entitled to a salute, let the salute be given.  Again, one does not know whether one is on nodding acquaintance or otherwise with these Guards sometimes down the country when one meets them.</P>
    <P>May I make an appeal to the Minister on behalf of the Irish language?  Some years ago one of his predecessors introduced a scheme whereby Irish-speaking Gardaí were allocated to Gaeltacht areas.  Additional pay was given to the men who were placed in these isolated areas.  I understand that that pay is still being paid to Gardaí stationed in Gaeltacht areas but, unfortunately, the Irish-speaking Guard is a thing of the past. One of the reasons, in my opinion, is that Kerry Irish-speaking Gardaí were stationed in Donegal, Donegal Irish-speaking Gardaí stationed in Kerry, Mayo Irish speakers, stationed in Kerry and in Donegal, and <i>vice versa</i>, with the result that they were dealing with semi-illiterate people who spoke a language they could neither read nor write.  These people spoke in a particular dialect, and they did not understand the dialect spoken by Gardaí imported into the area.</P>
    <P>I remember a Circuit Court case in Letterkenny conducted in Irish.  The judge was a fluent Irish speaker, a native of Kerry.  Prosecuting counsel was a very good Irish speaker from Dublin and the witnesses were from the heart of the Gaeltacht in Donegal. Prosecuting counsel put the same question three times to the witness who did not answer.  The judge eventually said to the witness: &ldquo;You must answer.&rdquo;  The witness, then becoming <Col N="210" /> aware that everybody was getting annoyed, looked at me and asked me: &ldquo;What are they talking about?&rdquo; It was only then it dawned on everybody that the unfortunate witness did not understand either the fluent prosecuting counsel or the fluent Irish-speaking judge.  I do not suggest that we should send all Irish-speaking judges to the Gaeltacht, but we could improve matters by sending Irish-speaking Gardaí from various Gaeltacht counties into their own counties where they will understand, and be able to discuss matters with, the local people.</P>
    <P>Certain elements here at the moment do not recognise our courts.  Without going into the merits of that attitude we should do something to add a little dignity to these courts.  The Minister cannot compel these gentlemen to recognise the courts but it creates a very bad impression on outsiders to find Irish citizens refusing to recognise the courts and to find the courts sitting in buildings which are semi-derelict. That is a matter in which the Minister could use his good offices to ensure that the courts would sit in premises in keeping with the dignity of the law. In one district, I know from experience we had to wait until the hens stopped cackling before we could proceed with the business in a particular courthouse. I shall not name it in case the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and myself, coming from West Donegal, might find ourselves in difficulties with the landlord of the courthouse.</P>
    <P>County councils and local authorities, at the behest of the Minister, should ensure that proper courthouses are provided.  With modern methods of transport it would be no great hardship if some courts where there are no proper courthouses were abolished and litigants could go to proper courthouses. This would add dignity to the law and would impress outsiders who find it hard to understand our mentality at present owing to circumstances over which the Minister has no control.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Dr. Browne referred to the enforcement of the licensing laws.  New legislation is overdue in this matter and while its introduction may not be discussed on the Vote may <Col N="211" /> I be permitted to say that Deputy Corry introduced a private Bill some years ago, and he had my full support for it, to abolish closing on certain days, particularly Saint Patrick's Day? I am sure the Minister knows the story of the man who visited the dog show at Ballsbridge on St. Patrick's Day to get some refreshment and who could not understand &ldquo;why they brought all those damn dogs to a place like that&rdquo;. Even if this story is not true it is appropriate.  It is a disgrace that one must go to a dog show to get necessary refreshments to drown or wet the shamrock on that festival.  The unfortunate man in the country has no way out unless the Garda give him &ldquo;the Nelson eye&rdquo; and, thank God, they do.</P>

      <P>If the Minister considers the report he has received from the commission set up some years ago, despite the fact that he is a city Deputy, I would ask him to remember the rural point of view put forward in the various recommendations he received. Rural Ireland is completely different from the city.  Deputy Dr. Browne said he did not like later licensing hours but it must be recognised that in spring and harvest time, when farm labourers may work until 11 o'clock at night, they are anxious to get some light refreshments, probably to quench their thirst with a &ldquo;pint&rdquo;, and it is too bad if they cannot get it.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, but I think the Minister, in the enforcement of the present licensing laws, could perhaps indicate that legislation may be introduced in the future.  I believe the Minister will give personal consideration to the various points of view and I shall not delay the House much longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the mobile patrol could do more to enforce the traffic laws than it does at present and that justices should not be so lenient in cases of road tax <Col N="212" /> evasion.  We are all anxious to get the finances of the country straightened out and one of the greatest offences that can be committed is evading contributing to the national coffers the money which this House says should be contributed.  The question of dog licences could also be considered because very few people now pay these licences.  Vans will detect wireless licence defaulters but there is no proper method of detecting the dogowner who has not paid the licence.  If everybody paid his share of income-tax and the other taxes the Minister for Finance could perhaps reduce income-tax and we would be on a straighter road so far as finance is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with the question of recruitment for the Garda.  I have long believed that the retiring age limits, fixed originally 25 or 30 years ago, were fixed at limits which then appeared practicable and desirable.  But with the passage of time and the advent of better conditions in regard to peace in the country I feel it should be possible to extend the upper retiring age limit of the force.  We know that 95 per cent. of the Garda&mdash;and that goes for those of them who retire in the upper ranks especially&mdash;are in pretty good physical condition at the time of retirement.</P>
      <P>I have made a study of this matter over the past couple of years and have gone to the trouble of getting statistics with regard to the general fitness of members of the force who have retired during that time.  I find that, generally, all those people fit into some form of employment or another after retirement.  They are able to pursue, for many years afterwards, a normal course of employment.  They are able, in fact, to take on duties of an arduous nature which could only be performed, in normal circumstances, by people much younger than themselves.  That goes to show that these members of the force could continue to serve satisfactorily for a greater number of years than they have been allowed to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps their conditions of contract provide that they must retire and that the State has no hold on them after they have reached the age limit.  If <Col N="213" /> that is so, I would ask the Minister to consider the revision of the contracts of the recruits now entering the force so that when their time for retirement comes their age limit may be extended. In that way, too, recruits now entering the force will know what their contracts are likely to be.  In every other occupation, particularly in business and commercial life, it has been found that people are now as active and efficient at the age of 70 as they were some years ago at the age of 60 or 62. I would be inclined to say that serious consideration should be given to the feasibility of allowing members of the Garda Síochána to serve until they are 65 or 68 years of age and I see no objection to the officers of the force serving up to the age of 70 years.</P>
    <P>The work of the general administration of the force has lessened considerably in recent years, due to the co-operation of the people which is now forthcoming in a manner which was not the case 15 or 20 years ago.  It is now much easier for the Garda to carry out their duties and I feel that that is a good reason why consideration should now be given to the question of extending the retiring age limit.  When a Garda does retire, after having served for 35 or 40 years, he may have reached the age when he is not suitable for any other form of employment.  However, most of the Gardaí who do retire seem to be able to get employment.  There are complaints in many quarters, particularly from trade unions, that retired Gardaí in receipt of pensions are being considered for jobs at salary rates lower than those which would be normally offered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point only to indicate that it would be much more practicable to bring about a state of affairs where a member of the force could continue in service until he nears the age at which he could not do any other work.  There is the question of liability for State pensions which is increasing every year.  In this time of financial stringency, any reduction that could be brought about in that liability <Col N="214" /> is something that the Minister would welcome.</P>
      <P>I have very strong views, and I have mentioned them to the Minister on one or two occasions, on the point that the amalgamation of senior officers' posts in the Garda Síochána should be practicable at this stage.  We find, on looking through the Estimate, that we now have the same numbers of senior officers that we had at the very commencement. Things have changed a lot for the better in the past 20 years and I would be surprised if some scheme of reorganisation was not possible whereby the number of senior officers could be reduced.  I am not suggesting that any of these men should be retired but, when they do retire, amalgamation of their posts should be considered, particularly the post of chief superintendent.</P>
      <P>We have found it possible recently to amalgamate the areas covered by our district justices.  That is an indication that the general duties imposed on our officers of the law are inclined to lessen rather than to increase.  The post of chief superintendent is now largely of an administrative nature and I feel that, with efficient local superintendents, it should be possible to have three counties joined into one division, controlled by one chief superintendent.  Local areas, each under a superintendent, could not be interfered with because the district headquarters are units of a very compact area.  That type of organisation would be hard to replace at the present time.  The people are anxious to retain it because they like to have a local headquarters to which they can go when they have a complaint to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of controversy exists at the moment with regard to the Road Traffic Acts.  I should like to deal with a number of items arising from them. The first item is the question of driving tests.  I understand that, in this regard, I cannot indicate that I am asking that legislation should be enacted.  There is no doubt but that, sooner or later, driving tests will have to be imposed in some form or another. I have some knowledge of this subject as I am in a line of business that has connection with it.  We regard our- <Col N="215" /> selves in this country as being exceptional in the low ratio of accidents arising from the use of motor vehicles but it has to be considered that any person who decides to drive a motor car or any other mechanically propelled vehicle has only to obtain an application form from the local taxation authority, complete the form and send it together with £1 fee and he automatically gets a licence to drive that vehicle.  There is no doubt that a driving test is most desirable. The sooner something is done in that direction the better.</P>
    <P>All the well-disciplined organisations of the State, such as the Army, the Garda Síochána, C.I.E. and other semi-State organisations enforce very rigid driving tests.  Even in the F.C.A., our voluntary military organisation, there is a very fine panel of drivers selected after very careful consideration and after a very severe and exacting driving test.  I have experience of employing these drivers in other lines of business and they are a very fine example to others.  Those limited tests referred to, having proved so successful, should be a very good pointer to the need for a general all round test being imposed on drivers taking out licences.  At the present time a driving licence cannot be issued to persons under 17 years of age.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of driving licences is a matter for the Minister for Local Government. The Minister for Justice has no responsibility in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to offences arising out of the Road Traffic Act, particularly for drunken driving, I have not the latest statistics under that heading just now but from what I can learn from general inquiries into the matter, this offence seems to be on the decline.  I sincerely hope that that is so and that in future years there will be a further decline until this very unfortunate crime&mdash;I call it a crime; I cannot find any other word for it&mdash;is wiped out altogether.  That might be too much to expect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> In the early days when this form of crime commenced to show itself the district justices were inclined to take a much more lenient view than they do now.  We all know now that the general penalty for any person convicted of driving a motor vehicle whilst under the influence of drink is rather severe. It is a substantial fine and the licence of the convicted person may be suspended for a year or two years.  That is something on which we should be very strict.  Most people convicted under this heading will always find it possible to make a special case of their own difficulties and, generally speaking, public representatives, especially members of this House, have been rather soft in the past&mdash;at least up to the past couple of years; we take a different view now&mdash;towards people coming along, making representations and putting all sorts of pressure on the Minister for the purpose of getting him to restore a suspended licence.</P>
    <P>I had some requests in that direction in my short time in the House.  I got over that very easily.  I made a very fixed rule which I would not break under any circumstances, that in respect of any person convicted on a charge of drunken driving I would not even attempt to ask the Minister, even in the most diplomatic form possible, to consider restoring the licence.  I think we should all adopt that line of action and I am glad to know that a number of Deputies are taking that line.</P>
    <P>Of course, persons convicted will tell you they were not drunk.  I am prepared to accept the view of the District Court.  The district justices who adjudicate there are men of considerable ability.  They know the frality of human nature; I am sure they will weigh very carefully the relevant circumstances of every case and they will not rush hastily into any decision to convict a person of drunkness unless there is abundant evidence that he was drunk or in such a condition that he was not capable of exercising the necessary control over the car.  Society has to be protected in many ways and the attitude of the court is one of the most important means by which we can protect people of every walk of life who have to use our roads from drunken drivers.  If the present drastic action <Col N="217" /> which has been taken by the courts has shown satisfactory results&mdash;and I am happy to see evidence of that from the Minister's Department&mdash;that is something on which to congratulate ourselves.</P>
    <P>There is one Vote among this justice group to which very little reference has been made.  That is the Vote in connection with adoption.  This was a very controversial measure before it was introduced some years ago.  During its passage through the Dáil it was discussed at great length and again proved very controversial.  At all events it was enacted and as a newcomer here I have given it some attention.  I am inclined to feel that this is one of the finest pieces of social legislation that has been enacted by the State since its foundation.  The work of that board is carried out in an unostentatious manner and except when we get the annual report the vast majority of the people hardly know that it exists at all.</P>
    <P>We can all recall the difficulties that existed or that were supposed to exist and the doubts cast as to the wisdom of passing this legislation some years ago.  I am glad to say that quite a number of people with whom I have discussed this and who were genuinely in doubt as to the wisdom of the measure at the time, have admitted to me now that the purpose which the Act set out to achieve has been fulfilled in a very satisfactory way.  If you study the annual report of the Adoption Board you will find that all the difficulties and doubts expressed at the time now seem to have been overcome.</P>
    <P>I understand that the board is administered by a voluntary body, a chairman and a number of members who devote a considerable amount of time to the activities of the board. Meetings in Dublin are very frequent and, in addition, regional meetings are held throughout the country.  All the members of the board work hard to achieve the best results.  The last report indicated that up to 700 adoption orders were made in the previous year.  That number has been maintained again this year.  The figure is satisfactory remembering the amount of screening that has to be done and <Col N="218" /> the inquiries that have to be instituted by the personnel of the board before any order can be made.  There is one aspect which seems to have been overlooked. Those who are selected as parents for these children get a very large measure of satisfaction but, what is more important, is the fact that the child is now fortunate in getting a good home and devoted parents.  It is a pity that this piece of legislation did not appear on our Statute Book much earlier.  However, the old saying &ldquo;Better late than never&rdquo; holds true here.  I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the board and to commend them on the excellent work they are doing in co-operation with the voluntary adoption societies.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by previous speakers, notably Deputy Dr. Browne, to the system of making judicial appointments.  I have some views on that though they are not, perhaps, as advanced as those of Deputy Dr. Browne.  It is the method of appointment about which we are worried.  The reason we are worried is that young people nowadays have more detached views and are inclined to question the correctness of a system which has grown up over the years, and the more so as it was in operation in the old British days.  Judicial appointments then were made by the Lord Lieutenant. Men with no legal qualifications were often put forward merely because they had served in the Army or in one of the other British services. Fortunately, that is not our system. Under our system only qualified and competent persons are selected.  The Government makes a recommendation to the President.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the view that these appointments should be handed over to the Local Appointments Commission.  Appointments of this kind can best be made by the Government.  But a Government is very often placed in an awkward position and I suggest, therefore, that there should be some kind of judicial committee to screen candidates and submit from time to time a panel of suitable people.  In practice, the present system has worked out quite well.  The men selected have been well up to standard.  They have administered justice without fear or favour and done exactly the job they were put there to do.  It is because people feel that appointments are made on the grounds of political services rendered rather than ability that there is any desire for change to an Appointments Commission.  These positions are different from those of county engineer and county secretary, or any of the other local government positions which can be dealt with adequately by the Local Appointments Commission.  I agree with the previous speaker that the Local Appointments Commission is as near being perfect as it is humanly possible to make it.  It is a body of which we should be very proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to deal with the question of Summer Time.  Public opinion generally is in favour of an extension of the Summer Time period.  During the emergency we had double Summer Time for a year and nobody was any the worse for it.  If anything, they were the better for it.  Unfortunately, in this country&mdash;for what reason, I do not know&mdash;we are inclined to start work late in the morning; we start late and we work late into the evening. That deprives the ordinary worker of the sunshine so essential to the maintenance of good health.  One way in which to get over that would be to start Summer Time on the 17th March and continue it into the middle of November.  Daylight saving would be considerable and many people, particularly urban dwellers and school children, would benefit from a health point of view.  In industry, there would be increased output and there <Col N="220" /> is a demand at the moment from all quarters for increased output.</P>
    <P>We should follow the pattern set by the American firms.  The tendency in those firms is to start work early in the morning and finish early in the evening.  One famous American industrialist makes no secret of the fact that the ordinary worker is twice as good before lunch as he is after lunch and, for that reason, he has organised his own industry in such a way that the most substantial part of the output is undertaken in the forenoon and only a negligible part of it in the afternoon. It has worked out in practice in a very important industry in this country.</P>
    <P>In the matter of farming operations, except for harvesting, there is a lot to be said for extended Summer Time. Much valuable time is wasted in the early morning and in the evenings we are inclined to work late.  Those of us who have to work indoors, of course, would gain a very marked advantage if it were possible to have Summer Time extended whereby the normal stopping time for workers would go back an hour and the period between that and bedtime would be such that the people would be able to go to the seaside or go out under the sun.  I understand there is a good deal of opinion in this country in favour of such an extension.  If it is not too late for the current year, I would ask the Minister to take it into consideration.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal very briefly with the prison service here.  It appears from newspaper reports that the staffs attached to our prisons are not altogether happy.  This is not to be wondered at.  For some reason or other the prison service here is a sort of unknown body and for years we have not worried very much about it being a contented organisation or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I said already that society depends on many things to protect it, but one of the integral parts of that protection is the operation of a proper prison service.  Our prison service has adjusted itself a good deal to modern requirements.  I am very glad to be able to congratulate the Minister and his predecessor on moving with the <Col N="221" /> times in that connection.  In the old days people were put into prisons to be punished and to be punished so severely that the attitude seemed to be to exterminate them altogether. That has gone now and it is a very good thing.  Because of human frailty people will err from time to time.  Once there is an opportunity of bringing them to justice and dealing with them, we should be prepared to be as humane as we possibly can.</P>
    <P>I feel we are asking very much of the personnel attached to these prisons, from the governor down to the small men.  They work in very uncongenial surroundings and they work very long hours.  I noticed recently a newspaper report of some staff organisation meeting where a good deal of complaint was made in regard to rates of pay and comparisons were made between the rates of remuneration these people are in receipt of as against those in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have gone to the trouble of making inquiries and I find out that this is correct.  The average week worked by our officials is between 52 and 54 hours and the minimum week here is one of 48 hours without any half-day.  In Northern Ireland the opposite number to the man in this part of the State works a 42 hour week minimum.  However, he has an option to work an extra six hours for which he gets a very high rate of remuneration.  He has a further option to work another six hours for which he is paid more again.  The basic wage of an ordinary prison officer here&mdash;I take it he would be an established warder&mdash;for a 48 hour week would be around £8, and for the same 48 hour period in Northern Ireland the same man can earn £12.</P>
    <P>That is something of which I would like the Minister to take notice.  The prison staffs here should be treated in no less generous way than the other members of State services.  Many years ago, I understand, in the British time the prison officers here were on parity with the then police force.  However, in recent years they have &ldquo;slipped down&rdquo;.  The police force at present are above the rate of prison officers.</P>
    <P>It is very satisfactory to know that <Col N="222" /> our prisons are now staffed almost entirely by Irishmen.  Evidently when the service was taken over from the British it was necessary to take over part of the old staffs also.  We have a very loyal co-operative staff.  From what I am told by people who have to come into contact with them occasionally, on the whole they are as considerate as can be.  Often they have to work seven days a week.  There is a certain amount of night work and sometimes when there are rush periods the number of hours they have to be on duty often goes up to 70.  Some rest arrangement is made when that takes place, but generally speaking their hours are too long.  It should be possible to organise the system in such a manner that we could reduce the average working hours per week of these staffs down to the level of other State officers, particularly those employed in comparable employment.  I would ask the Minister to take note of that and perhaps he will be able to do something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one matter to which I should like to bring the Minister's attention.  Reference has been made here to juvenile delinquency and a number of suggestions have been made as to how that problem might be dealt with.  There are two factors which may have an influence as far as children are concerned.  They are films and reading material.</P>
      <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister the method of certification of films such as is practised in other countries. This means that a child can attend a film if it is suitably certified but otherwise a child can attend only when accompanied by an adult.  That happens in Great Britain where films are so certified.  It would be somewhat of a safeguard in this country if more responsibility were put on parents who feel their children should see films of the type more suitable for general viewing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other factor is in regard to the censorship of publications.  This would embrace books and other reading material considered unsuitable.  I do not know whether it is practicable or not, but I should like to ask this question. <Col N="223" /> I know that publications which offend in this respect are listed as such in the official gazette, but in the ordinary way the public are not aware of the existence of such journals.  Would it be possible to make the public, and particularly parents, aware of the fact that such publications have offended in this respect?  In that way they would be able to guard against the possibility of these publications falling into the hands of young people.</P>
    <P>In regard to the general Vote, I believe we could have more co-operation from the people generally with the Garda.  We have not any serious crime and people generally are favourable to the Garda, but there still remains the tendency not to co-operate as fully as they might.  Our newspapers and everybody in public life might do more to encourage people to co-operate more fully with the authorities who are given the task of enforcing the law.</P>
    <P>One matter mentioned in regard to the Garda was their treatment and interrogation of young people.  A view was expressed that they sometimes do not act as they ought.  From what experience I have had with regard to this matter, I must say the Guards have always been very, very scrupulous in their approach to the questioning of young people.  I have never heard of any complaint that they exceeded what would be expected of them in this matter.  They are doing an excellent job in that respect.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary way, our system of justice is working in a satisfactory manner.  If there is not any grave or serious outbreak of crime, there is some crime of the lesser type.  We might get over that with more co-operation from the people generally. The officers who have to enforce law and order are to be congratulated on their standard of behaviour.</P>
    <P>The only two points that I wished to make were in regard to the question of certification of films suitable for young people and the question as to whether it might be possible to list objectionable books or periodicals so that parents might be aware of the danger.</P>

      <P>I view this Estimate with a great sense of disappointment. Every local authority has received circulars from Ministers impressing upon them the need for economy.  We were informed some time ago that there would be economies in the Civil Service.  In this Estimate we find, not a reduction, but an increase of £150,000.  We find that the headquarters staff, with one fewer, is costing £5,000 more.  We find that the cost of the Garda Síochána is up by £141,000.  I do not think the country is so unruly that it requires such a large amount of money to keep it in order.  At present, Ministers should see what they can do with regard to paring down the cost of their Departments.  The people are entitled to a good example from the Government in that respect when they are urging other people to save.</P>
      <P>My main complaint in regard to the Department is its inactivity.  This House, some two years ago, set up a commission, which was generally welcomed in the House and by the public, to inquire into the liquor laws and to make recommendations.  These recommendations have been in the hands of the Minister and his Department for a considerable number of months.  The Department of Justice, more than any other Department, should realise and have brought home to them the complete contempt that the general public have for the present unjust licensing laws.  As a member of that commission, I know that not one single witness urged that the present licensing laws should be continued.  Everybody agreed on the urgency of change.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is out of place for a Deputy to call attention to the fact that the public are paying £80,000 odd to 103 persons on a headquarters staff who have got a document, which cost the taxpayers money, from a commission set up by this <Col N="225" /> House and are gloriously inactive about it.</P>
      <P>It is 14 or 15 years since I brought into this House legislation to rectify the licensing laws because at that time I realised that the laws were unjust and in contempt.  I had the very enlightening experience of seeing teams of men marching around the Lobbies here to vote against opening the rural public houses and giving justice to the rural people on Sundays and, the following month, marching in the opposite direction to see that the city houses remained open.</P>
      <P>A number of years have passed and the licensing laws have not improved so far as the general public are concerned.  If one were to mention a licensing law in any rural parish, one would be laughed out of it because even the Garda have come to realise that these laws have gone by the board, that they are unjust and cannot be enforced.</P>

      <P>I am calling the attention of the House on this Estimate to the fact that we are paying some £80,000 to a headquarters team who, several months ago, received the decision of a commission set up by the House on the licensing laws and have not taken any action since.  We expect work from those we pay and we expect that reports of commissions set up by the House should be acted upon by the Department concerned.  We are paying some few million pounds to the Garda Síochána.  They have their regulations and laws to carry out.  They know those laws are unjust.  Everybody in the country knows that the laws are unjust.  One would expect that the first thing that would be done when the report of the commission arrived in the Department of Justice would be immediately to investigate it and to bring in legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a word about the enforcement of law here and elsewhere.  There seems to be a namby-pamby approach to it.  People talk about juvenile deliquency and when damage is done or a crime committed there is no punishment.  We should forget about the people who approach these matters in an abstract way.  If people break the law they should be punished.  Cases have been brought to my attention of people being almost beaten to death but the culprits were merely fined and let go.  I have seen a Garda's uniform insulted and rolled in the dust and, when the case came to court, the man charged said he did not kick the Guard in the face; he missed him.  Very severe penalties should be imposed where Gardaí are assaulted.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy said the courts should be careful before finding guilty a man charged with being drunk in charge of a car.  My experience is that the courts are very careful and go to great trouble to make sure of the facts.  They are prepared to give the benefit of the doubt and I am glad that for some time past both the present Government and the former Government have ensured that where driving licences are suspended or revoked as a result of drunken driving these licences are not restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some incorrigibles do not worry about going to prison; they go as to an hotel.  I feel if people break the law they should be made pay for it. When we speak of criminals who <Col N="227" /> should be specially catered for or cases that should be psychologically treated, we are really dealing with a very small minority.  We should protect the great majority of ordinary respectable citizens and make it possible for them to come home from theatres or cinemas without being assaulted or black-guarded by unruly elements.</P>
    <P>I seldom agree with Deputy Corry, but I would say it is now time that the findings of the commission set up in regard to the licensing laws should be implemented and revised legislation introduced.  Closing public houses on St. Patrick's Day is ridiculous and it is worse to say the law closes them.  It does not, and thank God there is that much elasticity about it.</P>
    <P>In regard to traffic controls, Dublin draws great crowds for big matches at Croke Park or Lansdowne and even when there is a big race meeting at Fairyhouse or elsewhere in the vicinity. There should be more mobile patrols on the road and greater severity should be shown in dealing with motorists travelling to and from these sports fixtures who do not comply with the law.  Too often one finds oneself unwittingly involved in a desperate road race.  Coming from the South to this House between two and three o'clock when there is racing at the Curragh, one faces traffic coming round bends in bunches.  I have often seen six, eight or ten cars bunched together, all dashing to get there for the first race, even though the majority when they arrive go straight to the bar and do not even see the first race or have a bet on it.</P>
    <P>I had the misfortune to come upon two or three accidents on these roads. It is a pity these scenes could not be filmed, a pity some people who drive cars recklessly could not see the effects of these accidents, the effects of careless driving.  I would advocate more road patrols.  Even though Deputy Corry regretted the Department is costing more money, I believe the Garda Síochána is under-staffed.  In the average Irish town or city very few Gardaí are on patrol at night and anything may happen.  One Deputy <Col N="228" /> suggested a check should be made on people entering cars after late dances and I agree with that.  The tale of the man standing at the car door saying: &ldquo;Help me in; I will be all right when I get in; I can drive then&rdquo; is not a funny story.  It is a fact.</P>
    <P>We are now approaching the holiday season and more patrols should be sent out to make the roads safer for the majority.  I would ask the Minister, as I asked his predecessor, to ensure that people who had licences suspended or revoked for a serious breach of the traffic laws should not get those licences restored but should suffer the punishment meted out by the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well appreciate the feelings of Deputies following my disclosure of the fact that the number of indictable offences has increased by about 12 per cent.  My appreciation of Deputies' feelings in that respect was measured by my own sense of disappointment&mdash; I might almost say shock&mdash;when I first read the Commissioner's interim report on crime during the year 1957.  My disappointment was not alleviated in any respect on making a closer examination of what the figures revealed.  I found that the figure of 14,322 indictable offences was an increase over the previous year of 1,540.</P>
      <P>On examining it still further I found that the figures for 1956 showed an increase of 1,251 over the figures for 1955.  These figures, unfortunately, show a continuous tendency to rise over the past three years.  As I pointed out in my opening statement, the bulk of these offences occured in the Dublin Metropolitan District where the offences have risen to 8,750 in 1957 from 7,120 in 1956, a rise of 1,630.  The figures for 1956 show an increase of 787 over those for 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a situation which, in my opinion, calls for considerable thought. I am quite prepared to accept the fact that the Minister for Justice is responsible to this House for the preservation of law and order, but, in accepting that responsibility, I do not want Deputies to sit back in complacency after having made their criticisms in regard to the situation with which we <Col N="229" /> now find ourselves confronted.  This situation is the responsibility, not only of every public representative in this country but, in my opinion, is the responsibility of every organised section of the community.</P>
    <P>We are confronted here with the situation in which we see crime of a dishonest character developing.  Thanks be to God, we are not in the situation which we see in other countries in which life is held cheaply and where that type of crime is very much more in advance of anything we have in this country.  However, we cannot feel that we are doing all that is possible to prevent the development of this type of crime unless we, as a people, do something about it.  The organised sections of our people can, perhaps, do more through their various societies, than can the mass of the people acting independently.</P>
    <P>It is my feeling that I should appeal to all sections of the community to combine in making it much more difficult for this type of crime to be committed than it seems to be at the present moment.  I feel that the approach to the effort to bring about a reduction of crime can be started in the home.  There can be no doubt that during the child's formative years is the best time to inculcate into them the right line of conduct.  That can be continued when the child reaches the age at which it goes to school.  When the child does go to school the teacher can co-operate to a very great extent in furthering that effort.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to the House that the Ten Commandments, which are the guiding rule of all Christians, are being openly ignored by the young men who are carrying out these robberies of one kind or another. The Seventh Commandment which tells us: &ldquo;Thou shalt not steal&rdquo; and the Tenth Commandment which tells us: &ldquo;Thou shalt not covet they neighbours' goods&rdquo;, which every generation of our people respected as the rules which guided their life, now seem to be held in complete disregard.  It is because of that complete disregard that I am making this appeal now, not only to the ordinary member of the community but also to the clergy of all denominations. <Col N="230" /> I think this is a situation which we must all take note of.  We must all co-operate in endeavouring to bring about some alleviation in that situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, in the course of his speech, referred to this question of the increase in crime.  It is unfortunately true, as I have said, that there has been a very substantial increase in crime, crime which is being committed mainly in Dublin, and in the larger towns, but not to any great extent in rural Ireland.  In Dublin alone there have been over 1,000 bicycles stolen.  These are being stolen, not from capitalists, but from unfortunate men who use them as a means of transporting themselves to their places of employment.  Yet there are some groups here who are organised for the special purpose of stealing bicycles.  The Gardaí regard the detection of that particular type of crime as the most difficult of all they are confronted with.  I made an appeal, in the course of my opening speech, to the general public to take some action in respect of the protection of their own property.  Some Deputies appear to think that such a suggestion should not be made, that it is the duty of the authorities to provide that protection. However, the authorities can only provide that limited type of protection that operates after the detection of a crime.  Detection of crime is not a cure for crime.  The only cure is its prevention. If, for instance, motorists go around parking their cars in by-ways and leaving, as we very often see, valuable property in their cars and leaving it in such a position that it is easily stolen, then I do not see how the Gardaí can be blamed in respect of the property which has been taken away.</P>
    <P>I did also advocate that large business concerns should provide themselves with watchmen during the hours of darkness as a further means of providing protection for the valuable property that is often contained in its premises, property sometimes worth tens of thousands of pounds, and yet it is not regarded as a good economy to provide a watchman who would be always on the premises during those <Col N="231" /> hours of darkness and who would be in a position to raise the alarm in the event of any attempt being made to burgle the premises.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that motorists, cyclists, owners of business premises and concerns of that type should do everything possible to make it more difficult for these criminals to take the public's property.  If they would do that I think I would be in a position, if I was here next year, to be able to say to the House that the number of indictable crimes had considerably decreased.  I do not think I or any other Minister who would occupy this position would be in a position to say that so long as this looseness in regard to their own personal property exists among members of our community.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also asked why there was a drop of 1,000 in the Garda strength.  The fall of approximately 1,000 in the strength of the force over the past ten years has been made possible, first, by reduced opening hours for the smaller Garda stations. This was initiated in 1950 and was later extended.  At present these stations are open only for a limited time and instead of what was happening heretofore, when an unfortunate Garda was regarded as being on duty for a period of 24 hours, they are now working nearer to the eight-hour day than they have been in the past.  That is as it should be.  It is true to say, as somebody said in the House, that a Garda is always regarded as being on duty.  A Garda naturally will always make himself available if he is suddenly informed in the course of the night that something is happening somewhere; he will go there and do what he can to look into and examine the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also suggested that we should endeavour to simplify court procedure.  As a layman I would be prepared to agree with Deputy McGilligan in what he says in regard to the simplification of the complexities of legal procedure as well as to the reduction of costs.  All that sounds to me to be pure common sense and if it could be brought about I certainly would be very glad to see it done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> The same Deputy suggested something that has been voiced on a number of occasions&mdash;I am not sure whether it was to my predecessor or the predecessor of the Minister for Local Government&mdash;the possibility of imposing fines on the spot.  It has been suggested that a policeman, especially with respect to motor offences, could, in the simple cases, such as parking offences, traffic offences of one kind or another, deal with the case summarily, that is, on the spot, and say to the culprit: &ldquo;You are fined 5/-&rdquo; and there and then give him a receipt for the 5/- and the matter would be ended.  As Deputy McGilligan suggested, much of the difficulty and expense that occurs in court would be eliminated.  I could, of course, see certain dangers to that. I could see possible dangers of perhaps corruption developing as a result of the adoption of a system whereby on-the-spot fines could be operated. Whether it would be a dangerous thing to adopt or not is something that would require very mature consideration.</P>
    <P>The question of the Solicitors' Remuneration General Order, 1957, was also raised by Deputy McGilligan. He was anxious to know why it was dealt with in the Seanad rather than in the Dáil.  I think I pointed out since, that the Dáil would not assemble at that time and that we took advantage of the fact that the Seanad was meeting to bring it within what we then believed was the limited period of time within which we could have this case dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also asked about law reform.  I can tell the House that there is no let-up at all on endeavouring to provide for additional law reform.  With my very limited experience in the Department, I can see that law reform will be a very slow process and unless it is dealt with by some other means than those which are operating at present, I cannot see that we will be very much further advanced by this time next year.  I do know that there are a number of proposals in the Department which are nearing completion but they have to be examined by the Government before they can be submitted to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> It did occur to me on a number of occasions when I was looking into this question that a more expeditious manner of dealing with complete law reform would be to establish some kind of semi-permanent salaried board of expert law officers with drafting qualifications, and so on, that could sit more or less semi-permanently examining the types of law that need reform.  From that point of view I believe greater expendition will be ensured because Bills would be drafted much more quickly than they are at the moment since they sometimes have to take their place in a long queue in the Draftsman's office.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also was rather worried about the situation which has arisen as a result of the judgement recently given by the Supreme Court in relation to the Solicitors Act, 1954. I met a deputation from the Incorporated Law Society recently and I gave that deputation an assurance that, as far as I was concerned, I would make every possible effort to see that the situation which had arisen as a result of that judgment would be dealt with as quickly and as efficiently as possible.  There will have to be some means of dealing with the situation from the point of view of indemnifying the society if any very grave difficulties arise.  The matter is under consideration and we hope to reach a decision as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also asked if I had received any reports from the Court Rule Making Committees.  I have not had any reports from them. He also put forward the novel suggestion that recording machines should be provided in the courts instead of keeping to the old system of taking down evidence in longhand.  He described his own experience in that connection; he said he practically suffered with the unfortunate writer taking these longhand notes for hours at a time. He suggested that machines should be installed to take such evidence.  I suppose such a record could not be disputed since the actual voice of the individual concerned would be played back, but there might be difficulties in relation to interruptions and so forth, which would not be discernible on the <Col N="234" /> record.  I do not know how a court would regard that kind of evidence or whether a judge would be prepared to accept it.</P>

      <P>Of course, we shall investigate all the suggestions.  Deputy McGilligan made that suggestion and I thought it a novel one.  I also thought it might be feasible but, on thinking it over, it seemed to me that interruptions would cause a lot of difficulty.  For instance, a recording machine here might be a very accurate way of recording a debate but, when we start hurling remarks at one another across the House, I do not know what would happen to the record.  The report would be rather jumbled, I should think.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan suggested, too, that court offices should be staffed during the vacation, or over a substantial period of it, to enable payments to be made.  That is something with which, of course, the Deputy is very conversant.  I do not know very much about it.  I did not know that the offices closed during the vacation.  Deputy McGilligan seems to think that they do and that it is not quite the thing; we are looking into that and having the position examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Everett mentioned the increase of £140,000 in the Garda Estimate. That is mainly due to the increase in pensions&mdash;I mentioned that in my opening statement&mdash;and to the provision of cars, necessary replacements, plus 31 additional patrol cars to complete the programme of one car for every district.  It is hoped, as a result of the provision made in this Estimate, to have that programme completed this year.  If it is, it will be <Col N="235" /> possible to meet the requests made by a number of Deputies to have roads patrolled at peak traffic periods, such as race meetings, football matches and so forth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett also complained that there were too many officers in Garda headquarters.  The headquarters strength was recently examined by a firm of management consultants and certain reductions have already been made in the strength as a result of the consultants' reports.  It is expected that further economies will be achieved when the recommendations are fully implemented.  Already, as a result of the economies effected, the cost of engaging these efficiency experts has been offset.  From that point of view, the position is eminently satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey mentioned the necessity for a new Garda station at East Wall.  I can see good reasons for that.  There are vast properties in the area, tremendous stores holding valuable goods of one kind or another, goods liable to be pilfered and so on. Because of the increasing congestion as a result of new housing, the Garda authorities, at the request of some of the residents in the area, sent patrol cars to cruise around pretty continuously&mdash;I am not sure if the system is still in operation&mdash;and there was an immediate and considerable decrease in the activities of those people who were causing disruption.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin suggested that the State should provide free legal aid. That is a matter that has been brought up from time to time.  The general attitude of various Governments to it has been that free legal aid should not be supplied by the State and that the ordinary taxpayers should not be asked to provide, as they would have to provide, free legal aid.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also suggested that the form of &ldquo;Your Worship&rdquo; and such formal addresses should be discontinued and that the mere use of the word &ldquo;sir&rdquo; should suffice instead.  It is the Rule Making Committee that makes the orders governing the mode <Col N="236" /> of address and I can do nothing about it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also suggested that there should be grading of films.  That is a very debatable question.  A lot of people think along those lines and quite a number of people believe that there should be grading of films, that films should be marked for adults only and those under certain ages should not be admitted.  The general tendency as far as the authorities are concerned is that a film not suitable for a child should not be regarded as suitable for an adult.  I think we could leave it at that.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also spoke with very great feeling about the question of landlords getting what he described as &ldquo;key money.&rdquo;  I am informed that &ldquo;key money&rdquo; or premiums on the granting of a tenancy are illegal and may be recovered by the tenant.  The Deputy may have been referring to deposits as security for rent.  These are not illegal provided they are returnable, less any rent owing, at the end of the tenancy.  The Conroy Commission recommended that a ceiling be put on deposits as security for rent. As far as Deputy Sherwin is concerned, he could advise those people who appear to have been complaining to him that anything in the nature of acceptance of key money is illegal and any persons who paid such key money are in a position to recover it if they are prepared to go to law.</P>
    <P>In regard to landlords charging excessive prices for furniture, I am informed that a landlord who requires an incoming tenant to pay a grossly excessive price for furniture may be caught by the prohibition on key money but no complaints have been made to the Department in regard to this particular practice.  I presume that that applies to landlords who are endeavouring to set flats with some form of furniture in them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also suggested that certain landlords were refusing to accept rent from their tenants and that after a time the tenants found, because of the landlords' refusal to accept rent, the arrears had grown to such an extent that they were unable <Col N="237" /> to pay.  They were then in the position that they could be ejected.  I would advise Deputy Sherwin to advise his clients that, instead of utilising the money the landlords refused, they should put it into the Post Office or into a bank so that it would be always at hand.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sherwin also complained that a man who was interned in the Curragh Camp and who lived alone, had his house raided by the Gardaí and searched without a warrant while he was interned.  I am informed that that is not the situation at all.  What happened was that the house was broken into by some scoundrels who knew that the man was away.  They burgled the house in his absence and the man who was holding the key for the man who was interned went to the Gardaí and told them what had happened.  The Gardaí accompanied the man to the house, saw what had happened and took whatever precautions they decided necessary. But there was no truth in the statement that the house was raided deliberately by the Gardaí while the man was away.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin also suggested that wine licences for the sale of wine in restaurants late at night should be issued.  That is a dangerous suggestion. I am told that a number of places in the city are in fact selling wine&mdash; probably they have some kind of wine licence&mdash;not only during licensing hours but also in the hours after the time they should be doing so.  Any addition to that situation would be dangerous and unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Giles complained that there was discrimination in the raiding of licensed premises.  I get complaints from time to time in regard to that and I usually go to the trouble of having them investigated.  The reports usually show that practically every licensed premises in the particular area referred to has been raided from time to time and that there is no particular discrimination against one <Col N="238" /> licensed premises over another.  If the Deputy has any specific complaint I would be glad to get it and have it investigated as I have had the others investigated.</P>
    <P>Throughout the debate a number of Deputies put forward the suggestion that a lot of the increase in crime was due to the leniency with which the courts deal with these cases.  I have seen myself examples of individuals charged with serious offences where the courts seemed to be satisfied that a suspensory sentence or something of that kind was sufficient.  All I can say to the Deputies who raised that question, including Deputy Giles, is that the courts are completely and entirely independent of the Minister for Justice or any other individual and therefore they can deal with these cases in accordance with their own views and beliefs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles also advocated the release of internees.  I do not quite know what he means and whether he suggests that we should open the gates and let them out.  There is, as Deputies know, a means by which every internee who wants to leave the precincts of the Curragh Camp can do so. He can give an undertaking that he will observe the laws of the State. In agreeing to take that undertaking, we are taking a certain risk.  We are saying &ldquo;we are prepared to accept your word that you will respect the laws of the State&rdquo;.  The internee having given us that undertaking, we are quite prepared to release him.  I do not think that we can be expected, or that we should be asked, to go any further than that.  In addition to that, if the internee is not satisfied to sign, if he thinks that he is wrongly interned, he can appeal to the Detention Commission and I have no doubt whatever in my mind that the commission will deal with the case absolutely and entirely on its merits.  If the man's release should be recommended by the commission, as far as the Government is concerned the man is released and that is the end of it.</P>
    <P>The question of itinerants was raised consistently by a number of Deputies. Deputy Dillon has raised that question also on a number of occasions.  As a matter of fact, it was following a very <Col N="239" /> strong case which Deputy Dillon made, I think, on last year's Estimate, that I went into this particular question. It seems that as far as the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and the Department of Local Government are concerned, the problem in regard to itinerants is insoluble.  For some time I could not see why that should be and I was challenged to suggest a remedy.  I accepted the challenge and gave the matter considerable thought.  I did think I had found a solution when I produced for the officials of the Department what I thought was an original scheme suggesting that every county should provide a certain acreage on the edge of towns of some importance and that the itinerants would be allowed to park only within the precincts of these enclosed areas.  I was told that that was an old remedy, that it had been suggested on a number of occasions, that there was nothing new about it. It was the only solution that I could find after thinking the matter out. Deputy Russell was also very concerned about the situation existing in Limerick.  All I can say is what was said to me.  If a Deputy thinks he can provide a solution for dealing with itinerants, I certainly would be very glad to have it examined.</P>
    <P>There was support for the right of itinerants to operate as they have been operating in the country.  It was suggested that they are a decent class of people, that, in the main, they are not habitually of a roving kind, that, in fact, they live for part of the year in houses, like the rest of us, but that when the good weather comes they take to the roads with their cars and that normally they are just ordinary people. I do know that they cause a considerable amount of dislocation on certain roads by reason of the positions they often take up and that their horses and very often their children are a menace and a danger to motorists and other moving traffic.</P>

      <P>As I said, there are three Departments involved and yet <Col N="240" /> none of them appears to be capable of producing a solution.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne made a statement that I am not quite clear about.  He complained that Gardaí take children from schools and even from their homes while their parents are away and question them at Garda stations.  I am told that it is contrary to practice for Gardaí to do this.  If the Deputy would send me particulars of any case where that has happened, I will have it investigated.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies made complaints about the condition of courthouses. I have seen reports in the provincial Press from time to time containing the remarks of justices and judges who have to occupy these premises making very serious complaints about them.  They have written to me on a couple of occasions.  The only thing I can say about that is that I bring these complaints to the attention of the county councils concerned. The county councils are entirely responsible for the provision of the courthouses in the first instance and for their upkeep.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond was complaining about the fact that we handed over the old Cork prison to the university authorities in Cork.  As far as I can remember, there was general agreement by the Cork Deputies on that occasion when it was decided to hand over that old building to the university authorities and I am sure that the university authorities will put it to much more useful use than any other body would do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne raised the question of the appointment of the surgeon to the Garda Síochána force. I must point out to him that the Government in making that appointment was acting as former Governments had acted because the Police Force Amalgamation Act of 1925 provides for the appointment by the Government of the Garda surgeon. The man who succeeded in securing that appointment was a senior Army officer with a very distinguished academic record and apparently suitable from every point of view.  There was no question of politics at all: it was a matter of securing a man with the <Col N="241" /> highest possible qualifications and the man selected was a senior Army officer who has been in charge of one of the largest Army institutions on the Curragh which caters for a very large body of military patients.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also complained that the promotion of senior officers in the Garda is done through some political means.  To say that he must have been completely ignorant of the manner in which senior Garda officers are promoted. First, a body of senior officers, men of rank higher than that of Chief Superintendent&mdash;Commissioners &mdash;examine the qualifications of those seeking promotion.  Their seniority is considered as well as their efficiency, and from that body recommendations go to the Commissioner and from the Commissioner to the Minister for Justice and from him to the Government. So far as I know there has never been any non-acceptance by the Government of the recommendations of the senior officers and the Commissioner. If the Deputy has been informed this is done by the Government, as he described it, for political reasons, whoever gave him that information misinformed him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne also seemed to take strong exception to the fact that we had included a figure of £40 for possible execution expenses.  That item is not new; it has been there as long as the Estimate, so far as I know. The Deputy thought it should be described by some other heading; but, as I told him, &ldquo;A rose by any other name,&rdquo; etc.  I do not think it is necessary to take any action in that respect. He also suggested that there should be some more drastic scientific test&mdash; a blood test he probably had in mind &mdash;for drunken drivers.  I doubt if that would be more effective than the test operating at present.  The Garda who makes contact with a drunken driver &mdash;these people usually finish up in some kind of an accident&mdash;and finds him completely and entirely incapable usually has him examined by a doctor. The doctor has no doubt whatever about it, if the man is so incapable, and there is no question of what the decision will be.  I think that is as good a test as it is possible to get.  By <Col N="242" /> the time the person who would make the blood test would arrive the man might be much more sober than when the Garda would have had him examined.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question, as did other Deputies, of the licensing laws.  These are under examination at present and when the examination is completed a memorandum will be prepared for the Government and submitted to the Government for decision. I should point out that the commission which dealt with the matter sat for, I think, a year and then produced a majority report and quite a number of minority reports, so that there seems to have been a considerable division of opinion.  There was not apparently the unanimity that would suggest there was an easy solution to this very difficult problem.  When the Government makes a decision on what they will submit to the House they will have to consider this and I am certain when the legislation does reach this House the same difference of opinion will exist here as existed in the commission. A number of questions on <i>bona fide</i> drinking and so on were raised, but as all these come under the licensing laws they can be dealt with when that discussion takes place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne suggested that juvenile delinquents should get psychiatric treatment.  Actually that is given at present; any district justice dealing with children's cases can call for the services of a psychiatrist.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell and others referred to dangerous driving on the roads and seemed to think that the Garda authorities were lax in that respect.  There is no speed limit here and a man may be driving at what appears to be an excessive speed on the main roads but he may at the same time be in complete control of his vehicle.  It may not be as dangerous as an onlooker might presume.  Until such time as we get down to having driving tests and perhaps a speed limit there is very little the Gardaí can do about this matter.</P>
    <P>All these different matters that have been raised by Deputies and upon which I may not have touched will be <Col N="243" /> carefully examined by me as a result of the reading up by my officials of the reports of the debates.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell suggested that it was wrong to send Gardaí who are speakers of Donegal Irish into Kerry, that the Kerry dialect is vastly different from the Donegal dialect.  I should have imagined myself, and I am not an Irish speaker, that the right thing would be to make that kind of exchange so that Gardaí would become intimately acquainted with the various dialects that do exist.  We know ourselves, when we are speaking to a 100 per cent.  Corkman or 100 per cent.  Belfast citizen, that we find considerable difficulty in understanding what they are saying in the English language.  I presume that the same would obtain in the speaking of the Irish language.  It would appear to me that it would be a very good thing to move Irish-speaking Gardaí around in that fashion so that they can become acquainted with all the dialects.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moloney has raised several points which we shall have examined.  I do not think we would be justified in having the retiring age for the Gardaí higher than it is.  It was originally fixed at 57 and it has been raised from time to time until it is now 63.  Recruits who are coming in now are being limited to 57 years except in certain circumstances where the Commissioner, having satisfied himself that it is in the interests of the efficiency of the force to do so, can extend the age limit to 62 years, with the approval of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>I personally should not like to ask a man of 63 years of age, and Deputy Moloney suggests 68, to participate in a street riot or something of that nature.  I doubt very much if he would be able to protect himself, much less the ordinary citizen.  In having an age limit of 63 years, we have been sufficiently generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moloney also suggests a reduction in the number of chief <Col N="244" /> superintendents.  That is a matter that can be examined.  He suggested that by an amalgamation of a number of counties we could reduce the number of chief superintendents.  We will also have that matter examined to see if there is anything in it, and, if there is, it will add a further economy.</P>
    <P>He also suggested an extension of summer time and appeared to praise the period when we had double summer time.  That was in a period of emergency and we had double summer time for the purpose of saving fuel and electricity.  At the present time summer time is operating during the same hours as it does in England.  That serves a very useful purpose from the point of view of business generally, including post office business.  I think it would be a retrograde step to go out on our own and add another hour to summer time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moloney also made a complaint with regard to pay of prison officers.  The pay of prison officers was fixed by arbitration in 1953 and their conditions of service are subject to the conciliation and arbitration machinery.  A fresh request to have their basic pay increased has been received and that will be dealt with by the arbitrator in due course.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible that I may have left out some points raised by Deputies.  If so, I want to assure them that I shall be only too happy to have them dealt with as a result of an examination of the Official Debates.</P>

    <P>Cuimhneoidh na Teachtaí go ndúras, sa ráiteas a rinne mé i dtaobh na Meastachán seo anuraidh, go ndéanfaí, a luaithe a bheadh an t-ullmhúchán chuige críochnaithe, an Ghníomhaireacht Nuachta Éireannach d'fhorceannadh agus go gcuirfí deireadh le híocaíochtaí as an Vóta.  Tá an Ghníomhaireacht forceannta anois agus, dá bhrí sin, ní bheidh gá feasta le soláthar faoin bhFo-Mhírcheann áirithe sin.</P>
    <P>An tsuim a taispeántar i leith tuarastal agus liúntas ionadaithe thar lear is lú í, de bhreis is £5,000 ná an soláthar anuraidh.  Ní hionann sin is a chur in iúl go bhfuil aon laghdú tagtha ar fhoirne na Misiún agus na gConsalacht. Ba lú de sholáthar a dhéanfadh cúis anuraidh mar gheall ar thosca áirithe, mar atá folúntais shealadacha i bpoist áirithe thar lear, oifigigh a bheith as láthair go sealadach as na tíortha dá rabhadar creidiúnaithe agus, i gcásanna áirithe, rátaí iomlaoide níos fabharaí ná mar bhí coinne leo.  Is deacair, dar ndóigh, meas cruinn a thabhairt roimh ré ar mar tharlódh tosca den tsórt sin in imeacht bliana.  Cé go gcaithfidh duine alúntas a dhéanamh i leith earráide, meastar go mbeidh sáith sa tsoláthar atá a dhéanamh anois faoin bhFo-Mhírcheann seo.</P>
    <P>Is deacair freisin a rá go cruinn roimh ré cén caiteachas a bhainfeadh le postas, páipéarachas, telegrama agus telefóin in oifigí thar lear mar tagann athruithe ar an méid a bhíos na seirbhísí sin ag teastáil.  Tá an tsuim laghdaithe a taispeántar sna Meastacháin bunaithe ar na sonraí atá ar fáil i dtaobh an ráta chaiteachais anuraidh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> Tá méadú ar an Meastachán i leith Tuarastal, Páighe agus Liúntas sa Cheann-Oifig mar gheall ar ghnáthmhéaduithe ar bhreis-thuarastail na foirne bunaithe.</P>
    <P>Sa bhliain seo caite, ba lú de chuid mhaith an Meastachán le haghaidh costas taistil na foirne thar lear ná an méid a chosain sé, is é sin, £12,000.  Tá méadú cuíosach mór ar an Meastachán faoin bhFo-Mhírcheann seo mar gheall air sin agus mar gheall ar gur dóigh freisin go mbeidh costas ag gabháil le hoifigigh d'aistriú, oifigigh ionaid a sholáthar agus oifigigh a ligean abhaile ar saoire.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh an Meastachán le haghaidh Abhair Eolais don bhliain seo £8,000 a laghdú ó £10,000 i 1956-57 go dtí £7,000 i 1957-58.  D'aontaigh an tAire Airgeadais go gcuirfí £1,000 ar ais i mbliana leis an laghdú de £3,000 a rinneadh anuraidh ar an Meastachán seo.</P>
    <P>Lasmuigh de na príomh ítimí méaduithe agus laghduithe atá luaite, tá mion-athruithe freisin i gcomórtas leis an mbliain seo caite faoi thrí FhoMhírcheann eile&mdash;Caiteachais Teagmhasacha agus Éireannaigh Dhealbha sa Choigrích a Thabhairt ar Ais agus a Chothabháil.  Chífear ó na hathruithe i ngach cás go bhfuil iarracht déanta ar an méid a meastar a caithfí a dhéanamh amach as an eolas a ráinig dúinn le déanaí.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Meastachán le haghaidh Comhair Eadarnáisiúnta (Vóta 60), £97,970 atá ar leith don Mheastachán seo, sin glanmhéadú £26,400 ar shuim na bliana seo caite. Airítear an tsuim seo de thoradh méaduithe faoi roinnt mhaith Fo-Mhírcheann agus laghduithe beaga faoi dhá Fho-Mhírcheann.  Is é cúis is mó leis an méadú go bhfuil Fo-Mhírcheann nua curtha san áireamh le haghaidh £16,500 i gcomhair Ranníoca i leith Fórsa Éigeandála na Náisiún Aontaithe. Meabhróidh Teachtaí gur déileáladh leis an ní seo cheana trí dhá Mheastachán Fhorliontacha&mdash;ceann sa Mhárta, 1957, i leith íocaíochta £6,810 agus ceann roimh shos na Cásca ar £4,750 faoi chomhair íocaíochta £6,750 in aghaidh na bliana 1957-58.  Nuair a bhí an Dáil ag vótáil na Meastachán Forlíontach sin d'aon-ghuth, chuireadar in iúil gur aontaíodar leis an tír seo do leanúint <Col N="250" /> de ranníoc a dhéanamh le haghaidh cothabhála an Fhórsa.  Tá an Meastachán bunaithe ar an dóigh gur $25,000,000 an costas iomlán a bhainfeas leis an bhFórsa sa bhliain airgeadais agus go mbeifear ag súil go ndéanfaidh Stát-Chomhaltaí ranníoc do réir an scála ranníoc a bhaineas le Cáinfhaisnéis na Náisiún Aontaithe.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na méaduithe eile sa Vóta seo, tá trí cinn acu, dar comhshuim £4,500 tar éis tarlachtaint mar gheall ar ranníoca níos airde i leith na dtrí Eagras lena mbaineann an Vóta&mdash; Comhairle na hEorpa, an tEagras um Chomhar Eacnamaíochta san Eoraip agus na Náisiúin Aontaithe.  Tá na ranníoca déanta amach ó na Stát-Chomhaltaí uile do réir chéatadáin áirithe de Cháinfhaisnéisí na nEagras, nó beagán faoi nó thairis.  Tá méaduithe ar na Meastacháin toisc Cáinfhaisnéisí níos airde do bhaint le gach ceann acu.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú cuíosach mór (móide £3,250) sa Mheastachán i leith costas taistil i ndáil leis an Eagras um Chomhar Eacnamaíochta san Éoraip. Tá dhá chúis leis seo.  Is é an chéad uair é go bhfuil costais taistil oifigeach ó gach Roinn a fhreastalas an tEagras um Chomhar Eacnamaíochta san Eoraip á n-áireamh sa Vóta seo.  Ina theannta sin, toisc an-tsaothar a bheith ar siúl ag an Eagras um Chomhar Eacnamaíochta san Eoraip ar an mbeartaíocht le haghaidh Limistéir Saor-Thrádála, ba ghá foirne cuíosach láidir ó na Ranna Eagsúla a bheith i láthair go minic i bParis.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, tá méadú céad faoin gcéad, nó £1,825 an ceann le sonrú sna ranníoca atá le tabhairt do Chiste Leanaí na Náisiún Aontaithe agus do Chlár Cabhrach Teicniúil na Náisiún Aontaithe.  Fé mar a míníodh faoi na Mírchinn faoi seach (leathanach 357) tugann an Ciste sin cabhair airgid ar mhaithe le sláinte leanaí i gcoda bochta den domhan agus bheireann an ceann eile cabhair theicniúil do límistéirí neamh-fhorbartha.  Bhí ár ranníoca féin sa bhliain airgeadais seo caite íseal sa dá chás seo i gcomórtas leis na ranníoca ó thíoctha eile atá sa chás chéanna linn féin, geall leis, agus níos ísle ná mar bhíodar blianta eile.  Mar gheall air sin socraíodh go n-ardófaí iad an méid a taispeántar sna Meastacháin.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na laghduithe a bhaineas <Col N="251" /> beagán d'ualach an mhéaduithe sa Vóta seo, tagann siad sin ó laghdú ar chostais taistil i ndáil le Comhairle na hEorpa agus costais teagmhasacha ag na Náisiúin Aontaithe; is ísle de £745 agus de £800 na costais sin faoi seach i mbliana.  Tá an chéad laghdú thuas bunaithe ar an eolas atá le fáil i dtaobh na gcruinnithe éagsúla maidir le Comhairle na hEorpa is cosúil a bheas ann i mbliana&mdash;an Comhthionóil Comhairlitheach agus a chuid Coistí, an Coiste Airí agus Coistí Saineolaithe. Airítear sa Mhírcheann do chostais teagmhasacha ag na Náisiúin Aontaithe costas aíochta le linn Síosón an Chomhthionóil Ghinearálta, agus, de thairbhe taithí, meastar gur leor chuige an tsuim laghdaithe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister three questions.  Does the Government accept the proposition that it is in the national interests of this country to strengthen the influence of the Western democracies in the U.N.O.?  Secondly, is the Government in favour of a more neutralist position in world politics than that maintained by its predecessors?  And, thirdly, will the support that this Government will give to individual members of the U.N.O. be contingent upon whether they support this country in our efforts to end Partition?</P>
      <P>I ask these three questions in an effort to obtain from the Minister some clear idea of the Government's foreign policy.  The Minister has been remarkably silent on the affairs of his Department and on the foreign policy of this country since he went into Government.  Within the last three years he has spoken on, I think, three occasions in this country; on not one of them has he given any indication of what the foreign policy of this Government is and what principles they act on when representatives go to represent this country at international organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister at the General Assembly of the U.N.O. last year made certain proposals and voted in a certain manner&mdash;something to which we took strong exception&mdash;and because of what he said then, and because of what he did, and because of what he <Col N="252" /> had said in the previous year on this Estimate here, it appeared to us that his actions and his speeches were a manifestation of a change in the foreign policy of his predecessor.  We could only deduce from what he said, we could only infer from his actions, that a change had taken place.  We had a debate here in November of last year on the foreign policy of the Government and we suggested to him then that his actions and his speeches indicated that his Government appeared to be in favour of adopting a more neutralist position than his predecessors had done in the U.N.O. He neither confirmed nor denied that suggestion.  It is of more than academic interest that we and the country as a whole should know exactly where the Government stands in regard to the vital issues at present being debated in the world generally and where exactly our support is to be given in relation to the countries ranged on opposite sides in these issues.</P>
    <P>Last year, we had a debate in this House which took the form and pattern that this debate is taking to-night. The Minister opened his remarks and moved his Estimate in a short speech in the Irish language.  That speech did not contain one statement on Government policy.  Last year several Deputies spoke on this side of the House asking the Minister to state the Government's foreign policy.  We were interested to know it.  The country was entitled to know it.  Outside observers wished to know if there was any change.  The Minister at column 620 of Volume 163 of the Official Report replied as follows to the queries and requests by Deputies for elucidation of his foreign policy:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not think it is necessary for me to go into the many broad issues that have been raised here.  It is not the first time that this Parliament has debated external affairs and all the Deputies and the country know the policy upon which Fianna Fáil has acted in the past in relation to external affairs, and that is the policy upon which we propose to continue to operate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Certainly in July of last year it appeared from the Minister's statement <Col N="253" /> that he envisaged no change from what had been the policy of his Party in the past.  Something apparently happened between July and the autumn when he went to New York. We are anxious to know what change, if any, has come about in Government policy with regard to foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister's suggestions in the United Nations Assembly were debated here last November.  I do not wish to rehearse the arguments that were dealt with then but there are certain aspects of what was said then to which I wish to refer.  I do this in the light of some recent comments on the Minister's proposals for a withdrawal of troops in Europe.</P>
    <P>There is at present in European circles considerable discussion on the merits and demerits of what is generally called disengagement in Europe. There is no doubt that proposals for disengagement have had champions of very great repute and men to whose views we should listen with a degree of force and with whose point of view we may in many cases have sympathy. Similarly, the opponents to the idea of disengagement in Europe have among their members many of great integrity and honesty and political acumen to whose views we should listen.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer Deputies to a debate that took place recently in the German Parliament in which Dr. Adenauer and his Party fought strenuously for three or four days on the principle of allowing nuclear weapons to be stationed in West Germany. On many occasions since the debates on disengagement have taken place Dr. Adenauer has expressed very cogent reasons for his disagreement with them.  Similarly such people as M. Spaak, General Norstad and M. Renaud, as a representative of the French point of view, have expressed the view that disengagement proposals would, in fact, weaken the West and would be a strengthening of the Russian position.  Even such attenuated disengagement proposals as the Rapacki Plan have not met with favour in some circles, to whose views we must listen, and in this particular case their views are almost coercive on us.</P>
    <P>In yesterday's paper it appeared <Col N="254" /> that the Defence and Armament Committee of the Western European Union declared that the Rapacki plan was, in fact, a Soviet plan.  A prominent writer in a French newspaper last month described it as against peace.  We must listen to these very cogent arguments against plans, even watered down plans, for disengagement such as the Rapacki plan, and the more ambitious forms of disengagement outlined by Mr. Gaitskell and Mr. Healy of the British Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is this. What the European publicists and statesmen are arguing now about disengagement is not proposals such as the Minister for External Affairs of our country has made.  The proposals for disengagement by Mr. Gaitskell and Professor Kennan differed in one very fundamental respect from the proposal the Minister put forward at the United Nations Assembly last year. The Minister ignored completely the problem of the division of Germany in his proposals.  One of the criticisms we made of his proposals, apart from the fact of their impracticability, and apart from the fact that they were going against the declared foreign policy of Powers that had been friendly disposed to this country, was that his proposals ignored one of the vital sectors in any disengagement scheme, namely, the division of Germany.</P>
    <P>The theory behind disengagement proposals is fairly simple.  If armed forces are withdrawn, if points of friction are minimised, there is less likelihood of an outbreak of war.  It is precisely because the division of Germany is just one of the most combustible points in Europe that people such as Mr. Gaitskell and Professor Kennan have made it an integral part of their suggestions for disengagement in Europe that the plan for withdrawal of troops should also include a solution for the partition of Germany.</P>
    <P>It is no harm, in view of the fact that there has been a certain amount of misunderstanding of the disengagement proposals that are being debated at present, to point out that one of the most cogent criticisms of the Minister's proposals last year was the fact that he ignored completely this vital problem. It seemed to me that it might have <Col N="255" /> been an oversight on his part but, when questioned in the Dáil about it last year, in the debate that we had on the 23rd November, and when it was put to him that his proposals were different from Professor Kennan's and that Professor Kennan's proposals included proposals for a solution of the German problem, the Minister went again to outline his own proposals and stated: &ldquo;If that were done the unity of Germany could look after itself.&rdquo; That is from column 1220, Volume 164. of the Dáil Debates.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Government have failed to give the country an outline of where they stand in regard to the rôle we should play in the U.N.O.  It is regrettable that we do not know whether the Minister and his Government accept the three principles the inter-Party Government put forward as the three guiding principles of their actions in the United Nations Assembly.  Deputies will recall that, speaking in July of 1956, the Minister for External Affairs of the inter-Party Government announced that his Government would be motivated by three principles: firstly, that they would themselves apply the principles of the U.N.O. and see that they should be applied at every opportunity in which they would be applicable; secondly, that we should maintain a position of independence in the U.N.O. and thirdly, that we should, consistent with our position of independence, give support to the Western democracies and endeavour to strengthen the Western democracies in the U.N.O.</P>
    <P>If the Minister says that he agrees with those three principles, divisions that have appeared between us in this House concerning the foreign policy of the Government may be minimised. Our division would then be based on the fact that we regarded the application of these principles by the Government last year as being very flatfooted indeed.  If, however, he disagrees with these principles, he owes a duty to the country to inform the people of exactly what principles his Government holds should motivate their votes and their speeches in the United Nations General Assembly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> It is important for the country to know the view the Government has on the present developments in Western Europe.  It appears to me that it is in the national interest to strengthen the move for greater European unity.  The move for greater European unity has recently been given an impetus by the ratification and implementation of the Rome Treaty but it is now generally agreed that the ratification of the Rome Treaty carries dangers for the political division of Western Europe and it would be of interest to the House if the Minister had given some idea of the views of his Government on the problems which arise as a result of the creation of the Common Market and as a result of the present negotiations for a Free Trade Area.</P>
    <P>One of the political problems that will arise as a result of these developments is, to my mind, that unless the Council of Europe is greatly strengthened, it will decline into a rôle of comparative insignificance by virtue of the importance of the creation and development of the Common Market. I can envisage, if no changes are brought about, that the delegates and the Parliaments of the six countries of the Rome Treaty will regard the Assembly of the Common Market as the vitally important assembly as far as their nations are concerned and disregard, and largely ignore, the work of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>This danger to the Council of Europe and the danger of the political division in Europe are, of course, appreciated and proposals are at present in being to help avoid that, not just by the creation of a Free Trade Area but also by a reorganisation of the existing European institutions.</P>
    <P>I want to say that I am strongly in favour of the proposals for a merger of the O.E.E.C. and the Council of Europe.  I should be glad if the Minister would indicate his view on it to-day. I know that there are differences, quite strong differences, between the framework of the Council of Europe and the O.E.E.C. and there is the problem that there are two nations, Portugal and Switzerland, which are members of the O.E.E.C. and not members of the Council of Europe. <Col N="257" /> Those difficulties can be overcome and special arrangements could be made for Switzerland and Portugal so that they would be free not to participate in all the organs of an amalgamated organisation.</P>
    <P>There are coming before the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe in the next few weeks proposals for a merger of the two organisations, proposals which have got to the stage of a draft form of statute. It is very likely that both proposals will get very strong support in the Council of Europe and will be sent to the Committee of Ministers.  I would urge the Minister to realise the desirability of the drive for greater European unity and that greater European unity would be assisted by a merger of the two organisations.</P>
    <P>There are economic problems that have arisen as a result of the creation of the Rome Treaty.  I do not think this is the time to go into the negotiations that have been going on for some months with regard to the creation of a Free Trade Area around the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I should have liked if the Minister had given us his views on certain of the matters that are being debated at the present time, which appear in the Press.  In particular, the country would have been interested to know what the views of the Government were on the question of the French proposals which have appeared in the Press and which have caused so much adverse comment in Great Britain and on the Italian proposals which have recently been put forward to the Committee of Ministers of O.E.E.C. and which have been referred to an expert committee.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that these are matters which are at present being negotiated and that no strong line need be taken on them but we should be an adult assembly and we should discuss these matters.  These matters are discussed in other Parliaments and were discussed quite recently in the British House of Commons.  The fact that the French proposals are only unofficial and have not been officially made known, and the fact that the Italian proposals have been sent to an expert committee should not stop the Government <Col N="258" /> giving its views on these matters.  If they were to do so, it would assist the knowledge of the country on these difficult negotiations.</P>
    <P>A further matter that appeared recently in the Press concerning the organs of the proposed Free Trade Area was the question of majority decision in the Executive Committee of any Free Trade Area Convention that might be concluded.  It did appear from statements in the Press that a considerable victory had been won over the British point of view on this matter and it appeared that the British Government had conceded the principle that decisions on all matters in the new Free Trade Area Organisation would not have to be unanimous decisions.  In the Rome Treaty there is provision for decisions binding on all members which need not necessarily be unanimous.  So that, in fact, countries may be bound by a convention to undertake obligations against which they had themselves voted.  I should like to know whether the Irish Government would be prepared to accept such an obligation if, in fact, it was written into the Free Trade Area Convention.</P>
    <P>I put down a question to-day to the Minister concerning the advisability of an approach being made to the Rome Treaty Organisation at the present time.  I think the arguments for Ireland joining a Free Trade Area at the present time are stronger than the arguments for Ireland joining the Rome Treaty.  I feel nonetheless that we should endeavour to ascertain what type of conditions would attach to our adherence to the Rome Treaty. Luxembourg is a signatory of the Rome Treaty and she has been given favourable consideration by protocol attached to the Treaty.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that the Governments of the six would be prepared to allow other countries to adhere to the Rome Treaty if it appears that the Free Trade Area negotiations will not prove successful. I do not think it is time to start negotiations when the Free Trade negotiations themselves have broken down.  I think the time is now, and I can see no reason why approaches should not be made to the relevant organisation of the Rome Treaty <Col N="259" /> powers with a view to ascertaining how a country such as Ireland could become associated with the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Newspaper reports indicate that countries such as Austria and Denmark which are vitally affected by the Rome Treaty and who are vitally concerned that the Free Trade Area negotiations should not break down have already made approaches in Brussels with a view to seeing in what manner they could become associated with the Common Market.  I could see little to be lost by such approaches and a lot to be gained.</P>
    <P>It is customary to refer to the question of Partition when discussing external affairs and I wish to do so very briefly.  It has been made very clear by spokesmen of the Party to which I belong that we believe that the prejudices, suspicion and hostility that exist in the Six North-Eastern Counties among our fellow Irishmen against this part of the country can be diminished by active co-operation by the Governments of the two parts of the country.  In the last few years this has proved eminently successful on more than one occasion and the way to break down the barriers that exist in the minds of 750,000 people in the Six Counties is, I believe, by cooperating on as many fields as possible with them.</P>
    <P>Quite recently in January of this year a debate took place in the Seanad concerning co-operation between this part of the country and the Six Counties, and in the course of his speech in the Seanad the Taoiseach, as reported in Volume 48, No. 15, column 1416, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One point has been made &mdash; and it is a good point.  It has been asked: has there been a systematic survey of the situation and the facts to see whether, and in what direction, co-operation is possible?  That is the duty of the Departments of State. Knowing the policy of the Government as a whole, the various Ministers would naturally be interested in finding out what the possibilities were in these various directions. That side of the work will certainly be done.  The examination can take <Col N="260" /> place, and if anything of value, or anything that would seem to be of value, emerges, the present Government &mdash; and, I am sure, any Government that would be here &mdash; would be only too anxious to consider it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am anxious to know from the Minister whether any examination has taken place by the Departments of State with a view to seeing how they in their particular fields could co-operate with the Northern Ireland Government, or is that merely lip-service paid to the principle of co-operation? Have any steps been taken since January of this year in an endeavour to get the Departments of State in this part of the country to examine their various fields of activity to see where they could co-operate with their opposite numbers in the Six Counties?</P>
    <P>I do not think much can be gained by paying lip-service to the principle. We shall not break down the barriers that exist in the North by merely talking about how pleasant it would be if we could co-operate.  The work of co-operation would, of course, be a lengthy one and a long-term one but it is advisable that it should be started and started on a systematic basis.  I hope the Taoiseach in fact carried out the proposals he made in these remarks and is asking the Departments of State to find out how they can co-operate with their opposite numbers in the North.  I think we would be interested to know what progress has been made in that respect.</P>
    <P>I want to make some comments concerning the administration of the Minister's Department.  It is a fairly common criticism of the Government's administration to say that we are overloaded with civil servants.  I do not think that criticism is applicable to the Minister's Department; in fact I feel that Department is understaffed at present in many important fields.  The Minister has many expert advisers arduously engaged in various activities to which they have been assigned and in many cases the tasks they have been given should be undertaken by six persons instead of one.  Economic advantages are to be obtained from membership of the O.E.E.C.; we <Col N="261" /> should not ignore those advantages by understaffing our representation in the O.E.E.C.  Political advantages are to be gained and questions of prestige are involved in membership of the U.N.O.; yet so far as I know, there has been no increase in the staff of the Department dealing with the tremendous problems that arise from membership of that organisation.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate the criticism I made last year of the Minister's speech in moving this Estimate.  The Minister may have certain views about the Irish language and the desirability of restoring it as the vernacular, but I do not feel he should demonstrate his point of view by speaking in Irish in moving this Estimate.  In this case it does not matter very much because the people who do not know Irish have not missed very much.  The fact is, although some Deputies do not appreciate it, that a certain amount of interest is taken in our debates on foreign affairs, outside the country.</P>
    <P>There are people whose job it is to look at and read the debates that take place in national Parliaments on foreign affairs.  These people do not know Irish.  I think the Minister is doing a disservice to the country by speaking in the Irish language on the Estimate for External Affairs.  This is not like a debate on an Estimate which will be read and studied in this country only.  It is perhaps the only Estimate in which an interest is taken abroad and it does seem to me that the Minister is doing a disservice to the country by making his remarks in Irish.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that the Minister last year announced that there was no change in the foreign policy of his Government, that everybody knew it and that it was unnecessary to labour it.  Within a few months he had gone to the United Nations Assembly and raised a considerable body of criticism against this country by nations normally friendly to this country.  I trust the Minister will not repeat that performance this year.  If he does not tell us what the foreign policy of his Government is, I certainly hope that he will not ignore the Dáil as he did last year, by making no statements here and then going abroad <Col N="262" /> and creating an impression, as he did last year, about this country.  If he is going to go abroad next August and vote for a resolution favouring a discussion on Red China I think we ought to have a debate in this House in July on the desirability of such a vote.</P>
    <P>If he has any such announcement to make concerning the foreign policy of this country I suggest that he should adopt the ordinary democratic method of allowing the national Parliament to debate the matter so that we shall not be in the position of having a representative of this country going abroad making speeches and casting votes on subjects which vitally concern the country without an opportunity being given to the national Parliament to discuss the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

      <P>It was said by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, on the very day on which this Government was elected, that the policy of the Government was the best kept secret of the time.  Many months have passed since that statement was made and it as true to-day as it was then. It is not enough for the Minister to say that the whole country is aware of the policy of the Government.  The whole country is not aware of that policy and the people are very anxious to have a clarification of it.</P>
      <P>As the months go by and the mystery deepens, we look to the annual examination of the various Estimates to glean from them some idea of what is in the mind of the Government, and what they propose to do in relation to the policy of the various Departments of State.  We looked, therefore, to the Minister for External Affairs for some idea as to what the Government felt in regard to the many pressing problems that afflict the world to-day, problems that call from the various nations a realistic examination of the many dangers that face them and of the steps that should be taken to counter these dangers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister very briefly introduced his Estimate for 1958-59 and summed up by saying that in it he would explain the variations in the sub-heads as compared with the previous year. There was no more substance than that in the Minister's introductory <Col N="263" /> speech.  It is very difficult to discuss an Estimate in this House if some lead is not given on the Government side. We are indebted to Deputy Declan Costello for having made a broad statement on the situation and for having vouchsafed certain suggestions. The Minister expressed no opinion whatever.  That is very unfortunate. It is becoming a habit, and a very regrettable one, that we cannot get a line in relation to policy from the Government Benches.  Such a line would give the Opposition, and those sitting behind the Government, an opportunity of expressing an opinion as to whether a policy is right or wrong.  It is regrettable that the Minister has not indicated what the foreign policy of the Government is.</P>
    <P>The question of the Partition of this country has been brought to the fore frequently in recent times by incidents which have brought from the Government serious condemnation.  There are people who will seek to absolve the unfortunate young men who have been dragged into these activities by saying that they are doing something, whether it is right or wrong.  It is alleged by people who are apologists for that line of policy that the Government is doing nothing about Partition, that they have nothing to offer in relation to the unity of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reluctance to refer to the existence of Partition in introducing his Estimate is adding fuel to the fire that these people would seek to kindle.  It would be very helpful if the Minister would say whether or not he is in agreement with the views expressed by Deputy Declan Costello, speaking for this Party, or whether the Government proposes to do something with regard to the legitimate anxiety which the people feel in regard to these matters.  If he does not do so, it will add weight to the opinion held by very many people, who should know better, that it is up to some unauthorised people to take these matters into their own hands.</P>
    <P>Over the past year or two, many people have expressed concern at the extent of State expenditure, and if there is any Department in which they <Col N="264" /> think economies could be effected, it is the Department of External Affairs.  I think that outlook is quite wrong.  I think our Embassies are doing an excellent job of work and that our diplomats are a credit to this country. I think that, over the last quarter of a century, the manner in which our diplomats have carried out their duties has done much to raise the prestige of this country.  I think our career diplomats compare favourably with those of any small nation in the world. We cannot afford the vast diplomatic service that other nations have.  We are limited very much in what we can afford to expend in that direction but we are getting good value for what we are spending.</P>
    <P>Many of these men living abroad carrying the responsibility of representing this State have often done it under extremely adverse and difficult circumstances.  In the formative years of the State their duties were in the main directed towards advancing the recognition of this State, bringing it home to people that we were a nation entitled to self-government and still a dismembered nation, and with the continuing obligation of keeping that before the eyes of those in the various parts of the world where they were stationed.</P>
    <P>In the last few years, however, a new duty has been imposed on our missions abroad.  It is an all-important activity, the success or failure of which will react upon every home and every individual in the State, that is, in relation to how they will succeed in marketing the produce we have to sell abroad.  In recent months the Government have shown quite clearly that they are not in a happy mood in regard to our ability to market our surplus goods profitably abroad.  The Minister for Finance has recently nailed his colours to the mast in a statement with which we all agree, that the greatest economic good that could flow to the advantage of this country would be that we would have a high level of exports and as high a level of imports as that level of exports would permit the country to afford.</P>
    <P>Consequently in the years that are <Col N="265" /> ahead of us in the new situation which will be presented by our involvement in the Free Trade Area, by the advances that various other nations have made in their marketing, in their packaging and in their advertising, we are brought daily closer to the challenge which is there to be met.  We have to look to our representatives abroad to ensure that we will be informed at home of what is necessary here to meet that challenge and that they in their various locations will lose no opportunity to secure for us markets of which our competitors are only too anxious to avail, even markets where we stand well to-day and from which our competitors would be very anxious to oust us.  Therefore, we have to defend the markets we have and try to secure fresh outlets for what we are producing.</P>
    <P>For a number of years the attention of the Government in office had to be directed towards the encouragement of people here to produce more goods industrially and agriculturally.  In the industrial field, the vast proportion of the goods which we manufacture is used in Ireland, but in relation to agricultural produce we are in the situation that we shall have to rely on the proportion of our agricultural produce that we can sell abroad to import the constituents of many of the industrial goods which are providing employment in our cities.</P>
    <P>In regard to agricultural marketing, a great difficulty was overcome in achieving the increase in production which has been achieved, but, now that it has been secured, there exists among the producing sections of our people considerable concern because of the fact that the Government cannot guarantee to the producer that there are markets available for the goods which are produced.  The introduction of a fine on those sections who produce these goods, if they procure them in abundance, is recreating in the minds of those people considerable doubts as to the advisability of producing the goods.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made by various organisations that we should augment our missions abroad with representatives who will avail of the opportunities <Col N="266" /> that present themselves from time to time.  We know that there exist near us in Britain many opportunities which have not yet been availed of for the disposal of many of our surpluses, particularly in relation to butter.</P>

      <P>Yes, and for the Department of Agriculture, on which Estimates we intend to raise this matter. But in relation to the Department of External Affairs, I want to relate my remarks to the fact that we have to rely on our Ministers abroad and on the members of the staffs of our Embassies to advance our trade potential.  If we can, through the administration of the Department of External Affairs, secure in the coming 12 months an improvement in marketing the surplus agricultural and industrial produce which happily we now have, there would be no need for this Government or any Government to place a fine on the people who answered the call made by all Parties in this House to produce more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling. I realise that if I went into detail I would definitely be out of order.  Let me finish on this note, by impressing upon the Minister the desirability of examining any proposal that is submitted to him whereby the staffs of our Embassies abroad could be augmented to improve the marketing position in those countries where we would be in a position to dispose of our produce. I want to repeat that the staffs in those Embassies at the present moment are doing a good job of work.  They have to look after many of our nationals who are distributed all over the globe.  On the occasions that have come to my notice on which their assistance was sought it was very quickly forthcoming.  This places on <Col N="267" /> them considerable work and responsibility, and the people who are the first to point at the Department of External Affairs and to pass the gibing remark that there are people there who are having a very good time and enjoying fat salaries and expenses at the expense of the Irish taxpayer are in the main completely ignorant of the service provided for our Irish nationals in those countries in which they work.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to look into the possibility of extending our consular services.  There is one location in particular which has been brought to my attention where a consular representative would be very desirable and that is in Lourdes.  On some occasions deaths take place, and we know of the difficulties that are occasioned when people seek to marry in Lourdes.  It is awkward that we have no representative nearer than Paris who can be contacted when such occasions arise.  It should be possible to secure the assistance of a suitable person to act in that capacity without entailing any expense.</P>
      <P>The Minister in this Estimate seeks an increased contribution to the United Nations Children's Fund.  It is a very small contribution, but a very advisable one.  People are apt to regard these various organisations set up under the aegis of the United Nations as being military in character. They are apt to ignore the magnificient work done by organisations such as U.N.C.F.</P>
      <P>There is a slight increase in the contribution for the maintenance of the United Nations Emergency Force. Never was money so well spent as that spent in setting up and maintaining that force.  Results have been apparent principally because of the manner in which that force got down to work on the Mediterranean shores, thereby preventing what might have been a very disturbing situation for Europe and the world generally.  The charge we have to meet is very slight in relation to other charges and the contribution is a worthwhile one since the effectiveness of the force has been proved beyond doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> I defend the expenditure of every pound the Minister seeks in this Estimate but I should have wished that he would have given us some idea of what the Government's foreign policy is.  I emphasise, too, the necessity for his Department collaborating with the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture to ensure that our marketing organisation abroad is improved so that we shall have an outlet for the goods we are producing in abundance. It seems to be accepted in some quarters that it is impossible to dispose of these goods.  We know that markets are available and it is only a matter of organisation, particularly on the part of the Minister and his Department.  That is why I have raised the matter on this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in complete agreement with Deputy O'Sullivan as to the value of co-operation between the Departments of External Affairs, Industry and Commerce and Agriculture. There is evidence of that co-operation to a somewhat limited extent in sub-head B (1) in relation to Great Britain where, of the two Counsellors there provided, one is on loan from the Department of Industry and Commerce, and of the two First Secretaries, one is on loan from the Department of Agriculture.  There is also one Higher Executive Officer on loan from Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>I should like to add my encouragement &mdash; I hope none is necessary &mdash; that we should press on with the maximum inter-departmental co-operation.  I know that Córas Tráchtála has its representatives abroad, one in Great Britain and one in the United States of America.  Our permanent diplomatic and consular representatives should be able to give tremendous help.  Indeed, I am sure they are doing so.  However, technical ability is of great value in assessing markets and advising producers on such things as marketing, packaging and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as general foreign policy is concerned, I should have thought the Minister has made the position of the Government fairly clear in his statements at the United Nations and elsewhere. <Col N="269" /> It is not possible for a small country like ours to adopt a strong individual foreign policy.  That is not our best contribution.  As has been shown by the Minister, particularly at the United Nations, we have a chance of adopting a rôle of reconciliation between the conflicting interests in the world Power <i>blocs.</i>  Were we to declare ourselves in favour of an almost blind adherence to any particular Power <i>bloc</i> we would be greatly limited in the contribution we could make in international affairs.  For that reason I prefer that we should preserve our freedom of action at all times so that, should a situation develop over which we have little or no control, we may be able to make our contribution by bringing the opposing parties together.</P>
    <P>In the past, it has been perfectly clear that when the Minister has tried to act in that way his action has been grossly misinterpreted by some.  That is always the fate of anyone who tries to reconcile opposing interests.  There is always the danger that both sides will oppose.  But that is a risk which must be taken.  Our contribution cannot be the same as that of Switzerland, which has a long tradition of passive neutrality.  That is not the rule we should adopt.  If neutral, we should at least be active in our neutrality so that we may come before the larger Power <i>blocs</i>, not as members of one of themselves but as a neutral State anxious to reconcile the parties.  Because of that rôle, it would be very difficult for anyone to make a statement of our general policy as regards Algeria, Cyprus, South America, South Africa and so forth.  I do not feel we are obliged to make statements on any of those questions.</P>

      <P>We have made it clear, however, by the statements of the Minister that we are anxious to co-operate in every possible way to preserve peace in international affairs and to eliminate the military use of nuclear energy.  It does not seem to make any great contribution if we solemnly pledge ourselves not to use atomic or hydrogen bombs.  That is a fanciful suggestion at the best of times.  It has been made perfectly clear that we are anxious to see that the greater military Powers do forswear the use of nuclear energy in connection with their armed forces.</P>
      <P>I am delighted we are taking part in the support of the United Nations Emergency Force.  As I said on the Estimate for the Department of Defence, I would be far more delighted if we could make some contribution by way of actual manpower to that United Nations Emergency Force as well as the contribution of money we make at present.  I know that might entail legislation but I would be anxious that that should be kept constantly under review.  It might be possible without any change of legislation, where the men involved would volunteer for the work, that we could send out technical officers, either members of the Defence Forces or the Civil Service, to act as technical officers with the United Nations Force. That would be of great value to those who were sent out and it would be an additional pledge of our adherence to the United Nations and the efforts made to preserve peace.</P>
      <P>Comments are always being made about our Embassies abroad and I was delighted that Deputy O'Sullivan was so confident that those Embassies were well worth while.  I agree with him in that.  I feel they are essential shop windows in the eyes of the world, both from a trade point of view and also from the point of view of tourism.  If the country is not adequately represented abroad, people will not know even that we exist at all.  The expenditure, large though it may seem to some extent, is a very wise investment of our national funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that those who are serving in the Diplomatic Corps are serving us well and we have every reason to be <Col N="271" /> proud of them.  My only criticism is that I am not quite sure that they have sufficient technical assistance readily available to them so that the maximum use can be made of their contacts in other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express my disappointment at the Minister's speech.  We are discussing the Estimate and possibly this is not the opportune time to discuss external affairs and foreign policy.  But I suggest to the Minister that this House is at least as appropriate a place to discuss or indicate Government policy on foreign affairs as the United Nations or elsewhere.  As a Deputy without any Party affiliations, I should have welcomed an indication from the Minister on various points in connection with his Department which are not referred to in this document which I received and which, I presume, is a copy of his speech.  This document deals almost completely with financial matters.  It is an interesting document from that point of view but I suggest it is a document that might have been submitted by a very minor official of his Department rather than the Minister of what is an important, and a growingly important, Department of this country.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers who have preceded me, I am disappointed that no indications of the Government's foreign policy have been given in the Minister's speech.  I appreciate that we have difficulties not common to other countries.  I do not wish to be unfair in my criticism of the Minister's statement.  This is a small country and our resources are very limited indeed.  We have had a turbulent and difficult past history.  Possibly even more important than any of these considerations is the fact that we are a partitioned country.  I appreciate that any Minister for External Affairs must of necessity tread with caution and with some temerity in the councils of the nations outside this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to think that our rôle would be, firstly, the rôle of any small country, the rôle of a peacemaker, in that we would adopt a fair attitude in the councils of the nations of the world <Col N="272" /> and that we would be regarded as being fair-minded.  I, for one, would be quite content to wait for a later opportunity to put forward our own case for the reunification of our country after we have earned a reputation of being fair-minded, of being a nation whose contributions could be regarded as carrying weight and not blassed in favour of any of the big <i>blocs</i> who control world affairs between them.</P>
    <P>In saying this, I do not wish to be misunderstood in suggesting that we should depart from the old traditional alliances of friendship and race with the countries of the west.  I do not. But keeping these traditional and historic associations in mind, in external affairs we should try to build up a reputation of being fair-minded and, if at all possible, of being regarded by opposing <i>blocs</i> as a country which would fairly adjudge in a world of international crises.</P>
    <P>That is possibly the best rôle that a small nation can play.  It would be a great mistake to seek to make an international nuisance of ourselves, even though the temptation is there to put our own very concrete difficulties and very real grievances regarding the division of our country before other countries and to seek to gain their assistance in having the position remedied.  I should prefer not to do this until we make our position clear &mdash; that we are a country, although a small one, which carries weight and which has regard to its obligations in world affairs.</P>
    <P>I should have liked if the Minister had given some indication of the Government's own approach to the question of Partition.  I know that the present Taoiseach over the years has indicated his views, with which, I must say, I am very largely in agreement. But the time has come now when we must be able to offer a clear alternative to the solution of Partition by force.  The Government has rejected force as a means of solving Partition, and if you want to encourage those men who believe in that solution to follow another line, you must give them a lead to follow.  It is not sufficient to do nothing and say nothing about <Col N="273" /> it.  I believe there is an alternative to force but it is an alternative that must be followed energetically and a clear lead must be given to get these young men to follow it.</P>
    <P>I should like to support the previous speakers on both sides of the House in their request to the Minister to be as generous as he possibly can, having regard to our limited resources, to our Legations and Embassies abroad, particularly in regard to trade representation. I have reason to believe that some of the Legations and Consulates, in particular, are so understaffed and overworked by normal consular duties that they have not the time or the opportunity to lend themselves and their staffs to looking after our trade interests.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is fair to take the United States of America as an example, but I see that our representation at Chicago consists of one consul, one vice-consul (temporary) and a temporary stenographer clerk. That is the second largest centre in the United States.  The representation at Boston is one greater, by the fact that they have two temporary stenographer clerks.  A somewhat similar situation obtains in other centres on the Continent and in Canada.</P>
    <P>I know that we cannot do all that we would like to do.  I have very mixed views as to whether the prestige value that we are trying to secure by calling our representatives &ldquo;ambassadors&rdquo; is worth while or not, having regard to the size of their staffs and the fact that they are not adequately paid.  I should prefer to see more consular and honorary consular representatives, particularly throughout Europe.  That is more than ever necessary now with the likelihood that some form of European free trade will come into effect in the next year or two.  Now is the time to be preparing for that with an aggressive and energetic policy of well-staffed trade representatives abroad, linked particularly with the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in which we must be unique amongst the countries of the world, that is, in the huge number <Col N="274" /> of native-born Irish outside the country, particularly in Great Britain. If the reports we read are correct, there must be something like 1,000,000 native-born Irish living in Great Britain.  I should have liked the Minister to have referred in his speech to some means of maintaining contact with that huge population, to ensure that they will retain close attachment to their country of origin and will not become anglicised completely with the passage of a few years and not wish to return to this country.  It should be possible to work out some system whereby there would be in the larger centres of Great Britain, London, Manchester, Birmingham and so on, some form of representation by the Department of External Affairs to keep these people in continuing close contact with the country of their birth.</P>
    <P>Deputies have paid tribute to our consular officers abroad.  I, also, should like to say that, from personal experience, I found them both efficient and courteous and, having regard to their limitations in staff, salary and technical assistance, they are giving excellent service to the country.  As other Deputies have said, I believe that increased expenditure over the comparatively modest amount which we pay to these officials, particularly in Europe and the United States of America, would be a very good investment and an even better investment in the years ahead, when the proposed Free Trade Area comes into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the Minister for External Affairs, or, rather, the Department, has failed in its mission. &ldquo;External Affairs&rdquo; means foreign affairs.  There are certain duties, such as looking after visas for people who want to come and go, and looking after our nationals in foreign lands, but, primarily, the function of the Department of External Affairs should be the solving of Partition.  We have a huge machine, ambassadors, consuls and so on.  It is questionable whether we need so many ambassadors, consuls, or staffs.  It is questionable, seeing that we have actually no power in the affairs of Europe and that we can do little more than look after our nationals and arrange visas, that we <Col N="275" /> should have such an expensive machine and should try to compete with other countries that have real power.</P>
      <P>As I said, the primary duty of the Department is to try to do its share to solve Partition, to get foreign powers interested in Partition, to use their influence with Britain and even to use their threats with Britain.  Our purpose should be to try to soften up this problem, so that it would become nearer to solution.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, there has been no improvement as far as Partition is concerned.  We were in a very good position at one time, at the time of the Treaty.  Since then, our whole power seems to have collapsed.  Arising out of the unfortunate Civil War, we became divided.  Even at this stage, our representatives cannot go to Britain without being mobbed &mdash; I mean, in the wrong way.  I am sure that if our representatives were to attend public meetings or functions in America, they would also have crowds after their heads.  It is a sorry position for us to be in that, after all these years, we have no unity amongst ourselves, let alone the support of any foreign power to try to solve this problem which is our main problem and, certainly, the main problem for the Department under discussion.</P>
      <P>As I said, we were in a good position before the Civil War.  It is a great pity that such a thing ever happened.  Even if we had our differences, it is a great pity that we could not have continued as a Government.  We would at least have had unity, like the French, who have it out amongst themselves, but who stood shoulder to shoulder against the enemy during the Revolution.  Had we stuck together in spite of differences as to what should have been signed, or should not have been signed, I am quite certain that we would have been a good match for those opposed to us in the North and in Britain and that the problem could have been solved long ago.  There is no use, however, crying over spilt milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What have we done to try to retrieve the position?  The previous Government made a very foolish mistake, a <Col N="276" /> blunder, in abolishing the External Relations Act.  They set up a Republic for Twenty-Six Counties.  In doing so, they made possible the Ireland Act and made our position impossible as far as any reasonable hope of ending the problem is concerned.  Well and good if they meant to follow it up and walk in and take Northern Ireland, as they would be justified in doing, but had not the power to do it.  If that was what the previous Government had in mind, well and good, but they had no such intentions.  They made the position worse.</P>
    <P>What have the present Government done? &mdash;a speech now and again.  Do we follow up this speech?&mdash;no.  Then we have another speech next year. We act like defeatists; we have no policy, it seems; and we can do nothing about it.  A policy means a plan, which means a follow-up.  If we follow a policy we must invade Northern Ireland, and, if we do not want to do that, it is because we have no policy. We cannot invade Northern Ireland because we have not the necessary power to do it, but at least we can try to do something else.  We make speeches appealing to the North, but do we do it properly?  We must remember they are not like the people of Kerry or Galway.  Anybody can appeal to the people of the Twenty-Six Counties, but in the North we have people who I hold are of British stock and what we say to the people of Kerry must be said in a different way in dealing with the North.  We must accept that they are different and then make a proper approach.</P>
    <P>What do we offer these people?  Has a plan ever been submitted?  If one goes to an auction, one must bid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy can speak afterwards and give us his side of it. <Col N="277" /> My point is that most of those people are of British stock, and, whether we like it or not, they did not, as was done down here, inter-marry with the old stock.  They remained Presbyterian. Their culture and everything else are different.  I am referring to the two-thirds. Unless approaches are followed up, they are of no use, and appealing, as we appeal to the people in the South, is no use.  We must give these people in the North guarantees in regard to what they are concerned about, whether we will include them in our Government, whether we will have some association, as far as they are concerned, with the Commonwealth. They are British stock and they should get the guarantee that, so far as they are concerned, there will be certain relations with the Commonwealth.</P>
      <P>They may want guarantees about Irish.  These people are largely materialists and might fear that we would do something like compelling them to learn Irish or deprive them of certain posts.  They should be assured there will be no compulsion.  We must satisfy their fears.  Since they are of British stock, we should say that if England is in any trouble and if they want to volunteer, we shall not stop them.</P>
      <P>We must satisfy them we shall not make them poorer than they are in regard to social benefits.  The average Northerner will ask: &ldquo;How much old age pension will I get?&rdquo; Each individual counts these items up and just as when one goes to an election meeting, one promises every little group: &ldquo;We will take down the rent&rdquo;, we must say that we will not cause them to lose social benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have we made some approach to these people?  No; we have said they can have the same Government as they now have and that any power England possesses over them, we will claim. They will need other assurances.  We must not treat these people as fools, but as individuals with certain loyalties that must be recognised and respected. Have we made them an offer?  Have we made an effort to satisfy their fears?  Are we to do nothing more than make an occasional speech?  Are we <Col N="278" /> going to invade?  What are we going to do?</P>

      <P>I am not the Minister, but I am asking the Minister who is responsible, and who must accept some responsibility for the present state of affairs here, because all the division in the country, the internment camps and everything of that kind, arise from the failure of the Department of External Affairs.</P>
      <P>I know the problem as well as the Minister does, and I am asking the Minister what offer he is making.  The other Government made the mistake of abolishing the External Relations Act. What will the present Minister do now to satisfy the various groups, these Presbyterians in the North?  Those are the people who must be satisfied and they are not Irishmen such as we have in Cork or Tipperary.  That must be recognised.</P>

      <P>Like previous speakers, I am disappointed that the Minister did not see fit to make a statement of policy.  Our newspapers are full of foreign affairs and events, and radio broadcasts give us full details of things taking place in other parts of the world.  This Estimate for External Affairs is the only opportunity we have for an unlimited discussion on foreign affairs as related to ourselves.  No one expects the Minister to make a categorical statement in regard to different matters troubling the world to-day, but he might have made a general statement covering the important events that are taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that, since we had the Estimate here last year, affairs have been changing continually in Europe and elsewhere, and I should like to stress two very prominent changes that have taken place in the past 12 months.  In the first instance, there has been a growth of unity in Europe and there is no denying that the unity of Europe, be it the Common Market, the Free Trade Area, or any other economic negotiation that may be going on, has, in the main, a political background.  We who live a long distance from Europe do not appreciate <Col N="279" /> the atmosphere in which the average European has lived for the past ten years or so, when he has been threatened by the might of imperial Communism. From day to day, he never knew the moment there might be an outbreak in Europe which would seriously affect his home and those he held dear.</P>
    <P>This political unity has been gradually strengthened and the common market has come into existence, and is a further advance in the burying of the feud between France and Germany, the two great European powers that have taken part in three wars in the past 100 years.</P>
    <P>We well know that there has been a drastic change within the Communist countries.  Beginning with the insurrection in Hungary two years ago, there has been a gradual tendency towards liberalisation in the satellite countries themselves.  That liberalisation has not been given freely by their Russian overlords.  It has been forced on these countries by a chain of events within their own boundaries.  The collective system of Communism has been found to be a failure.  The abiding resistance of the Christian faith against militaristic atheistic Communism has gradually made inroads on that society.  No matter what they have done towards limiting free thought and limiting the pursuit of the Christian ideal, their efforts have failed.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary economic situation that exists behind the Iron Curtain, Communism has been forced to slow its progress and the great resistance to that progress has come from the people on the land.  Those on the land have got a greater outlook towards freedom than any other section of the community.  The result of the Communist imposition on this freedom whereby the people on the land were required to work solely for the benefit of the State was a failure.  They did not work.  They produced less and less.  They concealed what they did produce so that countries that had been exporters of agricultural produce found themselves in a state of semi-starvation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> The whole face of Europe is changing. These are things that are happening from day to day and they must affect us in this country.  Everything that happens in the outside world must affect Ireland.  The effects of Suez were felt down as far as the ordinary villages in rural Ireland.  For those reasons one would have expected the Minister to express the opinions of his Government, not only to this House but to the country generally.  If he had done so, it would have given us an opportunity to initiate a discussion. We expected the Minister to give us a lead with regard to the change of circumstances in which we find ourselves but he did not do so.</P>
    <P>The Free Trade proposals for a common market are bound to affect this country.  This is a matter of interest to everyone here.  We are vitally concerned in that matter and the Minister's Department is also vitally concerned.  Our Ambassador in France is chairman of one of the committees dealing with the effects that Free Trade will have on the smaller nations such as Ireland, Greece and Turkey.  I point out these things to show you why we expected the Minister to talk on these matters, to show why we expected the Minister to initiate a discussion on them so that we could have a debate which would be a clarification for everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>It has always been a puzzle to me why, when we are one of a number of 15 or 16 States that are members of bodies such as the Council of Europe, O.E.E.C. and the United Nations, we should not have the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce dealing with these things.  The whole atmosphere in Europe to-day is an atmosphere of unity.  We want to get out from behind Britain and face, on our own, as a separate and independent nation, the problems that face us to-day.  To do that we must have full representation at these discussions.  If this Party were in Government I am sure that we would send the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and <Col N="281" /> Commerce to all these important committees. Much more information would be made available to Deputies who, after all, are the elected representatives of the people, and they would then be in a position to put the facts before the country as a whole and thus bring Ireland into the position which it will have to take if, within a few years, a common market or a united Europe comes into existence.</P>
    <P>Many people say that Free Trade is a complicated thing.  That is only natural if you have a debate on External Affairs in which a Minister gets up and reads a statistical statement and nothing else.  How, under such conditions, are the people to learn what is going on in Europe?  That is what the people want to know.  We have much to gain, in my opinion, from a united Europe.  We have much to gain from the fact that a united Europe will bring together a manpower of 250,000,000 people which will safeguard this generation and many generations to come from an attack by Communism.  A united Europe would also bring a better economy.  It is bound to bring a better economy to smaller nations if they are joined in a common market with the greater nations.  These are the things we should be discussing in this debate and on which we have had no opportunity of ascertaining the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>I am not certain whether the Irish Government are in favour of joining the Free Trade Area, said in Paris last do not know to what extent they consider it desirable to participate in that plan.  It is quite obvious that they cannot stand still.  Time is marching on and vital decisions have got to be taken.</P>
    <P>Mr. Maudling, who is chairman of the Council of Ministers set up to consider the Free Trade Area, said in Paris last December, when addressing four or five committees of the Council of Europe, representative of all shades of political opinion in fifteen nations, that he thought the vital decision would be taken by the end of July. We are now in the middle of April and we have had no announcement <Col N="282" /> from our Minister for External Affairs of the policy of the Government in relation to that matter.  I think that is wrong.  I think that in justice to the House the Minister, when replying to this debate, should give us a résumé of any discussions that have taken place.  He should give us a résumé of what he thinks are the pitfalls in regard to the Free Trade Area.  It is not just a question of joining the Free Trade Area.  We may have to join it. The Minister should give us a résumé in regard to the pitfalls he sees, and indicate what progress has been made to meet the particular circumstances in which Ireland finds itself as a young nation.</P>
    <P>These are facts which the Minister should communicate to the House.  I do not think it right that the Minister who happens to be dealing with this particular branch of foreign affairs should go to Belfast and make statements. Such statements should be made now on this Estimate.  The Minister should avail of this opportunity to make a full and comprehensive statement.  He must have all the facts.  He has his advisers and his Embassies to tell him what is happening.  He also has the experts who have gone out there on the different committees.  This is a matter which must have been repeatedly discussed within the Government itself.</P>
    <P>A great interest is taken in foreign affairs in this country.  I assume that those who direct our information services and newspaper editors must know that the Irish people &mdash; the ordinary reading public &mdash; are interested in such things.  That is evident by reason of the fact that practically every day you open a newspaper or listen to the wireless you hear the latest about sputniks, satellites or summit conferences.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable amount of talk about atomic warfare.  With regard to atomic warfare, no one nation will ever get away with it.  The nation which struck the first blow always got it back 100 times over. There is another factor to remember, an important factor.  The threat from <Col N="283" /> Russia to-day comes not so much from the fact of her trying to impose her ideology on the world.  That she would never do if there were a united Europe with a sound economy.  The great threat from the point of view of Russia is that she has built up the greatest undersea force the world has ever known.  In the last war Germany practically starved out Britain with 59 submarines.  To-day Russia commands 700 submarines &mdash; a very formidable force and a force which could affect our economy in every way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Declan Costello posed a very fair question to the Minister when he asked what our policy was in regard to the United Nations.  I do not want the Minister to be a slavish follower of British policy or a slavish follower of the policy put forward by the great powers.  We may suspect many things which the great powers say but we have to accept the fact that our future and freedom are tied up with the survival of the free world.  Were it not for the strong arm of the United States and for such forces as a divided Europe is able to place at the disposal of the world, we would be enslaved overnight and let there be no illusion about it.  It would not be long before the atheistic and materialistic forces of Russia walked in to subjugate us here. One of the forces which has held down that is the Christian faith.  We are sending out from this country all over the world &mdash; we have done it over a great many years &mdash; people who preach the Gospel.</P>
    <P>Although we may not agree with what the great Powers say, at least they are conserving that freedom.  They are conserving the democratic method of government and, by their doing that, we are allowed to develop our own high spiritual ideals and send out those people who are the glory of our race, no matter where they go.  They proved themselves by what they did in China where the people were brutalised by atheistic Communists.</P>
    <P>I do not like to criticise the Minister for External Affairs when he speaks on behalf of his country abroad, but I think the statement he made in the United Nations when he referred to <Col N="284" /> China was a mistake.  It was misinterpreted particularly by those people who represented the ancient ideals for which we stand in this country.  If the Minister is going back to U.N.O.  I do not think that he should have any discussion with Communists.  The Communists look only for discussion when it suits them.</P>
    <P>Rumour has it at the moment that the suspension of atomic tests is due to the fact that Russia has had one of the most disastrous explosions that she has ever had before.  It has made her own people, who are actively concerned, nervous of having any more to do with these high-powered tests.  It is also rumoured that radiation is so active in that country that the health of the nation has been vitally affected. I have a suspicious mind.  Whenever you hear Communists talk about negotiations it means they have something to gain by the negotiations and a lot to lose if they do not take place. With regard to the withdrawal of troops in Western Europe, western troops might withdraw but a few days afterwards, on some pretext or another, the boys would be back again behind the Iron Curtain in full strength.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that Partition is a very difficult question.  In this country we have attacked each other politically for a great many years.  I do not want my remarks to be misconstrued.  I object to Partition.  I think it is an imposition on this country; it is unjust and internationally dishonourable. There is nothing to justify it.  Other Powers are not really interested in our affairs.  I have discussed this matter with a lot of people in my period abroad as a representative of Ireland on the Council of Europe but they are not really interested in our affairs. They always say it is a question that we ourselves should try to solve.  My guess is as good as that of anybody else.  I think that if we were to get some form of an economically-united Europe the position would improve.  As I said earlier, in my opinion a united Europe will be a political unity for the purpose of protecting the free world against the forces that threaten to engulf it. It will not be in the interest of any <Col N="285" /> country to see any other country as a weaker economic unit.  Therefore, I feel that, were we to achieve this political and economic unity, and if it comes about, the other countries will definitely say that Ireland cannot afford two Governments.  In fact, the situation that exists will become so ridiculous that it will just disappear of its own accord.  That may be wishful thinking but it is one road or one avenue to the ending of Partition. Apart from that, I feel that the more co-operation we have the better.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a united Ireland. It has been the ideal of all nationalists throughout all time, no matter what way they approach it.  There is the misguided approach.  We see it in those who do not recognise the Irish Parliament. That does not make sense to me. There is the other approach &mdash; the approach of trying to unify your country by having as much intercourse as possible between the two halves and thus unifying it without bitterness.  We must bear in mind the economic circumstances, the change in population, the fact that the nationalist population is slowly growing in the North, the general economic circumstances in the North.  Economically, the North is not a satisfactory unit from Britain's viewpoint. She has to pay a big sum of money every year to maintain the Government she has imposed on the Irish people there.  What that sum is, nobody knows because it is never disclosed. I know that members of the British House of Commons who are sympathetic to Ireland tried by parliamentary question to elicit the amount of that sum but there was no answer. There never will be an answer.  The finances are so mixed up that it will not become apparent to the British people who are paying for it what the Government in the Six Counties is costing.  By cohesion between the two parts of Ireland &mdash; tourist trade and other ways &mdash; it will eventually become self-evident to the people up there in the North that their economic interests lie with the South.  You will get a united Ireland in that way and perhaps a peaceful united Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would ask one question in reference to this country and the Six <Col N="286" /> Counties.  I understand that a proposition was made to the Six Counties that they should co-operate with us here in an atomic research station.  I do not know if any further move has been made in that line.  I do not know if it was accepted or not by the Six Counties.  If it was not accepted by the Six Counties, it is another proof of their want of good faith.  It would be a good thing if the Minister replied to me on that point and made public in this Parliament if that offer was made and was refused.  We, the Irish delegates who have an opportunity of going abroad to these different societies, can make that matter public to the other parliamentary representatives throughout Europe.  We can show that we, in this half, have gone a long way, in spite of the injustices imposed on us in the past, to unify Ireland.  We can prove to the world that right is ours and not only that right is ours but that we were prepared to forgive and forget a lot of things and to try to come together for the sake of the country to which we all belong.  Be we from the North or from the South, we are Irish and we like to serve our country as a united Ireland together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This year, the Minister, in introducing his Estimate, says nothing at all about policy.  We have not yet heard him conclude.  However, on the last occasion when he presented an Estimate to this House &mdash; in 1957 &mdash; he defined the policy of the Government of Ireland in the following comprehensive terms, as reported at column 620 of Volume 163 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not think it is necessary for me to go into the many broad issues that have been raised here.  It is not the first time that this Parliament has debated external affairs and all the Deputies and the country know the policy upon which Fianna Fáil has acted in the past in relation to external affairs, and that is the policy upon which we propose to continue to operate.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parliament will not survive if the Ministers responsible perennially treat <Col N="287" /> it with contempt.  I do not think the present Minister for External Affairs is profoundly devoted to parliamentary procedure but, for good or ill, he is a member of a parliamentary Government and he is answerable to this House and to the humblest Deputy in it for the Department for which he has responsibility.  This House has a right to ask him and even to demand of him at least once a year a declaration of Government policy on foreign affairs.  He cannot go and treat the House, as Minister, with contempt without imposing on us who constitute the Opposition the duty to try to find out from his <i>obiter dicta</i> when he was less discreet than he now is what his mind is on very vital matters that affect us.  To that end, I want to quote from column 148 of Volume 159 of the Official Report.  Deputy Aiken, as he then was, intervened in a debate initiated by the then Minister for External Affairs, now Deputy Cosgrave. On that occasion Deputy Cosgrave, as Minister for External Affairs, conceived it to be his duty very exhaustively to lay before Dáil Éireann the policy of the Government to which we then belonged.  Deputy Aiken, as he then was, conceived it to be his duty to follow Deputy Cosgrave's speech, point by point.  At column 148, Deputy Aiken is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think the Minister, in the third principle he outlines, departed to some extent from the first and second which he announced.  It seemed to me, from what I could hear and as I was able to follow him, that he was rather tying himself up in this third point of policy.  There is no doubt that one of the reasons why Communism has had success in some parts of the world is because the non-Communist nations have not behaved as they should.  There are sins that are common both to the Communistic states and to non-Communistic states.  Our acid test for all nations, no matter on which side of the Iron Curtain they may be, should be the test the Minister stated in the beginning of his speech he would apply to Russia, namely, that it is what is done that counts and not what is said.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> I want to ask the Minister for External Affairs as he now is if Deputy Aiken still speaks, since he became Minister for External Affairs, in the language he employed when he addressed this House as Deputy Aiken on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Is our attitude to the United States of America exactly the same as it is to Russia?  Do we ask the United States of America to prove its good faith by deeds, in the same spirit and with the same secpticism as we address that question to the U.S.S.R.?  I do not.  I believe the United States of America to be the citadel of freedom and liberty in the world to-day.  I believe it to be the leader of freedom and individual liberty.  I believe it to be the sponsor before the world of all the political ideals that this nation holds dear.  I believe the U.S.S.R. to be the convinced, implacable and unconvertible enemy of all these things.  I look with deep suspicion on any gambit that the Government of the U.S.S.R. makes.  I expect to discover that any action taken by the United States Government is taken in the interests of freedom and in defence of liberty.  I require to have it proved to me by performance before I am prepared to accept the propaganda, whence ever it may come, that the United States of America has turned traitor to the principles upon which she was founded and by which she has regulated her existence since she became an independent State.  That is a diametrically opposite approach to that of Deputy Aiken as recorded in the speech to which I have referred and which stands upon the printed record of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>On that issue, I ask him categorically to say, does he adhere to the position set out in his speech on the 3rd July, 1956, when he said that he thought we ought to apply the same test to the good faith of any nation, on whichever side of the Iron Curtain it has its being?  I do not, and I do not believe anybody on this side of the House does.  I very much doubt if there are many Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side who accept that doctrine; but I suspect that it is becoming dangerous, in the Fianna Fáil Party at least, to say aloud what I am saying here now.</P>

      <P>That is a right we enjoy on this side of the House and I am using it now.  The Minister has a right and duty to speak, not only for himself but for the Government of which he is a member.  He ought to tell us now whether he is still of the same mind as he was some time ago. He was greatly aggrieved when we called in question in this House the expediency of &ldquo;the Aiken Plan&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Rapacki Plan&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Kennan Plan&rdquo;.  This plan was launched, if you please, to test before the world the good faith of the leaders of Russia. We were to say: &ldquo;Yanks, go home!&rdquo; if the Russians would go home; and then we were to see Kruschev blushing and all distressed, wondering what he was to do that Aiken had called his bluff.  Kruschev did not wait.  He got out the next week and he said: &ldquo;Somebody misunderstood something I said in Budapest; I want to be more explicit in Cracow; I want to give a message to the people of Hungary and I am announcing this to them: &lsquo;If anyone&mdash;Aiken, Rapacki or Kennan&mdash; sticks his pig's snout into our Socialist garden, we will kick the snout off him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> Now, who is blushing?  Kruschev is not blushing.  He wants everyone to know that, if anyone entertains fancy notions about the tenderness of his feelings, for fear they would think he would stay in a minute longer than he was invited to abide.  Because somebody interpreted something he said as meaning that if the Hungarians did not in future consolidate their Communist Party in their own country the Russians might not come back to help them &mdash; somebody understood him to say that &mdash; he said: &ldquo;Let us put that right and let us amend it; if Aiken, Kennan or Rapacki sticks his pig's snout into our Socialist garden, we will kick it off.&rdquo;  Was not that a very brilliant performance, that in order to make Kruschev blush we thought it expedient to announce that we were quite ready to clamber on the bandwagon of &ldquo;Yanks, go home!&rdquo; and to proclaim before the world that, so far as we were concerned in Europe, we looked upon them as six of one to half a dozen of the other.</P>
    <P>That comes from a country that knows blooming well that if America declared herself disinterested in this Continent to-morrow morning, we would not survive a fortnight.  Is there anyone who doubts that?  Is there anyone such an imbecile as not to read very recent history?  I remember Secretary Acheson saying &mdash; I think, in an unguarded moment &mdash; that the vital interests of the United States of America did not include the area of Korea; and within a fortnight we had the Korean War &mdash; because he did not take the precaution that Krushchev took after his Budapest speech.  He did not mean that, but the Communists thought he meant it and they thought they could clean up Korea without interference. All that saved Korea from incorporation in Red China was the painful, bitter, three years' war.  Who fought that war?  The United States of America, with token support of the other democracies of the West.  That war was our vital interest, because it was the concrete notice to the Communist countries that America meant what she said and that if there was an attempt made to overrun existing democracies America was prepared to fight.  Do we think it expedient to try <Col N="291" /> to make Kruschev blush, at the heavy price we paid in misunderstanding, with that futile gesture?</P>
    <P>This appears to me to be one of those platitudes which still requires to be repeated, that the purpose of foreign policy, our purpose of diplomacy, is to serve the vital interests of Ireland.  Anyone who goes to the table of international negotiations with any other purpose in his mind simply causes confusion, because every other Minister who is there is sent there on that mission, to defend the vital interests of his own country. What are the vital interests of Ireland? Are not they to preserve our independence and to promote our prosperity? How are those vital interests served by protesting our impatient passion to have the question of Red China's admission to the United Nations put upon the agenda of the United Nations in the knowledge that this was a matter to which the United States of America, for her own reasons, attached fundamental importance, and a matter in respect of which she felt she was affronted &mdash; affronted not by somebody whom she knew she might look upon either for a blow or a commendation but by somebody, of all others, who, she was convinced, would go to the utmost limit of its resources to help her in so far as it lay within her power. It was not on a major issue of the admission or non-admission of Red China, but on the trivial and piffling issue as to whether it should be put on the agenda that we chose to appear before the world as the opponent of the United States.</P>
    <P>I have said here before that I have never detected in international conferences at which I was present any desire on the part of the United States of America to impose on her friends, great or small, the mind of America, in respect of any issue that was raised.  All you had to say to your American colleagues, if you wanted to differ was: &ldquo;This is a matter of real significance to us in Ireland.  We know your interests run counter to us but we feel quite confident that once we explain our position there will be no hard feelings.&rdquo;  Invariably there were no hard feelings but it has been understood, <Col N="292" /> and always was understood until this vital act of folly, that in matters of complete indifference to us, where no vital interest of ours was involved, if the United States had some vital interest, whether of prestige or substance, she would look upon us as a certain help.</P>
    <P>Such information as reaches me from the United States leads me to believe that in wide areas of public thought in America, where in the past we have enjoyed friendship and sympathetic understanding, that futile, silly vote about putting the question of the admission of Red China on the agenda has done us even more harm than the whole ridiculous farce of the Aiken plan, which resulted in Mr. Kruschev's observation about the pig's nose.  I think diplomacy of that kind is deplorable and may in some measure be due to the Minister's arrogant refusal to discuss policy in this House.  If he had indicated in 1957 that he adhered to the line which he adopted in 1956, when he spoke as an individual Deputy, he would have heard from many sides a note of warning that the road he was travelling did not faithfully represent the people and could not properly be presented in the United Nations, or anywhere else, as a true reflection of the Nation's will.  We have got to ask ourselves in very explicit terms is there anybody in this House, or anybody anywhere, who is prepared to advance the proposition that as between Communist Russia and its satellites, China and the others, on the one hand, and the free world under the leadership of the United States, on the other, is Ireland neutral?</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Minister for External Affairs to answer that question categorically, explicitly and clearly and he has a duty to this House to comment on the &ldquo;Pig's Nose&rdquo; in relation to the Aiken plan.  I want, on the assumption that we can recover &mdash; which I am afraid I doubt &mdash; a great part of the sympathetic understanding which we lost as a result of our attitude in the United Nations, to renew on this Vote, which deals with External Affairs and international cooperation, a suggestion which I adumbrated on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> We profess to be looking for foreign capital for investment in this country. I am prepared to agree with Deputy Kyne who said on one occasion that his mind was preoccupied with the problem of unemployment.  So is mine. I think one of the great dangers to a political system founded on individual liberty and parliamentary institutions is that it will appear to a large part of the population that it has not the answer to the problem of unemployment. Although we who are in constant contact with a variety of sources of information may know that the solution for unemployment, which is available in the Communist countries is the slave State and that the full employment there is the full employment of slaves who are directed to their work under penalties to which free men would not submit, an unemployed man enduring the hardship of poverty, more especially as it impinges on his wife and family, will have a yearing for the security of an assured income which turns his mind and thoughts into fertile soil for the seductions of a Communist philosophy.</P>
    <P>I feel most deeply that any opportunity that presented itself to us of engendering within the State employment &mdash; even employment divorced from profit, as far as the country is concerned &mdash; should be welcomed and promoted. Accordingly, I would be interested to hear that the Minister for External Affairs would consider formulating a somewhat more hopeful &ldquo;Aiken Plan&rdquo;&mdash; and he is quite welcome to it and it will not, I guarantee him, evoke from the United States as crude a reply as Kruschev's &ldquo;Pig's Nose&rdquo; oration.  We are faced with a difficulty that when you come down to the problem of employing men here in industrial production, once you have exhausted the capacity of the domestic market to consume, your problem ceases to be primarily one of production and becomes a problem of finding a market which will absorb your production and that involves two requisites, one, the technical skill and administrative experience requisite to produce an article capable of meeting the competition of international trade and, that having been done, establishing <Col N="294" /> a marketing organisation sufficiently widespread to secure for your product the volume of trade which will make your industrial unit viable.</P>
    <P>That creates for us in Ireland a vicious circle the breaking of which is almost impossible because you cannot build up the marketing organisation until you have the goods to market, and you cannot get the goods to market unless you have the marketing organisation to distribute them.  I can see no means of breaking that circle in our circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is true that in the past we have seen a firm like Bata in Czechoslovakia achieve that development by manufacturing for their own domestic market and then breaking out into the European market.  However, let us remember she was in the land mass of Europe and had access to a railway system which served the main European consuming centres without any commitment on her part.</P>
    <P>We have transport problems and a variety of other problems connected with effective marketing which make it extremely difficult for us to do what Bata did.  We must not forget, however, that in Ireland under the free trade system that obtained 50 years ago, we did have a biscuit manufacturer in this State who succeeded in distributing biscuits to the four corners of the earth by his own zeal and enterprise.  But, when I regard the position to-day I find it very difficult to see any development of that kind appearing again, and if we are to control unemployment in this country it must happen and not in one isolated case but in ten, 15 or 20 cases. There is no use burking that issue. Unless it is possible to get ten or 20 industrial units functioning in this country it is illusory to talk about making any real or enduring impression here on unemployment and emigration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it a matter for the Minister for External Affairs.  I want him, instead of plan- <Col N="295" /> ning to clear American troops out of Europe, to go to America and to propose to her that instead of distributing, on the magnificent scale which she has done heretofore, her resources through the medium of the Marshall Plan and through the scheme for international co-operation, and through the hundreds of other schemes which she has operated out of her own resources for the benefit of mankind, to suggest to her that we do not want any grants of money, that we do not ask her for any subsidy of that kind, that we simply ask her to get a group of her manufacturers who themselves have the technology that we lack and who already are distributing through international marketing organisations without which we cannot hope effectively to enter international trade, to establish branch factories in this country with the assurance that every facility they want will be provided for them, and with the indication to the United States Government that our primary interest is to procure employment for our people in their own country.</P>
      <P>When I adumbrated that proposal on another occasion the Minister for Industry and Commerce appeared to misunderstand it and implied that America was a free enterprise country and was not interested in schemes of that kind.  Yet, I read in the Press of last week that such a corporation has been established for the purpose of doing that very thing in the Near East. One of the instruments of American policy is to seek to establish factories in those countries friendly to America in the Near East, in order to help their Governments to raise the standards of living in those countries that look to the West rather than to Moscow.  One of our great weaknesses &mdash;and let us face it, it is not only in Washington that this applies&mdash;is that we are too faithful.  If we had a nice little Communist Party established in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking only for confirmation of this view that if there was a nice little Communist Party growing up here like a mushroom we <Col N="296" /> would be surrounded by solicitous friends.  But, the fact that it is the policy of every Party in this State, and of every Deputy in this House, to repudiate and to frustrate any attempt to establish the Communist Party in this country is one of the reasons why, if there is any scheme afoot to help the neighbours, Ireland is the last in the queue.  It is something we should glory in and it is one of the facts of life that a sensible foreign Minister should bear in mind.  It is something of which we might with propriety boast when we go abroad, that of all the free nations in the world this is practically the only one that is left that wants no help to deal with its Communist problem, but we do want help, and make no apology for it, for the would that was inflicted on this nation when its whole industrial potential was cut away and by&mdash;let me moderate my language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I read some of the understanding plamás that is being published at present about our obligations to lick the feet of those who divided this country, when we are told it is our duty to forget that Bonar Law and the Tory Party undertook to destroy the British Constitution in order to divide this country, when we are told that we must eliminate all that from our minds and make a new departure, and, when I think of the Buckingham Palace Conference and the men who wrecked their lives and careers rather than accept the ultimatum of Bonar Law and, when I remember our people were, after 40 years, driven back into arms by disciples, not of the Fenians nor of the United Irishmen, but had arms forced back into their hands to defend themselves against the disciples of Bonar Law, Carson, the Marquess of Lansdowne and the rest of them, it makes me angry that I have to listen to the reproofs of those that we have a duty to forget all that as well as to forgive it.  I do not forget it.  I do not forget it and when I hear people telling me at international conferences that it is the business of Ireland to settle this matter I cannot help recalling what somebody else said on another occasion, and I think his name was Pontius Pilate, that he was not <Col N="297" /> called upon to make a judgment: let others take the responsibility.</P>
    <P>I do not want to exacerbate a difficult position but I can look back vicariously at least over 100 years of the history of this country throughout which my family has sought to secure conciliation between our people and the British people and three times I have seen conceded to violence what was denied to reason and argument. On each of these occasions a lifetime career of a patriot in Ireland was sacrificed and each time in 18 months there was conceded to violence what had been argued for nigh on 80 years.  However, let nobody plaster the illusion on his mind that this question concerns only the people of Ireland.  If this question concerned only the people of Ireland it would have been settled long ago.  There was never an Irish voice raised in defence of the partition of Ireland.  It was never true that it was solely the concern of Ireland but it may well be true&mdash;and I think it probably is&mdash;that in order to put right the wrong that has been done we here in the Republic may have to bear the heaviest burden and bring others to see the light and remedy the position for which we were not responsible but for which others were.</P>
    <P>I was drawn into that diversion by a recollection of a smarmy document that was circulated to demonstrate that anyone who remembered the past with pride was to be frowned upon as something inferior.  I remember all the past with pride and I want no instructions from smarmy frauds and hypocrites who would bid me not only to forgive but to forget.  Forgive I will most gladly but God forbid that I or any other decent Irishman should ever forget.</P>
    <P>I was pointing out that Ireland is in her industrial employment dilemma to-day not because of something inherently wrong with Ireland.  Do people realise that when this country was divided there was taken away from us the greatest shipbuilding industry in the world?  We had a greater shipbuilding industry in Belfast than in any shipyard in the United Kingdom, Japan.  Germany or anywhere else.  We had a great textile industry.  We had a great clothing industry.  We had many <Col N="298" /> other great industries all of which by a stroke of the pen were cut off from this country.  That is the essence of our problem.  If that mayhem had never been done there would have been a very different industrial history in this country over the last 30 years.</P>
    <P>What country in the world, if it had three quarters of its industrial potential swept away overnight, could have rebuilt in our geographical circumstances and with our special difficulties of communication with the outside world?  I do not think any other country in the world could do it.  How would Great Britain react if you went and asked her, if the whole of the black country of the north from Newcastle-on-Tyne to the Clyde were removed in the morning, could she contemplate revitalising these industries through the rural counties of southern England?  If you went to the United States of America and suggested that Pennsylvania and all the industrial east of the U.S.A. should be cut off and that they should re-establish it in Iowa and Colorado they would laugh at you.  That is what we are supposed to do; at least it is what Fianna Fáil thought it could do and has discovered it could not.  Now we are faced with the fact that they cannot stop emigration. We made a substantial reduction in unemployment and we succeeded in 1956 in having the lowest unemployment figure ever recorded in the history of this State&mdash;although there again under the exigencies of a balance of payments situation it shot up again on us and we were getting ready to redeploy our forces when the Fianna Fáil Party came into office and no doubt they are doing their best to deal with the situation.  The fact remains, however, that we ourselves have not the resources to meet this problem but I believe they are accessible to us through the instrumentality of our friends.  We are fools if we do not seek to cultivate as best we can those friends who want to help us or who certainly, when I knew anything of government, wanted to help us, those friends who look upon us as a mother country, as a faithful ally and a dependable companion in all the crises that encompass the world to-day.</P>
    <P>Is it not true that if we could get <Col N="299" /> 20 firms like Monsanto, like some of the great textile and rubber firms of the United States and certain other of the leading groups, to establish a factory here they could easily employ 1,000 men.  If there were 20 such factories, 20,000 men would be drawn into employment in the morning and the products of those factories going into their several marketing organisations would be but a drop in the ocean.  If one doubts that that is so, I want to assure this House that I know of a case in which there was being produced from raw materials in this country an excellent product.  I saw that company move to the very verge of insolvency and I was asked as Minister to meet the directors of a big international firm and to guarantee to that international group my co-operation as Minister for Agriculture in procuring raw materials for that company if this firm undertook to sponsor the local factory's activities in Ireland.  I was happy to be in a position to give that guarantee and within one short 12 months everything that firm could produce was moving into consumption without the slightest trouble.  Every penny of a debt of £250,000 was wiped out within five years and I believe that at this moment the capacity of that plant is being doubled.  All that came about not primarily as a result of any change in the method of manufacture or increased efficiency but because of the industrial miracles achieved by bringing into contact a product of a quality which enabled it to enter an international market with an effective established marketing machine.</P>

We are in the position that we want a higher standard of living for our people, and we cannot get it for them.  They are going abroad to Manchester and London and Birmingham and Southampton in search of it. That is what they are going for.  Is that not true?  They are not going for fun.  They are going all over the world in search of a higher standard of living.  Surely it is a legitimate activity of our Department of External Affairs to search the world to help to get for the people in our own country that standard of living, the search for which is making so many thousands of our people a daily charge on the Minister for External Affairs as emigrants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking him to take any interest in agriculture.  God knows, he is too ready to do that as it is.  He was romping about the corridors of the Department of Agriculture until I had to chase him out. I do not want to make a short answer, but I can bring manifest evidence by pointing out that one of the duties with which the Minister is charged is the maintenance of consular offices all over the world to co-operate with the individuals we are sending abroad to drum up trade.  I am told that the consul in Chicago was involved in a quarrel between the Lord Mayor of Dublin and Deputy Briscoe, because Deputy Briscoe had a bigger gold plate on his bosom than the other, and he could not prevail upon them to come to the same meeting.</P>

I am not sure that the consul was not called upon to measure the two soup plates to see which was the bigger soup plate, but, in the heel of the hunt, the Minister's resources were employed on behalf of Deputy Briscoe, and Deputy Briscoe emerged on the clear understanding that nobody would press too closely as to whether or not his soup plate was the bigger.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Upon my word, Sir, when I read his statement to-day and his concluding statement on the last occasion he presented this Estimate, I began to wonder was he responsible for his Department, because he gives no evidence of it.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I think the plan to which I have made reference now has in it the seed of hope and, with that in mind, I hope the Minister will consider raising it at some suitable time with the Government of the United States, even in an exploratory way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to ask a question of very vital interest.  Does anybody know what is the position in relation to the Free Trade Area?  I, as Minister for Agriculture, attended a meeting; in those days, the Irish Government was always represented by the Minister for Agriculture with O.E.E.C. when matters of Agriculture were involved, and the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Finance and the <Col N="302" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce were called in when questions relevant to their Departments arose.  Now, under the new dispensation, the &ldquo;Pooh-Bah&rdquo; of the Fianna Fáil Government, the Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce, is there every time.  He speaks for Agriculture, External Affairs, for Finance, and for everything else.  Whatever he knows about finance, external affairs and industry and commerce he knows &ldquo;Sweet Fanny Adams&rdquo; about agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the House is discussing the Tánaiste.  The Deputy is referring to the Tánaiste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, and his activities in Paris at the O.E.E.C. discussing the impact of the Free Trade Area on agriculture in Ireland, and I want to put it on record now, internally and externally, in the language of his own Bill, he knows &ldquo;Sweet Fanny Adams&rdquo; about agriculture in this country.</P>
      <P>Will anyone tell me what is the position in regard to the Free Trade Area?  The funny part of it is that every Deputy whom I have heard speak on this Estimate so far seems to take it for granted that it is a highly proper situation that nobody should know anything about the Free Trade Area. I want to ask Deputies has our Minister for External Affairs a duty to inform us, to the best of his ability, as to what he knows about the true situation at this moment in regard to that matter, or has he not?  If he has not, who has?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put this on record, too. The Tánaiste had the courtesy during the Recess to invite myself, Deputy Costello and Deputy Cosgrave to meet him in his Department, where he gave us to the best of his ability, I think, such information as was then at his disposal, and for that courtesy we were grateful.  I believe a similar courtesy was extended to the leaders of the other Parties.  I do not think I shall be guilty of any breach of confidence when I say that the pabulum served to us on that occasion was the thinnest possible gruel, not through any fault of the Tánaiste but because he had not the wherewithal to make a <Col N="303" /> thicker soup, and he very politely diluted the dismal eggspoonful available to him with as much broth as he could generate, and we quaffed the brew and left, in the same state as that in which we had originally gone in.  That was no fault of the Tánaiste. He gave us as much information as he had.</P>
    <P>We have travelled a long way since then and time has passed.  Maudling has made speeches; Macmillan has made speeches; and Pinaud, the French Minister of Finance, has made speeches.  In fact, several French Ministers of Finance have made speeches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And will again.  But I always remember the meeting at which Deputy Cosgrave and I represented this country at O.E.E.C. and at which the Free Trade Area was first mentioned. I think there were 17 nations there that day, all of whose representatives got up and made <i>déclarations</i>, with the exception of ourselves.  I made a short speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which is a different thing from a <i>déclaration.</i>  At the end of the proceedings, the French Minister of Finance&mdash;now, who was it? &mdash;got up and made a most eloquent speech in which he welcomed this glorious thought and in which he assured his colleagues that France was more than willing to accept all the splendid benefits that he saw accruing from this brainwave, but he desired to record that in present circumstances he was sure all his colleagues fully understood France could contribute nothing whatever. We all listened to that.  I remember registering at the time a mental note that, for their own good reason, they did not wish to play and I remember thinking: &ldquo;Here is a Minister who really promotes the vital interest of his own country.  We all know what he is about.  He does not think it suits France to play this game and he is not going to play.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have passed through a good deal of history since then.  There have been <Col N="304" /> Italian plans, French plans, British plans.  At any moment, I suppose we shall have to make plans.  But the one thing we have not yet had is any informative statement from the Minister responsible to this House on what the situation is and what the prospects are.</P>
    <P>We have had innumerable speeches made in the country in which we have been told everybody is to prepare themselves for complete free trade. There is one thing I venture to assert is remote from the truth and that is the speeches of the Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce assuring us we are on the verge of universal free trade.  If he ever thought that, he would be having fits; but, with his usual cynical approach to life, he shrugs his shoulders and says: &ldquo;By the time this thing matures, if it ever does mature, I will be on pension and my successor, on whatever side of the House he sits, will have to answer the problem.&rdquo;  I do not think that is correct.</P>
    <P>Whatever repercussions this may have in the remote future on industry in Ireland, what is of vital and radical importance&mdash;and it may come within three to 12 months&mdash;is the inclusion or non-inclusion of Irish agriculture.  We ought to be informing ourselves as industriously as we possibly can as to the prospects in regard to that sector of the problem.  It is probably true that the impact of the Free Trade Area on the industrial arm of this country will be postponed for from ten to 15 years.  All those who are really concerned intimately with this matter know that as well as I do.  But I am not at all sure that agriculture may not be put in serious difficulties, and at an early date.</P>
    <P>What will happen if we are confronted with a situation in which our traditional markets for agricultural produce are raided by persons inside or outside the Free Trade Area, if it ultimately comes, and we are precluded by some undertaking given by us from taking any measures designed to offset the raiding potential of another country in a traditional market of ours?  At this stage I do not know the answer, because I do not know the scope or nature of the problem, but I <Col N="305" /> want to go on record quite clearly as saying this.  It is little short of a scandal that the Minister for External Affairs should introduce the Estimate for External Affairs to this House, without making any attempt whatever to tell us what the facts are.</P>
    <P>The reason, of course, as the House knows, is not far to seek.  This is the old technique of the Taoiseach.  He always introduces his Estimate by saying: &ldquo;I have nothing to say, but if anybody else says anything, I will be very glad to answer him.&rdquo;  The object of that is that he should have the last word.  That has been a kind of pathological obsession with that man for the past 40 years.  It is perhaps the only feminine quality in his character.</P>

Parliament and parliamentary government is one of the most difficult of all systems of government to operate because it predicates that every servant of the State shall treat this Parliament, representative of the Irish people, with the respect due to the people, quite divorced from any Deputy's personal reaction to the personnel of the House. When any Minister of State reaches the conclusion that, as a result of the majority he commands in the House, he has a right to treat the House as a whole with indifference and contempt, let him beware because he is digging <Col N="306" /> away the foundations on which his own authority depends.</P>
    <P>It is from this House that Governments are chosen.  It is by the authority of this House that Governments claim the respect to which they are entitled, and it is because they have been designated through this House by the people as the recipients of the Divine Authority, that the Government are entitled to govern us as they do.  Wipe out this House or bring its reputation so low that it is no longer regarded as necessary by the people of Ireland, and we lose not only the Parliament but freedom and individual liberty as well.</P>
    <P>Do not forget that there is all too common an illusion abroad at present. Most people living under the blessed institutions of freedom have the idea that the world at large is moving, albeit slowly and haltingly, to the realisation of this kind of freedom. There is no greater illusion than that for free peoples to fall into.  There is only a very small part of the human race to-day enjoying the kind of freedom we have here.  Those changes that have taken place in recent years have been changes from freedom to tyranny, and in almost no case from tyranny to freedom.</P>
    <P>The freedom of every one of us depends upon the slender thread of the esteem this House enjoys, and I say advisedly &ldquo;this House&rdquo;.  The measure of that esteem is profoundly influenced by the attitude of Ministers, especially when they are supported by a clear majority of the Deputies of Dáil Éireann.  The attitude of the Minister for External Affairs to-day is well calculated to bring this House into contempt. If for no other reason it deserves the censure of the Deputies, wherever they may sit.</P>
    <P>But in some degree the insolence of his initial approach may be mitigated by the attention he directs to his task of answering clearly the categorical questions that have been put to him from this side of the House.  I have not much hope of the present Minister performing this duty conscientiously, but I do not propose to condemn him until at least I have given him the <Col N="307" /> chance of regaining his somewhat ragged reputation.</P>

      <P>Lest anybody in reading the Deputy's speech might think that there was some basis for his allegation that I was not profoundly devoted to parliamentary procedure, let me say that the gentleman who has made that accusation once tried to put an end to this House when he trotted in with a blue shirt and when his leader at that time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who says I am not very devoted to parliamentary procedure must recollect, as well as the people of the country who take an interest in public affairs&mdash;which is the vast majority of them&mdash;that it is only a couple of months ago since the same accusations were made by Deputy Dillon and his friends in a long-drawn-out formal debate censuring the Government for my actions and speeches in the United Nations.  The Dáil turned down the Vote by a two-to-one majority.  Deputy Dillon shows his contempt for parliamentary procedure and for the will of a two-to-one majority in this House by repeating exactly the same type of speech and accusations which were repudiated by a two-to-one majority in this House a couple of months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What a very revealing <Col N="308" /> observation on the part of the Minister! That is his idea of freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Dillon had had his way, we would all have to &ldquo;keep our pig's snout&rdquo; out of this House; there would have been no House; they would have handed down their ukase and told us how to behave.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello repeated the same questions here to-day which I answered on the occasion on which the Vote of No Confidence in the Government was before the House in relation to External Affairs a few months ago and I shall not repeat my answer.  We are all grown up in the country.  No people in the world take as keen and as intelligent an interest in foreign affairs as the people of all parts of Ireland.  I do not want to make any arguments about the various suggestions made to try to break the impasse in world affairs and to bring about a state of affairs where peoples will live in peace, their disputes settled by law and enforced by some legally established law enforcement authority.</P>
      <P>All I can say about the various proposals for disengagement in Europe is that I do not believe the American people want to keep their soldiers on the Rhine for ever.  At some time or another, if there is to be peace and if East Germany, Poland, Hungary and these other countries are to get the freedom that we all hope they will get, there must be a stepping back of forces.  They are not going to stay there forever, we hope, and I think the sooner they begin to draw back a mile or two or a yard or two, the better for everybody, and give a chance to the real forces of peace and the forces of reason to get going.</P>
      <P>The Free Trade Area proposals have been discussed here at some length.  As Deputy Dillon revealed here, the Tánaiste, who is charged particularly by the Government to carry out the negotiations in Paris in relation to this matter, saw the Leaders of the various Parties in the House and explained to them exactly, as far as he was able to describe them the intricate difficulties of the present negotiations for a Free Trade Area.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps.  I am perfectly certain, as the Tánaiste has said before in the House in relation to this matter, that if there are any Deputies who think that an interview with him in this matter will help them to make up their minds or who want information on the Free Trade Area, as far as he knows of the negotiations, he will be quite prepared to see the Leaders of the Opposition Parties in that regard.</P>

People who have been following the papers and the difficulties that the Free Trade Area idea has run into can see that it would take a prophet to foretell what is going to be the course of events in relation to negotiations for a Free Trade Area or its association with the Common Market or any of these other matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knew it too well before.  I should like to say that I appreciate what has been said about the officials of the Department and their activities, their loyalty and hard work, both at home and abroad.  I should wish that we were in a position to multiply our activities, to have the amount of staff that the various Deputies have proposed in the various Legations abroad but at the present time we are spending £400,000 odd on the Department of External Affairs proper; we are spending nearly another £90,000 odd on our representation at the United Nations.  The Minister for Finance, I think, thinks that it is more than we can afford and he <Col N="310" /> asked me to try to reduce the amount instead of increasing it, as the Deputies suggested.</P>
      <P>We did succeed in reducing the Vote for the Department of External Affairs somewhat but, in spite of this, the Vote for the various organisations has gone up.  There are a couple of items where there is increased expenditure which Deputy Esmonde and others welcomed and I think we are entitled to show our gratitude for the benefits we have received by doing what we can to help countries in greater need.  The slight increase in the funds that we are giving for the relief of children will be very well spent and may relieve a great deal of hardship of suffering young ones.</P>
      <P>The amount that we are spending, also, for technical assistance to underdeveloped areas will, I think, help to bring about an increase in the standard of life in areas that are very much worse off than we are.  We would all like to see our own country better off than it is but, compared with many countries that are being helped by this fund, we are very rich indeed.</P>
      <P>The United Nations force we discussed a very short time ago.  We have increased the amount this year of the Vote for that purpose.  I think it is one of the most favourable indications that has come out of U.N.O. We trust that that force at some time or another will be in a position to carry out and enforce law, peace and justice where disputes have been adjudicated upon by a properly organised court of justice under that organisation.</P>
