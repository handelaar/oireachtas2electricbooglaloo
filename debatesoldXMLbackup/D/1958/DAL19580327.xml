      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, I made the point that unless some such phrase as I suggested is used in paragraphs (e) and (f), the interpretation might be that the same business had to be carried on.  Saying &ldquo;such business was carried on continuously in the State between the 2nd day of July, 1934&rdquo; is the same as if one said such company carried on any business continuously.</P>

      <P>Any manufacturing business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any manufacturing business?  I want to know why was it necessary in the 1934 Act to extend the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; by adding in the phrase I have used?  It possibly is not the same, but that is the gist of it. The phrase used in the 1932 Act was &ldquo;business&rdquo; and &ldquo;business&rdquo; had to be <Col N="1101" /> extended.  If the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; simply means continuing business, being in business to do manufacturing process A at one time and continuing business by switching over to manufacturing process B and then continuing by switching over to manufacturing process C, why was it necessary, if that is permissible, why were these words added?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;reasonable extension of existing business&rdquo; is in the 1932 Act, as well as in the 1934 Act.  The intention in 1932 was to allow any company to continue in the business in which it was engaged or any reasonable extension of it.  That position will continue under this Bill. Any company which was engaged in manufacturing business in 1932 will be entitled to continue in that manufacturing business, or any reasonable extension of that business, in the future. The only limitation which will be placed on that company is that the business must be a manufacturing business. In the case of 1934 Act companies which were entitled to operate without a licence before the passing of that Act, they were still entitled to continue in any business without a licence.</P>
      <P>That position has been continued under this measure.  The inclusion of these provisions is due to the desire to have in one section all the conditions under which manufacturing can be carried on.  Provided that any one of these conditions is fulfilled, manufacturing operations can be carried on. There is no change in the position established under the 1934 Act.  I think it might be no harm to insert the indefinite article &ldquo;a&rdquo; before the word business.  As it is the intention to leave the position the same as it is, the same phraseology might be used. Whatever interpretation was put on the phrase in the 1934 Act will continue to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the change in the 1934 Act, the matter was put negatively, but here the words are &ldquo;It shall be lawful&rdquo;.  That makes no change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that it does, it is only a change in the <Col N="1102" /> phraseology.  What is intended is to put here in a positive way the conditions that obtain under the 1934 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not seem to me to make any difference whether it is put in a positive or a negative way. It is not suggested that the putting in of the word &ldquo;a&rdquo; makes any change. That is only to say that it must be a business carried on by way of trade and what is aimed at is to carry on any manufacturing process.  What is required is continuity, not in respect of business generally, but in respect of a business carrying on a particular manufacturing process.  That is not contained in paragraph (e).  It must be a business carrying on a particular manufacturing process.  If it is a business carrying on any manufacturing process, my amendment might appear to be a limiting one.</P>
      <P>In the 1932 Act, there is an extension of the word &ldquo;business&rdquo;.  It means that you look back at what is being done; but you look back at a business which. was in the same trade in 1932 and see that what has now been done is a part of, or an extension of, that business. It was necessary to put those words in the 1932 Act.  They were carried forward in the 1934 Act and they are here again in this legislation.  You have the phrase &ldquo;such business&rdquo; in paragraphs (e) and (f) and in (f) you find to a certain extent the extension I am looking for.  If it is necessary to put these things in for some purpose or other, it makes me feel that the phrase &ldquo;such business&rdquo; is possible of definition as a business carried on on 3rd July, 1934.  I do not think that the suggestion of &ldquo;a business&rdquo; would get over it.  What do the words &ldquo;such business&rdquo; mean?  Is it a business in which a certain manufacturing process was carried on or is it any business? Is that what is meant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing only the question of drafting here. What we want to provide is that a company which was in operation before the 1932 Act shall be permitted to continue in the same manufacturing business as it was engaged in then, or any reasonable extension of that business. We also want to ensure that a company <Col N="1103" /> formed after 1932, but affected by the provisions of the 1934 Act, can continue to carry on any manufacturing business, provided it was qualified to carry on that business under the 1932 Act.  Deputy McGilligan has some doubts as to whether the Bill achieves that and that is the only point between us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only point.  I recognise that there is a big distinction between the 1932 type of business and the 1934 type of business. If the phrase &ldquo;such business&rdquo; refers to the enlarged business, why enlarge it any further?  That enlargement is carried on here.  As it stands, it seems to me that it is a matter which will call for interpretation.  If any court came to construe this matter, it would take up the same line of construction as it takes in connection with any documents.  If you suggest that a thing has to be enlarged in one way&mdash;say, in one sense of particulars&mdash;in certain circumstances, you are taking the meaning that you do not want that extension applied in other circumstances. That is what I am afraid of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the matter not be dealt with in the manner the Minister suggested?  Could it not be rectified by putting in &ldquo;a&rdquo; in front of &ldquo;business&rdquo; where the word occurs in this section?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to do that.  I do not know that it makes any difference.  I think it is better to have the precise words used in the 1934 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 4 would then read: &ldquo;such a business&rdquo; and, to make the matter even more clear, add the phrase: &ldquo;carrying on any manufacturing process.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the preamble of Section 9 of the 1934 Act. Notwithstanding that the term &ldquo;a <Col N="1104" /> business&rdquo; was used for certain purposes, it would be necessary to define &ldquo;such business&rdquo;, meaning the business carried on at the earlier date or any extension or departure from it. Therefore, the word &ldquo;a&rdquo; did not carry the interpretation I am asking for in the 1934 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1934 Act, it has been found necessary, for some purposes, to define &ldquo;business&rdquo; as part of it or extension of it in respect of any business regarding which the phrase &ldquo;such business&rdquo; was used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not any business. There are three categories of companies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will allow me, I know about the categories. The only way in which I would be impressed by any recital of the categories would be if the phrase &ldquo;such business or any manufacturing process&rdquo; were used with some limitation in some or other of them and not in respect of the others.  Here we get the words &ldquo;such business&rdquo; that fall for interpretation. It does not matter what the categories are, they have to be modified.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Several amendments are affected by amendment No. 18&mdash;amendments Nos. 19, 35 and 36.  I suggest that they might be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 35 and 36 might be regarded in a certain way as consequential but I think they have a point of their own distinct from amendments Nos. 18 or 19.  Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 may be taken together.  I move amendment No. 18:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 35, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo; where it secondly occurs.</P>
      <P>I am also dealing with amendment No. 19 which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 36 to 38, inclusive, except &ldquo;or&rdquo; in line 38.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> In other words, amendment No. 19 seeks to cut out sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (e) of Section 4 (1), it therefore being necessary to cut out the conjunctive which joins them.  That would mean that one of the ways in which the company could be excluded would be if the business had been carried on continuously in the State between the 2nd day of July, 1934, and the relevant time.  Why add &ldquo;relevant time&rdquo; in a qualifying business?  These businesses have become qualified.  Are they likely to lose their status?  My suggestion is that, having started them under certain conditions&mdash;if they have started and have been run since 1934&mdash;why not let them run on and take away these conditions about a qualified business?  I understand &ldquo;qualified business&rdquo; refers to the shareholding.  If you have companies that started here and qualified, and have remained qualified for all these years, why not simply have a new start now and say that any business which has been in operation here since the 2nd July, 1934, will be allowed to carry on, no matter what its shareholding conditions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more than shareholding involved.  There is also the question of directorships.  The Deputy is correct in assuming that this section continues, the same as that inserted in the 1934 Act, any business which had been carried on continuously since 1934 and which, at the time they were established, complied with the requirements of the 1932 Act in regard to shareholding and which now comply with that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deletion of the paragraph to which the Deputy refers&mdash;which requires that the business is, at the relevant time, a qualified business within the meaning of Part II of the First Schedule to this Bill&mdash;would mean the removal of the obligation to comply with the requirements of the 1932 Act.  Then, any manufacturing company, conducted continuously since the 2nd July, 1934, would not be required to comply with these requirements of the Acts as regards either shareholding and directorships.  I do not think that is desirable.  I think the opening up of that channel by which external companies that did not <Col N="1106" /> wish to apply in any other way for authorisation to carry on business here or which were refused, on good grounds, the necessary permit or authorisation, could nevertheless acquire the authority to engage in manufacture by securing a controlling interest in the existing company. These companies were fully safeguarded under the 1934 Act.  Their shareholding and directorship obligations were less restrictive than was required under the 1934 Act, but, nevertheless, they were allowed to continue and engage in any form of manufacture. The suggestion that they should now continue to enjoy that privilege, even if they sell out completely to external interests, is undesirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how they can retain an interest by selling out completely.  Certain companies are mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d).  We now come to sub-paragraphs (e) and (f).  Under sub-paragraphs (e) and (f), one has to have these conditions: (1) the business must have been carried on continuously in the State between the 2nd day of July, 1934, and the relevant time&mdash;the time something is called for investigation, and (2) the business must, at the relevant time, be a qualified business within the meaning of Part II of the First Schedule to this Bill, that is, it must have been carried on between the 1st June, 1932, and the relevant time. I am collapsing, as far as the time is concerned.  Since the 2nd July, 1934, continuously, it ought to be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though they no longer have any Irish shareholders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have Irish shareholders now&mdash;they must have. If one takes in paragraphs (ii) in each of sub-paragraphs (e) and (f), there is a different type of shareholding requirement but they are there.  You have existing businesses.  They are here since July, 1934.  They have a particular capital set-up.  Say, why not let them carry on?  If they are not the same business, then there will have to be a new application.  That was my point about the &ldquo;continuously&rdquo;. If they are in any business, but in any business having the required <Col N="1107" /> shareholding, they are here and have been here for some time. Are they likely to change their capital set-up?  They are here doing business under the Acts.  At least 60 per cent. of those affected by these Acts are not complying with the Acts in a real and proper way.  There are all sorts of loopholes in the Companies Acts and many people have availed themselves of these ways of escape.  Take the people who have abided by the Acts. Take one ruling date, 2nd July, 1934. Certain people have conformed to what is really required in the way of shareholding.  They are established. Are they likely now to change over and have shareholders of a different type?  Will they change the whole capital make-up?  They have been able to pull along since 1934 under these Acts.  They have gone through their qualifying period.  Now the Minister should say to these: &ldquo;We will let you carry on.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I suggest that should be done.  Anyone who comes under Section 3, or who is doing business solely for export, is immediately outside the scope of the Acts.  That is so in the case of any new applicant who does not fall under Section 3; but, in relation to those to whom I have referred, they have passed their qualifying period and they should be allowed to continue. The likelihood of their making a new arrangement in regard to shareholding and the number of directors of Irish nationality is very remote indeed. As these people have obeyed the law for so long, this gesture would be some recognition of what they have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy fully appreciates what he is proposing.  As the law stands, and will continue, any of these companies qualified within Part II of the Schedule of this Bill&mdash;companies set up in accordance with the provisions of the 1932 Act and continued under the 1934 Act&mdash;can engage in any manufacturing operation whatever without restriction.  We will not put a restriction on them, except that the shareholding qualification to which <Col N="1108" /> they conformed when established under the 1932 Act shall be maintained.  If we were to waive that, in view of the fact that these companies can engage in any manufacturing operations, then the whole Act would fall to the ground, because any foreign company could come into any manufacturing business here even to supply the home market alone.</P>
      <P>In the ordinary course, they would not be given a licence on that ground, but, if we were to accept this, they need do nothing except get a controlling interest in some existing business and they would then be free to manufacture anything.  The Deputy is putting it a little too simply because he is contemplating a business of the same kind carrying on and continuing. The fact is that any of these companies under this Act, so long as they continue to be qualified under the 1932 Act, can engage in any manufacturing operation whatsoever.  The Deputy suggests they should not be subject to the restrictive qualification of the 1932 Act.  That means we would be leaving the door wide open to a foreign manufacturer to engage in any kind of manufacturing operation and the rest of the provisions of the Act would become completely inoperative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not extend the number of businesses of an industrial type in the country at the moment.  I think the Minister understands that. The Minister makes the point that you might have a business for manufacturing process A., and it could switch over and do another manufacturing process.  I did not think that was the interpretation given to &ldquo;continuous&rdquo;, but even if it is, it does not make much difference.  We have X number of firms here at the moment and they have been carrying on since a date in July, 1934, and have accommodated themselves in their requirements in regard to shareholding.  I suggest we should say to these: &ldquo;Since you have been here since 1934, you can carry on.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In any business, but, on my interpretation, it would be <Col N="1109" /> the same business.  Even taking the wider connotation, in any business, I am sure the Minister is well aware that many businesses in operation here have qualified by date under the 1932 and the 1934 Acts and have since been sold to others.  There is a traffic in these businesses.  They change over to other things.</P>
      <P>There is a matter in that connection in which I was personally interested, where there was a question of buying land on the outskirts of the south side of the city, and the company that bought that land was a company called &ldquo;Steel Holdings, Limited&rdquo;.  They were trafficking in land in order to escape the 25 per cent. and they were able to buy a company which had really gone out of business, but there had been such a company, and they were keeping up a sort of facade.  That is what is happening under these old Acts.</P>
      <P>But I am talking about the people who have qualified in the proper way and I say we should say to them: &ldquo;If you have been here since a date in 1934 continuously, we will let you carry on.&rdquo;  The Minister seems to think there will be a good deal of trafficking and a company doing one type of business will switch over to another type.  Why should they?  They have been engaged in business in a certain manufacturing process.  Will they change to a different one?  My suggestion is that we should simply wipe out all these old controls, as far as the people who are already here are concerned. For any people who want to come in hereafter, either the 1934 Act, as extended, will apply, or else this 1958 Act will apply.  But I do not increase the number of businesses.</P>

      <P>The matter to which the Deputy has referred&mdash;the acquiring of old companies for the purpose of buying land&mdash;has nothing whatsoever to do with the Control of Manufactures Acts.  That arises out of the provisions of the Finance Act imposing stamp duty.  Here we are dealing with something quite different.  We say to certain companies: &ldquo;Provided you were established in accordance with the provisions of the 1932 Act, you are entitled, notwithstanding the more <Col N="1110" /> restrictive provisions of the 1934 Act, to continue in business in any manufacturing process.&rdquo;  We are not altering that.  These people are still entitled to engage in any manufacturing business, provided they conform to the provisions of the 1932 Act.  The Deputy says we should wipe out even that proviso.  That means that any company now in existence is entitled to engage in any manufacturing business of any kind whatsoever even if it sells out to external interests.  I think that would leave the whole situation wide open.  There would be no regulation and no restriction of any kind.</P>

      <P>You cannot have it both ways.  We have just discussed the question of whether a company carrying on business can alter its process of manufacture from, say, soap to chocolate. At the same time, to allow an outsider to come in and acquire such a business with that proviso would negative the whole Bill.  It would be far easier to withdraw the Bill and give <i>carte blanche</i> to anybody to come in. If we are to do as Deputy McGilligan says, we must depart from what we were discussing a few minutes ago, because the company cannot be given <Col N="1112" /> the right to alter the process of manufacture. It would be only too simple for a company, which wanted to compete with another existing company, or to keep out an outside competitor, to come in and acquire a company, change the process of manufacture, or go out of business altogether.  It must be one or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I want to direct attention to the sub-section. Sub-section (3) was not in the original draft.  It came in on ministerial amendment.  Originally, it was intended to delete Section 9, but Section 9 still stands although I am not sure how much stands.  Section 9 is amended from the words at the end of the preamble down all the paragraphs to (e). Section 9 of the 1934 Act states that &ldquo;it shall not be lawful for any person to carry on business ...&rdquo; and so on, &ldquo;unless either,&rdquo; and there follows a series of paragraphs that run from page 11 to page 17 in my copy of the Act.  I take it that the whole of that goes out?  All we keep is the preamble stating it is not lawful to do certain <Col N="1113" /> things.  Then we have the contrary to that, in the positive phrase in Section 4 that it shall be lawful to do all these same things, if these conditions are complied with, so that the whole of Section 9, sub-section (1) is abolished.</P>
      <P>The next paragraph (d) abolishes sub-sections (2), (3) and (4).  As I read the matter, the only part of Section 9 of the 1934 Act now left is the preamble and sub-section (5).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>All of Section 9 is gone, with the exception of the preamble and that part.  In addition to that, the 1934 Act is amended by (a) which says: &ldquo;References to a person shall be construed as references to a company and not to an individual.&rdquo; Any individual or group of individuals, so long as they do not incorporate themselves, can do anything.  All persons may operate without any question of licences and so on.  They can be in partnerships or any other set up, so long as they are not incorporated.</P>
      <P>There is another matter in connection with shares.  The only shares that are controlled by Section 3 are ordinary shares.  Preference shares do not come into the matter at all.  By definition of the 1932 Act, the term &ldquo;share&rdquo; includes either preference or debenture shares.</P>
      <P>In addition, the manufacturing process is defined here.  It means that the manufacturing process must include the mechanical power.  Any business that does not use mechanical power is clear out of the Acts.  Any people, whether they use mechanical power or not, are clear out of the Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice also that Section 9 is amended in the following respects: &ldquo;(b) the reference, in sub-section (1) to doing any of the specified things shall be construed as a reference to carrying on any manufacturing process.&rdquo;<Col N="1114" /> That is not for the purposes of this Act.  That is generally.  It is everything to do with manufacturing processes.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong, but my judgment on this piece of legislation is that it is intended as a liberalising effort.  The liberalisation really stops at Sections 3 and 4.  Section 4 permits the doing of certain things, down to paragraph (i).  One of these refers to a business carried on for export, that is, solely, but &ldquo;solely&rdquo; is defined as meaning that less than 10 per cent. was sold on the home market, and the company is an excluded company. That gets back to Section 3.  Letter paragraph (c) gets back to ministerial intervention.  It is the Minister who grants the certificate of exemption. Letter paragraph (d) refers to a qualified company within the meaning of Part I.  That is the old system.  Paragraphs (e) and (f) are definitely the old system&mdash;the capital set-up and the shareholding and the directors&mdash;(g)&mdash; the manufacturing licence&mdash;that is still the old arrangement&mdash;and (h) is somewhat new.  I want to ask a question about that.  Paragraph (i) is merely the matter of carrying on a business that is in the hands of a receiver.  That is common to all these things.</P>
    <P>As far as this is to be considered as part of the liberalisation process, that process is confined to letter paragraph (a) and letter paragraph (b).  The rest is the old control all over again&mdash;the requirements with regard to shareholding, directors or, else, one goes to the Department to get a certificate of exemption or to get a new manufacturing licence.  So that the whole liberal features of this now are narrowly confined to Section 3 and Section 4, letter paragraphs (a) and (b).</P>
    <P>There is the liberalisation in the end in sub-section (3), that all people are out who are not incorporated, and that there has to be use of mechanical power before the old code of Acts grips anybody at all.  How far that will make any change, I do not know.  I do not know what business would have been caught by the 1932 and 1934 Acts who use something other than mechanical power.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> I am not too sure what (h) means, at least, what the difference is.  In the original Act it was the &ldquo;assets of the company and used in the company&rdquo;. At any rate, the purpose of the amendment is said to be that it is the assets that are used and not the assets that are owned that is what is looked at. That is what I gather.  It is the third of the Minister's amendments.  The effect of the amendment was to allow paragraph (1) (h) to mean the assets used in a business.  In the Bill as introduced this would apply to the assets owned by a company and used in its business.  I do not accept that. The old phrase was that a company is a company the fixed assets &ldquo;of which&rdquo;.  Apparently that phrase &ldquo;of which&rdquo; has been interpreted &ldquo;owned by which&rdquo;.  Is that right?  That was the old phrase which has gone.  In the original draft the phrase was &ldquo;such company the fixed assets of which used in its business do not exceed £5,000&rdquo;. Now we have got rid of that and put in &ldquo;the fixed assets used&rdquo;, that is to say, whether they are the assets of a company or not.  I take it &ldquo;of which&rdquo; was interpreted or intended to mean &ldquo;owned by the company&rdquo; and that that has now gone.  If so, that to my mind, is going a little bit back on the liberalisation process.</P>
    <P>Let me take a case.  Supposing a company leased a factory premises, say, paying £500 a year rent.  On a ten-years' purchase of that, the property leased in that way would be worth £5,000.  Suppose they get machinery which was worth, say, £2,000.  Am I to take it that both the premises and the machinery used are now to be looked at for the purpose of calculating whether the assets exceed £5,000 or not?  Are we finding it entirely on the assets used as opposed to what the company owns, so that anything a company hires or pays money for, as long as it uses it, will all be brought into this calculation of whether there is an excess of £5,000 or not?  If so, then I, personally, would have preferred the other phrase but I had not known the &ldquo;of which&rdquo; would have drawn down this interpretation of &ldquo;owned by the company&rdquo;.  Apparently, however, that is so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> If that is the position, there may be some very difficult situations arising as there is quite a number of companies in the country that do not operate in buildings which they themselves own; they get a lease of buildings. I presume now that there is some calculation made of the value of the building, not the amount paid by way of rent for a lease, but the value of the building will be taken in and then that and the machinery will be added together for the purpose of seeing whether it is £5,000 or not, the aim being that if the company's fixed assets are not in excess of £5,000 the Acts are not going to bother about it. It is only companies over £5,000.  There may be a lot of companies dragged into this unintentionally by this very big enlargement of the phrase &ldquo;the assets used in the business&rdquo;.  The company might get machinery, even, on lease to themselves.  They might hire machinery for a number of years and pay a rental for it, but all these things, as this new paragraph is, will all be counted for the purpose of finding out whether there is an excess of £5,000 or not. That being the case, there is not any great liberalisation in this.</P>
    <P>I criticise Section 4 on the basis that the only two good parts of this Bill are Sections 3 and 4.  The virtue of Section 4 stops at paragraphs (a) and (b).  It might have stopped at (h) if the old phrase was allowed in, namely, that you measure the assets by the ownership and not by the use.  There is then the better, certain, liberalisation in sub-section (3) so far as individuals are left out and so far as the manufacturing conditions that are necessary in connection with any of these manufacturing processes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the points to which the Deputy referred in sub-section (3) first, it is correct that the Acts will not in future apply to any business carried on otherwise than by a company.  A business carried on by an individual or partnership will be outside the scope of the Acts.  Also, manufacturing operations which do not involve the use of mechanical power or which do not involve operations, such as are indicated in Section 2, are outside the scope of the Act.  Thirdly, <Col N="1117" /> companies which are set up here to do mainly export business, companies which are interested in the home market only incidentally, are excluded and, of course, also, companies which are engaged in the production of commodities which are excepted by ministerial Order under Section 2.  In so far as liberalisation means putting manufacturing operations outside the scope of the 1934 Act, it is correct that it is only in respect of these matters that there is complete exclusion from the scope of the Act.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that Section 5 does not represent considerable improvement on the present position.  We can discuss that when we come to Section 5.  But, it is, I think, generally realised that most companies starting up in business are not in a position to finance themselves by public issues of shares at that stage.  The normal commercial practice would be for a company to finance itself in other ways and then to seek to make a public issue of its shares only when it has established the success of its enterprise and its profitability.  At that stage, a company which was established otherwise than in accordance with the requirements of Section 3 can apply for and get a certificate exempting it from the Control of Manufactures Acts, an irrevocable certificate, at least, a certificate that cannot be revoked as long as the company remains in business or unless it itself asks for revocation.</P>
      <P>Similarly, an existing Irish company with shares quoted on the Stock Exchange, which is now required to check every transfer of its shares in order to ensure that it does not infringe the provisions of the 1934 Act, can be exempted from the requirements of that Act so that its shares can be freely transferred and so that it can, if it proposes to extend its operations for export, obtain new capital from external sources by a transfer of shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraphs (c) and (f) of Section 4 are, as I said, merely designed to deal with the situation that exists at present and paragraph (h) also represents another relaxation of the conditions of the 1934 Act.  It exempts from the Act small businesses, but it is <Col N="1118" /> necessary when doing that to make sure that exemption does not become a loophole for the evasion of the Act. It is essential that the words used in the paragraph should be those which are in it, that the reference should be to &ldquo;assets used in the business&rdquo; because otherwise there would be the danger that companies would evade the obligations of the Act by presenting that they did not own the assets they are using.  That, as it is well known, I think, has been a device not infrequently used in the past to evade the necessity for seeking a licence under the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, as I said, exempting from the Act manufacturing enterprises which are not owned by companies, manufacturing enterprises which are small in their scale of operations, which are financed by the offer of shares to Irish shareholders subject to the conditions set out in Section 3 which are primarily concerned with export business; or which are engaged in the manufacture of commodities which can be exempted under Section 2.  In respect of all other concerns we are making arrangements in Section 5 which will be more satisfactory than the existing arrangements of the 1934 Act.</P>
    <P>The certificate of exemption provided for in Section 5 cannot carry any conditions except two; it will specify the commodities in respect of which exemption is given and it will require the commencement of operations within a specific time.  But there can be no other conditions attached to these certificates which when given are irrevocable and operate to meet the particular problems to which I referred, that of the company which intends to finance itself by the public issue of shares at some stage after coming into operation and the existing Irish company which wishes to have freedom to transfer its shares even to an external concern so that it can extend its capacity to go into the export business.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is possible to go any further except to the extent of repealing the Control of Manufactures Act altogether and I do not think that <Col N="1119" /> would be desirable as it would be a breach of faith with many existing Irish firms and clearly so in respect of a number of firms to whom fairly specific undertakings were given by various Governments during the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>I think we must protect the position in respect of manufacturing operations which are solely intended to supply the home market and where existing firms are already meeting the full needs of the country we should prevent the incursion of wholly foreign-owned companies coming into that field.  They are certainly welcome to come in with any manufacturing operation here so long as by doing so they will add to the industrial development of the country either by meeting the home market requirements of goods now imported or adding to our exports.</P>
    <P>I can understand the submission of an argument, with which I would have some sympathy, in favour of the complete repeal of the Control of Manufactures Act in present circumstances but I think it would be a dubious and dangerous course to follow because one could not see exactly the possible repercussions on existing enterprises or their development.</P>
    <P>I already mentioned, arising out of the possibility of agreement for a Free Trade Area in Europe, that the matter may have to be reconsidered, because one of the likely provisions of that agreement will relate to the right of companies in one European country to establish themselves in another.  That is still somewhat uncertain but until that obligation is forced on us by international convention&mdash;assuming that we adhere to it&mdash;I do not think we should go the whole way to repealing the Control of Manufactures Act altogether.  In any case I think we would always require that external companies should be registered here, managed and controlled in the country and that they should be, in that sense, separate enterprises which could pursue their activities with regard only to the possibilities that are open to them and not be dependent upon decisions taken by boards of management located abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> I have always held the view that industrial development by way of branch factory under external control would be a very undesirable type of development because these branch factories would always be the first to go in circumstances of trade depression and would never be allowed to develop beyond the limits determined by people who are not concerned with the interests of this country, but only with their own particular interests.  I believe that in another part of Ireland they are already experiencing some of the problems associated with industrial development by way of branch factories that are externally controlled.  I feel we can reasonably require that companies proposing to manufacture here, especially where they are receiving assistance in the form of protection, grants or otherwise, should at least be Irish companies in the sense of being managed and controlled within the State.  Therefore I do not see the circumstances arising in which we would think it good policy to legislate otherwise than on that basis, but in present circumstances I think this Bill represents the limits to which we can go. As I already indicated in the course of the Second Reading debate, I am prepared to consider practical proposals to go further provided we do not go to the extent where it can be alleged that we are defaulting on our commitments to other enterprises already established.</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied with, and I would agree with the desires expressed by the Minister in regard to this Bill but I think that the first paragraph (a) which says &ldquo;such company carries on business solely for export ...&rdquo; would be a deterrent; I do not think it has the liberalising purpose desired and departs somewhat from the objects of this Bill.  I would like to see the word &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; written in instead of &ldquo;solely&rdquo;, and I would like that the qualifying section on page 5, sub-section (2) on page 5 should stop at the word &ldquo;commodity&rdquo;.  In other words, it would read: &ldquo;such company carries on business mainly for export&rdquo; qualified by paragraph (2) on page 5: &ldquo;... any manufacturing process are <Col N="1121" /> incidental only to its export trade in that commodity ...&rdquo;, and stop there. I think that would be real encouragement to outside capital to come in and to my mind it would clarify the position completely rather than by retaining the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo;, which does not mean solely when you depart from 100 per cent. by having 10 per cent. allowed for the home market and 90 per cent. for export.</P>

      <P>I would agree with the Minister.  I appreciate, as the Minister does, that many of these firms are there over the past 25 years or more and it would be wrong to take a radical step which might injure them severely.  However, there is every prospect of the Free Trade Area coming into being in Europe in the years ahead and now is the time to prepare for that.  Personally speaking, I would welcome the influx of a greater number of efficient foreign companies who would be prepared to establish plants here to engage mainly in the export trade.  As regards &ldquo;mainly in the export trade&rdquo; I would say anything over 50 per cent. would be reasonable.  It would be a good thing for the country generally, from the point of view of the export potential and of employment. I see no point in changing the wording unless the 10 per cent. is also liberalised.</P>

I cannot see that any industry set up under the existing Control of Manufactures Act would be as greatly prejudiced as he envisages.  If a new foreign competitor wanted to come in to deal in the home market and found <Col N="1122" /> an existing industry here I cannot imagine that his first reaction would be to establish a brand new factory and plant when all he would have to do would be to make a reasonably attractive offer for the taking over of the existing company here.</P>
      <P>To say that this is any great liberalisation is an exaggeration. Admittedly the individuals and partnerships are now excluded.  Admittedly also you are excluded if the fixed assets in the business do not exceed £5,000 in value.  However, that seems to apply only to back-street businesses.  There is no business of any value to the country which could work on fixed assets of less than £5,000.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is prepared to amend paragraph (a) of sub-section (1), as he has expressed that he is probably willing to do, I am still not quite happy about sub-section (2) on page 5.  While I can see the desirability of giving some definition of what &ldquo;mainly for export&rdquo; would be, I foresee a tremendous amount of difficulty in deciding the exact proportion.  Ten per cent. of the quantity of the commodity is what is set out in the Bill, but from the interpretation point of view, I do not know what that means.</P>
      <P>A commodity may mean anything. Take, for instance, that there is a new factory being set up for the manufacture of cranes down in Kerry.  These cranes might be enormous cranes valued at £5,000 to £10,000 each.  They might at the same time be manufacturing some workshop hoists worth £50. Of their output of cranes what would 10 per cent. mean?  Would it be 10 per cent. of the number of units or 10 per cent. of the value of the total output? I can see a tremendous amount of haggling and dodging through loopholes by anybody who wants to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A commodity to my mind in this context is not something like matches, cigarettes, and so on.  It could cover anything manufactured by a certain manufacturing process.  You could have somebody manufacturing steel tanks.  These might be open steel tanks of enormous capacity or cylindrical steel tanks of 5,000, 10,000 or 15,000 gallons capacity.  It might mean that by the same manufacturing process you <Col N="1123" /> could have very small tanks made for domestic use.  In this case also, is it the number of tanks regardless of size that is to be taken into consideration or the total value of the output?  I heard one of the leading solicitors in this city expressing the view that this Bill would produce further wasteful expenditure on legal interpretation.  It does not appear to be spontaneously attractive to the foreign investor on that account.  Granted sub-section (3) does mean a liberalisation, but there again bits of other sections and subsections have been taken out which makes interpretation extremely difficult and clumsy.</P>
    <P>I would have hoped we could have produced a much more clear-cut Bill so that anyone who wanted to carry on a manufacturing process could do so unless it could be certified by the Minister that the home market was already catered for in that regard. This constant concern for safeguards seems to make any expansion of industry almost impossible.  As a result, I cannot see that our trading position will be any better and I certainly cannot see that this will have any great impact on the unemployment situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were no law there would be no need for legal interpretation and, therefore, no need to spend money on legal interpretation. Let us not lose our heads in this matter, as there seems to be a tendency to do, by arguing that there can be no industrial development in this country unless we can get foreign capital in for that purpose.  It is still true, and will continue to be so, that by far the greatest force behind Irish industrial development is Irish enterprise. Now and in the future those companies promoted by enterprising businessmen in this country will be the spearhead of any industrial expansion we achieve. They may have to get associated with them companies abroad who have got technical knowledge they cannot command themselves or access to markets they cannot otherwise enter but, nevertheless, it is their enterprise which will be the force behind all our progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> What is likely to stop that enterprise from continuing?  One thing would be the feeling that, if they undertake a new manufacturing operation, as soon as they have established themselves in it, some big international cartel will set up a branch factory here to put them out of business.  It was the recognition that that danger was so real 25 years ago that produced the existing Control of Manufactures Act. That danger has not yet passed and unless we are prepared to wipe out altogether the possibility of industrial development by Irish enterprise then we have to make some law which will give us the right to say to a firm that is embarking on such an undertaking that if they do so and make a success of it we will ensure they will not be subjected to that type of competition in the internal market.  We know that has happened in other countries.  Why do we think it could not happen here? We, therefore, have to keep on our Statute Book some law which will ensure that in relation to operations of that kind the Minister for Industry and Commerce can have a look at what is proposed and give it his approval or disapproval in accordance with his judgment.  What are we doing here? We are saying: &ldquo;We are going to keep that power of regulation in relation to industry, but we are going to strip ourselves of it in certain cases.&rdquo;  We will strip ourselves of it in the case of industry which is not concerned with the home market and obviously there is no need for us to retain power of regulation in relation to an undertaking of that kind.  That is paragraph (a).  If a new industry is not concerned with the home market, it can go ahead and has no need of a licence and does not have to go near the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>It is only when it is concerned with the home market that we have to think in terms of safeguarding Irish enterprise and possible future undertakings promoted by Irish enterprise.  Even in relation to them, we say: &ldquo;Provided you give Irish investors a reasonable opportunity of investing in your concern you are still free to go ahead without authorisation or permit.&rdquo; We have also this power of <Col N="1125" /> exempting certain commodities the manufacture of which is not being done here at the moment.  I am not very confident that that power can be widely used, but it is there.  The rest of this Bill is merely getting rid of difficulties of which we have had experience under the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
    <P>We realise now that it was not necessary to have kept control over manufacturing operations that did not use mechanical power, manufacturing operations carried on by private individuals or limited partnerships.  It was a bit preposterous that a foreigner coming in here, as some refugees did, and setting up watch-repairing in a back room, had to get a licence from the Department to do so.  We are stripping away all these unnecessary regulations and confining this legislation to the type of manufacturing concern which we all have in mind when we talk of a manufacturing business&mdash;the factory run by a company of a reasonable size, using mechanical power and producing goods in bulk for sale.  We are confining it to those.</P>
    <P>One other thing we are doing is this. We are dealing with the particular position of existing or future Irish companies which are established in accordance with the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act, which have initially got the two-thirds capital subscribed here but which at a later stage want to issue those shares, or have already issued shares, to the public and wish to allow those shares to be dealt with freely in the market without keeping this continual watch which they must exercise now, upon the transfer of those shares to make sure they are not getting into a position where they are in breach of the provisions of the Act.  It is also to meet the other problem of the existing Irish concerns which have the intention of extending their business into export and where to permit that they wish to bring in as shareholders in their concern certain external interests which can help them in their plans.  That is what we have been trying to do.</P>
    <P>Let it be quite clear that we are not trying to strip away all the regulations that we used in the past.  Some of <Col N="1126" /> those regulations which were necessary in the past are just as necessary now. We are retaining those which will help industrial expansion and not impede it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister believed half of what he says, he should not have introduced this Bill at all.  If Irish enterprise and Irish capacity for investment is as much to our hands as he says what is the good of having this couple of exclusion clauses.  I thought the whole idea was that we were not having enough capital here to satisfy our needs.  That is always letting the Minister away with the £100,000,000 he has in the heel of his boots and which he announced as his plan years ago.  Let me keep that for another occasion and discuss it at another time.  If people are losing their heads and getting a wrong idea about the necessity to attract foreign capital here, who is responsible?  It is the Minister.</P>
      <P>I have one lecture of his here.  I suppose that at the half a dozen dinners he has attended since last autumn he has been preaching eternally on the question of foreign investment. Here is one occasion, where he spoke at the meeting of the Wexford Chamber of Commerce.  The headline given to it in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 28th January of this year was: &ldquo;Is Internal Capital not Sufficient?&rdquo; The content is given here.  He said that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...capital within the country was not nearly sufficient to give the rate of investment in industrial expansion for which the economic position called&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That was quoted from the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the dinner of the Wexford Chamber of Commerce.</P>
      <P>It was regarded as so important that this yellow sheet which the Department of External Affairs produces gave it a special number.  It said:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">&ldquo;Campaign to Attract U.S. Investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A publicity campaign to attract investment of U.S. capital in Ireland has been begun, Mr. Seán Lemass, <Col N="1127" /> Tánaiste (Deputy Premier) and Minister for Industry and Commerce, announced recently.  It will be directed particularly to attracting participation of U.S. investors in new industries or in those with export possibilities.  The campagn will publicise the advantages and facilities which Ireland has to offer, and may be extended to other countries later.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence, speaking at the Irish Auctioneers' and Estate Agents' Association meeting at the Gresham Hotel, reported on the 15th November last, made another comment. I am sure what he knows about economics could be written on the back of a big postage stamp; he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the home supply of capital is not adequate for the needs of an expanding economy, it is surely desirable to open the door to outsiders who are prepared to risk investment here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is obviously much better to do everything possible to attract foreign capital to aid us in our effort to provide full employment here, than to be forced to acquiesce in the flow of emigrants leaving for want of work at home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is exactly what Deputy Booth has put.  What is the great danger in bringing in foreign capital?  If we are told the capital we have at home, the internal capital, is not sufficient, why should we not look for foreign capital? If one has to balance a risk with regard to capital entering into the country, as against the continued flow of people out of the country, I suppose the human exports we have are the next biggest thing to cattle exports over the years.</P>
    <P>Recently, during the St. Patrick's Day festivities, the Minister for Education went off to some place in England&mdash;I forget where&mdash;and he made a pathetic plea over there, to our folk, people of Irish birth, people born here and who had gone off to England.  He told them that they had certain obligations <Col N="1128" /> towards the country&mdash;I think he said &ldquo;the country of domicile&rdquo; but he obviously meant &ldquo;the country of choice&rdquo;&mdash;and he asked them would they not send back some of their savings for investment here.  He asks our exiles, he makes this pathetic appeal to them, to pack up some of their savings and send them over here. The poor man obviously does not know what happens to such savings as they may have over here&mdash;in the ordinary way, the Central Bank would get hold of them and the greater part would be financed back to the British banks for their investment at whatever they think good possibilities, and they will take our capital if they can get it.</P>
    <P>The Minister says, with regard to the phrase &ldquo;the assets used in the business&rdquo;&mdash;let me get that off as a small matter&mdash;one has to get a phrase like this because of the purported use of business which is not owned by the company.  In so far as that has been so already&mdash;he is speaking from his experience, the phrases appear to come from past experience of his under the 1932 and 1934 Acts&mdash;one of the devices, and there have been many devices in order to cut through the Act, was in regard to hiring equipment instead of owning it.  That will go on still.  This phrase with regard to capital being used or fixed assets being under a set figure, applies only in respect to the section.  As far as the other two devices are concerned&mdash;whatever they are, making a change as between ownership and the use of assets&mdash;they are still possible and will still go on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell has spoken of that also.  The Minister is getting a new education over in Paris these days, with regard to free Europe.  As Deputy Russell said, the Minister realises there has been a big change. It is a change which other people saw ahead of him and which is now recognised widely all over the world.</P>
    <P>Is freeing Europe anything more than a complete retreat from economic nationalism?  Economic nationalism has been found to be a thing that has obstructed efforts to raise the standard of people generally in Western Europe and now they are trying to get the benefit of this common market. <Col N="1129" /> The Minister, a great tariff reformer, says we must prepare for free trade and for the free trade era.  I understood that one of the many technical matters that had been discussed at these conferences in Paris were the various devices with regard to restricting the use of capital and the restriction of investment.  If there is to be freedom with regard to the movement of moneys there must always be one objection to the Free Trade Area. That, however, is a good bit off.  All the results of our activities since 1932 with regard to high tariff walls and developing our industrial activities are about to end.  All that is now in such a state that as one of the undeveloped countries it will take us 15 or 20 years to get out of our position.  Our industries cannot stand the strain and we are still trying to hang on to the outmoded devices of the 1932 and 1934 Acts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell has talked about the difference in eras.  All the reading that I have done on the subject has indicated that there is a general alteration in periods as between those in which a country is saturated with capital with no outlay for investment and other periods in which there are capital starved eras.  We are in such an era at the moment.  We want capital in this country particularly, and all undeveloped countries want it. We probably want it more than anybody else.  In these circumstances we are presented with a piece of legislation for the purpose of attracting American investment.  If the Minister is right in what he says we should not need this at all.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the question of branch factories on the Second Reading.  I gave statements of Professor Carter of Queen's University which appeared in <i>Studies.</i>  He referred to the old fears, fears that never had been realised, in regard to the closing down of branch factories, during a slump, by the parent factory, because they did not feel they were based on any real foundation of economic thought, and certainly not on experience.  I do not know that we have any experience of that here. Certainly there has been no observable swing in that regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to Sections 3 and 4, I <Col N="1130" /> asked myself again what is the purpose of this Bill.  I understood it was the same as in America, that we are trying to attract business here, trying to get new business open here and for that purpose we are saying to American investors and to others: &ldquo;You can come in here and you need not go crawling to any Department.  There are no controls and you are free to operate as you do in America.&rdquo;  I asked myself if this piece of legislation, and the Minister's Second Reading speech, were both sent off in a packet to, say, the legal adviser of any American business firm, if that legal adviser were asked to go through the Bill and the Minister's speech and were asked did they represent control or the removal of control, what would be the answer?  There are only two parts of this Bill, about one and a half pages, that have anything to do with liberalisation; the rest is screwing down the controls.</P>
    <P>The free business man in America who is accustomed to dealing with industries is not going to have anything to do with this.  He will not go to Government Departments and get licences, exemptions or this, that or the other thing.  He wants to know can he come in and enjoy the full rights of free competition with export market possibilities open to him.  I do not believe that anybody in America getting this piece of legislation will find any proof that it represents any big effort in the way of freeing controls of the old type.</P>
    <P>Look at the fatuous and futile thing that has happened.  It was introduced as the Control of Manufactures Bill. Now we have changed the title to the Industrial Development (Encouragement of External Investment) Bill.  I cannot see where the encouragement is.  What sections deal with encouragement? I do not think that we make enough use of the savings for capital investment, but even if they were used to the full I see no immediate prospect of having such a situation where they will help the 80,000 unemployed and the 50,000 people who emigrated in the last year.  These are very serious problems and to produce this Bill now is certainly fiddling while the State is on fire.</P>

      <P>If we, in this country, have to seek in the negotiations in Paris some extra time in which to develop our economy before we can meet the impact of the Free Trade Area, we can count these as disastrous years. When Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Industry and Commerce that is the time we lost.  It is significant that nobody ever suggested putting him back in that Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very well for Deputy McGilligan to enjoy himself, being mischievous at the expense of this country.  The purpose of his effort is to ensure that the attempt we are making to develop industries and attract external capital into industry will not succeed.  He can shed crocodile tears about emigration and unemployment, but what he is trying to do is to make sure the Government will not succeed in its efforts to solve these grave social problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this Bill will be effective in what it sets out to achieve.  What does it hope to achieve?  Its object is to attract external capital into new industries, and into industries with export possibilities, and in that way to put more people into employment. It is not to put existing factories out of business but to ensure that the capital which can be attracted will be channelled into the activities which we want to promote.  Apart from being mischievous, I think it is just nonsense to talk about American firms crawling to Government Departments.  In practice, no American firm would think of engaging in an industrial enterprise without coming to the Department of Industry and Commerce to acquire all the information it thought it needed regarding legal requirements, taxation arrangements, local administration practices and matters of that kind. Indeed, I have never known in any country any important industrial enterprise financed by external capital being started without contact being made with the Government Departments of that country.  We have here, perhaps, a greater need than some <Col N="1132" /> other countries to secure external aid in our industrial development programme because, as I have said, we have not merely an insufficiency of locally generated capital to give us the rate of progress we require, but we have also got certain deficiencies in technical knowledge and access to external market contacts which can be made good most speedily by association with external companies.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this legislation is to proclaim what our policy is in that regard, that our policy is to invite and welcome external capital into Irish industry where it is bringing something new to Irish industry, where it is giving us types of manufacture which we were not able to develop heretofore, or the possibility of increased export trade in any class of industrial production. The purpose of the legislation is to make it quite clear that in so far as capital comes in from other countries with those aims we will be prepared, not merely to give it a welcome but to provide all the facilities which it might reasonably expect to obtain.</P>
    <P>It is, however, necessary to keep in mind that there are two sides to this problem.  There is first the side of new development for export, and the production of commodities that we have not yet been able to get produced by Irish industry.  The other side is to help to foster and encourage the development of existing Irish enterprises, which offers the most immediate prospects of general industrial expansion. If we are to succeed in that second aim, fostering development of existing Irish enterprises, then we have to retain some system that will enable us to give them an assurance that their growth will not be wrecked by an intensification of competition on the home market sponsored by external firms.</P>
    <P>My purpose in framing this Bill was to give us the minimum measure of control which would enable us to preserve these safeguards.  Behind this Bill, and all the other Bills which the Government has produced, is the one aim of expanding the number of jobs available in the country so that these two social problems, unemployment <Col N="1133" /> and emigration, can be relieved in our time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The only interpretation I could take out of Deputy McGilligan's contribution was that he would not be anxious to give any protection to the Irish industrialists who had already invested money in this country and who had started factories in it over a generation back.  He would allow foreign capital to come in <i>ad lib</i> to compete where we have already enough production to supply the home market.  Deputy McGilligan's line was apparently to allow any foreign capital that comes in to compete against people already established here and give those people, who have already put money into the country, no protection at all.  I do not see any sense at all in the learned Deputy's contribution this morning.  If we are to take him literally, what he has stated is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is to say to any foreign capitalist who comes in: &ldquo;We have enough production in certain lines for the home market but, if you do wish to come in and compete with the Irish industrialists who are here already, put them out of business by all means if you can under-sell them.&rdquo;  That is really what the learned Deputy conveyed to me.  I am sorry I have to interpret him in such a way because that is the only way he could be interpreted.</P>
      <P>I see nothing at all wrong with the Bill, I think it is a protection to foreign investors coming in here.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce can tell any foreign capitalist who is going to come into the country: &ldquo;The home market is supplied with a certain product.  If you come in and wish to get a very limited corner of the home market, and if your firm is able to produce and sell for the foreign market, that is what we want.&rdquo;  If our economy is to survive that is what we require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see anything in the Bill which would deter anybody from coming in.  It is an encouragement to foreigners.  It is an honest-to-God effort to point out the situation as it stands so that they will not be coming <Col N="1134" /> in under false pretences.  On the other hand, we have a duty to the people who have money already invested in the country.  We are honestly trying to get into the export market and to invite foreign capital into the country but we want to invite it in under decent conditions&mdash;to give foreign capital an opportunity of doing the things we want done here by creating employment for our people.</P>
    <P>I was pleased that the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to our branch factories.  The only factories in my constituency that are really standing up are the old-established factories which have a tradition behind them, and which did reasonably well, even during the recession in trade during the last few years.  There is one question I should like the Minister to answer.  I am told, I have no reason myself to make this statement, that certain branch factories are established here specifically to supply the home market.</P>
    <P>If branch factories are established here for that sole purpose, their functions are limited considerably. They cannot go into the export market, if their parent companies in outside countries say they will supply the export trade and the branch factories must only supply the home market here in Ireland.  We had a lot of unemployment in certain branch factories. Though we were very pleased to see such firms coming in, taking the long-term view, they are not such a great help to the nation.  We want manufactures who will come in and say the whole world market is their aim and they are not going to be tied.  If they can under-sell their product against competition in the world markets, that is what we want.  Unless we get people of that type coming in here we shall not achieve what we set out to achieve.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Industry and Commerce on that section because it will save our Irish investors and foreign capitalists who may be anxious to start factories here. It will do the reasonable things that we require should be done.  Surely the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce knows very well that certain <Col N="1135" /> statements he made in his contribution to the debate are not true.  He must know very well that if he made these statements outside the House, in any of the areas where there are factories, and if he told Irish industrialists: &ldquo;I have no regard for you at all; all I am anxious for is to bring in foreign capital and if such capitalists are able to put you out of business more power to them&rdquo;, it would not go down very well.  That is the interpretation I took of his speech here this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>To me, it seems a matter of degree.  The Minister impressed me with his desire to encourage outside capital to come in.  How much encouragement are we to give to outside capital, having regard to the necessity of maintaining the position of industry which has grown up here over the past 25 years?  If I felt as strongly on the matter as the Minister did when he spoke a few minutes ago, I would not have Sections 3 or 5 as they are in this Bill.  Indeed, it is very doubtful if I would have brought the Bill to the House in its present form. It seems to me to be too easy to evade the Minister's purpose in Sections 3 and 5.  If we are to have absolute regard to the position of Irish industrialists, those two sections, to my mind, would have to be radically changed.  It is not sufficient to put in the Bill that the sole purpose of a company is to export and leave it at that.  By doing that you create loopholes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is far better to say openly that we want outside companies to come in to establish plants and engage mainly in export.  I think we have exaggerated the importance of the home market to any substantial outside firm coming in. We have overlooked the fact that over the past 25 years most of our Irish firms have had an opportunity to bring their factories and plants to a high degree of competence.  I think the Minister himself paid a tribute to the efficiency of Irish manufacturing units on many occasions.  The fact that some of these units are at the moment engaged in export is sufficient proof that they are not sitting to be knocked down like shuttlecocks, if we <Col N="1136" /> open the doors to outside firms.  I do not think that situation will arise.</P>
    <P>If this is a Bill to attract outside capital we should make it as attractive as we possibly can, and give concessions to these larger outside corporations, and, at the same time, not tie them down, as the Minister has, with 10 per cent. of the home market and 90 per cent. of the export market. It would be far better to leave the thing open.  I do not think it will endanger the Irish manufacturer who has become solidly implanted in this country.  He is sufficiently efficient to carry on and certainly to maintain his place in the home market.</P>
    <P>Several references were made to branch factories.  I know it is quite on the cards at the present time that it might be very attractive for outside concerns to establish branch factories in this country to export back to the country of origin.  That is very much on the mat at the present time, due to the conditions in England and the difficulties there.  Having regard to the shortage of capital and labour there, it would be very attractive to establish a branch factory here which would export back to England.  We should not overlook that.  I see a danger that that might be a passing phase.  The Irish company might be closed down.  In the interest of employment, we should take cognisance of that development.</P>
    <P>If we had adequate capital, if we had adequate industrial tradition and if we had adequate technical skill, we would not need to bring in a Bill of this sort. The Minister and his predecessors have admitted that it is because we lack the technical skill and capital after 25 or 30 years of protection that this Bill is being brought in to encourage outside capital to come in, primarily for the purpose of establishing plants to engage mainly or solely in the export market.</P>
    <P>The only point I am trying to argue on this Bill is that if we want it that way, we ought at least to make it as attractive as we can.  I can appreciate the Minister's point with regard to the undesirability of doing anything to injure Irish manufacturers, but if we want all these things from outside, we <Col N="1137" /> have got to make the Bill attractive.  I do not think that would injure the home manufacturer whose degree of protection over the past 25 years has made him, in the main, a competent and efficient unit in this country.  Perhaps, that does not apply to all of them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke, after his foolish interruption, left without waiting for any reply.  I used no phrase in this House which can be interpreted as meaning that I want Irish industrialists put out of business.  I used a phrase with regard to people coming in.  I feel that the Control of Manufactures Acts of 1932 and 1934 would have prevented a vast amount of capital coming into this country by devious ways.  It will continue to come in by ways which are perfectly legal, but that was not the intention of these Acts.  The piece of legislation before the House contains 13 pages or leaving out the Title, 12 pages.  A page would contain all the liberal concessions in the whole Bill.  The rest screws down the community and ties them up.  What I called crawling to the Department was the case of people who have to look for licences and certificates.  Apart altogether from what will happen in the near future with regard to free Europe, we will be able to see the results of 25 years of protection.</P>
      <P>At the moment, we are faced with two things.  Internal capital is insufficient for our needs, either for export or for the establishment of new industries.  That is generally accepted. We are still waiting for the production of the £100,000,000 which the Minister promulgated as his plan a couple of years ago and has never talked about it since.  The second thing is a terrific combination of unemployment and emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe went off to America recently.  The Minister went down to see him off and complimented him on being an unofficial emissary of this country.  Deputy Briscoe's first statement in New York was that unemployment here was very severe.  It ran at 12 per cent. of our labour force.  He added that emigration was at a peak point and gave the surprising statistic <Col N="1138" /> that were it not for emigration, unemployment would be equal to 50 per cent. of our labour force.  That force must be the 700,000 people mentioned recently in a question as being employees, people working on the roads and so on, but not proprietors.  That is about 700,000 people.  The 12 per cent. measures up to 84,000 people.  That was an outrageous figure for him to promulgate&mdash;that if there was no emigration, our unemployment would reach a figure of 350,000.  That is trying to get people into this country by false pretences.  It is saying to American industrialists that there are people in this country hungry for employment and that they can come into this country and get people to work for them for any price they themselves like.  That means obedient labour.</P>
    <P>If that is the sort of development we are encouraging here, if we are trying to get people in here on the grounds that there is no way in which we can provide employment for our own people, then it is not the sort of development that is wanted here.  We have not yet used the phrase &ldquo;coolie labour&rdquo;, but that phrase was used on a memorable occasion in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>However, if we leave out these fantastic figures of Deputy Briscoe's altogether, we find that the situation here is still very serious and, being serious, the internal capital is not sufficient.  Yet we offer as an inducement one page out of 12 pages of legislation, the remainder being a screwing down of controls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 28, to delete &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;of opinion&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noticed that in the first sub-section of the Bill the Minister has to be satisfied and, in the next section, the Minister has to be of the opinion. I want to know what is the difference, if their is a difference.  In the first Offences Against the State Act, it was held by one judge, and it did not go any further, and no further opinion <Col N="1139" /> was taken on it, because the appeal did not lie, that the use of the word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; meant that the Minister had to act judicially. He has to hear evidence and act as a result of that evidence.  To say that the Minister is of opinion means that he could only conclude.  The word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; was used in the first offences Against the state Act and it was held that the Minister was administering justice and that that was wrong.  The Government of the day changed &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; to &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo; and that changed was held to be lawful.  I do not knows why the word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; is used in sub-section (1) and the phrase &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo; used in sub-section (2).  If there is any reason for the use of the word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;is opinion&rdquo; I should like to knows what it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between the two expressions and there is a difference between the two subsections. One section deals with the issue of certificates of exemption to externally-owened companies and the other, sub-section (2), deals with the granting of certificates of exemption to existing Irish-owned companies whose shares have been quoted on a stock exchanged for a period of five years.  It is quite clear that there is a difference between the two expressions. The company covered by sub-section(1) is a new, externally-owened company proposing to engage in some manufacturing process here.  If its export expectations do not materialies, the products of that company can be, and will be, sold on the hame market.</P>
      <P>In the other case, there is an established Irish company seeking access to new capital to develop exports, and if that export expectation is not realised, the consequences to other Irish concerns are not likely to be so severe.  It is desirable that the Minister be satisfied of the <i>bona fide</i> intentions of the first type of company to engage in export trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (1) is in respect of any Irish company which is managed and controlled within the State and carries on a particular manufacturing <Col N="1140" /> process.  That is an existing company carrying on a manufacturing process.  It is a company whose shares have been quoted on the Stock Exchange for a period of five years and it proposes to carry on and develop an export trade.  Sub-section (2) deals with a new Irish company which seeks capital also for the purpose of carrying on an export trade.  Both of these result in the same thing.  But in one case the Minister has to be satisfied about an existing company, while in the other case he &ldquo;is of the opinion&rdquo;.  In sub-section (2), the Minister &ldquo;is of the opinion&rdquo; that a company is completely exempt from the Act and in this instance the Minister uses the lighter phrase.  I think it would be better if &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; or &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo; were used throughout.  This is the kind of thing in which courts ask why one phrase is used in one sub-section and another phrase used in the next.  Being &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; would mean a heavier type of decision.  If it is thought better to use the phrase &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo;, I think that phrase should be used in all cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Satisfied&rdquo; is the heavier word and I think that the lighter word should be used in all cases.  If satisfaction is required in sub-section (1) of Section 5, a weightier phrase still would be required in sub-section (2), instead of a lighter one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if he would be satisfied with both?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference. I do not pretend to be an expert in legal interpretation but I am told there is a difference.  In one case, the <Col N="1141" /> Minister has to satisfy himself that a company has the main object of developing exports.  In the other case, there is an application from an existing company, already operating on a substantial scale here, with share quoted on the Stock Exchange, who say: &ldquo;We desire this exemption because it will help us to develop exports.&rdquo;  If the Minister is of opinion that it will help exports, he will give it.</P>
      <P>In the first case, if the main object of the company is not as they stated&mdash; the Minister although satisfied it proves to be wrong&mdash;the effect upon existing Irish concerns could be serious because the company set up to do export business might intensify competition in the home market.  In the other case, the existing concern already supplies the home market and if it fails in its export drive then that is its own affair. The point is that it is not doing damage to anybody else.  There is the case.  I am for using a stronger phrase in one case than in the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be equally good English to say that the Minister has to be &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; or &ldquo;or proposes to carry on&rdquo;?  I would agree in the opinion that you are carrying on.  But this case ought to say &ldquo;or proposes to carry on.&rdquo;  To my mind, that brings in something stronger than the word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of both, there can be an existing company. The only difference between sub-sections(1) and (2) of Section 5 is that, in one case, the company has to be in existence for five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">

      <P>Both companies may be carrying on business.  In one place there is a reference to a company which is carrying on business and, <Col N="1142" /> in the second, there is the addition about a company which has been in operation for five years.  That is the one difference with regard to the carrying on.  The company referred to in sub-section (1) of Section 5 might be there for 20 years.  Might it not? Therefore, there is no difference, really, on the point of the length of period they are operating here.  If necessary, you could put in the five-year period in the other matter.</P>
      <P>What is to be decided?  The Minister is satisfied in regard to sub-section (1) that the main object is to develop export trade.  In regard to the section, the Minister has to be of the opinion that the purpose of the company is to develop an export trade.  You have to consider, then, the two things.  The Minister is of opinion that the purpose of the company is to develop export trade whereas, up above in the other one, he has to be satisfied that the main object is to develop export trade. Is there any such difference as requires the use of the weightier term in one case and not in the other case?</P>
      <P>If the purpose is export trade, one is satisfied that the main object is a main object.  It may be one of many. We will get away from the principal object, which will lead to the other types of interpretation in respect of Section 3.  However, here the difference is whether the purpose is to develop an export trade or whether a main object is to develop an export trade.  There is to develop an export trade.  There is not much in it.</P>

    <P>I suggested this point in regard to another matter, which the Minister accepted.  This is an important matter I suggest that the Dáil should be notified simply that the certificate of exemption has been granted.  The register has to be retained.  However, the attention of Dáil ought to be called to facts that the exemption has been granted.  Then, if anybody wants to investigate further, he may do so.  This is merely a notification to the Dáil that matter such as a certificate of exemption is being given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree. I am prepared to meet circumstances in Section 2 where the Minister makes an Order in relation to the exception of commodities.  Here, however, we are dealing with an individual firm.  It could possibility lead to a debate in the Oireachtas on the affairs of an individual private firm.  I do not think that that procedure, or the remote possibility that that might happen, could be regarded as conducive to encouraging external investment.</P>
      <P>There is provision that the certificates will be entered on the register and that the register will be open to public inspection.  That is adequate.

      <P>On Section 5&mdash;this gets back again to departmental control&mdash;there is a power given to the Minister and, under it, as far as paragraph (1) is concerned, if the Minister is satisfied that the main object of the company is to develop an export trade he may exempt it from the general provisions of the Act.  Under the second sub-section, where in respect of an Irish company whose shares have <Col N="1146" /> been quoted for a period of not less than five years, the Minister again grants an exemption.  That may be altered or revoked, but only on the application of the holder and there are various very lengthy provisions as to when the certificate of exemption will cease to be in force.  The first is if the company ceases to carry on such manufacturing process, even though it may be a temporary cessor, it will have to go through the performance of coming along and getting a new certificate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ceases to carry on the manufacturing process.  If the process is for the purpose of developing an export business and the export market ceases to be very rosy, then the manufacturer clearly has to show that the carrying-on of that process is no longer for the purpose of developing an export business and the certificate of exemption ceases.  Subsequently, if prospects brighten, the certificate will have to be applied for again.  The revocation and transfer are matters subject to the control of the holder; they are all right.  Under (d), &ldquo;if the certificate was granted subject to the condition that such company shall commence, before the expiration of a specified period, to carry on such manufacturing process and such company has failed to comply with such condition&mdash;on the expiration of such period&rdquo; there, there is a limitation put upon the time on which the manufacturing process starts and not the time the exports develop.</P>
      <P>It is laid on the Minister to establish and maintain a register, and so on, and the people who inspect will be in a position to know the name of the company to which the certificate relates, the commodity and the process authorised to be carried on.  The amendment has been withdrawn.  The Minister gives Parliament notification that he has granted these certificates. That is supposed to induce fear in the minds of the people looking for certificates because of their fear of an inspection, whereas if there is an inspection, followed by debate in the Dáil, there would be no such fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> I object to the section because it does not liberalise.  Again, there is control by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I object to that. It may be regarded as something in relief of the more rigid sections of the 1932 and 1934 Acts but, in so far as it is relief, it depends upon the individual view of a particular Minister.  That, I think, is wrong.  If all this were rolled into paragraphs (3) and (4), then a complying company would be automatically exempted.  Similarly, under sub-section (2) there would be liberalisation. But, holding that section as it stands over any group of foreign industrialists and telling them that these are the conditions, is not liberalisation. One firm may be given a certificate and another may not.  They will not like that.  They will regard that as extended control, control extended in a bad way because it allows for differentiation as between firms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was originally another Section 5 which has disappeared from this Bill.  I suppose that is just another of the peculiar conditions under which this Bill has been dealt with.  The old Section 5 has gone and there is no section upon which I can discuss its disappearance.  That is, because of the particular procedure we have gone through.  It was a section upon which the Minister founded some strength in his remarks to the Dáil on Second Reading.  Yet, the simple statement I got merely says that it was decided not to proceed with the section.  I would ask for permission to discuss the disappearance of that section now.  I want to know why it has disappeared.  It was a section putting the onus of proof in relation to certain matters on a company which claimed that it had complied with certain conditions and Deputy Norton raised the point that there have been no prosecutions under the earlier Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that this was a completely new situation because now the onus of proof is put upon the company where there are proceedings under Section 4.  All that has now gone and the simple statement offered <Col N="1148" /> to me is that it is decided not to proceed with the section.  It was thought that it gave more strength.  There were likely to be more prosecutions. There was a possibility of a better effort to prevent evasions.  But all that is simply taken out and we are told it is decided not to proceed with it.

      <P>May I query &ldquo;the Control of Manufactures Act&rdquo; which is now to be amended to the &ldquo;Industrial Development (Encouragment of External Investment) Act&rdquo;?  That is <Col N="1155" /> the new title of this piece of legislation. I want to query that title.  When our savings go abroad they are generally referred to as the pile-up of external assets and when we invest in companies outside the State it is generally referred to as external holdings of ours.  That would be regarded as external investment from our angle. This is to encourage external investment, that is, looking at it from the point of view of the investor, not from the point of view of this country.  I would have thought the Minister would have said &ldquo;Encouragement of Export&rdquo; or &ldquo;Encouragement of Export possibilities&rdquo; or something like that but, when you use the phrase &ldquo;External Investment&rdquo;, anybody reading that from an Irish point of view would begin to think in terms of our investing abroad whereas what is really referred to is other people investing here but how that is called &ldquo;External Investment&rdquo; beats me.</P>
      <P>I recognise that if you take, say, your stand in New York and think of an American company going to invest over here, it is external investment from the point of view of the American but in an Irish Act, when we view things from an Irish centre, I suggest the phrase is badly used. &ldquo;Encouragement of External Investment&rdquo; to anybody here means encouraging our people to invest abroad whereas this has clearly another meaning.</P>

    <P>The section standing, the verification that may be required is to be verified in such one or both of the following ways (as may be specified in the notice), (i) by a statutory declaration made by a person having personal knowledge of the fact, (ii) by a certificate signed by such a person having <Col N="1157" /> personal knowledge of the facts.  Why insist on a statutory declaration? These are notices that are to be sent in.  One does not look so much at the status of the person who verifies the particulars as to the fact that there is a verification.  If the verification is wrong, the whole matter would be as much open to objection as if it is verified by the statutory declaration.  I suggest that we should take only one of these things.  It would be enough to have verification of the return by a certificate of a person having personal knowledge of the facts.  It ties the individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This was newly introduced.  I know the general purpose is to allow an application to the court but in what respect is it sought to case the situation?  I am told there is a restriction in Section 9, but that it is only in the latter part of it that the proceedings may not be taken so long as there is an application made.  What is the purpose of this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose is, if there is any question about the status of the company, the company can, if it chooses to use this procedure, obtain absolute security by itself by going to court, submitting there evidence of its constitution and getting it established that it is carrying on manufacturing operations in conformance with the Act.  It is to give the company, particularly a company thinking of raising new capital or extending is operations, the ability to get its status&mdash; assuming that status is questioned by anybody&mdash;put beyond doubt.  It provides that while it is doing so it cannot be subjected to any prosecution by the Minister for any default under the Act.  I expect the normal practice that will arise, if there is any doubt about the status of a company is, that the Minister will convey that doubt and naturally examine the situation to see if there is need for further action by him, perhaps leading to a prosecution. Once that atmosphere of doubt begins to surround a company the company can resolve it completely and absolutely by this procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but does this operate only where, so to speak, proceedings have been more or less institured against the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the need for the company seeking this declaration of the High Court might arise perhaps from an inquiry from the Department of Industry and Commerce, but it could also arise from some query from a banker or somebody the company was trying to borrow money from or do business with.  If any doubt arose regarding the legality of its manufacturing operations it can take this means to resolve that doubt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But it all turns on <Col N="1160" /> the phrase, &ldquo;in respect of an alleged contravention&rdquo;.  That is in line 20. Proceedings will be in respect of that.

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking last night, I emphasised how important the F.C.A. was to the country.  There are plenty of activities for the young people to engage in by joining the F.C.A. and we should encourage them to participate in those activities before they are taken away by other attractions.</P>
      <P>The first improvement that needs to be made in relation to that organisation is the provision of a more attractive uniform.  A great many people would join up if this were done.  I also want to see members trained in the latest military equipment.  At the moment they are being trained with obsolete rifles and as part of the regular Army they are entitled to be trained with modern equipment.</P>
      <P>There should also be some type of school held for the F.C.A. once or twice a week to teach them love of country, love of self-sacrifice, respect for the rights of others and to foster our national traditions.  The F.C.A. is the proper organisation for this type of training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is a new Minister and I believe the Minister for Defence has an important role to play.  He should be a man who keeps out of active politics.  I listened to some speeches of his for the last month or so and one of them was nothing like what should <Col N="1163" /> come from a young man of the present generation.  It was a narrow, mean, vindictive speech in which he tried to stir up the bitter feelings of the past. The Minister has the responsibility of moulding the youth of the country and he should steer clear of the old controversies and adopt a more enlightened attitude.  He comes of good stock and he is a well-educated young man.  He should be more temperate in his speeches and give the youth of the country a lead in the adoption of a new spirit.  No doubt the remarks I heard him make in the course of contributions to debates here were made in the heat of political discussion but I express the hope that it will not occur again.</P>
    <P>A recruiting campaign is a very costly affair.  You do not always get the best type of person from such a campaign but in many cases people who cannot get a job anywhere else.  The young fellow who has had a row at home makes his way into the Army.  There is not much future for an ordinary solider unless he joins up for his lifetime. After a few years he is thrown out in the wilderness.  Another thing we find is that after training our men, they join the British Army, and after a few months they have risen to the rank of corporal or sergeant.  Of course, it speak well for their training here but I would rather see these people getting jobs at home.</P>
    <P>The reason it is so hard to get the right type of recruit is that these people realise there is very little prospect for them in the Army.  When there is a national emergency we say that they will get first preference when they are being demobilised but they have seldom got first preference in anything.</P>
    <P>There is an ex-Army association in this country and it is important from the point of view of linking up the high ranks with the lower.  It is the duty of the Government to give a generous annual contribution to that organisation. Nearly every country in the world contributes to such associations and we must do likewise if we want to have a worthy ex-servicemen's association.</P>
    <P>A large number of young single men for when work should be provided are <Col N="1164" /> drawing the dole.  The dole is only a pittance for them to keep body and soul together and perhaps keep them from emigration.  There should be a means of giving these young men work on drainage, afforestation, bogs and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would, and an unemployed Army general. There are too many idle men.  We realise that our Army of 10,000 men is an insurance against danger, but they are idle men and they are not contributing very much to the national economy.  There are too many idle men both in the Army and outside it.  We should reorganise the Construction Corps which did such excellent work when it was previously in existence.</P>
      <P>This is a very big Estimate and it should have been pared down.  There is a sum of £47,000 provided in connection with the retirement of officers in recent years.  That amount should have been spread over five or six years instead of one year only.  There are many other expenses which could have been cut down, the number of lorries used, and so on.  Greater economy must be enforced if we want to put this country's finances in balance.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister, as a young man, to give a good lead and good guidance in future to the youngsters. The youth depend more or less on the men in charge of the Army for the proper spirit in the F.C.A.  In the F.C.A. we want men of all classes, creeds and politics.  If the Minister makes intemperate speeches, as he has done in the past, the young men will not come in.  They will say: &ldquo;Why should I go in there; did you see what he said yesterday?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is talk at the moment of efforts to take their minds in another direction, into a channel which is not democratic.  Young men's minds are very open to deception.  There are some men very active, and if things go on as they are, we will have two armies.  There is room for only one Army, one police force in a democratic way of life.  It is up to the Minister for Defence to make every effort to see that the youth of Ireland <Col N="1165" /> is fostered and brought into the F.C.A., so that every man worth his salt will be learning something and giving of his best for the betterment of the country.  I would be satisfied then that the Minister was doing good work and that it could be left to him to carry on the proud tradition, handed to him from the past, to the new generation coming after us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDooley" hpid="Mr. Dooley Mr. Dooley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the debate there was reference to promotions in the Army.  Last year, when I spoke in this debate, that was one of the matters to which I referred.  It is something which does not arise in Fianna Fáil administration only; it seems to be a perennial source of complaint in the Army.  I am not referring to promotions through political influence or anything like that.  There is a feeling amongst officers and men that there is a certain amount of personal bias with the men on top, that they can sometimes hold back a person's promotion by transferring him from one section to another.  If that is the case, it is something which should not be allowed.  The opportunities for men to advance to the position of N.C.O. are very limited also.  There are many men who, after a full term in the Army, have not advanced any further than the rank of corporal.  It should be possible to provide greater opportunities for the serving solider to advance before it comes it his time to retire after long years of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the year, the Minister made some reference to the conditions for N.C.O.s and men on retiring, and I hope he will keep that in mind.  He has not come to any decision on that question, but an improvement on their present retiring position is desirable.  I was glad to hear him say that, during the course of the coming year, there will be an improvement in housing and that housing schemes will be provided at some barracks in the country. There is still a great amount of dissatisfaction amongst the serving troops in regard to housing conditions and we would like to see much more done, particularly int he Curragh area, in that respect.  Some houses have been built&mdash;a very welcome step&mdash;<Col N="1166" /> but there could be still further improvement.</P>
    <P>In opening the debate, the Minister referred to the maintenance of barracks. While we have the buildings at present in use, they should be kept in the best possible condition.  I accept the assurance that everything possible wil be done.  It would be a pity if such fine buildings as we have throughout the country were allowed to fall into disrepair through neglect.  There is some dissatisfaction amongst the men also, that some couple of years ago they were promised a walking-out uniform.  That has been issued in some cases lately.  I do not know if there has been any cessation of the issue of such uniform, but it is a thing the men would appreciate very much.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles mentioned the Construction Corp.  I do not know if there would be agreement with the view he expressed.  I would like, however, to pay tribute to the Apprentice Schools of the Army.  These schools are at Naas and Baldonnel and the boys there certainly get very fine training.  I want to pay tribute to the trade unions who co-operate in that and also to the vocational schools. I get many opportunities of meeting the lads from Baldonnel and Naas and they have nothing but the highest praise for the way they are treated in the barracks.  They are getting a very fine training.  Their educational interests are looked after also and during their couple of years they have the benefit of Army discipline.  I should like to see that scheme extended, if possible.  We are living in a technical age and the more technicians we can provide the better.</P>
    <P>I should like to see as much as possible done for the F.C.A.  In particular when they go to camp, the conditions should be as good as possible for these young fellows.  Many of those who go are still school and they are possible material for the Army.  If they get a bad impression at the annual camp, it may turn them against Army life, to which otherwise they might be led.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Corps of Engineers, I wonder if it would be possible to do anything to provide permanency <Col N="1167" /> for the civilian employees of the corps.  I understand that some of the Grade A and Grade B men are regarded as more or less permanent, but they really have no guarantee of permanency.  If they could be assured of permanency and if a proper force could be built up, they would give a better return.  Last year, some men were let off through redundancy.  Some were taken back again since then. There have been cases where men were taken back and felt they had some hope of continuity of employment, but within a month they were let off again.  It is not helpful to their work to have that situation.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, when replying, to clarify the position regarding gratuities to civilian employees.  I understand that after seven years, if a civilian employee of the Corps of Engineers is dismissed through redundancy, be is entitled to a gratuity.  I should like a clear statement on that, and also if the gratuity is paid to others who leave when they come to the retiring age, that is, whether they are entitled to a gratuity.  The work these civilian employees do, as I have seen on the Curragh, is high-class work.  The houses they built there are a credit to them, and they built them at a very competitive price.  It might be possible to arrange that any work to be done by the Army could be done through that corps of civilian employees and the Army men, rather than under contract, so that there would be a possibility of those civilian employees being assured of permanency in that way.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister also mentioned that he had handed over some lands to the Department of Lands.  I should like to know if there are other lands, particularly in the Curragh area, which he feels he could dispose of to them, without harming the interests of those who have cheap grazing rights on the Curragh grasslands or any other interest there.  If there are lands available, they should be turned over to the Department of Lands, to be made available to the small uneconomic holders around the Curragh area,</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the <Col N="1168" /> men of the Army whom I know pretty well in our area, Naas, Kildare and the Curragh.  We in Kildare are very proud of them and they are of the finest character.  I think it is a pity that there should be any disparaging remarks about the men who serve in the Army.  There may be a difference of opinion as to whether we should have an Army, or as to its size, but while we have an Army, we should respect the men in it.  It is regrettable them, particularly from men who were serving members themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the previous Deputy's remarks, I do not think that anybody in this House wishes to disparage the individual members of the Army, either officers or men of other ranks, although there is considerable difference of opinion as to the size of the Army and, possibly, the overall efficiency of the Army. Whether we like it or not, we must have regard to the cost of the Army in our present circumstances.  In view of the necessity for devoting a very substantial annual sum to productive enterprise, whether we can continue to bear the cost of over £6,000,000 is a question that has sufficiently engaged the attention of the Government. Personally, I do not think we can.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the Army the best and most efficient unit we could have, with the proper ratio of officers to other ranks, well-paid and clothed, with the opportunity for the ranks to come up to the officer class and with every encouragement given to them, together with proper retiring benefits and pensions.  I would rather have a small well-equipped, well-trained Army than a force regarded, judging by some of the remarks that have been made, as more or less an outlet for employment. I do not think that is the way to look on an army.  It was suggested here yesterday that if certain barrack were closed down, it would lead to unemployment.  Certainly it would, and I think the spookeepers in the areas would suffer, but surely there are other ways of utilising the expenditure that would be saved by keeping on a barracks for the only reason that it is providing employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> I presume it does not arise on this Vote, but I should like to mention the question of national service which I think is closely associated with the Vote for Defence.  I would like to see national defence service introduced in this country.  Despite the goodwill and the loyalty that has gone into organising the F.C.A., it is extremely difficult, particularly amongst the young people&mdash;who naturally rise to the occasion in time of stress&mdash;to keep peacetime forces operating.  The Minister should seriously examine the question of introducing some form of compulsory national service that would apply to all young men of a given age&mdash;18 to 20 years&mdash;with sufficiently liberal provisions to extend either above or below that age limit.</P>
    <P>I do not mean that they should have purely military training, but also technical training which is so necessary to-day, and in that regard I quite agree with the previous speaker.  There should also be physical training and ordinary training in citizenship.  All that could be incorporated in national service.  I think it would be a good thing for the country and a very good thing for young men of every class.  There should be no question of drawing distinctions and it should apply to all men, in the age groups concerned, throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I do not know enough about defence matters to criticise in any specific way the present organisation of the Army. I should merely like to suggest to the Minister that he should make a very close examination of its present organisation and of the type of Army we should have, in the light of developments over recent years and having regard to the speed with which the picture is changing.  That might be put into effect by himself.  He is a young man and a new Minister and I feel he has the right drive and the interest in the Irish Army to ensure its streamlining in the modern sense and having regard to our capacity to support a force of this kind.</P>
    <P>Then, there is the question, as I have already mentioned, of barracks in outlying areas an whether it would not be better to concentrate on barracks in the larger and more populous <Col N="1170" /> districts and have them better equipped, rather than have barracks throughout the court merely as a means of giving employment to men who otherwise would not be employed. I know that the Minister is familiar with the question of housing for soldiers.  In regard to Limerick, I think his attention has been drawn to the dire necessity for providing houses for soliders and not leaving it to the already overstrained local authorities to provide the housing accommodation. I think he intimated here that the question of providing soldiers' houses in Limerick was actively engaging his attention, and I hope that the matter will come to fruition very soon.</P>
    <P>The type of housing in most of the older barracks, such as Sarsfield Barracks, is indeed very primitive, and I should like to see a newer and more attractive type of house, again in the larger centres.  I do not think it is a practical proposition to seek to add to the number of old barracks in the rural areas by building soldiers' houses there.  I would say we should rather concentrate on the building of houses in larger centres.</P>
    <P>Finally, I suggest to the Minister that, having regard to our present circumstances, this figure of £6,000,000, while I know that, in terms of modern defence, it is only a fleabite, might be more than carefully looked into, as we need to devote every single penny we can to productive enterprise.  That and the organisation of the Army and the conditions of the men, are points. I should like him to consider, and I should like to see him taking the initiative in regard to some form of national service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has intimated that it is necessary in the near future to embark upon a recruiting drive.  Happily, changes have taken place in this House in regard to what the target should be for the numbers to be recruited to the Army. When I came into this House seven years ago, I remember there was very strong feeling and it was intimated that the previous Government, the Government now in office, were too pessimistic in relation to the numbers <Col N="1171" /> which should be engaged in full-time membership of the Defence Forces.  It was advanced at that time that their policy was in some way inimical to the interests of the Defence Forces, that they were concentrating overmuch on our Second Line of Reserve.</P>
      <P>Happily, we now have more realism in relation to the number, that are adequate to our requirements, and it seems to be pretty well agreed that what we require is a competent and trained cadre of officers and N.C.O.s with just the requisite number of men to man the military institutions we have.  In fact, it has been said by, I think, Deputy Booth, among others, that a number of the institutions are surplus to our requirements.  I thought that may apply to centres in country areas, but those speakers were emphatic that they were referring to the City of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I could well imagine that the closing down of some of the barracks in Dublin would not bring in its train the social consequences that would arise from the closing down of a barracks in a rural town.  Deputy Russell appeared to think there was some advantage, from the point of view of efficiency, in concentrating our Regular Army in the larger centres of population. I do not agree with that point of view.  I think it desirable that we should have a diffusion of our troops and should retain the centres throughout the country.  If barracks are to be closed down, they should be closed down in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that in many rural towns to-day conditions are not good in relation to business and, therefore, the impact on a rural town, if spending capacity is reduced, due to the removal of a number of soldiers from it, must be borne in mind.  It would be brought forcibly to the attention of the Minister when such things are mooted.  It would be more advantageous to retain the centres throughout the country, because we must bear in mind the connection which it is vital to maintain between the people and the Army.  It is also important to have available fully trained and full <Col N="1172" /> time personnel to assist in the training of, and encouragement of recruitment for, the F.C.A.  In relation to the F.C.A., it may have been an oversight, but I think this is the first occasion on which a Minister has not paid tribute to the voluntary effort which these men are making and to the spare time they devote to this service.</P>
    <P>Numerous Deputies have expressed concern at the situation relating to the general trend and present position of the F.C.A.  A number of them referred to the fact that at least a better fitting uniform is desireable.  It is only natural that when young lads go out on parade, they should attract attention, and they feel very self-conscious because of the type of uniform which is all too conducive of the kind of sneer which so quickly comes from the hurlers on the fence, from the fellows who are not prepared to give their time or efforts to this service.  There is an obligation upon the Minister to see that the boys who are entering the F.C.A. are provided with the best facilities we can afford to give them.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, before I pass from the Regular Army to deal more fully with the F.C.A., that we are at the moment in a transitional period. We are now losing from our Defence Forces and from the administrative side officers and men who have been in the Army since its foundation, and the respect which our Army has earned is no mean tribute to these men.  Now that they are departing from the Army, it is to be hoped that the men who are becoming career officers will emulate the standard of conduct of the men who preceded them.</P>
    <P>There was at one time a feeling that the F.C.A. was a force that could readily be officered, administered and trained by its own members.  I agree it is vital that it should be officered from within its own ranks, but we had to revert to the regular N.C.O. to train F.C.A. members.  There is in the Irish character that geniality and habit of mixing with one's neighbours and becoming friendly with one's neighbours.  That might be all right in other countries and among other <Col N="1173" /> people, but, because of the character of our people, we cannot discard that friendship at the hall door and command the respect which rank must acquire, if it is properly to train young lads, particularly in rural areas. Therefore, the contribution that has been made by the regular trained N.C.O.s has been considerable in that respect.  It has assisted those who are officers in the F.C.A. to overcome many difficulties.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should initiate a drive through the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and Macra na Feirme to secure the best type of member for the F.C.A If the F.C.A. is taken up with any enthusiasm in colleges where these men are being trained as teachers, they will being their enthusiasm to whatever part of the country in which they work later, that enthusiasm which they imbibed in the first instance in the schools, or whatever societies in which they first became interested in the F.C.A.  The need at the moment is to do something for our young people and there is within the framework of the F.C.A. an opportunity to provide physical training equipment and facilities.</P>
    <P>The major difficulty in getting good attendances at parades is in urban centres.  It is more readily available, extraordinarily enough, where men work longer hours and work harder. Where they do that, they are prepared to come to parades, under very adverse conditions of weather, bad roads and so on, to their regular training centres. The difficulty of getting good attendances is not as great in rural areas, as it is where young lads have other activities in which they can engage, where they are attracted by amusements and so forth.  In rural areas, many boys who would otherwise have left the country have been held at home by the spirit of comradeship which develops in an organisation such as the F.C.A.  It would do many boys all the good in the world if they entered such a force and learned the temperament and control which can be an advantage to them, even in their civilian lives, apart from any contribution that might be required from them in the defence of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> There is reflected in this Estimate, and it is the first Estimate to come before the House this year, a small but significant contribution which flows from the budgetary policy of the Government in withdrawing the food subsidies.  It is our intention, on every Vote that comes before the House, to indicate that, because of that policy, what was supposed to be a saving is not, in fact, a saving.  There is no Department of State which will not reflect in its Estimate some small amount put there to meet the impact of the withdrawal of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>There is one activity of the Army which, down through the years, has brought much credit to this country. That is the Army jumping team.  I know that the jumping team, if it goes off or is not too successful, cannot recover overnight.  However, it is gratifying to see the improvement which has taken place in the past few years.</P>
    <P>It has been reported that some of these men who, as Irish Army Officers and as members of the jumping team, have brought great credit to this country, have suffered as a result of the niggardly expenses which are allowed to them.  That is regrettable.  They are only seven or eight in number, and we are not in the position of some of the great countries which can send units of their navies to visit various other countries and be received by those other countries as emissaries of the country they represent.  Among the few emissaries of good will that we have in this country are the jumping team, and they should be treated as such.  With the tradition we have as regards horses, the jumping team is certainly an ancillary industry.  If we have in the Army a small group of competent horsemen who can go out and compete in the world's capitals and who have, in the past, brought honour and prestige to the country and to the Army, they should be properly treated and in the coming years, we ought to give the jumping team the chance and the encouragement which they require, if they are to continue to bring credit to this country.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Giles who suggested a reintroduction of the Construction Corps.  That is a matter which <Col N="1175" /> should at least receive examination.  It has often been said that there are necessary works of national reconstruction which cannot be undertaken, due to our limitations in many respects.  It is possible that an organised force such as the Construction Corps could undertake such work.  Perhaps the Minsiter would look into that matter and see if anything could be done in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Russel referred to compulsory service or national service, which is a different thing from the Construction Corps.  I would not make it compulsory, but I should like to have an outlet for a certain class of young man who, through parental disability or for some other reason, is unliekly to be given an opportunity of advancing himself.  In a force like the Construction Corps, he could get technical training, and at the same time he could contribute in some material way to the creation of some project which would be of assistance to the country.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, in all sincerity, to review his decision regarding the attendance of the Army at the annual ceremonies at Béal na Bláth.  Since Michael Collins was the founder of the National Army, it is only right that the simple little tribute paid by the Army should be continued at the annual commemoration.  If that commemoration had, in the past, been used for the making of political speeches or for the advancement of the political interests of any Party or person, then I would say that the Army should not be in attendance there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the pattern has been, through the years, to gather there and recite the Rosary, and disperse.  On some occasions we have had a tribute from the Army itself and now, if the Army is divorced from it, somebody will have to step into the breach.  I would ask the Minister to review his decision on the matter and to permit the Army to restore the simple tribute which it has, on occasion, paid to the <Col N="1176" /> memory of its founder.  We know that there are men who held different views from those of General Collins, but still they gather there now to do him honour, and I suggest the Minister review his decision and make it possible for a small unit of the National Army to be present at the annual commemoration.  If he does that, the view will follow from it that the National Army is outside politics and it will be an inducement to young men, who have no interest in past times, to some into the Army as recruits to the regular forces or to join the Second Line Reserves.</P>

      <P>Corvettes purchased some time after the cessation of World War II are not capable of protecting our territorial water and keeping poaching trawlers outside.  I should like the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, to devise some scheme of adequate protection for our fishermen.  Fishing is a very important industry.  These corvettes should be scrapped and up-to-date craft purchased.  We should have a naval service capable of protecting our fishermen.  Such a service would add prestige to the country.  Corvettes have never been of any use.  They are <Col N="1177" /> expensive to operate.  They are slow. They should be disposed of to the best advantage.  For adequate protection, some type of underwater craft would be preferable.  I heard one Deputy recommend helicopters.  I do not think helicopters would be satisfactory.  It would be easier to apporoach poaching trawlers under water rather than from the air.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>We spend £6,280,560 on the Army.  I have no objection to that because we require an Army.  The maximum is set at 12,500 men.  I would be content with anything from 5,000 to 7,000 men and those men should be the best paid soldiers in the world.  Everything possible should be done for their welfare and to ensure their efficiency.</P>
      <P>Some people hold we do not need an Army.  Every free country needs an Army of some kind.  I appeal to the Minister to make our Army as efficient as possible and to ensure that both the officers and the men will be well paid, well equipped and well housed. Many of our barracks are entirely antiquated and out-of-date.  The married quarters are most unsuitable.  If one wants to have men satisfied with their conditions, then one must give them the best conditions possible.  I think our people as a whole understand that money must be made available for the Army to ensure that the officers and men are perfectly satisfied.  In the world conditions in which we find ourselves to-day, one never knowns when we may need our Army.  It is expensive to maintain an Army admittedly, but an Army is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People think the Army is no use because they never see it.  Would the Minister consider the advisability of having manoeuvres in different parts of the country.  Would it not be an excellent idea to have manoeuvres in the mountains and glens of Kerry? Would it not be a good idea to have Army bands available at certain public functions?  Would it not also be a good idea to permit the jumping team to take part is sporting events throughout the country?  As I am on the subject of the Army jumping team, may I suggest that the next horse purchased <Col N="1178" /> will be called &ldquo;Killarney&rdquo;. Killarney is as well known as Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We want to keep the Army out of the politics.  With reference to the F.C.A., I have had experience of F.C.A. personnel in uniform passing a meeting where representatives of all political Parties were speaking from the same platform.  The F.C.A. were in full uniform and fully equipped.  They shouted: &ldquo;Up Dev,&rdquo;&ldquo;Up Costello,&rdquo;&ldquo;Up Fianna Fáil&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Up Fine Gael&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Up Sinn Féin&rdquo;.  Once men are in a uniform they should pass such meetings and forget all about politics until such time as they return to civilian duties. I should like to draw the Minister's attention to that.</P>
      <P>If we are to have an army it must be non-political.  If we are to have the F.C.A. it must be non-political when on duty.  I was ashamed on one occasion to have American and English tourists hear of something that happened.  Nobody interested in the Army likes that.  I think the F.C.A. should get every support.  There is one small matter I should like to mention. I have seen members of the F.C.A. at fairs and going to creameries wearing their uniform overcoats.  That should not be.  They should be kept for duty hours.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the desirability of the presence of the Army at Béal na Bláth.  I hold that, not only should they be there, but they should be present at the anniversary celebrations of all the great Irishmen who fought for the freedom of their country down the ages.  It does not matter what side they took in the unfortunate Civil War.  If they did their duty during the Black and Tan War, in ceremonial fashion.  The people would be proud of the Army and would regard it as the nucleus of a bigger force if that were ever required.</P>

      <P>This speeches on this Estimate in the main have been very reasonable and in certain respects they wil prove helpful.  I thank Deputies generally for the manner in which they approached the debate.  I cannot agree, of course, with all the criticism expressed but there were some useful suggestions made.  I am satisfied that the majority of Deputies &mdash;with, of course, the one usual notable exception&mdash;approached the matter in a serious light.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies expressed the view that a large saving was very readily available.  I cannot agree with that for one moment.  I mentioned in my opening remarks that it was obvious from the Estimate that it had been prepared against the prevailing background of financial stringency.  I repeat that.  Anybody who examines the Estimate must agree it is obvious it has been prepared with those financial considerations very much in mind.  It is obvious that no surplus expenditure has been provided for.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies have been making the point that what we should aim at here is a small, well trained Army as a nucleus for expansion in times of possible emergency.  Some Deputies anunciated that idea as if it were a new idea, as if it were not, in fact, the basis on which the Army has always been organised.  The peace-time establishment provided for&mdash;which has never been reached&mdash;was only intended as a nucleus which could be expanded in times of war.  There is no point in that type of war.  There is no point in saying that the Army is organised on too grandiose a scale and that we should now decide to go in, instead, for a small nucleus capable of expansion in times of emergency.  That appears to be an attempt to create the impression that that is not being done at the moment and that, if it were done, there would be a considerable saving.  There is no room for a saving in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been other suggestions as to how money could be saved on this Estimate.  Possibly it would be better if deal with them when I come to deal with the remarks of individual <Col N="1180" /> Deputies.  One suggestion was that money could be saved by reducing the number of occupied posts in the country.  I examined that proposition when I first took over the Department of Defence and when I found it necessary to make certain savings on the Estimates last year.  On examination, I found that the saving that would accrue from that would be not worth while, would not be worth the disruption that would be caused in the lives of soldiers married and settled down in these different posts and would not be worth the inconvenience, and indeed harm, that would be caused to local traders in these areas.  I discovered that there was really nothing in that, That saving would be very small.</P>

      <P>Although Deputy MacEoin was highly critical of certain aspects of my administration during the past year, in the main his speech could be described as one of the most helpful and reasonable speeches I heard here.  I can certainly agree with the majority of the sentiments he expressed.  I am glad to take this opportunity of joining with him, with Deputy O'Higgins and others in the tribute they paid to the services rendered to the State by the outgoing Secretary of the Department of Defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only had 12 months' experience of him but, during that 12 months, I certainly formed the same impression that all my predecessors did.  I know from other members of the Government that the services he rendered, in particular during the <Col N="1181" /> emergency period, will probably never be fully appreciated outside of the people who were associated with him at that time.</P>
      <P>I must also thank Deputy MacEoin for the support he rendered to the recruiting campaign for the Army and the Civil Defence Service.  His remarks in that respect will be of great help in these campaigns.  It is a good thing to know that both the Government and the main Opposition Party realise the importance of building up the strength of our Defence Forces and it is certainly very important indeed that it should be realised that there is unanimity on the necessity of making our people conscious of the urgent need for a well-trained and extensive civil defence organisation.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt about it but there is not a proper appreciation of the importance of civil defence in this country.</P>
      <P>I mentioned in my opening remarks that the recent recruiting campaign had been reasonably successful.  We secured up to 3,000 volunteers.  At the same time, it is a fact that there is a great amount of apathy, particularly among the people who should be most concerned, public representatives, on the question of civil defence.  Anything that any member of this House can do to dispel that apathy and to arouse enthusiasm for the expansion of the civil defence services will be very much appreciated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They certainly will. I can thank my predecessor, Deputy MacEoin, for his help in those respects. Deputy MacEoin went on to refer to the seniority list and I can also agree with the sentiments he expressed with regard to that matter.  Unfortunately, the fact that he did mention it seems to imply that I have been ignoring the seniority list in regard to promotions. I want to assure Deputy MacEoin and other Deputies that the considerations with regard to promotions are based, in the first instance, on seniority.  The <Col N="1182" /> first thing that is taken into account is the question of seniority, but in this Army, now as always, as in other armies, when you come to fill the higher posts it is necessary to consider also the question of suitability for the particular post.  There is always a certain element of selection in filling these higher posts.  That is not peculiar to this Army or to this particular Administration. It always obtained and always has to obtain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Promotion can almost rigidly follow seniority up to a certain rank in the Army, but after that the question of outstanding ability must be recognised and the question of suitability for a particular post must be considered.  I can assure Deputy MacEoin that I intend to pay proper attention at all times to the seniority list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin also referred to the question of people who are interned under the Offences Against the State Acts having visits from solicitors of their choice.  One or two other Deputies also dealt with that subject.  The position in that respect is that all requests for interviews with solicitors have been granted, with two exceptions, and they were both for visits from one particular solicitor.  The statutory instrument in this regard places the responsibility in this matter on the Adjutant-General but, of course, the ultimate responsibility is mine and I accept responsibility for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular case there was a security objection to the particular solicitor who, it was requested, should visit the internee.  I was informed that it was proposed to refuse admission to this particular person and while, as I say, the responsibility is placed on the Adjutant-General, I have no doubt that, if I had demurred, my view would have been accepted but I have given him the responsibility for administering the camp and I certainly concurred with his decision <Col N="1183" /> in view of the fact that this objection was there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister suggest that the internee could see this particular solicitor when he was allowed out on parole?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

It was subsequently withdrawn and later this <Col N="1184" /> man was allowed in but if at any other time similar circumstances should prevail I shall take the same action. Generally speaking, the solicitor of the person's choice is allwoed in.  There is no attempt on my part to force any particular solicitor on anybody there.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEoin also referred to the importance of ensuring the confidential nature of the documents that were contributed to the Bureau of Military History.  The decision that was taken by Deputy MacEoin while in office was that these would be lodged in the strong room in Government Buildings and kept there for a period of 25 years.  That decision has not been changed and the bigger part of these has already been transferred there.  The work of preparing the others and transferring them is proceeding.  If there is any change, I can assure Deputy MacEoin that it is more likely to be to extend the period rather than to shorten it.</P>

      <P>I now come to the contribution to the debate made by Deputy McQuillan.  This was largely the same type of contribution as Deputy McQuillan has been making for a number of years.  It consisted of the usual mixture of bluff and abuse &mdash;bluff intended for those people who do not realise that it is Deputy McQuillan's attitude on every question to try to be on both sides at the same time and abuse for all those who have at any time had the misfortune to incur <Col N="1185" /> Deputy McQuillan's displeasure. Showing his usual contempt for accuracy, his usual disregard for facts, he started off by saying that this Estimate showed that the officer personnel was up to full strength.  In actual fact, of course, the Estimate shows nothing of the kind.  Basing his remarks on that incorrect statement, he said the idea should be to reduce the officer strength or bring up the N.C.O. and private strength.  He was maintaining throughout the whole course of his speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that the burden of the first portion of Deputy McQuillan's speech was that what I should set out to do was to reduce the officer strength or to bring up the strength of the N.C.O.s and men.  He insinuated that the opposite was being done, that the opposite was the policy. If he had any desire to be fair, he should have taken the trouble to examine the Estimate and he would have seen that the Estimates this year do, in fact, show a slight tendency in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimates this year provide for a smaller number of officers and for an increase in the number of other ranks, but Deputy McQuillan, as usual, chooses to ignore these facts.  But the fact that I am doing this at the moment and have taken some steps to reduce the number of officers does not mean that I am accepting the peculiar views in that regard frequently expressed by Deputy McQuillan.  I have decided on a slight reduction in the strength of the officers because I am influenced by <Col N="1186" /> the fact that, due to circusmstances outside my control, the strength of other ranks is low at present and also by the stringent financial situation.  I felt that, purely as a temporary measure, we could manage with fewer officers but I hope in more favourable circumstances I shall be able to correct that situation and get back to full establishment strength.</P>
    <P>It is completely wrong to compare the number of officers with the number of other ranks and to divide the number of other ranks by the total number of officers and then say that proves that we have one officer looking after every six or seven men.  That gives a completely false picture because many of the officers are engaged in other activities.  A number of them look after the F.C.A. and a number are always on courses for different purposes. I hope to get back to the position of more or less full strength in accordance with the peace-time establishement at some future date.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan further demanded that we should give increased pay to the other ranks.  I could certainly sympathise with that, if Deputy McQuillan in the next breath had not demanded a substantial reduction in the Estimate. These conflicting demands show taht the Deputy had no real interest in the problem.  I find that pay increases are given to the Army in accordance with a pattern applicable to all public servants and if the Army is to get further pay increases it can only be done as part of the scheme for the entire public service, Of course that is not a matter for me alone; it is a matter that has to be decided by the Minister for Finance and the Government. But if anybody advocates increased pay surely, if they are to be consistent, they must be prepared to face the responsibility of raising the extra money.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan referred to his recent Private Members' motion.  I suspected he intended to give us a re-hash of the arguments put forward on that occasion and I do not think it necessary to go into these again. All I shall say in regard to the suggestion that I should set up a committee to advise me on defence <Col N="1187" /> policy and expenditure is that I already have at my disposal the advice of two committees which I consider satisfactory.  I have the Defence Council and the Government, and I am quite satisfied with the advice I get from these two bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with his motion regarding defence policy and expenditure, Deputy McQuillan elaborated on the attack he made in that motion on the civilian employees employed in conjunction with the Corps of Engineers in the Army.  He said that was one of the main ways in which money could be saved&mdash;by dispensing with the services of those who are employed on works connected with the maintenance of barracks and in the execution of new works.</P>
      <P>For years since Deputy McQuillan left the Army he has been conducting a ceaseless campaign against his former comrades and superior officers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I intend, while I am in this position, to do my best to defend these people from his venomous attacks.  Year after year Deputy McQuillan in speaking on the Estimate for this Department has attempted to represent the average Army officer as a lazy good-for-nothing who spends the best part of his day in bed, with private soldiers running up and down stairs attending on him. Time after time that was the picture Deputy McQuillan painted and I want to refute his allegations; I find the officers of the Army generally are very efficient and enthusiastic and I find that they pay every possible attention to the performance of their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> Successive Ministers for Defence have refused to accept Deputy McQuillan's picture of some of the senior Army officers whom he has described, saying: &ldquo;Underneath the brass hats are brass heads.&rdquo;  I also refuse to accept that definition of Deputy McQuillan's&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot more brass in the Minister's head than in theirs, although brass is fairly valuable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy McQuillan on other occasions was attacking senior Army officers he concluded by saying he did not care whose heads would roll.  But the heads have not rolled and as far as I am concerned I do not think they should roll.  While I am here I shall certainly see that they do not roll on the basis of anything Deputy McQuillan has brought to light since I assumed office.</P>
      <P>Having failed in his attack on Army officers, Deputy McQuillan has apparently decided to transfer his attentions to civilian employees and the attempt he is making now is to deprive them of their livelihood.  He is now attacking the carpenters, plumbers, painters and other tradesmen employed on works in connection with barracks and on new works for the improvement of Army facilities.  That was one of the main points he made in his Private Members' motion and I had hoped that during the debate on this Estimate the Labour Party would explain to the Dáil why it was they supported Deputy McQuillan's motion to throw these people out of employement and have the work carried out instead by serving personnel of the Army.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the fact that the present system of determining ratheable valuation is based on legislation enacted over a century ago and that it is inequitable in many instances, he will consider the setting up of a commission to study the whole problem and make recommendations for its improvement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The system, as such, of determining valuations, although based on century-old legislation, can itself hardly be described as inequitable.  The anomalies that exist arise largely through the failure of individuals and local authorities to seek the revision of out-of-date valuations.  In the circumstances. I very much doubt whether any advantage would be gained by setting up a commission of inquiry for the purpose suggested by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>When dealing with the number of civilian tradesmen employed by the Army, Deputy McQuillan again showed his disrespect for facts.  I do not think the Deputy will deny that he said there was an increase in the number of civilian tradesmen employed and that, at the same time, there was a decrease in the number of soldiers in the Army.  The fact is that the increase of 30 civilian employees to which I referred is for the coming year.  The provision for the coming year was for increased employment to the extent of 30 civilians over last year, when there was a decrease.  The Estimate provides also for an increase of 250 men in the Army for the coming year.  The increase in civilian employment will take place in the present year, when there will also be an increase in the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan objects to the employment of skilled tradesmen in a civilian capacity, when there are skilled tradesmen available in the Army itself.  The latter tradesmen are <Col N="1201" /> also soldiers and must be trained as soldiers and must learn military engineering.  They must be trained in that work and, therefore, they would not be available for continuous employment in the maintenance of barracks and the construction of new works.  They are in the Army because they are needed as members of the Corps of Engineers.</P>
    <P>In comparing the cost of civilian employees and the cost of civil servants generally with the cost of the private soldiers in the Army, Deputy McQuillan apparently manufactured figures for his own convenience.  The allegation he made was that the cost of civilian employees and civil servants generally was £953,000 and, according to his estimate, about £650,000 is provided for upwards of 4,000 private soldiers.  He expressed the opinion that he could not be more than a few thousand out in his estimate.  If he wanted to be accurate, he would want to increase his estimate by over 100 per cent.  The cost of the private soldiers is £1,220,000 and that does not include marriage allowance which is paid to 1,117 soldiers at a cost of £130,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision is made in the Estimates for 4,639 privates at a cost of £1,220,000, with £1370,000 for marriage allowance, which makes a total of £1,350,000, or something more than double Deputy McQuillan's alleged estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently in his speech, Deputy McQuillan referred to the setting up of an internment camp in the Curragh. I would not object to any reference to <Col N="1202" /> this, because it is possible that some people may disagree with it, but I have no time for Deputy McQuillan in his attempt to pose as a revolutionary. He is not a revolutionary and it is not in him to be a revolutionary.  He is a constitutionalist and accepts his seat in this House and accepts his salary from the Exchequer, but he pretends to sympathise with those people.  If he had any sincerity in him, he would join with those people, but they would not have him any more than any political Party in this House would have him.</P>
    <P>People who have flouted the authority of the State have forced this action by the Government, but I have only contempt for people like Deputy McQuillan who sit on the fence themselves and who have not the character or the sincerity to do more than talk about these things.</P>
    <P>The next Deputy who spoke was Deputy Rooney, who criticised the small number of men provided for in the Estimate.  There are 250 more men provided for this year than last year. Deputy Rooney stated that the strength of the Defence Forces had never been more than 7,500 or 8,000 in the past few years.  I have the figures for recent years here and in 1953-54, when Fianna Fáil were in office, the strength of other ranks was 9,637.  In 1954-55, that strength fell to 8,826; in 1955-56, it fell again to 7,909; and in 1956-57, it fell to 7,524.  In 1957-58, when we were operating on the Estimate prepared by the Coalition Government, the average number was about 7,250.  For this year, we are providing for a strength of 7,500.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney asked a question about the disposal of surplus lands at Tallaght and he said he was under the impression that they had been offered to the Land Commission for division amongst local people.  Deputy Rooney was probably thinking of the lands at Baldonnel which have been handed over to the Land Commission.  I understand that the Land Commission are not interested in the lands at Tallaght and those lands are being disposed of by public auction.  It is expected that they will be auctioned in the very near future. <Col N="1203" /> Deputy Haughey was one of a number of Deputies who paid tribute to the F.C.A. and I am glad to express my appreciation also of the very valuable work that that part of our Defence Forces is doing.  There is no doubt that we are getting very great service at very little cost from the F.C.A. and An Sluagh Muirí and no praise can be too high for these young men who are sacrificing so much of their spare time to preparing themselves to defend the State, should that be necessary.</P>
    <P>I was sorry that there were one or two Deputies who had some adverse criticism to make of that very excellent force.  I want it to be understood that as far as the Government are concerned, we fully appreciate the importance of the work they are doing and the patriotic motives that inspire them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey thinks that possibly in defence policy insufficient attention is paid to the F.C.A. I do not really think that that is so.  Possibly they could be brought more into the picture and I shall look into that aspect of the matter; but there are 450 officers and men of the permanent Defence Forces attached to the F.C.A., and I know that the different units of the Army throughout the country take a very great pride in the efficiency of their local units of the F.C.A. and, in this respect, there is almost as much rivalry between the Army people associated with the F.C.A. as there is between the units of the force itself.  I was very pleased to find the high regard in which the force is held generally in the Army and I know that the Army authorities were very proud indeed of the fact that this year the F.C.A. were able to run their own competitions themselves at the Curragh, without any assistance from Regular Army officers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of shortages of supplies of uniforms, there may occasionally occur shortages of a particular size, but this is hard to avoid, and it occurs only when there is an abnormal demand in a particular area for a particular size.  To ensure completely <Col N="1204" /> against that would involve the tying up of a large sum in maintaining large stocks of every size of the different components of the uniform.</P>
    <P>With regard to accommodation for training for the F.C.A., it is very difficult to get suitable accommodation in the different centres and the Army have had to erect huts in a number of centres in order to accommodate the F.C.A.  There are 53 centres where huts have been erected.  There are three in course of construction at the moment.  These Estimates provide for the erection of four further huts, but the location of these has not yet been decided upon.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins got the impression that developments in other countries in relation to modern weapons and so forth may not get the proper attention in our Army.  I can assure him that the Army staff are as far as possible kept abreast of these developments. They are keeping informed as much as possible with regard to them.  I do not say that we are keeping abreast as regards equipment.  Naturally, we cannot even attempt to do that, but they are doing their best to keep up to date in regard to modern developments in methods of warfare.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to the figures for the strengths over the past few years and he made the point that the strength had never exceeded 8,000. I have already given figures which show that, about 1953-54, the strength reached almost 10,000.  Deputy O'Higgins's point was that, in view of the fact that the full peacetime establishment decided upon after the war has never been reached, it should now be reviewed and a different establishment worked out.  The establishment is at the moment under review, both in the light of our experience with regard to recruiting and in the light of modern developments.  I do not know when that review will be completed, but it is being attended to at the moment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the casualty service for the treatment of wartime casualties, as Deputy O'Higgins says, there has been some difficulty about that and I hope that the problem will be solved in the very near future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> Deputy O'Higgins left the complaint to which he appeared to attach most importance until last.  That was in reference to an answer I gave him to a question he put down with regard to the present strength of the Defence Forces.  I regret that the Deputy should have felt outraged by the fact that, in that reply, the Irish titles of the different component parts of the Defence Forces were used.  Deputy O'Higgins appeared to be very annoyed about that, but I want to assure him that there was no intention on the part of the officers of my Department who framed that reply to cause Deputy O'Higgins any inconvenience.  They were not actuated by any sinister motives, either of denying Deputy O'Higgins the information he sought or of offering him a personal insult by using the Irish language.  I am sorry he should have taken up the attitude he did.</P>
    <P>The position is that only Irish titles are in use in the Department of Defence now.  I would say that these titles were probably used from force of habit, or possibly, if the people concerned in the drafting of the reply did consider the matter, they may have come to the conclusion that, since Deputy O'Higgins was one of those who had the advantage of being educated under a native Government, it was reasonable to assume that he would be able to understand the titles used.</P>

      <P>He complained that he did not know what Na Buan Oglaigh meant and what An Cultaca Oifigeach agus An Cultaca Fear meant.  He knows now, so he has gained even more knowledge. Not alone has his knowledge been increased as to the strength of the Defence Forces, but he also knows the titles for the component parts of the Defence Forces currently in use in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins made the point <Col N="1206" /> that I broke the law and acted illegally in using these titles.  I am aware that it was illegal at one time to use Irish names, but I am also aware that the Constitution enacted by the people 21 years ago established the Irish language as the official language of the State and, while I have great respect for the status of Deputy O'Higgins as a learned counsel, I refuse to believe that I have in any way broken the law by describing the permanent forces as Na Buan Óglaigh and the Reserve of Officers and Men as An Cultaca Oifigeach agus Fear.  I do not intend to take account of the fact that Deputy O'Higgins tells us this is illegal.  I see no objection to the continued use of these titles.</P>
    <P>I could not attempt to justify the expenditure on the Department of Defence to any person who does not believe we should have an Army at all. Anybody who has that opinion is entitled to have it.  It is a matter for himself. But unless a person believes in the desirability and necessity of having a defence force, I could not justify the expenditure involved in this Estimate.</P>
    <P>There does not seem to be much point then in dealing with Deputy Kyne's criticism of the Estimate.  He started off with a straightforward point of view that we should not have an Army here at all except for internal purposes.  This whole Estimate is based on a defence force for the purpose of defending the State from possible external aggression.  That being so, it is impossible to justify the expense to people like Deputy Kyne.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne stated that he does not consider it worth while.  His attitude could be expressed by the phrase that freedom is not worth the shedding of a single drop of blood.  If that viewpoint had always obtained, we would not be here to-day.  He says it is hopeless for us to attempt to defend ourselves against a great power.  I am sure it looked equally hopeless to attempt to free ourselves from domination by a great power, but that has been done for this part of the country at any rate.  While I respect Deputy Kyne's views, I should not like to see them gain any great support.  The freedom <Col N="1207" /> of the country is worth defending and I am glad that the vast majority of the speakers on this Estimate accepted that view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth was one of those who referred to the fact that in his opinion there was an excessive number of posts occupied by the Army.  I have already dealt sufficiently with that.  The saving, such as it would be, would be small and mainly at the expense of the maintenance staffs employed in the different barracks.  In present circumstances that would be undesirable.  In addition, Deputy Booth says&mdash;and there is something to be said for his view&mdash; that there are too many barracks occupied in Dublin city.  The fact is that the accommodation in these barracks is by no means ideal, particularly with regard to dining room accommodation and cooking accommodation. The numbers housed in these barracks during the emergency period could hardly be accepted as a suitable standard during peacetime.  It would not be desirable to overcrowd the different barracks, the putting into them considerably larger numbers of troops would accentuate the difficulties I have referred to in regard to accommodation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth mentioned the question of the professional pay of legal officers and said that that had been overlooked at the time when increases were granted to the other professional officers.  That, it is true, is not included in the actual Estimate. However, sanction has been obtained for the adjustment of that position but was received too late to be reflected in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth also referred to the soldiers' pay section of the Civil Service attached to the Department of Defence.  He may be under a misapprehension as to the actual nature of the work done in that section.  The soldiers' pay section keeps the accounts of the personnel of the entire Permanent Defence Forces as well as the accounts of the Reserve Defence Forces and civilian employees.  That is a total of nearly 40,000 individual accounts.  It is true that the actual cash disbursements to serving N.C.O's. <Col N="1208" /> and privates, to reservists in training and to civilian employees are made by military personnel but all the other payments are made directly by the soldiers' pay section.  The position is not what Deputy Booth imagined it to be and there is a slight reduction in that section this year as against last year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Casey was one of those who criticised An Fórsa Cosanta Aitiúil and An Slua Mhuirí.  I realise he did not intend to criticise the personnel in any way but he was of the opinion that there could be some economies.  He also appeared to be under a misapprehension. He apparently thought the figure of 20,000 I mentioned for the F.C.A. was the total strength of the F.C.A., not the effective strength.  He based his remarks in regard to expenditure on the F.C.A. on the assumption that the majority of that 20,000 were not effective members. That is not the position at all.  The fact is that the latest figures for the effective strength of the F.C.A. is 19,527 and for An Slua Mhuirí, 345. Those are the effective members, the members who are turning up regularly for training and fulfilling the obligations they undertook.  That being so, I do not think anybody can say too much is being spent on the F.C.A. Certainly I have no intention of cutting down in any way on the F.C.A.  I do not think there is any waste there.</P>
    <P>There was also the non-effective strength.  That is roughly half of the effective strength.  It is not true to say that these people joined for the sake of two weeks' holidays during the summer period.  In the first place, they do not go on holidays.  They go for two weeks' training and they do very effective training during those two weeks.  Unless a man has been active and has attended his parades during the year, he is not considered and cannot go on the two weeks' training. Nobody joins the F.C.A. just to get a cheap holiday.  While I hope they all enjoy their two weeks' training, they also give very valuable service to the State during those two weeks.</P>
    <P>There were some suggestions in regard to recruiting made by Deputy Moloney and others.  I shall look into <Col N="1209" /> those.  With regard to the question of helicopters which was raised by Deputy Coogan, Deputy Blowick and others, the military authorities are keeping themselves fully informed as to the uses to which helicopters can be put. The position is that they are not prepared to recommend the purchase of helicopters for military purposes at the moment.  They have some military uses, all right, but there is a number of other things more important from the purely military aspect and which would have to receive prior consideration.  We are not prepared to recommend their purchase at the moment and the uses suggested for them here are not purely military uses.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Blowick who wanted some idea as to the cost of a helicopter.  The cost of a suitable helicopter is reckoned at £36,000 but, of course, that does not mean that the service that Deputy Blowick would wish to see rendered by this type of aircraft could be provided at a cost of £36,000.  The range of these craft is extremely limited and one helicopter would be absolutely no use.  It would be purely a matter of coincidence if it happened to be in the right spot at the right time.  It is estimated that the very minimum that would be of any practical use would be three.  These would have to be stationed at different points along the south and west coast and it would be necessary to set up suitable bases for them there which would also cost a considerable amount. It would also be necessary to train personnel to man them and such personnel would have to be sent abroad for that purpose.  Consequently, the cost of the actual craft gives no indication as to the ultimate cost of setting up a service such as was requested here.  There would be no point whatever, of course, in buying one of these craft and retaining it in Baldonnel.  It would be of no use whatever in the event of an emergency arising on the west coast.</P>
    <P>A number of useful suggestions, which I shall look into, were put forward; some of the things suggested have been already much in my mind.  I am glad that Deputies generally were so helpful and that we <Col N="1210" /> had such interest displayed in the F.C.A. in particular.  A great number of Deputies expressed appreciation of the importance of that constituent of the Defence Forces.  I certainly agree with them and I shall do everything possible to encourage and expand the force in the country.  I do not think there is anything else that requires comment from me at this stage and I would ask the House to accept the Estimate.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,103,170 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Further Pensions and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923, No. 12 of 1927, No. 24 of 1932, No. 15 of 1937, No. 2 of 1941, No. 14 of 1943, No. 3 of 1946, Nos. 19 and 28 of 1949, No. 23 of 1953, and No. 19 of 1957); Military Service Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 48 of 1924, No. 26 of 1932, No. 43 of 1934, No. 33 of 1938, No. 5 of 1944, Nos. 11 and 34 of 1945, Nos. 7 and 29 of 1949, No. 5 of 1953 and No. 12 of 1957); Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 37 of 1936, No. 9 of 1948, No. 30 of 1950, No. 27 of 1952, No. 4 of 1953, and No. 17 of 1957); Payments in respect of Compensation for Members of the Local Defence Force (No. 19 of 1946 and No. 15 of 1949); and for sundry Contributions and Expenses in respect thereof, etc.</P>
      <P>The total sum required for Army Pensions for 1958-59 is £1,654,750, which is a decrease of £2,380 on the Estimate for 1957-58.</P>
      <P>The principal provisions of this Estimate are for pensions under the Military Service Pensions Acts; would and disability pensions, special allowances, dependents' allowances and gratuities under the Army Pensions Acts; and service pensions and gratuities under the Defence Forces (pensions) schemes in respect of service in the permanent Defence Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only appreciable increase occurs in sub-head J&mdash;Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes.  The increase of £47,000 in this sub-head is due to the increasing number of retired and discharged Army and Naval personnel for whom provision has to be made as well as to the introduction last year of a scheme of supplementary retired pay for certain officers on retirement who were awarded the 1916 Medal or the <Col N="1212" /> Service (1917-1921) Medal or both. This scheme&mdash;the Defence Forces (pensions) (amendment) (No. 2) scheme, 1957&mdash;was, it will be recalled, approved last November by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The only reductions, I think, that call for any comment are those under sub-head F&mdash;Allowances and Gratuities to Dependents, etc.&mdash;and sub-head I&mdash; Military Service Pensions.  The reduction of £15,393 under sub-head F as compared with 1957-58 is due to the fact that, when the 1957-58 Estimate was being prepared, a large number of claims for allowances under Part II of the Army Pensions Act, 1953, from relatives of deceased persons with pre-Truce service were under consideration and were likely to be decided in 1957-58.  This accumulation has since been disposed of in the main.  As regards sub-head I&mdash;Military Service Pensions&mdash;the 1957-58 Estimate was prepared on the basis that all outstanding claims would have been decided by the end of December last and that consequently the cost of new pensions, including arrears, would be high.  This was not possible, however, with the result that the sub-head was rather overestimated.</P>
    <P>I now expect that all outstanding applications and petitions under the Military Service Pensions Acts will have been disposed of by the 30th September next and this Estimate provides in sub-head C for the cost of the Referee and Advisory Committee for six months only.</P>
    <P>I hope that the brief comments which I have made will assist Deputies in their examination of the Estimate.  If any further explanations are required I shall endeavour to give them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather disappointed with the Minister's rather cryptic statement on this Vote.  The Minister is, no doubt, aware that there are serious complaints in two sectors of the administration about payment of certain claims.  When I became Minister I found that there was a serious situation relating to the holding of medals by certain people who claimed to have been members of Oglaigh na hÉireann and this was very <Col N="1213" /> much doubted.  There was fairly strong evidence that a substantial number were not members.  That information is at the disposal of the Minister.  I tried to deal with it myself, but the Minister has made no comment on that aspect or what headway he has made in regard to it.  It has brought about the situation in which practically every medal-holder is now suspect and a situation is arising in which when a person, who is entitled or feels he is entitled to a special allowance and is the holder of a medal to which he is properly entitled, makes an application, he is reinvestigated as if he were a doubtful character.  I think that should not be.</P>
      <P>While it is true that a great many people have died and are not available to certify, there is very substantial certification available to the Minister and his Department of which I think he could avail.  I know it is not permissible to advocate legislation on a Vote, and I have no intention of doing so, but I should like to ask the Minister if he has examined proposals which I had dealing with this matter, dealing both with medals and the more important consideration, the winding up once and for all in a satisfactory manner&mdash;which I think is difficult&mdash;of this question of entitlement to military service certificates.</P>
      <P>I left proposals, having gone as far as I could, in the Department and perhaps the Minister might be able to improve on them.  I would commend to him in a very special way the reexamination of these proposals.  I can assure him that, as far as this side of the House is concerned, he will get full co-operation and assistance in putting them into effect.  That is something that has not been said on this side for a long time.  I offer that to the Minister with all the goodwill I can muster.  I think he should avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us that the Estimate that I had, was not sufficient for the payment of a very substantial number, &ldquo;The best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft agley.&rdquo;  I had expectations and intentions, if the people had decided to allow the <Col N="1214" /> Government of which I was a member to remain in office, to have much larger payments made available but upon my new plan.  The people of Ireland decided otherwise; there is nothing I can do about it and all I can say is that I commend the plan to the Minister for his consideration.</P>
    <P>There has been a long struggle for recognition on the part of some of these people and it is a heartbreak that some of them have died without the recognition to which they were entitled.  People are receiving recognition now at this late stage.  I regret to say there was apparently always financial stringency so far as the Old I.R.A. was concerned.  It is a pity, but we have to do the best we can with the material at hand and with whatever money the Minister for Finance for the time being can put at our disposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the Board of Assessors will be wound up in six months but I would ask him not to be too hasty in that regard.  They were wound up before, but it did not work, and it will not work, but if the Minister takes responsibility for the winding up and is able to convince everybody that justice has been done, it will be a great relief to the House and to everybody concerned.  I wish the Minister good luck in his efforts in this long-drawn-out battle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in complete agreement with Deputy General MacEoin in regard to special allowances. The record of the Department of Defence in the past year is anything but satisfactory in regard to these allowances.  There have been interminable delays, and to my mind, inexcusable delays, in dealing with applications. Deputy MacEoin, when he was Minister, knew that people had got medals and certificates of service to which they were not entitled.  As a result the Department started this verification of claims, but the pendulum has swung the other way and the Department has gone too far in having applications verified and reverified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No later than last week I was visited by a battalion company leader who had been written to by the Department regarding <Col N="1215" /> applications he had verified early last October.  He was written to in January this year and again in March.  The Department stated that another officer had given different information and he was asked if he would then re-verify the verifications already made.  That was asking the man if he was a liar when he made his first verification. That sort of thing should be stopped because these unfortunate people would not seek special allowances at this stage and would not go to the trouble of getting officers to verify their claims if they were not quite sure they were entitled to succeed.  They know the Department has become very strict in this matter and know that they leave themselves open to penalties. Many of these people will be dead and gone&mdash;judging by the progress made in the Department now&mdash;before they will be awarded a certificate or a special allowance.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this matter is the means test applied to these people.  It has become too rigorous and exacting. I have been told by social welfare officers that the test applied to applicants for special allowances is far more rigorous than that applied to applicants for old age pensions and that every iota of means, real or imaginary, must be put down by the social welfare officer.  If a dependent of one of these holders of special allowances goes on holidays for a fortnight or a month, an appropriate deduction is made in the allowance.  That is carrying the matter too far.  That is something the Department of Social Welfare does not do in regard to widows' pensions or other pensions or allowances where dependents are involved.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to do two things, to speed up verification in regard to special allowances and not to be too rigorous about means.  I know the Public Accounts Committee some years ago drew attention to the fact that people were getting money illegally.  They never expected that these stringent checks and re-checks would be carried out as a result.  Secondly, I ask the Minister to use more discretion in regard to the means test. <Col N="1216" /> It is far too rigorous and exacting. These people are entitled to some recognition by the State and it should not be as tardy as it has proved to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Being an old I.R.A. man, I have an interest in this subject. I know the whole set-up and I know a number of cases where persons got medals to which they were not entitled. In Dublin, before the Truce, I was a member of a company of Fianna.  There was never much more than a dozen on parade, but during the Truce that number jumped to about 80.  I would say that that was the position all round.  It was a simple thing for people to support the claims of some of those who just came in during the Truce.  I was told that Deputy MacEoin, when he was Minister, was reviewing this whole business and that it was a very big job. Perhaps that is why the Minister has decided that where special allowances come in the case will have to be reproved. I accept that.  It is bad enough to know that a person, might have obtained a medal but that he should get pension as well, not having served, would be a disgrace.</P>
      <P>On the question of Army pensions I always felt it was unfair for people to get pensions because they had pre-Truce active service and that the Civil War period should be taken into account.  I understand the position is that if you had pre-Truce active service the Civil War period was taken into account but if you had pre-Truce service but not active service, then the Civil War period was not taken into account.  If that is correct, it is most unfair because the Civil War should not be considered for service for anyone if it is not considered as service for everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the pre-Truce period, at least in the cities, only small numbers were active.  Only small numbers were invited to be active.  The view has often been held that only a few thousand fought.  You would imagine that the other people were under the bed.  There were more than a few thousand who served.  The practice, as I remember it, was that only a few members out of a company would be <Col N="1217" /> needed for a particular duty and those same few men were always inivited by the officer in charge for such duty. The other men, though they desired activity, were not given the opportunity to engage in it.  That happened in most of the city companies to my knowledge.</P>
    <P>A very large number of men suffered a great deal during the Civil War. They lost their jobs and their liberty. Many of them had to leave the country and they never received as much as a week's money for all their trouble and loss.  Those men should have received some form of gratuity to help them over that difficult period but those men were denied any help even from a latter-day Government on whose behalf they acted.  As I said, it was not the fault of many men if they were not active.  There was considerable suffering but only those who said they were on active service in the Tan War and in the Civil War received any benefit.</P>
    <P>In respect of disability, a number of persons suffering grave disability never received any service pension. The reason was that when the first Disability Act came out you had to prove that your disability was due to service.  In many cases, through lack of evidence or by reason of the fact that the disability then existent was only latent although later on it became aggravated, these men were turned down.  However, there was in the Act a clause that where new evidence could be produced the Minister for Defence could reopen a case.  At a later period an Act was brought in which provided that where it was shown that a person's disability was aggravated, though not directly caused, by service he was entitled to a pension, but in this later Act there was no section empowering the Minister to reopen a case where new evidence arose.</P>
    <P>In most of the Acts there was a period for making application.  If the application was not in by a certain date you could then make no claim. There was a number of cases where persons were not in a position to make their claim within the period prescribed in the Act and because there <Col N="1218" /> was no clause enabling the Minister to bring their case again before the board, they had to do without any form of assistance.  The Minister should give a little thought to this matter, as well as the other matters I brought up&mdash;the question of medals, the question of those men who suffered during the Civil War period and who received no assistance.  I shall say no more.  I wanted an opportunity for the last 30 years to make those remarks.</P>

Le linn an tréimhse atá sé ann mar Aire, tá obair maith tabhachtach déanta aige agus tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh tortha tabhachtach ar na rudaí atá idir lamhaibh aige.  Tá súil againn go léir ná luíonn sé sin ar an Aire go h-iomlán mar tá bord aige agus caithfidh sé brath ortha na casanna a scrúdú go cúramach ach ba mhaith an rud é dá ndéanfadh an tAire féachaint isteach ortha i dtreo is ná béadh aon mhoill fhada ortha.</P>
      <P>I should like to say, Sir, how grateful many people are to the Minister who, in the short period he has been in office, has cleared up a number of difficult cases, cases that have been there for years, very troublesome cases of people who have been waiting for years for a decision.  In a number of these cases judgement has been arrived at to the satisfaction of all concerned.  We know that the Minister is not able to do everything.  We know that he has a board on which he must depend to sift the evidence and bring in a verdict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I would say that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction still.  I would be inclined to agree with Deputy MacEoin when he says that the end of the year is a better time for the exercise of the functions of the board and for the making of inquiries. There are many people who were giving information and doing special work, people who were specially appointed to do special work, and the officers who could verify that they were doing that work have, in many <Col N="1219" /> instance, gone to their eternal reward. There are now left only a certain number of company or area officers who have some knowledge that these people were doing that work but who have not sufficiently detailed knowledge of it to justify the award of certificates.</P>
    <P>These are officers of integrity and when they are prepared to give evidence on behalf of men who sacrificed themselves, even though they do not know the details of the service, I think it should be taken for granted that these men, having been so unselfish through the years, are not claiming anything to which they are not entitled. There is still a great deal of dissatisfaction is certain cases and I think that these cases should be reviewed before there is a final close&mdash; down on the verdicts.  I agree with Deputy Carty that there is a good deal of delay in dealing with claims for special allowance.  These are very difficult cases.  In many instances there has to be medical verification and after that a means test.  I know that there will be a certain amount of delay, but, in some cases, that delay had gone far beyond what should be expected in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The general position had been improved by the Minister.  I hope he will continue in that way until the few outstanding claims of men&mdash;I would say there are only a few left in each company area&mdash;that can be verified by the company or battalion officers, will be verified so that when their cases close there will not remain a residue of discontent with regard to service which was so unselfish, so successful and rendered agaist great odds and which succeeded in establishing part of the State in freedom among the nations. Whatever doubt there may be in these cases the benefit should be given to the people concerned.  Their claims should not be rejected because of matters of detail after so many years by members of a board who may be too exacting in these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing I detest is the shedding of crocodile tears.  Year after year we see these crocodile tears <Col N="1220" /> shed in this House about the poor unfortunates who fought for the freedom of this country.  When General MacEoin was Minister for Defence the thought of these gentlemen.  Some of them had service in the Army of the State and he took steps to ensure that they would be permitted to continue to serve despite the fact that they had reached the normal retiring age.</P>
      <P>These were men who fought in 1916 and who fought the Black and Tans and General MacEoin permitted them to retain their ranks in the Army for a further period of two years.  One of the first actions that the present Government took was to retire these men compulsory and this House agreed with that.  They were retired last November. We thought that certain economies would be effected be these retirements but they were no sooner retired when they were replaced by men of the same rank.</P>
      <P>We now find an increase of £47,000 under sub-head J to provide pensions for these pre-Truce officers whom we compulsorily retired.  We find men who could have remained in service for the next 18 months retired compulsorily and replaced by other men.  We find them compulsorily retired and an increase of £47,000 in this sub-head to give them pensions.  Then we come here with crocodile tears and say what we would love to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McCarthy. When we find a man who fought the Tans and never got a pension, who now finds himself down on his luck, with his health gone and who seeks a pension, it should be paid to him forthwith.  These men have waited for 30 years and have asked the State for nothing.  When such men lose their health why should investigating officers spend years investigating their claims?  I know of one case and I may say that the present Minister was not the Minister in charge when the case was being investigated.  I was particularly interested and after fighting the Minister and his Department for 18 months we succeeded in getting a special allowance of £90 a year. However, on the morning I was notified of that award I was also notified of the unfortunate man's <Col N="1221" /> death.  He was a gentleman named O'Donnell from the village of Kincasslagh in Donegal.  I am not giving a fictitious name.</P>
    <P>I see a Deputy in the Government back benches appears to doubt my work.  All this is quite true; on the very morning of his death I received notification.  I wrote the Department and asked: &ldquo;Will you even give some little grant towards the funeral expenses of this unfortunate veteran who fought for his country and died as a result of that of declining health?&rdquo;  Not one solitary penny was forthcoming.  Those are the things that make one feel futile in one's efforts to do something for these unfortunate.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a young and active man and he could cut out this red tape.  He has had some experience of the Army himself.  He knows the position of these unfortunates.  They do not ask for this pittance until the very last minute, until they have been deprived of their health.  In the name of providence, let us speed thing up and give these people the allowances to which they are entitled.  I join with Deputy MacEoin, Deputy Sherwin, Deputy McCarthy and Deputy Carty in appealing to the Minister to cut out these pin-pricking investigations and pay to these people&mdash;the last few left &mdash;the special disability allowances to which they are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a few points in connection with sub-head J. in this Estimate.  I hope that the Minister will be a little bit more accurate in his figures in this connection than when he was replaying to the debate on the main Estimate in relation to the expenditure on Defence. When the Dáil resumes after Ester I shall take the opportunity of having the exact figures with regard to the pay of the privates in the last 12 months clarified in comparison with the pay of the civilians and civil servents attached to the Army.  I still maintain that the civilian employees and the civil servents had emoluments almost £300,000 in excess of the pay received by the privates.  Those figures cannot be contradicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out that there was an increase <Col N="1222" /> of £37,000 in the Estimate for Defence, that there was a further increase which should have been shown in that Estimate but which was transferred for administrative purpose to Vote 58, namely, Army Pensions.  The majority of the sub-heads in Vote 58 deal with the Old I.R.A., military service pensions and so forth, but the Defence Forces proper have now been brought within the scope of that Vote and I see no reason why the sub-head covering pensions for the regular Defence Forces should not be included in the Estimate for Defence itself so that the public might have a true picture of the total expenditure under the Defence Estimate and on the defence programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out recently that a member of officers were being retired.  I understand many of them are quite capable, fit and intelligent enough to serve for a further period. The cost of retiring pay this year is £128,859.  But that is not the full figure because it does not take into account the extra moneys that will be needed to pay the pensions of the officers whom the Ministers recently retired. There is a note at the foot of page 333 of the Book of Estimate, which states:&mdash;</P>

    <P>I take it that those figures are all in excess of the retired pay given under sub-head J, namely, £128,000.  If we add the extra cost that I have mentioned that will bring the total with regard to retired pay of officer personnel over £180,000.  That is a not inconsiderable sum and it is no harm to have this particular matter brought to the notice of the public.  The position might not be so bad if the actual amount were static.  Nobody suggest that men who have given loyal and efficient service should not be recompensed. It is an accepted fact in the Civil Service and in local authority employment that servants, when they retire, should get a reasonable pension. When, however, we find pension figures <Col N="1223" /> beginning to creep up and the amount involved increasing year by year, particularly since the Minister took office, it is time to have a future look at the problem of expenditure on both Army pensions and the Defence Forces themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his usual fashion, and with his usual ability for misrepresentation, will no doubt seek to suggest that I do not want to see any pensions whatever paid to either officers or men.  To save myself from that type of misrepresentation, at which the Minister is so expert, I must put it on the records of this House that I have no objection in the world to any State servent being properly recompensed for his services, but I suggest to the Minister that his actions in recent months in connection with the Defence Forces are responsible for the fact that not alone have we an increase in the main Estimate itself but we have a very substantial increase in pensions as well.  These actions of the Minister may result in increasing taxation.  Can anybody suggest that there has been an increase in efficiency in the Army as a result of the Minister's actions? The fact is we have a reduction in numbers in certain categories, especially in the lower ranks.  But, despite that reduction, there has been no increase in pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we come to the retired pay of officer personnel we find there is a substantial increase and the reason for that increase is because the Minister got rid of certain members of the Defence Forces for whom he had little love and very little regard for their services. It will be suggested to me that the Minister retired these officers for the sole purpose of allowing the junior officers to gain promotion. The Minister will not get away with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that were the case it would be essential each years from this on to start improving immediately the top echelon if he is to leave room for promotion for <Col N="1224" /> all the deserving officers in the Army. If that were the case, we could expect each year a substantial increase in the pension allowance scheme.  I do not think at a time like this, when every section of the community is asked to tighten its belt, when the Minister for Finance states that money is not available&mdash;even for what can be described as most desirable objectives&mdash;that we can afford to retire men who were physically fit and not be in a position to satisfy the rightful ambitions of a large section of the junior serving officer personnel.  It would be far better to leave this question of promotion within the Army on its normal basis in peace time so that when a promotion takes place, it would take place automatically over a period of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The points raised were not very many. In the first instance, I propose to deal with those concerning special allowances. Allegations were made that <Col N="1225" /> there are serious delays in dealing with special allowances.  I do not find that is so.  On occasions the consideration of applications is long drawn out but generally speaking I find that on any occasion on which there is a long period of delay the reason is that adverse reports have been received.  It is in an attempt to resolve the doubt thereby created that the delay takes place.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies objected to the reinvestigation in these cases.  As Deputy MacEoin pointed out, it was found that a number of people had been awarded medals without being entitled to them in accordance with the law.  It was found necessary then to reinvestigate these cases.  I do not think that any officer asked to reverify should feel insulted about that. A number of cases of genuine mistaken indentify have been brought to light. There are cases of people with the same or very similar names in the one area.  After the passing of such a long number of years people can often be mistaken in regard to the identification of an applicant.  A certain amount of public money may be saved by reinvestigation. It is the duty of the Minister for Defence to see that public money is given only to those people entitled to it in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of the relaxation of the means test, I should like to relax it, but these special allowances are at the moment costing the country a considerable amount; £387,400 is the estimate for the coming year.  That aspect of it has to be considered. I am investigating the possibility of relaxing the means test but I do not know whether I shall be able to do it or not.  I should like to do it.</P>
      <P>Do rinne an Teachta Mac Cárthaigh tagairt don iarracht atá á déanamh chun na hiarrataisí le pinsin seirbhís mileata a glanadh suas.

    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all that has to be said in <Col N="1226" /> regard to special allowance.  It is all right for Deputy O'Donnell to suggest that I can out red tape.  They are safegurds for the expenditure of this public money.  The question was raised of the cost of the supplementary retired pay being granted to certain Army officers.  That was agreed by both Houses of the Oireachtas only last year and I do not think it is necessary for me to go into the reasons for it.</P>
    <P>It was not to make opportunities for promotion that I decided to withdraw the grant of two years' extension.  It was restore the opportunities of promotion that were there for the younger officers prior to the granting of that extension.  I make it quite clear that I had no objection to those people being rewarded for the services they rendered.  What I objected to was that they should be recouped at the expense of their fellow officers.  It has cost some money to clear that up; but I think it was worth while for the beneficial effect it had on the morale of the Army.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £65,040 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice, including certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle and if it is agreeable to the House, to follow the practice of previous years and to deal with the Votes for which the Minister for Justice is responsible, namely Nos. 27 to 35, as a group so that there may be one general discussion, without, of course, prejudicing the right of any Deputy to raise any particular point on any particular Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entire group of Estimate, taken together, shows a net increase of some <Col N="1227" /> £114,000, which is almost exactly the amount of the increase in the Estimate for the Garda Siochána.  The largest single item in this increase is the extra provision that has to be made for police pensions which are expected to cost some £60,000 more in the coming year.  The upward trend in the expenditure for pensions is likely to continue for some years to come as there are now over 3,000 members of the Force who are, by reason of their service, entitled to retire on pension whenever they wish.</P>
    <P>During the year 1957-58, 250 recruits were enrolled in the  Garda Síochána but, notwithstanding this, the overall strength is still 100 or so less than it was on the 1st April, 1957 and over 1,000 less than it was ten years ago. The economies in man-power that have been achieved have necessitated an increased use of motor transport.  All but 31 of the Garda districts have already been supplied with patrol cars and it is now proposed to provide a car of each of these districts at a cost of about £19,000.  A similar number of mew cars are required to replace existing cars which have become unreliable and which it would be uneconomic to retain.  The additional provision that has has to be made for the purchase of transport is in the order of £32,000 and this amount, together with the extra £60,000 that has to be provided for pensions, accounts for the greater part of the increase in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>In the course of the year it is expected that there will be about 420 vacancies in the force, arising from the usual causes and, to fill these, it is proposed to recruit 400 Gardaí of whom 12 will be women, if the legislation that is in contemplation is enacted. All those who qualified at the examinations held in December, 1956, and December, 1957, will be called up in due course and there will be another examination for recruits in June.</P>
    <P>Within the past few days I have received from the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána an interim report on crime during 1957.  It shows that there has been an increase in the number of indictable officers of about 12 per cent. <Col N="1228" /> It is in the Dublin Metropolitan Distirct that the increase has taken place and there has been little or no change in the rest of the country.  Most of the increase is attributable to the fact that in the course of the years the number of bicycles stolen exceeded the number stolen in the previous year by more than 1,000.  The figures, which are provisional and subject to correction, put the number of indicate offences known to the police last year at a total of 14,322 for the whole country as compared with a total of 12,782 in the previous year and 11,531 in 1955.  In the Dublin Metropolitan District alone the number of indictable offences known to the police have risen to 8,750 as compared with 7,120 such offences in 1956 and 6,333 inn 1955.</P>
    <P>As usual about 95 per cent. of these crimes, that is to say, of the total volume of indicatable crime, consisted of the offences of house-breaking, stealing and other forms of dishonesty and it is in the field that there has been the most persistent and progressive deterioration in public morality. In this situation I suppose we may congratulate ourselves that there has been no significant change in juvenile crime, which has shown a slight decline.  But the fact that in 1957 there were no fewer than 2,368 persons under 18 charged, and a further 665 cautioned in respect of indictable offences, shows how serious the situation is&mdash;the more so as it is likely that these figures do not tell the whole story.</P>
    <P>In view of the crime wave, I would be glad to be able to tell the House that there had been an increase in the proportion of the indictable offences known to the police that have been cleared up.  But this is not the case and, while the position outside Dublin is little changed at over 80 per cent., the percentage of detections in Dublin has dropped from about 40 per cent. to about 32 per cent.  To put the matter in perspective, however, I should mention, first of all, that a detection rate of 32 per cent. for a large urban area is roughly the same as that obtaining in comparable conditions in other countries and, secondly, that the rate is affected to a very large extent by <Col N="1229" /> the detection rate for larceny, which cannot but be low from the nature of the crime, through larceny is, of all crimes, the one that is most frequently committed.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin Metropolitan Division larcenies account for 81 per cent. of all indictable crimes.  Moreover, the substantial increase in the number of larcenies of pedal bicycles was, to a large extent, responsible for the drop in the detection rate, as the stealing of bicycles is harder to clear up than other type of larceny.  In the case of burglaries, housebreaking and kindred offences, the detection rate was as high as 69 per cent. and the whole picture is likely to look better when the final figures are available.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile I should like to repeat a warning that has been given from time to time by some of my predecessors. It is that, no matter how numerous and efficient they may be, the police cannot be expected to prevent the commission of many crimes such as larcenies and, that at a time like the present, it would be well if members of the public took all possible steps themselves to protect their own property.  Many burglaries of business premises could be prevented by the employment of night watchmen and there are many cases in which, in view of the value of the goods stored and the ease with which the stores can be broken into, the employment of a night watchman is a precaution that the owners can reasonably be expected to take, especially in view of the resignation on pension of so many excellent and experienced men from the Garda Síochána.  Another type of crime which can be prevented by taking suitable precautions is the larceny of property from unattended vehicles or the stealing of overcoats from place of public resort.</P>
    <P>I come now to the problem of public order and the security of the State which continues to the threatened by the irresponsible activities of unlawful organisations.  As the House is aware these activities were condemned both by the Taoiseach and by his immediate predecessor, the leader of the Opposition but as they not showed no sign <Col N="1230" /> of abating but actually showed an increase it became necessary at the beginning of July to bring into force Part II of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940.  Since then I have signed a number of internment warrants on the authority of which 131 persons are at present detained. It is my hope that the necessity for signing many more such warrants will not arise.  Should, however, the public peace and safety be endangered by a continuance of these regrettable activities I shall have no hesitation in doing so.</P>
    <P>Besides the internees, there are 18 persons serving prison sentences for offences against the State or cognate offences.  I have no doubt that the action taken by the Government and internment of the persons responsible for this campaign has saved the country from much useless bloodshed. I am satisfied too, that the measures that have been taken by the Garda Síochána on the Border have offectively prevented their plans from coming to fruition and that the attempt that is being made to usurp the powers of Government and involve the country in civil strife is not going to succeed. In this regard, some hundreds of members of the Garda Síochána have had to be diverted from their ordinary duties to deal with the situation on the Border, and, in Dublin, the Special Branch has had to be strengthened at the expenses of other branches.  In addition there had been increased expenditure on transport and equipment. But this is the least of the ways in which these people are damaging the interest of the country.</P>
    <P>Turning from the Vote for the Garda Síochána there does not appear to be any significant change in the other Estimate all of which provide for expenditure on essential services and show little variation from year to year. In the case of the Vote for my own office, provision is made as usual for the staffing of a number of voluntary boards such as those that have been established under the Adoption and Censorship Acts.  I should like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the public spirit which has led so many busy people to render so much unpaid service to the community and to tell <Col N="1231" /> the House that all these boards are working harmoniously and well.  It is in Vote 35 that provision is made for the Charitable Donations and Bequests Office, but the charity commissioners, too, deserve a tribute for their work which is of the greatest possible value to the public though it is apt to pass unnoticed because it is of such a technical kind.</P>
    <P>In the case of Vote 29 it will be observed that the decline in the prison population, which has occasioned some Press comment, is again reflected this year in the smaller number of prisoners for which provision is being made. What is not so widely known is that so few youth are being sentenced to Borstal detention&mdash;in fact, no more than three in 1957.  This form of detention is intended for boys between 16 and 21 years of age whose criminal habits or tendencies, or association with persons of bad character, make it appear expedient that they should be subject to detention under suitable discipline and instruction for a period of two of three years.</P>
    <P>The system in reformative rather than punitive and in practice an inmate is released on licence before his sentence expires if a suitable offer of employment is forthcoming.  Apart from practical training, inmates receive instruction in elementary educational subjects and there are ample sports facilities, and I have no hesitation in saying that St. Patrick's is as efficiently and intelligently run as any institution of this kind.</P>
    <P>In former years my predecessors have all too frequently had occasion to express regret for delays in the transaction of business in the Central Office of the Land Registry and sometimes in the Registry of Deeds.  I am glad, therefore, to be able to say that in both cases, there have been much fewer complaints in recent times and, as I believe, much less ground for complaint. Not that the Business of the Land Registry can ever be quite up-to-date <Col N="1232" /> but there are no longer any abnormal arrears.</P>
    <P>There is little more I can say at this stage but if there is any point on which the members of the House would like to have further information I shall do my best to supply it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving to report progress, I should like to say just a few words.  The Minister said that if there was anything on which we would like further information he would try to supply it.  This Vote, in my calculation, covers something short of 8,000 public servants and the Minister has not said a single word as to whether these people, like their colleagues in the industrial and other spheres, are to get any increase in pay to make up for the extra sacrifices imposed on them in the increased cost of living.</P>
      <P>By a calculation made in this morning's newspapers, the revenue is running about £5,500,000 extra on last year.  That means that the present Government has clawed out of the pockets of the people £5,500,000 more than they were made to pay in the previous year.  In addition to that, they have off-loaded on to the people another sacrifice of £6,500,000 arising from the fact that the people have to bear the cost of the food subsidies in their daily lives so as not to have them borne by State revenue.  In this way, £11,500,000 extra is taken, so to speak, by way of sacrifice cannot hold out any ray of hope to the nearly 8,000 workers embraced in these Votes that they will get any extra benefit such as the benefits people in industrial life have secured and which even-the central local authority employees in the City of Dublin have got.  That is one subject on which I should like to hear more from the Minister.  It is something we can discuss after Easter.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 15th April, 1958.</P>
