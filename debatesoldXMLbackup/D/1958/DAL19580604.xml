      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order, Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  If the debate on No. 2, the Transport Bill, is concluded by 11.30 it is proposed to take, in No. 3, Votes Nos. 50 to 66, the Department of Industry and Commerce Votes, until 1.30; and then Votes Nos. 37 to 45, the Education group.  Questions will be taken at 3 o'clock.  It is proposed that Government business be not interrupted to-day to take Private Deputies' business.  Should it happen that the Transport Bill will not be concluded by 11.30, we shall take the Education Estimates, Votes Nos. 37 to 45.</P>

    <Title>Transport Bill, 1958&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>An amendment, in the name of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, appeared on the Order Paper as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>23.  Before Section 26 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding Section 9 of the Road Transport Act, 1933, a person whose only or chief occupation is farming may, without being the holder of a merchandise licence, carry for reward in a vehicle drawn by a tractor owned by him live stock owned by a person resident not more than two miles from the carrier's residence if the live stock are being carried to or from a farm from or to a live-stock auction mart on the day on which the auction takes place at that mart and they are not being carried in either direction on any part of a public road which is more than 20 miles by public road from his residence.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment thereto:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> In the fourth line, to delete &ldquo;drawn by a tractor&rdquo;.&mdash;(Deputy Sweetman.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I had considerable sympathy with the Minister when I heard him making his case for his amendment in the House last night, chiefly because I felt that he had been charged with making a case in which he himself did not believe.  I say that for many reasons. To my mind, first of all, this amendment of the Minister does represent a very serious departure from transport policy, as it has been pursued in this House for quite a long time, a departure from transport policy as enunciated by the Minister himself, both inside and outside the House.  I felt, therefore, when the Minister was speaking last night, making a case for this amendment, that he was to a large extent speaking with his tongue in his cheek.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the reason the Minister eventually put down this amendment was the considerable pressure brought to bear on him, even within his own Party.  I think it cannot be denied that it is inappropriate that such a serious departure from transport policy should be made in this fashion, by way of an amendment to a Bill where it is scarcely appropriate at all.  I recall that when we were discussing an amendment moved by Deputy Cosgrave yesterday, which urged that facilities to licensed hauliers should be extended &mdash;that they should be allowed be greater carrying capacity and greater scope of operation&mdash;the Minister said that, whatever about the merits of the argument, he felt this Bill was an inappropriate place to discuss them, because the amendment did represent a definite departure from what had been the Government's policy in regard to transport.  I am quite sure it is clear to the Minister that that argument applies with equal force to his own amendment now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving the amendment the Minister said that a concession, such as that outlined in his amendment, has been recommended in the Beddy report, and that is true.  However, it <Col N="1170" /> is significant that although such a recommendation had been made in the Beddy report, in the Minister's statement on transport in November of last year, when he outlined what his new Transport Bill might contain, he made no reference at all to the fact that we would now be discussing such a departure here.  Quite obviously, before the Minister made his statement and before he introduced this Bill, he must have given very serious consideration to every recommendation in the Beddy report.  As well as that, following the publication of the Beddy report, various interests who felt they had some useful comment to make, made their comments to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister had the report of the Committee on Internal Transport before him and he also had recommendations made by various representatives from different sectional interests.  I know that some interests urged the Minister not to agree to this recommendation and I think it may be taken, as well, that organisations like the National Farmers' Association, at that time, put their case very forcibly before the Minister.</P>
    <P>Having weighed all these arguments the Minister saw fit to make no reference to the matter in his policy statement of November last and to exclude any such provision from the Bill as he first brought it to the House.  It is reasonable, in those circumstances, to say that the Minister had rejected that particular plea.  It is a plea that was not a new one, a plea on behalf of the farming community that they be allowed some facilities for the haulage of goods for themselves and their neighbours.  The Minister recognised that as a departure from the accepted transport policy of the country and he rejected it.  To my mind, then, it was only as a result of considerable pressure that he found himself in the minority in his own Party.  Because of that I had considerable sympathy for him when he found himself in the position of making a case for this amendment last night.</P>
    <P>I think there is no doubt at all but that this amendment gets at the kernel of this whole Bill.  To a large measure, whatever good is in the Bill and whatever <Col N="1171" /> concessions are made in it will, to a great extent, be completely offset by this unfortunate amendment.  It may be said in defence of the amendment that the concessions given to the farming community are very limited and are clearly specified.  We all know from experience, however, that those who want to get outside the law, particularly as far as illegal haulage is concerned, can do so quite easily.  The fact of the matter is, that under this amendment a farmer or his family having a tractor is entitled to haul goods for a distance of 40 miles&mdash;20 miles to the market and 20 miles in the other direction.  I can see the difficulties that the Garda, or anybody else charged with detecting illegal haulage, are going to have from now on.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that the Minister is aware that a provision quite similar to this has led to all sorts of trouble as far as road transport is concerned in the North of Ireland.  Their experience there has been that such a provision has given an opportunity to people to get completely outside the law in regard to illegal haulage.  We know that the law, as it stood up to now, gave ample scope to people to carry on illegal haulage.  I had urged, and I know it to be the intention of the Tánaiste, that this Bill should go a long way towards putting the illegal haulier off the road.  Some sections of the Bill will help in that direction. The Minister did put sections into this Bill which will be a deterrent to the illegal haulier but it is apparent that, after the publication of the first list of amendments, the pressure on the Minister became so great that he agreed to this amendment which, to a large extent, completely nullifies much of the good work which the Bill set out to do.</P>
    <P>Because of that I would ask the Minister to consider reverting to his original opinion when he had studied the report and the representations made by the various groups and came to the decision that such a provision was undesirable in this Bill.  To my mind, this is the thin edge of the wedge and he will find it extremely difficult <Col N="1172" /> to resist other types of pressure which will obviously be brought to bear on him to get away from what he himself enunciated as the transport policy of this country.  I ask him to have another look at the matter and to realise that there is a danger that this amendment will completely nullify what is otherwise good in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's sympathy is appreciated but it is misplaced. My attitude to the idea which this amendment contains is not what he assumes.  This is not the first time that this idea was considered in the House.  We all recognise that since the Road Transport Act of 1933 was passed new transport needs have arisen and other things have taken place which make justifiable some modifications of the restrictions.</P>
      <P>The matter was discussed in the Dáil in the lifetime of the previous Government and Deputy Norton set up an inter-departmental committee to consider what could be done.  That committee rejected the idea of doing anything because of the practical difficulties associated with the modification of the restrictions.  The Beddy Committee came to a different conclusion and recommended that something be done to facilitate the haulage of farm produce for reward by farmers for their neighbours.  They dealt with it from the point of view of what was necessary and equitable rather than what was practicable.  The objection to a wider proposal than is in the amendment is the danger that a new type of transport operator would be brought into being and that people would get into the business as a means of livelihood, and then, not being able to make a livelihood out of it, would get into illegal haulage in other directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When, therefore, the National Farmers' Association came with this proposal to me, I examined it from that point of view, to see could we go thus far to meet the representations they were making, without creating these dangers which we feared.  I found we could.  It seems to me, so long as we confine the modification of the restrictions to the extent that is <Col N="1173" /> proposed, that a farmer should be allowed to use the combined tractor and trailer to carry live stock to an auction mart on the day the auction was being held at the mart, the task of the Guards in supervising such operations would be simplified and the danger which we saw&mdash;that is, the emergence of a new type of public transport operator&mdash;would not arise.</P>
    <P>I would agree fully with the Deputy that that is as far as we could go without creating such a danger.  That is why I could not agree to Deputy Sweetman's suggestion that this facility should be extended also to cover lorries.  I think that would open up this prospect I refer to, of people acquiring lorries for the purpose of doing this business and, finding there was in this business not enough income to give them a livelihood, pressing for further modifications of the restrictions, or illegally getting into haulage operations.  Indeed, the view of the National Farmers' Association is that this is of interest to them at all only in so far as the road tax concession would operate&mdash;which, of course, would not apply in the case of lorries.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Casey is correct in stating that this amendment will widen the operations of illegal haulage or undermine the principles of the Bill.  I am very satisfied in my mind on that score.  I think that, so long as it is confined as it is now proposed, that is not likely to arise.  Indeed, I was impressed by the reasonable case which the representatives of the National Farmers' Association made in that regard and by the fact that they limited their proposal to what is in this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment, but I fear it does not go just far enough.  The Beddy Report recommended the carriage of goods by the farmer and I really think that, in the very near future, in addition to cattle in the auction marts we shall also have various other commodities. Therefore, in addition to permitting the transport of cattle, farm goods generally should be permitted, as long as they are for sale in an auction mart.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>Wool, for instance, is a commodity which will be offered for sale in the auction mart before this year ends.  It would not be practicable or feasible to employ a six-ton C.I.E. lorry to go around to the farmers' houses in the morning to collect wool from half a dozen farmers. In the first instance, such a lorry could not enter 75 per cent. of the farmers' places.  It would be altogether impracticable to expect either C.I.E. or the private haulier to cater for the requirements of the present day.  I am glad the Minister has realised the change which has come over the marketing system in the present time and that we here must change the legislation to cater for these developments.</P>
      <P>While I know that 20 miles is a very reasonable distance to expect the tractor and trailer to travel to a mart, I can foresee difficulties where that 20 miles limit will exclude farmers in certain peninsulas from bringing their cattle to a mart.  For instance, a new mart is being erected in my town, in Skibbereen.  Previous to this we had to transport our cattle to Bandon, a distance of 33 miles.  From Skibbereen to the Mizen Head is 35 miles.  I expect that the mart in Skibbereen will be the mart furthest west in that area.  Therefore I think the Minister should consider that the transport of cattle or agricultural produce to the nearest mart would be involved in this amendment.  Otherwise, the people of the Mizen and Goleen and, I am sure, other outlying areas, will be greatly inconvenienced, as they will have no other market but the nearest mart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the concessions are not wide enough for modern times.  While I welcome this and am very glad the amendment has been brought in, I agree with Deputy Sweetman's amendment that it should be extended to cover light pick-up trucks.  They are not at all in competition with public transport or with the private haulier. They are catering just for a section of the people which could not be catered for otherwise.  A wool market may be <Col N="1175" /> held only twice a year; the mart is once a fortnight.  It would not pay C.I.E. or the private haulier to hold a valuable lorry idle for three or four days a week for the sake of the one day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole point.  What will he do with the lorry on the other days?  He has use for his tractor; he has no use for the lorry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many farmers who cannot afford a motor-car but who have a pick-up truck for doing practically their own work.  They are doing their own work.  I had one myself for a time, but when I got on I bought a motor-car.  That position obtains in many places.  It still obtains and I think the Minister should very carefully consider permitting light trucks to haul agricultural goods within a reasonable distance.  Now, we have the two-mile limit.  This is going to be a very complicated business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>But if I am to get to their residence by road it would take three miles.  That is a common occurrence. The two-mile limit in this respect is not at all sufficient and is neither workable nor practicable.  If it were two miles straight as the crow flies, it would be of some benefit, but not if it is two miles around the road&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case we shall be able to help other farmers, if it is two miles across country.  If it were two miles round the road, very few farmers would be allowed to benefit at all.  The change has come about by the auction mart system and if we are to be a progressive country we must change with the times and amend our laws to suit the requirements of the people and not have the farmers every day going the roads and of necessity breaking the law.  I hope the Minister will consider this point.  I think he should extend the two-mile limit to at least three or four miles and make it more practicable for the farmers to work freely in doing their own business. They will not interfere in any way with either C.I.E. or the private haulier because neither C.I.E. nor the private haulier could possibly cater for that type of work in rural Ireland.  Their lorries would get bogged down on the roads and in the fields and they could not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>They just could not do it and even the men in charge of them would not be experienced in that type of work.  I think we should widen the scope of the amendment so that there will be more flexibility in the working of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this amendment as much for its general principle as for the easement it gives, and it certainly gives easement which is very desirable in this case.  The whole transport system of this country has compulsion behind it and if there is anything that is annoying and frustrating to a businessman or producer it is to find himself circumvented by a whole lot of regulations compelling him to use this or that particular thing.  This compulsion applies to freight; it would be just as logical to apply it to passengers but you dare not restrict the liberty of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great need for this amendment. Take the case of the farmer who is living in a remote area with a long winding passage to his home up <Col N="1177" /> which the licensed haulier will not drive.  That man might have only one beast for the mart and it would be a great assistance to him if a neighbouring farmer, who has a tractor and trailer, were able to take it for him. It will certainly assure the people in those areas that they are not being neglected and that they still have freedom in their operations.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the licensed haulier who is confined to a radius of 15 miles of some central town near which he lives.  He may be living 14 miles from that town and the town might be just five miles from the mart, on the other side of where he is living.  He dare not haul to that mart because it is outside his radius.  I think the licensed haulier in that case should be allowed to take live stock for reward to the mart nearest to him.</P>
    <P>That easement itself would obviate the need for the farmer to be allowed ply for reward in the carriage of goods for his neighbour.  I suggest to the Minister that that would obviate, in part, the need for the amendment.  To meet Deputy Wycherley's point of view I think a special concession should be made for the peninsulas like the Beara and Kilcrohance Peninsulas.  Such places are remote and the people living there have to endure sufficient hardships and handicaps without being handicapped further by legislation. These could be specified in the Bill and special facilities allowed to them.  It would bring much relief to these areas where we have such emigration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out something that has not been stated already.  The request from the National Farmers' Association gave rise to this amendment.  It is a request from an organisation which has a vested interest in marts.  I do not mean to convey that I am opposed to the mart system. I think the mart system is one which ultimately will, to a very great extent, replace the former monthly or bi-monthly fair.  If we are to examine the position in relation to marts, the modern mart will cost anything from £20,000 to £25,000 and that will limit its erection to a certain given area. You will find that they will be erected <Col N="1178" /> in centres or in towns with populations of 2,000 or over.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>The marts will not be erected in the poorer areas as they would not be a safe commercial undertaking. You will find that the marts will spring up in the areas where you have the bigger fairs and where you have a higher density of cattle.  In other words, it will be in the big breeding areas.  When you go into the poorer areas, where you have a much lower density of cattle, the mart will not be erected and the farmers in the areas will still have, for many years to come, to turn to the local fair.</P>
      <P>When I was listening to the debate here last night I got the impression from the Minister, after Deputy Sweetman had spoken, that the Guards would have difficulty in controlling the operation of the same concession to a fair as to a mart.  I cannot see why the concession would not be extended to fairs.  After all, you are legislating for a particular organisation who have made a request and who have a vested interest in marts.  There will be a huge area in the country where the cattle population density per acre is low, where no marts will be established and where the farmer will still have to depend on the monthly fair.  I can see no operative difficulty in this.  After all, on the 1st January you can buy Purdons or Old Moore's Almanac and get the date of every fair.  The Guards will know the traditional dates fixed for these fairs; in many instances they are fixed for years and years ahead.</P>
      <P>The Minister should give some consideration to the suggestion made by Deputy Sweetman that if we are to legislate for giving this concession to marts, it will logically follow we are giving a concession to the more fortunate section who are living where the marts will be erected.  We are depriving the farmers in the more remote areas and, in many instances, in the areas where they will have to move cattle at greater inconvenience and for longer distances to the fair.  I would ask the Minister to examine this concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> There is also the point that we shall have to defend the position that, if you give that concession to the farmer to divert his cattle to marts, you will be open to the accusation of legislating for the liquidation of the fair in the small village and town.  This is something which we should consider.  It is something we should not do now, we should not legislate for one particular section at the request of an organisation that has a vested interest in marts, and then proceed to deprive a very large section in the more remote areas in which those people have no interest of the same concessions.  I do not think you can do it for one without seriously considering making the same provision for the other.</P>

      <P>I should like to reinforce what I said last night.  I am glad to hear Deputy Moher support it. Undoubtedly there are precisely the same arguments in favour of extending this provision to a fair as to a mart.  As Deputy Moher said, the fairs are known in advance.  There is no likelihood of two fairs taking place in the same locality on the same day. Therefore, the problem of enforcing the law would be simplified by reason of the fact that it is a known venue. The arguments which induced the Minister to introduce this amendment apply with equal force.  In addition, I believe that with the extension of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis requirements in a great many cases where farmers even yet walk cattle to the fairs, they will bring them in lorries or in trailers attached to tractors.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider, between now and Report Stage, the desirability of extending this provision to include fairs, because, if there is an argument in favour of applying these facilities to a mart &mdash;I believe there is a good case for doing so&mdash;there is undoubtedly an equally good case for applying them to fairs.  The same difficulties of ascertaining whether people will go outside the area or whether they commit a breach of the law will apply in both cases.  If the Guards are in a position to check on a mart, they ought equally to be in a position to check on a fair.</P>

      <P>Deputy Casey said that once you breach the restrictions you will be driven further and further to extend the concessions until the whole basis of transport policy is undermined. When I accept what is a reasonable proposal, I am immediately under pressure to extend that further and further.  Once we start going in that direction, there is no point at which we can stop.  We will be asked to go further still and then we are back to the situation where the whole effort to build up the public transport organisation will be completely frustrated.  I should like to make it clear that it was with considerable hesitation I accepted the proposal in the amendment, knowing it was likely that I would be asked to extend it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that people put cattle in a lorry or a trailer in a casual way?  It is quite a formidable operation.  Did the Minister ever try to put a cow in a lorry? We all know how difficult it is to persuade a beast to get into a lorry.  It will travel in every direction but the right one.  Every Deputy with rural experience will agree that he would gladly drive a beast two miles from field to field rather than load the beast in a lorry.  It is a very formidable operation to load a beast.  You load a beast because you want to bring it to a mart or fair looking fresh, whereas if you walk it two or three miles, it will be slavering at the mouth and sweating and will not look its best.  If you are only bringing the beast from field to field or to a neighbour's place, you would prefer to walk it rather than load it.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that there is not any scope in this regard for the development of a huge volume of vehicular traffic.  The last thing any farmer wants to do is to load a beast. When loading a beast, a dealer needs four or five assistants but a farmer has no assistants.  I want to try to bring some ray of reality into the proceedings. I do not say this is the fact but sometimes to hear the Minister talking or Deputy Casey talking, one would think the farmers were some sort of public enemy who were concerned to undermine and tear down all the institutions of the State.  No farmer willingly engages in the transport of live stock, unless he has to. There is no urge to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that Deputy Casey is a reasonable man. There are very few farmers outside the richer areas of Ireland who have a lot <Col N="1182" /> of cattle for sale.  In the old days, that kind of man sent his cattle to the Dublin market, but very few of us were able to do so because we were never able to fill a wagon or even half fill it.  You could not do it unless you were in a very large way of business. The ordinary man may have two, three of four beasts.  Many have only one beast.  Any of us who has driven one beast to the market or elsewhere knows what that procedure involves.</P>
      <P>Talk of travelling as the crow flies, you do not travel as the crow flies following one beast to the market or fair; you travel as the jack rabbit travels, over every hedge and through every gate that the cow can find her way through.</P>
      <P>Here it is proposed, very reasonably proposed, I think, that if one fellow in the parish has a lorry or trailer, if Deputy Sweetman's amendment be accepted, on the morning of a fair he could agree with four or five neighbours to pick up their cattle and all the cattle would go to the fair.  At the fair or mart the cattle would be unloaded and exposed for sale, in the knowledge that, if they are not sold, there is a neighbour's lorry or trailer there to enable them to bring them back because, if you are ten or 15 miles from home, or even seven miles from home, with two or three cattle, and you cannot get within £2 of what you want to get for them, you are very tempted to lose £6 on three cattle rather than face plodding home behind them after plodding in the morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are these requests unreasonable? The present situation&mdash;and I am sure the Minister knows it&mdash;is that we walk behind them because there is no other means of getting them there.  We are not proposing that any traffic which C.I.E. is at present enjoying is to be taken from them.  At present it is walking traffic.  All we are asking is that this additional amenity be made available.  Does anybody in this House seriously suggest that as a result of this concession there will be six loads a year of existing traffic taken from C.I.E.?  Does anyone seriously suggest that if you ask C.I.E. to-morrow to go around the village of Kilcolman and pick up a load <Col N="1183" /> of cattle there from eight farmers they would even consider the traffic?</P>

      <P>Well, at a price.  I do not want to be driven to the point of making too strong a case.  I know a case where it was a question of shifting a bull and the bull was sold at ten in the morning and the lorry was to be there at ten to shift it.  The lorry did not come at 11 or 12.  Inquiry was made at the local station and the reply was that it was being looked into. To cut a long story short, the lorry came at 5.30 p.m. and there was somebody sitting beside the bull all the time.  They loaded the bull.  The two chaps on the lorry were asked: &ldquo;How is it you did not come before this?&rdquo;&ldquo;Ah well,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we could not come until we were sure we would be paid overtime.&rdquo;&ldquo;Could you not get an assurance on that from the local fellow?&rdquo;&ldquo;No.  He had no authority to give it and he had to get in touch with the man at the central station&rdquo;&mdash; I think it was Waterford&mdash;&ldquo;and he was at his dinner; we could get no answer and we would not start until we got an assurance that we would get overtime.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But, if they did, the Deputy and I would begin to suspect their <i>bona fides.</i>  There is no prospect of this proposal taking from C.I.E. one load of traffic that they would at present carry, not one.  I put it to the House that, far from the Minister taking up the position that he is constrained to stick rigidly to the terms of his own amendment, he could without the slightest danger expand it in the terms suggested by Deputy Moher.  He could also with perfect propriety provide that a similar facility would be extended where the live stock were being brought to a factory for slaughter.  I know of divers cases in rural Ireland where the fact that farmers live close to one bacon factory and ten, 15 or 20 miles from another means that the factory in their vicinity will not give them the value of their pigs but, if they had access to the competition of the factory ten, 15 or 20 miles away, immediately they would get from the local factory, 5/-, 10/- and sometimes 15/- a cwt. more for the pigs.</P>
      <P>At the present time, any farmer moving milk to a creamery is entitled to bring it on a lorry for reward for his neighbours and bring it back. Does anyone in this House believe that C.I.E. lost £1 of revenue as a result of permitting farmers to carry milk to a creamery and skim milk back?  Not a shilling.  I think everybody will agree that farmers acquired a very considerable amenity but, what is much more important, hundreds of days' labour have been saved in the agricultural industry because, instead of 20 men going down with 20 ass carts, one man now goes down with 20 cans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am often appalled in this House at <Col N="1186" /> how remote some people are from all the norm of country life and the ghosts that they conjure up by theories.  I think the most absurd ghost ever conjured up is the picture of farmers dashing up and down the roads with cattle, carrying them for their neighbours for hire, nowhere at all, just giving them an airing.  That is the apprehension that is entertained.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister most strongly to make it permissible for any farmer to carry live stock for reward in a lorry or in a trailer to a mart, to a fair, for sale or to a factory for sale and slaughter and I am perfectly certain&mdash; and I have a very detailed experience of rural life in this regard&mdash;that the result of such a concession will not be to deprive C.I.E. of £100 revenue in 12 months of which it is at present in enjoyment but that it will provide a valuable additional amenity to country people.  I do urge the Tánaiste to consider this matter.</P>
    <P>I think he himself withstood for many years and resisted the proposal to permit lorries to carry milk for reward to creameries for exactly the same reason as Deputy Casey advances to-day, that if you opened this chink, it would be extended to a variety of other spheres to the great detriment of C.I.E.  We opened the chink, and, as far as I know, it did not injure or interfere with C.I.E. in any degree. However, there are few Deputies on the Labour Benches or anywhere else who will not agree that it provided not only a great amenity but a great economiser of time to the farming community, and the proposal in the Minister's own amendment, expanded as is suggested by Deputy Moher and by Deputy Sweetman, would greatly contribute to the efficiency of agricultural marketing in rural Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter.  I know some other Deputies may not think so, but, living in rural Ireland, I know what this means to my neighbours, and this is the place the story ought to be told.  I was struck by the obvious apprehension of the Minister that if he made a concession on the lines suggested in Deputy Sweetman's amendment to his amendment, farmers would buy huge lorries and, having bought them, would find no other use for them and thus be drawn into illegal transport.  That is quite an illusory idea and was most admirably answered by Deputy Wycherley who said he was thinking in terms of the pick-up truck.  No farmer is going to buy a vast truck to carry live stock.  If the Minister would stop <Col N="1188" /> for a minute to think that investment in such a truck would involve a sum of £1,800 to £2,000, he will realise what a phantasmagoria such a thought is.</P>
      <P>All we are concerned with is to let the farmer carry his neighbour's stock to the market for a reasonable reward, and it seems to me that every argument favours him.  I cannot too strongly emphasise that this fierce reaction, that any concession to farmers in respect of live stock is calculated to undermine the whole transport system of the country, is driving the farmers mad.  It is not impossible to get a reasonable <i>modus vivendi</i> between the various interested parties. It is not impossible to give the transport monopoly a fair try-out, provided reasonable concessions are made in relation to their everyday business to those who live in rural Ireland.  If the general impression is created that any marginal concession to the agricultural community is a trespass on the transport monopoly, there will be a growing volume of bitter resentment amongst the agricultural community, the feeling that their interests are entitled to some consideration and that they are not always to be subordinated to the overriding considerations of industrial enterprise and public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Norton who, as Minister, made the concession in respect of milk cans for farmers, but I think he made it with great trepidation and anxiety, lest it should develop into the kind of thing about which Deputy Casey is apprehensive, but it did not.  It was never meant to and it did not.  I assure the Minister, for what it is worth, that if he is prepared to try out even experimentally what we are now suggesting, that for fairs, marts and factories, he should permit the transport of live stock for reward by farmers for their neighbours, he will have no more reason for regret than had Deputy Norton in the concession he made.  If that is done, the very considerable volume of existing resentment amongst the rural community in respect of the transport monopoly will be removed.  So long as a concession of this character is withheld from the agricultural community, <Col N="1189" /> they have justifiable grounds for complaint. The benefits accruing to certain elements in our community from the transport monopoly are bearing unreasonably on legitimate agricultural interests and that is particularly exasperating in that the evil element in the situation could be removed by amendments such as we have now before us, without injuring materially the transport industry itself or those who work in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the Minister's statement that he was impressed by the arguments put forward by the National Farmers' Association. How impressed he was is indicated clearly by the fact that he put down this amendment which we are discussing. I think the amendment is a reasonable one.  I do not agree with Deputy Sweetman's amendment to the amendment, but I do most strongly agree with the suggestion by Deputy Wycherley, Deputy Moher and others that the distance goods may be carried and the types of goods that may be carried on a tractor trailer should be extended.  I think I am correct in saying that in my own county of Limerick there is only one auction mart in the entire county.  Straightway you create a state of affairs where there is an injustice done to a large section of farmers who cannot or do not desire to avail of that auction mart.  Farmers living near Limerick, within a radius of two, three or four miles of Limerick, would not be able to avail of this amendment or, if they wanted to avail of it, would have to turn their backs on Limerick, as the amendment stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you limit the concession to tractor trailers, you will achieve three objectives, the first of which is that efficient use will be made of transport which is there already.  As the Minister pointed out, those tractor trailers can be used only at certain times of the year and if they are lying idle without other employment, they will deteriorate and will be an expense not only on the farmer but on the community. Secondly, you will encourage more neighbourly use of existing transport between the farmers themselves and I think that is one of the objects of the amendment.  Finally, in the long run, <Col N="1190" /> you will ensure that C.I.E. as the national transport undertaking gets more freight carriage because one factor that has not been mentioned in the discussion is that the freight which C.I.E. must carry depends largely, in the final analysis, on what the farmer produces from his land, and if we can ensure that the farmers can cut costs of production and work more efficiently and have more expeditious means of transport to auction marts, fairs and factories&mdash; and to the railheads, I would say&mdash;it will be reflected in our economy.</P>
    <P>I would allow the tractor trailers to be used to bring live stock or live-stock products to the railheads and so be feeders to C.I.E.  If we can ensure that, we will ensure that production from the land and production of live stock and live-stock products will increase and it must flow over the national transport system in one form or another.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point made by Deputy Manley that the restricted licensed carrier should be permitted to carry cattle.  It is no secret that a number of them are doing so illegally at present and it is better that we should face up to the issue and allow them to carry cattle for reward.  The amount of cattle they carry is strictly limited and they do a very local or parochial business.  I agree also with the view expressed by Deputy Dillon and others in that I do not think that this kind of co-operative neighbourly service will put C.I.E. to any expense. Taking the overall picture, any contribution we can make towards lowering farming costs and increasing production will, in the long run, work in the interests of C.I.E. and every section of the community.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's amendment, but I think the provision should be extended to include at least transport to fairs and pig markets.  Why differentiate between a farmer bringing a bullock to an auction mart or pigs to a fair or calves to a calf market?  If we give these concessions, limited to tractor trailer transport, I think we will benefit the producer and the consumer as well, without doing any injury to C.I.E.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment recognises a need which is obviously there.  We must recognise the need which exists in relation to our marketing system and modern transport, and I feel the Minister who has brought in this amendment in relation to auction marts should see also the necessity to extend it.  The case has been made by previous speakers that the same need exists for transport of live stock to fairs and factories.  A very fair case was made by Deputy Wycherley that the amendment should extend to the nearest live-stock auction mart or a distance of 20 miles, whichever is the lesser because it is possible that we might have an auction mart&mdash;particularly in Deputy Wycherley's area&mdash;over 20 miles away and that difficulty could be overcome by providing for a distance of 20 miles or the nearest live-stock auction mart, whichever is the lesser.</P>
      <P>The Minister would be most unreasonable if, having given this concession in regard to live-stock auction marts, he did not extend it to fairs which are recognised and listed.  It is unlikely that any extra fairs will be set up; most of them are traditional and have been taking place for generations. There would be no difficulty so far as making provision for them in this Bill is concerned.  It is obvious also that the use of tractor trailers is the best way to deal with this question.  It will make live stock in rural areas more mobile.  If a farmer in a rural area at present has to call in C.I.E. or public transport, he has to travel great distances and may not have a telephone service within reasonable reach. There are various difficulties in hiring one of these lorries compared with giving messages by word of mouth or across the neighbour's fence that transport is required at a certain date and time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Live-stock auction marts, I think, deal only with cattle and possibly, sheep, but we must remember that the words &ldquo;live stock&rdquo; relate to cattle, sheep and pigs.  Pigs are brought mainly to fairs and not to live-stock marts, and I think most of those who spoke in this debate should be in a position to convince the Minister that the provisions of the existing amendment are too limited and do not meet <Col N="1192" /> the reasonable and obvious needs of live-stock owners in rural areas where it is considered easier to hire a tractor trailer than to seek transport by means of a large six-ton lorry.</P>
    <P>This amendment is a welcome departure in relation to the haulage of live stock.  There have been many complaints regarding the treatment of live stock when public transport was provided for them.  It is obvious that live stock will arrive in better condition if brought direct from farm to auction mart and back again.  Nobody in contact with live stock and knowing the manner in which that live stock has been transported up to now will say that the transport facilities can be compared with the transport provided by the ordinary private haulage contractor.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will expand this amendment to cover the other points mentioned which would really meet the need.  The present amendment is merely a small gesture and really does not meet the general need.  It is obvious that if the Minister at this stage cannot agree to extend the terms of his amendment, he will be faced with the necessity of doing so within a short time when it has been made clear that it would be unfair to one section as against another to confine the amendment to the carrying of live stock to auction marts.</P>

      <P>Might I intervene at this stage?  I produced this amendment with very considerable reluctance and hesitation, realising fully the possible consequences of any proposal to move away from the policy enshrined in the Road Transport Act.  I could not under any circumstances agree to go further.  As far as I am concerned, in realisation of my fears that the pressure will be entirely in that direction, if I had my choice I would prefer to withdraw the amendment than to go further in the direction Deputies want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture his Government set up an inter-departmental committee to consider what concessions of this kind should be made to the farmers.  That committee recommended against making any concessions because of the <Col N="1193" /> practical difficulties involved.  While I have no doubt Deputy Dillon argued with himself as eloquently and as fully as with the House here to-day, he did not convince himself.  He accepted the recommendation that no concession should be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the inter-departmental committee set up by Deputy Norton, when Minister, after the matter had been discussed here in the Dáil.  The desirability of the review of restrictions was urged on the Government.  It is all very well to say we should make concessions here and there.  But let us not lose sight of the main purpose of this Bill.  Our public transport service is losing money heavily.  The employment of 24,000 people depends on the survival of that service.  It cannot survive unless it gets more business.  Therefore, as I said, you cannot follow two divergent roads at the same time.  You have got to frame legislation to make it possible for that public transport service to get more business or it will fail.  You cannot help it to get more business by letting more people into the business of public transport.</P>
      <P>It is not a question of allowing farmers to oblige their neighbours. The question is how you can do that without taking the risk that people will represent themselves as farmers and avail of the modifications and restrictions introduced to set themselves up as transport operators.  That is the practical difficulty involved.  That practical difficulty, while it exists, is not serious so long as we confine ourselves to the limits set out in this amendment.  Once you go beyond that &mdash;certain Deputies talked about the operation of lorries for the carriage of live stock to factories&mdash;then, of course, you are creating a situation where the enforcement of the restrictions becomes impossible for the Gárda Síochána.  People will set themselves up as operators of this kind of transport for the purpose of getting a livelihood, and then the whole basis of our public transport legislation has been undermined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> As far as lorries are concerned, I could not agree at all.  The farmers who urge some modification as proposed here are not interested in lorries.  They say it could not be done by farmers on the limited basis we are contemplating if the full road tax and petrol tax have to be paid.  They are interested only in facilitating this obligement arrangement within the limits they think it will be practicable to do so.  As far as I am concerned, any transport operation that is to be carried through to sell service for reward by a lorry will be confined to the public transport operators and licensed hauliers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree, in theory at all events, that some case can be made for, perhaps, some relaxation of the transport regulations in respect of the transport of goods by one farmer to assist another, nevertheless one has got to realise that the moment one takes a step in that direction, one calls into question our whole policy in respect of public transport.  Even this discussion to-day shows the wisdom of the inter-departmental committee's recommendation because they foreshadowed all the things that reveal themselves here to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the purpose of this amendment? I am certain that if the amendment is accepted in the form suggested by the Minister or in the form of the further amendment moved by the Fine Gael Party, not a single licensed haulier will haul a head of cattle in a rural area in the future&mdash;not a single one of them.  These people to-day earn a livelihood because they hold a merchandise licence that entitles them to transport cattle.  In the future, if a farmer is entitled to use a lorry to transport not merely his own cattle but to offer his own lorry for hire to carry the cattle of everybody else then you are creating a new type of transport operator.  That person will compete with the existing licensed haulier.  He will be entitled to do so under the Bill as amended.  If he has a lorry he will say: &ldquo;This is good business.  I will transport my own cattle and within an area of 40 miles <Col N="1195" /> I can carry everybody else's cattle to the market.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But you cannot.  It is within an area of two miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  We know how the present three-mile limit is overcome, even in fairly large centres of population.  I do not think there would be any difficulty in exceeding the two-mile limit unless we are to augment the Garda force by three or four times its present strength.  You have to decide whether you will create a new type of transport operator.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of this Bill is to try to get more traffic for C.I.E., to put C.I.E. in a position of financial solvency, and to ensure that C.I.E. will not continue to indent on the public purse.  Although that is the purpose of the Bill, the Minister comes along with an amendment, the effect of which is to create a new type of private transport operator.  He may say that that new operator will not carry on widespread activities and will not seriously indent on the traffic of C.I.E.  But the discussion here to-day shows that it is only a matter of time, if you open this door, until it will be suggested that farmers with tractors and lorries should carry cattle, not merely to marts, but to a railhead, to fairs or to a factory.  Later on it will be suggested that they should be allowed transport pigs in the same directions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moher said that one of these days these marts will deal with the sale of wool.  These marts may deal with the sale of a number of other commodities.  After a number of years you will be dragged into the situation in which you will have created a new type of transport operator who will get his traffic at the expense either of C.I.E. or of the licensed hauliers.  The Minister now, I think, sees the dangers in his own amendment and, if this amendment is carried even in the rather limited form suggested by the Minister, there will be constant and sustained pressure to open the door wider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no other result of this <Col N="1196" /> amendment than to take away traffic from C.I.E. and from the licensed hauliers.  The Minister has been unwise in opening this door at all at this stage, whatever might be done at a later stage; at this stage the Minister is merely fertilising the idea of creating another transport operator and that transport operator will function to the detriment of C.I.E. and the licensed carriers.  After all, these cattle for which transport facilities will in future be provided by means of a tractor and trailer are at present being carried somehow.  So far as they are carried by the farmer in his own lorry, well and good; that operation will continue. So far as they are being carried by the licensed haulier or by C.I.E. they will lose that traffic in future. What other way could these animals go?  On the road?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way they are going now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way they are going to some extent but, so far as the man who has to push his cattle along the road is concerned, I am not sure that he will be a beneficiary under this at all.  This will benefit the man with the lorry or the man with the tractor.  In future, he will be a transport operator.  It is not the fellow who yearns for the money to buy a tractor or the fellow who yearns for the money to buy a lorry who will benefit under this amendment.  It is the man who has got the lorry and the man who has got the tractor and, under these two amendments, the same results will be achieved, but one result will go wider than the other.</P>
      <P>At the time when we are trying to sustain C.I.E. and give it more traffic the Minister comes along with an amendment the purpose of which is to create a new type of transport operator.  How he reconciles that with getting more traffic to C.I.E. is a mystery that has not yet been explained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton does not seem to realise that a new development is taking place all over the country and, in relation to that development, there is a new development <Col N="1197" /> in transport.  Taking cattle to and from marts is something that has never been embarked on hitherto by either C.I.E. or the licensed hauliers. This is a new business as a result of the establishment of marts, situated perhaps 40 miles apart.  It has nothing to do with either the past or present trade of either C.I.E. or the licensed hauliers.  In the long run it will help C.I.E. because, when cattle are sold or bought in the mart, the usual procedure is to have them transported by rail.  If the Minister cannot accede to our request with regard to lorries, he should seriously consider extending the concession to enable farmers to send their cattle to the nearest mart. Deputy Russell pointed out that there is only one mart in Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Russell, of course, does not realise that the Transport Act does not apply within ten miles of Limerick.  There are no restrictions within ten miles of Limerick.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>In my constituency in West Cork the farmers in Castletownbere will, for instance, be precluded from sending their cattle to the nearest mart.  It is unfair to give people within a 20-mile radius the concession and exclude people further away.  This will not take away business from either C.I.E. or from the licensed haulier if the concession is extended to farmers in more remote districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister inasmuch as I would not permit lorries under any circumstances to operate within the scope of this amendment.  The Minister will agree that the tractor as a mode of transport is somewhat immobile as compared with other forms of transport; its range is limited.  It is such a slow form of transport that there is no danger that it will be used to snatch business from C.I.E. or the licensed hauliers. I do not know whether I should press this further in view of the fact that the Minister is now undecided as to whether or not he will withdraw the amendment, but any little concession we get is something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that the number of marts which can be erected <Col N="1198" /> is limited.  They can only be erected in those areas in which there is a high cattle population per acre.  There will be no marts in the poorer farming areas where the cattle population is per acre low.  Fairs will remain a feature of agricultural life for a long time. Ultimately, with the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, they will disappear and the fair will be replaced by the auctioneer's sales yard.  It is inequitable to cater for the better off sections in this amendment.  If one looks at a map illustrating the marts one will see that they are sited, or it is proposed to site them, mainly in the big breeding areas where there is a high density of cattle.  There will be no marts in the poorer farming areas. Marts must be a commercial proposition. They must be planned on the basis of operating at a profit.  The Minister should, first of all, limit the concession to the tractor and trailer, leaving the lorries out, and then cater for the fair and the auctioneer's sales yard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious from the debate that this amendment is very acceptable to the House as a whole.  It is certainly acceptable to rural Deputies who are aware of the circumstances under which farmers have to carry on.  Deputy Norton said that the only person whom this amendment would benefit is the tractor-trailer owner.  That is an unrealistic statement.  The people who will benefit are the small farmers and those who own one or two beasts.  It is common knowledge that it is quite impossible in certain areas to get C.I.E. to transport stock.  C.I.E. does not go out after the small job and it will not put a lorry on the road to take half a dozen cattle to a fair.</P>
      <P>It is argued that if you reduce the economic costs and the overhead charges of the agricultural community, the people will produce more.  That is perfectly true.  This amendment will facilitate people living in rural areas. It is long overdue.  In every other country farmers are entitled to carry stock for their neighbours in tractors and trailers and, as far as I know, in lorries as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> The Minister seems to be getting rather apprehensive on account of some criticisms that have been levelled at his amendment.  These criticisms have come, practically entirely, from those who live in cities and who are not rural Deputies in the accepted sense of the word.  They do not live in rural Ireland and they do not realistically approach the situation.  If the Minister accepted the amendment relating to fairs and markets, which I think he can reasonably do without causing hardship to anybody, the position would be improved.  Surely there is a safeguard there?  The very amendment itself confines the owners of vehicles to the collecting of live stock within a radius of two miles and, altogether, they can take it only 20 miles.  Obviously, as Deputy Dillon says, they will not be taking live stock around for the good of their health. They will collect the stock and take it to the local fair as well as to the mart.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moher made a very good point and Deputy Russell made the same point.  In the more densely populated areas there are marts but in other areas where the population is small there are fairs and markets.  The Minister's amendment favours those areas in which auction marts are held. If we introduce legislation, let it be fair legislation and let it apply to everybody.</P>
    <P>The Minister is apprehensive in relation to Deputy Sweetman's amendment about lorries.  According to this amendment, the only people who will be allowed to carry will be persons whose chief or only occupation is farming.  If anyone buys a lorry and proposes to use it solely for the purpose of carrying live stock he ceases to earn his living by farming chiefly, mainly or solely and it rules them out straightway.  The Minister has adequate safeguard there.  A lot of rural Deputies have spoken on this. Mostly, they are from this side of the House.  That is only natural in a controversial debate.  The consensus of opinion from all the rural Deputies who have spoken is that this is a good amendment but that it does not go far enough and that it should be extended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> The Minister is asked to extend the amendment to fairs and markets and Deputy Sweetman has asked that it be extended to include lorries also&mdash; with the safeguard that the persons earn their living solely from farming.</P>
    <P>I will make two suggestions.  The first is that the Minister will produce an amendment on the Report Stage covering these points, with any little extra safeguards he feels may be necessary.  The second suggestion is that he will leave the matter to a free vote of the House.  If he does so, there is no question but that there will be an overwhelming vote in favour of the farmers getting this concession which is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Far from affecting C.I.E. in the country whatsoever, this amendment, if it goes through, will turn it into an assembling centre.  It will bring in live stock more so than heretofore. Then C.I.E. will have more opportunities of getting business than they had before.  A big combine such as C.I.E. wants big business.  They can work in the big centres.  The stock that is sold will be transported to other places in order to be sold in the Dublin market or shipped, or wherever it may be.  That is C.I.E.'s purpose.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister need have no apprehensions whatsoever.  I should like him to leave the matter to a free vote of the House or else to bring in an amendment on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The speeches made by the various Deputies in support of the Minister's amendment are the greatest case any Labour Deputy can put forward on behalf of the trade we are trying to protect.  This Bill is specifically introduced to help C.I.E., along with the licensed hauliers.  This amendment torpedoes the whole idea.  It is strange to read the Minister's amendment and to compare it with Deputy Sweetman's amendment and amendment No. 24 by Deputy Cosgrave, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>() It shall not be lawful for any person to enter into an agreement for the carriage for reward of merchandise <Col N="1201" /> by any other person unless such other person is a licensee under a merchandise licence or such merchandise is to be carried exclusively within an exempted area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Anyone except, I presume, a farmer can recognise that.</P>
    <P>Why do we want to put restrictions on the ordinary people?  Take, for instance, a small shopkeeper carrying his own goods.  Why can he not come along to another shopkeeper and say: &ldquo;I will help you out now for a small reward?&rdquo;  Anyone would think someone was trying to inflict a particular hardship on one section of the community, the farmers, to listen to all these Deputies.  Everyone knows that this Bill inflicts hardships on people and diverts traffic in a certain way.  It is done in the national interest. Farmers are expected to contribute to that, the same as everybody else.</P>
    <P>Why has the small trader to comply with the law?  Why does he not get an exemption?  Why does any small shopkeeper or anybody else not get an exemption?  Nobody is anti-farmer. The National Farmers' Association put up a very good case and did a very laudable thing for their own section.  I like trade unions whether they are for farmers or for workers.  It was their job to put forward the case.  The Minister has failed lamentably in giving way to it&mdash;not because he wants to oppose the farmers but because he wants to keep C.I.E. or the licensed hauliers or the public transport system as it is in being.</P>
    <P>I feel that if a Minister of that Party, other than the present Minister, were piloting this Bill the extensions asked for here would readily be agreed to. This is the thin end of the wedge.  This will finish off the haulage of cattle. What Deputy Wycherly says is true: this is a new business.  Of course, the idea of cattle marts is new.  But the fairs are as old as this country and now the fairs are dwindling.  Business was done at the fairs.  That goes now. With this new business coming in, you have a new set of hauliers.  It is ridiculous to say that they will be engaged for only one portion of the day.</P>
    <P>What will happen now is that a <Col N="1202" /> tractor will be bought in the name of a farmer.  His son will use it and put in two or three days a week to take business from the licensed hauliers and C.I.E. because there are as many as three cattle marts within a radius of 20 miles from each other.  Naturally, living in the vicinity, they will choose different places for the auctions.  He will be engaged on three days a week hauling cattle for reward within a two-mile radius of his farm.  As Deputy Norton says, that two-mile radius will be stretched.</P>
    <P>If there is to be enforcement of the regulation, you will have to treble your police force.  In the first place, you will have to establish a two-mile radius.  Then, there will be the question of working out whether he exceeded 20 miles.  Then, there will be the question of time&mdash;whether or not it was the day of a mart.  A day starts one minute after midnight and extends until 12 o'clock the following night.  If you have all the variations of times that can be included in that, for three times a week, and all to be examined by the local Gardaí, I can see them with no time to do anything else.  This is just the opening of the floodgate to what will come after.  It means the end of the haulage of live stock.  It would be preferable if the Minister would say: &ldquo;Let all live stock be hauled free or without any question of licences at all.&rdquo;  At least we would have it honest, open and above board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the Minister's amendment because I feel he has gone a long way to meet what was required.  I was rather disappointed with some statements made by Deputies on the other side of the House this morning, inasmuch as they tried to convey that we are not concerned with the interests of the farmers at all.  That is completely wrong.  I do not think the Minister is interfering with any privileges enjoyed by the farmers up to the present.  In my constituency any farmer who wants to go to market with his cattle or produce can do so, and in this amendment the Minister is going a long way to meet the needs of the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representations have been made to <Col N="1203" /> him by a very responsible body but it must be remembered that the Minister's job is a very invidious one.  He has to try to save the transport system, on the one hand, and to be fair and impartial to all sections of the community on the other.  I have pressed him on numerous occasions for certain exemptions for farmers in my own constituency, and many times I have pressed him unduly hard.  Nevertheless, I have to recognise that he has a national responsibility, either to save the national transport system or let it go and allow private enterprise to take its place.</P>
    <P>If there are hardships in any area where the public transport system has failed to carry cattle to a mart or fair and where proof can be given to the Minister that there is direct hardship on any small section of farmers as a result, the position should be considered in the light of experience.  As we know in rural Ireland there are fairs within reasonable distance of small and large farmers alike.  We have, of course, the emergence of the fact that the mart is replacing the fair and, with that development, marts might be longer distances away from farmers than fairs were.  The Minister, however, has gone a long way to assist the farmers, and the various concessions he has given to them over the years were welcomed by the farming community in my constituency.</P>
    <P>Where C.I.E. fail to cater for an area, where they fail to collect cattle from, say, John Murphy or Paddy Burke, where these people are a long way away from a fair or market, and C.I.E. feel it is not economic for them to cater for that small class of trade, in exceptional circumstances of that kind the Minister should be reasonable. Where a case is put up to him that there is great hardship in a particular area, due to the public transport system not bringing cattle to a particular place, I am sure the Minister will seriously and sympathetically consider any representations made to him on behalf of any group of small farmers thus adversely affected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nonsense for <Col N="1204" /> anyone to say that the effect of the amendment to the amendment is to create a new type of road haulage operator.  Deputy Dr. Esmonde made it perfectly clear that it is nonsense for anyone to say there would be, within a radius of two miles in the country, sufficient cattle to make it worthwhile for anybody to operate a road haulage business within that radius.  Anyone who knows anything about the situation surrounding the marts in rural areas will know that on the face of the section all that would be done under the proposals, and all that should be done, under the proposals here, would be to have a convenient method of picking up the odd stray beast around an area.</P>
      <P>I can appreciate the argument which the Minister made in relation to the difficulty of supervision.  That is an argument which may have some substance and it is on that basis, and only on that basis, that there can be any possibly reasonable objection.  But to suggest that this is bound to create a new type of haulage operator is so far divorced from reality as to make one believe that that argument is just being put up for the purpose of clutching at any stick by those who have a bad argument.  I want to admit quite frankly that, as far as the farmers with lorries are concerned, there would not be a great number of them in the community. There would be a certain number in Kildare and Meath, perhaps, but they would not be widespread throughout the country.</P>

    <P>While I think it would be a good thing, in an area where there are lorries, that they should be able to take the genuine traffic of this type, trifling traffic that it would be, I can see the argument against it from the point of view of the difficulty of enforcement of the law as I wish to see it.  I do not think that provided the amendment as amended, so to speak, were properly enforced it would make the slightest difference to C.I.E. or to the ordinary licensed haulier.  It would merely mean that live stock which at the present time go on foot, with the damage to condition that that involves on the one hand, and on the other hand with the additional time that is involved for the <Col N="1205" /> farmer by walking the stock into market, would be carried.</P>
    <P>As I say, I can appreciate there might be some difficulty of enforcement in relation to lorries.  I do not think the benefit is so widespread in relation to farmers owning lorries but I think it would be undesirable that it should be widespread and create the same problem that tractors do create.  For the life of me I cannot see any possibility of tractor haulage in any way operating as the Minister seemed to fear, in competition with the ordinary haulage by C.I.E. and licensed hauliers.  Tractor haulage of the type of live stock we have in mind here is going to be, by and large, for the short distances and for neighbours only.</P>
    <P>One must remember that in rural areas everybody knows the business of everybody else within a radius of two miles; it is entirely different from operating in a city where nobody knows whether, say, Deputy Mrs. Lynch, or Deputy Booth, or Deputy Sweetman, is sending goods out of his or her own premises in the City of Dublin to be sold.</P>
    <P>I know very well that, within a two-mile radius in the country everybody will know whether it is Deputy Moher's or Deputy Dr. Esmonde's cattle that are being carried.  As long as there is the restriction to the two-mile radius, there is no possibility of fraud in that respect.  Equally, so long as it is restricted to a tractor, there is not the same difficulty for the Garda Síochána.  I should like to see lorries included, but I can see the Minister's point of view that the inclusion of the lorry would create difficulties for the Garda.  The tractor does not create any difficulty at all.</P>
    <P>If the amendment is to be restricted to the tractor, I think the Minister could double the distance, as he has been asked to do.  There cannot be any possibility of creating doubt in the minds of the Garda.  He knows that it is the lorry he has to check, and only the lorry.  Everybody will know if X in any rural area is carrying cattle out of his area.  It is not by snap checks on the roads that the Garda find breaches of the Road Traffic Act, or that they find evidence <Col N="1206" /> to convict in cases of criminal larceny. We all know that, in rural Ireland, it a little more forthcoming as regards the Garda and enables them to move.</P>
    <P>The argument has been put forward that marts are restricted to certain areas and that fairs are not.  The Minister said last night that it was not possible to give a difinition of a fair, but surely it must be possible to do so. I am quite prepared to contribute to easing the Minister's mind by withdrawing my amendment, if he will be a little more forthcoming as regards the restrictions on the tractors and if he will include fairs as well as marts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>In opening the discussion this morning, I began by expressing my sympathy with the Minister in the situation into which he had been manoeuvred by certain interests, culminating in his tabling of this amendment.  The Minister felt that my sympathy was misplaced and he was fortified by the argument that the concessions he had agreed to make were very limited and specific.  I am quite sure that, having listened to the debate here this morning, he is not now so very sure of himself.  The very thing that I predicted would happen has already got under way.  I pointed out that the concessions contained in the amendment would not only themselves be abused but that they would be used as a springboard for the advocating of further concessions for private hauliers in all fields of transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within five minutes, that campaign had started in this House.  Not satisfied with the concessions agreed upon between the Minister and the National Farmers' Association, we had Deputies on all sides jumping up and saying that, while the concession is desirable, it does not go far enough and that there should be more concessions.  The Minister's amendment confines itself to the haulage of cattle, but we had Deputies asking why it should be confined to the haulage of cattle and why wool was not included.  It was stated that the auction marts would soon be dealing with wool and Deputy Wycherley indicated that these marts might even go farther afield and deal with other commodities.  Deputy <Col N="1207" /> Wycherley asked why, if a farmer was entitled to take his neighbour's cattle to the mart, he should not be entitled to take his wool and other commodities.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies asked why the concession should be confined to tractors and why it should not be extended to lorries.  Other people felt that the mileage extension was too restricted and they asked why should the haulage be confined to cattle and why should it be restricted to farmers within a two-mile radius.  They asked why the haulage should be confined to a limit of 20 miles.  Why should it not be 30 or 40 miles?  Again, it was asked why the concession should be confined to marts and why it should not apply to the haulage of cattle to other places and to fairs.  Deputy Dillon enlarged on that view and said that the concession should be extended to fairs and to cattle going to factories for slaughter.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to enlarge further on this matter.  The speeches made here to-day asking the Minister to go further than he intended are ample evidence of the fact that he has embarked on a very slippery slope.  I had the feeling, and I think the Minister himself had the feeling when he framed the Bill originally, that one step in that direction would lead to a very serious situation.  It behoves all of us to ask ourselves what we are discussing.  What type of Bill are we discussing?</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to give C.I.E. a fair crack of the whip and to give it an opportunity of breaking even.  This Bill is before the House because we all feel that there should be a properly integrated system of transport in this country on an economic basis and that, at some future date, the national transport concern should be able to carry on without having to come back here every second year, or even every year, and asking for further subventions from the Exchequer.  We are discussing this Bill because Deputy Dillon feels that he should be entitled to go down to Kingsbridge and get a train to Cork within a reasonable period; because he feels that if he has <Col N="1208" /> cattle to bring from Ballaghaderreen to Dublin, they should be carried in a reasonable time and at a reasonable charge.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has pointed out, you cannot have a public transport system that pays its way or breaks even, unless you provide by legislation a situation in which it will get the necessary traffic.  In this Bill, many concessions have been made to C.I.E.  They have been presented with an opportunity, not alone of winning back traffic which they have lost in past years, but of going out after new traffic and of putting themselves on an economic foundation.  That is the purpose of this Bill.  I think it was an ill-advised step on the Minister's part&mdash;and I am quite sure that he realises it now&mdash;to bring in this amendment, which appeared to go even the slightest step in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>If transport policy should change, if we should feel that we do not want a national transport concern, or if we feel that we should authorise every farmer, shopkeeper or working man to pull and drag by his own lorries and buses or by anything he likes, let the House at some stage decide on that. We have not decided on that.  Our policy has been a reasonably good, properly integrated system of transport, carried out by the national transport concern.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt at all in my mind that if this amendment goes through as it stands, there will be set up here, throughout the length and breadth of the country, a new type of transport huckster.  A precedent is there in the North of Ireland, where they have reached the stage now that it is impossible to make public road transport pay, because of concessions they made to the farming community in good faith, regarding the haulage of cattle to fairs.  The position is now that we see these lorries operating not alone in the North of Ireland illegally, but coming down here to the fairs in the South of Ireland, nondescript lorries without any indication as to who owns them or what they are entitled to do, and drawing illegally out of every fair here.  There is no rural Deputy who is not aware of that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> I do not wish to add further to the Minister's troubles.  Some of the suggestions made here to-day have landed him in a bad enough mess, without my adding to it.  The suggestion has been made, however, that this is all right because it is simply tractors that are mentioned in the section.  I should like to know the legal interpretation of the word &ldquo;tractor.&rdquo;  It is not defined in this Bill.  It may well be that some eminent legal man might regard it as any form of traction.  I want to point out that these detachable Scamell unites, capable of drawing a trailer, with a load capacity of ten tons, are described as tractors.</P>
    <P>While not wishing to add further to the worries of the Minister, I would say that, if he proceeds with this ill-advised amendment, he would need to have another look at what the word &ldquo;tractor&rdquo; means.  If it means that a slick operator in some rural area can purchase one of these Scamell units with trailer attached and carry up to ten or 15 tons of goods, I think that is not what the Minister had in mind and I would say it, was not what the National Farmers' Association had in mind, either.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I urge the Minister to have another look at this.  He can see from the contributions made here to-day that he has opened the door and has taken a very dangerous step; and if he does not close it quickly, I am afraid no one knows where he will end up or where the transport system will end up in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarMaher" hpid="Mr. Maher Mr. Maher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have come to the conclusion that there must have been a considerable degree of merit in the case made by the National Farmers' Association for a concession in relation to tractors; otherwise I am sure we would not be discussing this amendment here to-day.  Our transport problems arise, in the main, from our having too much transport in the country. Every Deputy has acknowledged that fact.  We are legislating to try to eliminate the difficulties caused by this superfluous transport.  We have had some discussion about the concession which has been given with a view to giving some extra facility to the farming community by way of allowing tractors to carry live stock to marts, <Col N="1210" /> and it is being asked that that should be extended to lorries.  I see a great danger in that.  We have too much transport; we have over 40,000 private lorries; and there will be a big increase in that number if the feeling gets abroad that anybody can buy a lorry and get permission to carry live stock for reward in a legitimate way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman seemed to think that no difficulty would arise, if the concession were extended to lorries.  I know a considerable number of farming families who have settled up their own private affairs and where a farmer's son or several of them may have £1,000 or £1,500 and the urge may be on them to buy a lorry.  Such a farmer's son will do it, if he gets this concession.  That is my opinion.  I would advise him to buy land or live stock or something else, but the tendency is there, with the cost of land, to use this £1,000 or £1,500 to go into transport business.  Even though the radius of two miles seems to be a safeguard, I listed down five or six sales located within 20 miles of each other, where it appears that a remunerative transport business could be set up without circumventing the regulations.</P>
      <P>For example, if a young fellow in Ballylinan in my constituency bought a lorry with a view to carrying live stock in a legitimate way within the scope of this legislation, perhaps he could carry it to Carlow, Athy, Tullow, Naas and many other sales within a 20-mile radius.  Since we have already far too many facilities for the carrying of the goods that are there, it would be a retrograde step for the community as a whole if any encouragement were given to people who contemplate branching into the transport business, which is already overdone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the development of the marts, there may be some merit in granting facilities to the tractor owners.  I do not know how one can ensure that a person's main income is derived from the pursuit of farming activities. Where a family has not separated the property, where the holding is fixed in one son and another son is living there, he could buy a tractor and be using it on the farm, but he could buy it <Col N="1211" /> for the main purpose of carrying live stock to a number of marts surrounding him.</P>
    <P>I think our balance of payments problem is difficult enough.  I do not want to disgress too far from the question we are discussing, but I think we will find ourselves purchasing more mechanisation, more lorries and more tractors and making our balance of payments problem more acute, by encouraging people to go into what I consider to be unproductive work. That tendency is there and if we encourage it here, it would be a wrong step for us to take.</P>
    <P>We should take a firm stand.  If we are going to try to drive traffic on to C.I.E. in order to enable them to eliminate their losses and save the Exchequer from contributing large subventions of taxpayers' money year after year, we must draw a firm line in relation to the facilities which we will permit other people to provide in the transport business.</P>
    <P>I feel that by our actions here, if we allow the lorries to carry cattle, we are ensuring that there will be a discussion here year after year on this C.I.E. problem and that we are taking a step by which beyond all shadow of doubt C.I.E. problems will be aggravated and the taxpayer will be called upon, in the future as in the past, to cover the losses that have arisen and that are likely to arise.</P>
    <P>Perhaps as a rural Deputy I should go all-out for an extension of the lorries but I am putting the national considerations before everything else. I think an extension of the lorries would be a retrograde step and not as easy to get over as Deputy Sweetman says.  It would be wide open to abuses and even this amendment is open to abuses.  The National Farmers' Association must have put up a very convincing case and I am prepared to accept that they have convinced the Minister. I think the Minister would be well advised not to go any further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to what the Deputy refers when he mentions an inter-departmental committee.  He <Col N="1212" /> is here long enough to know the function of such a committee is to put the joint wisdom of the various Departments together and Ministers, if they are sensible Ministers, will let the Departments speak.  They do not necessarily agree with the recommendations put forward by the Departments and any Minister of experience knows that.  As Deputy Sweetman said, if it will make any contribution, we are prepared to waive the proposal about the lorries.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Casey is mistaken. It is a good thing to debate these things in Dáil Éireann and I do not think there is any need for the Minister to feel he has set his foot on a slippery slope.  Nobody wants to force him into giving a concession which would materially undermine the principles upon which the transport legislation stands.  Sometimes when I hear Deputy Casey speak, and even the Deputy from Laois-Offaly, I wonder if they try to put themselves in the position of the small farmer.  What are you to do if you have seven lambs for sale?  You cannot walk seven lambs from Ballaghaderreen to Castlerea. You have either of two courses open to you.  You can take what you can get for them in Ballaghaderreen or else you can try to bring them to Boyle or Castlerea to get a better market. You cannot get a C.I.E. lorry to do that for you.</P>
      <P>The present situation is that the small farmer takes what he can get in the immediate vicinity of his home. The large farmer, with whom the Deputy from Laois-Offaly is familiar, hires a C.I.E. lorry and takes 40 lambs to a mart, or to the Dublin market or wherever he wants to, where they can be most advantageously sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarMaher" hpid="Mr. Maher Mr. Maher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maher</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy never sold a lamb in his life.  I know from bitter <Col N="1213" /> experience that if the word goes out that I have to sell lambs on my own land, it will cost me from 5/- to 10/- a lamb.  The moment I take them to Castlerea and sell the first half-dozen and get the full price, I shall get a better price for the rest of them.  I have been offered 5/- apiece less for lambs on my own land than the same buyer paid me for the same lambs in Castlerea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarMaher" hpid="Mr. Maher Mr. Maher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maher</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience of buying lambs I found that it was much easier to buy them at a fair.  In 99 cases out of 100 they were cheaper than if they were bought from the farmer on his own land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my experience of selling.  I have been paid 5/- apiece more for lambs at a fair 12 miles away, than the same buyer was prepared to give me for the lambs on my own land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarMaher" hpid="Mr. Maher Mr. Maher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maher</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Generations of farmers have not brought their live stock to markets and fairs for fun.  They know that in the competition of the open market they will get, as a rule, a better price than if constrained to sell them locally.  I think Deputy Casey makes this great mistake.  You can push a good case too far.  We can carry the people with us up to a point in making sacrifices to preserve C.I.E., both in order to maintain the transport facilities in existence and the employment provided thereon, but you can push that too far.  Our aim should be to enact legislation which preserves the employment in C.I.E., maintains the transport system and at the same time provides certain minimal facilities for people living in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is this additional consideration which I put to the Minister and which he may have overlooked.  The small towns in rural Ireland are not having a very good time at present.  One of the means by which the small town subsists is the monthly fair and the weekly market.  A good many small towns already feel the impact not only of the existence of auction marts in certain centres but of the booming <Col N="1214" /> prices for cattle which results in a very considerable number of cattle being bought on the land without being brought to the fair at all.  I put it to the Minister that he has a duty to consider that aspect as well as every other aspect.</P>
    <P>There are more people earning their living in the distributive trades and services of the small rural towns than there are even in C.I.E.  Many of them are losing their jobs and their businesses as a result of shops closing down in the small towns because the fairs and markets tend to dwindle.  In many small towns the pig fair is gone.  In every small town in Monaghan the pork market is gone.</P>
    <P>Is it not rather hard that at this moment cattle going to the marts in Carrickmacross may be carried by the farmers' tractors and cattle going to Ballybay, Castlerea, Clones or Monaghan must be walked?  Would the Minister not come as far as saying that cattle going to a mart, a fair or to a factory, for sale or slaughter, and carried by agricultural tractors should be eligible for the benefits of this amendment?  If he would come that distance, we might make a fair deal upon this matter and, by our withdrawal of the lorry proposal, get general acceptance that we did not want, at this stage, to set our feet on a slippery slope and that we were prepared to be unanimous in the fact that this amendment was not designed to develop a new haulier industry but was to be strictly designed to providing an amenity&mdash;which otherwise cannot be brought into existence&mdash;mainly for the benefit of the smaller farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to accept the recommendation made by Deputy Dillon. We all appreciate how far the Minister has gone in that respect.  He has gone so far as to meet the people in areas where <Col N="1215" /> auction marts are operating, but take the areas where they are not.  In my county, we have only one.  I feel we are going to permit the driving of a coach and four through the law, as far as this amendment is concerned.  A farmer bringing cattle to an auction mart may bring them to a fair on the way and he could say that he was only resting them at the fair.  It cannot do any harm where tractors operate only inside a radius of two miles.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the facts in relation to the rural areas at the moment.  Transport conditions have changed very much as regards the farmers.  Years ago, the farmer had to do all his work with his own horses. He now finds for economic reasons, the horses being sold, that the work is being done by tractors.  When the work can be done by tractors on the farm, I do not see what is wrong with the tractor owner carrying the farm produce for hire to the market.  I think the Minister, before turning this down, should reconsider it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be clearly understood that this facility being used by farmers depends entirely upon their continuing to get the road tax concession now allowed to them for agricultural purposes.  There is no likelihood that it would be extended to tractors used for general haulage. The people responsible for the Road Fund would be strongly opposed to any extension.  I do not think anybody would be interested in hauling for reward.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 24 not moved.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 26 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, may I take it that the provisions for dealing with offences of illegal haulage applicable to other acts of illegal haulage will also apply to people who may chance their arm under, the provisions made in the Minister's amendment? As I outlined when discussing the Minister's amendment, I feel that a further opportunity is being given to persons who may wish to embark on illegal haulage, and I particularly asked the Minister to clear up exactly what is meant by the word &ldquo;tractor&rdquo;. I pointed out that in the Bill itself there is no strict definition of the word &ldquo;tractor&rdquo;, and I have fears that this looseness in the section as amended will lead to all sorts of abuses which certainly the Minister or even the people who supported the amendment had not in mind.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to let me know if my fears in that direction are well founded.  I am led to believe that even these detachable Scamell units which can draw trailers of quite large dimensions can come under the category of tractors.  Secondly, will the Minister ensure that adequate steps will be taken to see that this section, as amended, will not be utilised as I fear, it will be, in the broadening of the opportunities for illegal haulage.  I should like to have the Minister's assurance that the Garda or whoever else may be charged with the detection of this breach of the law will be made conversant, by every means possible, with what is intended in the section as amended by the Minister.</P>

      <P>If there is any possibility of ambiguity about the <Col N="1219" /> significance of the word &ldquo;tractor&rdquo;, we can remove that by inserting the word &ldquo;agricultural&rdquo; in front of it.  It is agricultural tractors we have in mind. I may move an amendment on the Report Stage.  As regards enforcement by the Guards, I can only say I assume that they will take all reasonable steps to enforce the provisions of the Act and to see that their members are informed about the requirements of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section proper, I think the Minister is right in pitching the Bill as it has been pitched for the purpose of dealing with illegal haulage.  Illegal haulage has done irreparable harm to C.I.E. and illegal haulage by private transport operators resident in the Twenty-Six Counties and outside the Twenty-Six Counties has seriously indented upon C.I.E. traffic.  It is well known that a number of private hauliers gather around fairs wherever traffic has accumulated for the purpose of endeavouring to get business to which they are not entitled in the normal operation of their business.</P>
      <P>Because many of these illegal hauliers were able to employ people for very long hours, under very bad conditions and at low rates of wages, they were able to undercut the national transport authority and to that extent they simply undermined with impunity our efforts in this House to maintain a solvent transport undertaking like C.I.E.  It is desirable, therefore, that those who deliberately engage in illegal haulage should be made amenable for their actions in that respect. After all, there are 20,000 persons employed by C.I.E. and it is unfair that their livelihood should be put in jeopardy simply because people decide that they will deliberately break the law in the hope that if they are caught out they will be punished by the imposition of a nominal fine which is regarded by them merely as a small overhead in the operation of their haulage business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions in the section are wise and I hope they will give C.I.E. a better chance in the future in securing <Col N="1220" /> legitimate traffic.  It is quite obvious to everybody who knows the position and to C.I.E., who have made a detailed study of the matter, that illegal-haulage has siphoned off from C.I.E. a very substantial portion of traffic which they could have carried over the system and by the carrying of which they would have indented to a lesser extent on the public purse for subsidies to maintain their services.  I welcome the provisions of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any precedent for sub-section (4) of Section 26?  Sub-for sub-section (4) operates in the Transport Bill to repeal sub-section (1) of Section 1 of the Probation of Offenders Act.  If there was any Act of Parliament which has appeared to justify itself it has been the Probation of Offenders Act. I know we are becoming exercised about the iniquities of illegal haulage and the natural instinct is to want to remove every possibility of allowing people to get away with it, by doubling the fine, trebling the fine and prescribing all sorts of extreme penalties. But the Probation of Offenders Act surely ought not to be casually repealed.  I can remember no Act of Parliament passed in this House in which by a sub-section of one section we have suspended the operation of that Act.</P>

      <P>I cannot answer the Deputy's question as to whether there is any precedent; that would require a knowledge of the law that I do not possess.  Admittedly the principle of minimum fines is novel in our legislation but the view expressed by the committee investigating these matters is that you cannot hope to eliminate this illegal haulage except by an arrangement which will take the profit out of it, that is, this system in which the fines become steeper and steeper, eventually leading, at the discretion of the court, to the forfeiture of the lorry.  I am assuming sub-section (4) is consequential on the minimum fine provision of sub-section (2).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it can fairly be said that the Minister's speech is a pretty clear survey of his activities in the Department for the past year.  It is not an attempt to assess the merits or demerits of our educational system. That was more or less the trend or substance of the speech we heard from Deputy Dr. Browne.  Whether it is desirable or not&mdash;I do not know&mdash;it is not customary for the Minister for Education to make that sort of a review in introducing his Estimate.  So far as I know, he presents the Estimate with a factual and practical account of his activities, but if the Minister can do so, I think it would be just as well, as he is, so to speak, head of the educational system here, if he would comment on our educational system as he sees it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say, as Deputy Dr. Browne said, that we have taken for granted the general pattern of our educational system for years past.  It has been taken for granted by various Ministers for Education and I think <Col N="1223" /> the discussion which Deputy Dr. Browne has provoked may well draw from the Minister some general comments&mdash;if not detailed comments&mdash;on the system of education as it stands at present and as we have had it for many years past.</P>
    <P>Let nobody think that I would attempt to make any assessment of our educational system because, to be quite frank, I do not think I could.  I am not sufficiently conversant with the educational system at present to speak as Deputy Dr. Browne spoke or as Deputy Cunningham, who has practical experience of teaching, spoke.  I can speak only as a parent and as one who has not a very lengthy experience of schoolgoing children.  My comments are not so much on the general system of education as on points that have occurred to me.  Deputy Dr. Browne had some interesting comments to make on the teaching of the Irish language and on corporal punishment and I intend to say something on both these subjects.</P>
    <P>In his survey, the Minister mentioned the introduction of an interview into the tests for entrance to training colleges.  That, in itself, I suppose, is very desirable and something that will be generally welcomed, but inasmuch as the recruitment to meet the shortage of national teachers has been a big problem for the Minister and for the country over the past few years, I should like to comment on the general question of recruitment of national teachers.  So far as I am aware, in the early days, teachers were recruited through public examinations and a proportion of them were drawn from the type described as monitors.  In 1928 or 1929, I am informed, preparatory colleges were established, and entrance to them was by way of examination set by the Department for pupils between 13 and 15 years.  Fifty per cent. of the places available at those examinations were reserved for those who got 85 per cent. or over in oral Irish.  At least 25 per cent. of the vacancies must go to candidates entered from the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>This is what worries me and perhaps the Minister would examine it and if possible comment on it in his reply.  I <Col N="1224" /> am informed that if the Gaeltacht candidate does not obtain 85 per cent. the inspector must write a report as to why he did not get 85 per cent.  If a candidate from the Gaeltacht gets 85 per cent. or over, the inspector must make a report as to why he got over 85 per cent.  Perhaps my information is incorrect, but it is as I got it.  I would suggest that it is simpler for the inspector to give the candidate who gets 80 or 84 per cent. the extra percentage, so that he will not have the bother of writing a report and, on the other hand, it is simpler for him to fail the applicant from the Gaeltacht rather than write a report on why he did not get over 85 per cent. I should be glad to hear the Minister's comments on that.</P>
    <P>Let nobody take it as prejudice on my part so far as entrance to the preparatory colleges is concerned, but it seems to me that there is too much of a bias in favour of those who have the good fortune, for the purpose of the teaching profession, to be born in the Gaeltacht.  There is resentment of this super-preference.  I do not know what type of pupil the Minister envisages in the acceptance of trainees to the training colleges, but I am informed that at least half the vacancies in these colleges must be filled from preparatory colleges, entrance to which, as I have said, is weighted in favour of pupils from the Gaeltacht&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty-five per cent of Gaeltacht candidates in the preparatory colleges and 25 per cent. of preparatory college students to the training colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am corrected on that, but my information was that at least half the vacancies in training colleges must be filled from preparatory colleges. If I understand the Minister's remarks, however, it means that those in the secondary schools can compete on equal terms with those coming from preparatory colleges.  If that is the correct interpretation, as far as I am concerned, it is an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an oral Irish examination for the training colleges.  I am informed that up to four years ago there was also an oral English examination.  I do <Col N="1225" /> not know why that was scrapped.  We must recognise English as the spoken language and, as such, that it is very important in industry and in commercial and social activities.  If there is to be an oral Irish examination which will benefit those from the Gaeltacht areas, I believe there is an equally good case for having an oral English examination which will benefit those from the Galltacht.</P>
    <P>As I said, there seems to be too much preference for those from the Gaeltacht areas.  There should be equality between entrants from the Gaeltacht and the Galltacht.  The absence of that equality is something which militates against the language. I am informed&mdash;and Deputy Dr. Browne mentioned it&mdash;that the standard of living in the Gaeltacht areas is possibly not as high as in southern and eastern parts of the country.  We find in these examinations that applicants from the Gaeltacht areas get a subsidy towards their travelling expenses and the cost of examinations. But, although it may not be general, there are some poor boys and girls in the cities, provincial towns and rural areas in the South and East and in some of the northern counties.  In some cases they are not as well off as applicants from the Gaeltacht areas and they would be deserving of a subsidy towards their travelling expenses and examination fees.</P>
    <P>There is another point which I wish to raise, though possibly it is not appropriate to the Minister's Department. It concerns the examination fees charged by certain of the State examining bodies for positions within the Civil Service.  If poor people and people of modest means are expected to make use of their education they should not be hindered from going for Civil Service examinations by reason of the fact that they cannot afford a fee.  Recently, I saw an advertisement for a Civil Service post.  It was not a very highly remunerative post but the fee to be charged was £2 12s. 6d.  That was a fairly big fee for a member of a large family who has completed his intermediate or leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>On top of that these boys and girls must travel from various parts of the <Col N="1226" /> country to Dublin.  They have to pay their train or bus fares and make financial provision for a stay in Dublin of anything from one day to a week. If something could be done to remedy that position, then it could be said that those of modest means would have an equal opportunity, not alone as far as education is concerned, but also as far as the prospects of obtaining positions in the Civil Service or C.I.E. are concerned.</P>
    <P>I have not the same information about the scarcity of teachers as the Minister and other Deputies have.  It seems to me peculiar that in all branches of employment at present we have too many applicants.  We have too many builders' labourers, too many officials and clerks for C.I.E., too many civil servants, too many carpenters&mdash;and the people say we have too many T.D.s!  Yet there is a profession in which we have not enough applicants.  I have never yet heard anybody give a reason for this scarcity. Why do young boys and girls not go for the teaching profession?  Are they debarred from it?  Is it because they have not the money to receive the necessary education or is it that the remuneration is not sufficient?  Surely we should be able to attract into the teaching profession a sufficient number of teachers?  The only conclusion I can come to is that national teachers are not paid enough and that the profession is not made sufficiently attractive.</P>
    <P>It is a dangerous precedent for the Minister to lift what has been described as &ldquo;the marriage ban&rdquo;. Later, there could be a similar demand &mdash;and I think it would be justifiable&mdash; from lady civil servants or women in semi-State services.  The issues are very wide indeed as to whether or not we should allow married women to continue to work in the State or semi-State services.  I know that this is an expedient to relieve the Minister and the parents of the anxiety about having a sufficient number of teachers.  But I would suggest that the approach should have been to make the teaching profession more attractive by paying a salary in accordance with the heavy responsibilities of the work of national teachers and indeed of all teachers here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1227" /> The Minister has referred to the fact that a commission is to be set up to investigate how best to restore the language.  I was a member of a Government which set up various commissions. We were criticised and jeered at for shedding our responsibility. I do not say that in respect of this commission on the Irish language. The comment I would like to make is this.  Much damage will be done before this commission reports.  Our experience of commissions, no matter how simple they may appear to be, is that they take at least three years to make a report.  In the last Government a commission was set up in a particular Department to investigate what was regarded as a fairly simple matter. After three years that commission is still sitting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Which one is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to mention it.  I was responsible for it.  That commission is still sitting.  If the Deputy wants to know, it is the one on workmen's compensation.  I think it is a relatively simple matter.  It should not have taken anything like three years.  I do not blame the members; that is the way of all commissions.</P>
      <P>This may not be an attempt by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Education to shed their responsibility, but in the meantime great damage will be done.  The position of the language, to say the least of it, has not improved. There are many people responsible for that position.  I would say that the main reason why the language has not progressed is the compulsion that has been imposed and perpetuated by various Ministers.  I said that on one occasion when I first came into this House&mdash;I was not the hardened politician then: I was quite genuine&mdash;and great exception was taken to it by a Fianna Fáil Minister for Education.  I honestly believe, and so does practically every person in the country who has not got a vested interest in Irish, that compulsion is Killing the language.  As long as the language is treated in the same way as geography, history, chemistry, physics and every other subject, it will not make progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> A generation ago there were high hopes for the revival of the language and, whilst I disagree with a great deal of what Deputy Dr. Browne said in his contribution to this debate, there is not very much, if anything, upon which I could disagree with him in his remarks about the position of the language and the problem of its revival.  A generation ago there were high hopes for the revival of the language.  Why?  Because, as Deputy Dr. Browne said, it was a symbol of something.  It was a badge of nationality.  People were determined to restore the language because the authorities then insisted that we should not speak it; there was a strong national spirit abroad and the people felt it was their bounden duty to learn Irish as a badge of patriotism and nationality.</P>
    <P>To-day, I do not think any of us could say that the restoration of the language has progressed in any degree whatsoever.  In his reply, the Minister should tell us something about the Gaeltacht, which is supposed to represent our sheet-anchor in the revival of the language.  As far as I am aware, the Gaeltacht is decreasing every year. If our sheet-anchor is allowed to rust, there will not be much hope then for the revival of the language, unless there is a different approach and unless different methods are adopted.</P>
    <P>The basis of revival should, in my opinion, be love and respect.  Now, if young children of four, five and up to 14 years of age are to have a love and respect for the language it must not be something that they must pass in examinations.  It must not be regarded as a language in which they must be absolutely grammatical and in relation to the misuse of which they are reprimanded and corrected in the manner in which they are corrected by certain teachers and certain people who sport the Fáinne and belong to this organisation or that organisation.</P>
    <P>The language will not be revived if a certain section or a certain political Party regards the language and the problem of its revival as their very own and if they continue, as they do, to resent criticism of the methods of teaching the language or the methods adopted for its restoration.  The language <Col N="1229" /> belongs to us all and those Deputies who spoke so far in this debate have demonstated they are genuine in seeking its revival.  Criticism should be taken for what it is worth and it should not be resented in the manner in which it has been resented, especially over the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>I know there are people who do not want to have the language revived.  I know there are people who are antagonistic to the language and would prefer to have it done away with altogether but, by and large, people generally would like to see the language revived and they are resentful of the attitude of many of those who pose as champions of the language.</P>
    <P>The basis of revival must be love and respect, not compulsion.  Neither should it be regarded as a passport for a job.  That is a bone of contention. That is one of the reasons why in the Galltacht along the eastern coast there is some degree of prejudice against the language; a young boy or girl gets what is regarded as a fairly decent mark in an examination only to be ousted by some boy or girl from the fringe of the Gaeltacht who knows Irish better.  There should be some understanding of the position of the boy or girl from the Galltacht, who knows English as the ordinary-vernacular of his or her daily life.</P>
    <P>One of the things which has militated against the revival of the language is the sham behaviour of some people in this House towards Irish.  I could name certain Deputies who are sincere in their use of Irish here.  Those of us who have been here for some time know who they are.  There are others who have done nothing but bring the language into disrepute.  I heard the Taoiseach being proposed here after the last election.  He was proposed by one Deputy in two sentences in Irish. I am perfectly certain that Deputy did not know what he was saying.  He had not a clue.  He had some idea, I suppose, that he was proposing the election of the Taoiseach.  He was seconded by another Deputy, and he did not have an idea of what the words he was saying meant.  He said them parrot-like.  They were written out for <Col N="1230" /> him and he came in here&mdash;he had the sound of them&mdash;and just reeled them off.</P>
    <P>I do not think either of these two members ever made an attempt to learn Irish, beyond saying as a joke here: &ldquo;Sin ceist eile.&rdquo;  Certainly, they did not set a good example to the country.  That was just a puerile attempt on the part of these two Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party to represent to the country that, as far as the language was concerned, they were the saviours of the language.  I know these two Deputies.  They were then Deputy Lemass and Deputy MacEntee.  They had not spoken a word of Irish before that, and they have not spoken a word of it since.</P>
    <P>There are, too, the Ministers who insist on replying in the Irish language to parliamentary questions, when it suits them, or in English when it suits them to use English.  If we set the example here and showed ourselves really genuine and sincere about the revival of the language, then the country would at least have a lead from the Parliamentary of the country.  I would suggest, in that connection, that there should be some time reserved here for a discussion through the medium of Irish.  It need not be a discussion on a Bill or an Estimate; it could be a discussion on some non-contentious motion in which Deputies who wanted to participate could participate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham said we should not insist on grammatical perfection in the speaking of Irish.  Anybody who has had the opportunity of picking up French or German, or any other continental language, knows that his education in those languages has not followed the same pattern as did his education in the Irish language.  If we had not a lot of these fáinneoirí, it would be easier for learners of the language.  I do not mean to be disrespectful to them but some of them are very smart people and if one word or one syllable is astray they make a correction immediately to the embarrassment of some young boy or girl who is genuine about the Irish language but who, from that day onwards, is sheered off.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> I have known people who have gone to Strasbourg without a word of French and, by picking up different phrases there, using very bad grammer and making all sorts of mistakes, after a few weeks there or after being there a few times, they are able to converse fairly freely in the French language. That is because they did not have the big stick over them or any type of compulsion and, above all, because they did not have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; the fáinneóirí who are going around to say &ldquo;Níl sé sin ceart,&rdquo; or something like that.  I have often said here that, as far as my education in the Irish language was concerned, the method of teaching was all right.  I got more than the rudiments of grammar.  I discovered after a time at school, and after a most fruitful visit to an Irish college there we did every subject through Irish, that I was able to speak the Irish language moderately well and that I could read he Irish language pretty well.  But lo and behold&mdash;and I think I made this objection last year&mdash;there was a change in the spelling of the Irish language with the result that now I just cannot read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how that change came about, why it came about, or what Minister was responsible for it.  However, it was a dirty trick to play on those who had been engaged in school and in other places in learning the language for ten or 15 years.  I think the Minister who made the change, and even the Minister now, would be better employed if he did away with what is described as the &ldquo;Cló Románach&rdquo;.  I do not know why there is a preference for it.  I think it is true also that many of the publications and papers that get a subsidy or grant from the Department of Education are required to have a certain amount of their printing matter in the Cló Romhánach.  At the present time there are three sides to this matter&mdash;the old method of spelling and printing in the Cló Gaelach, the Cló Romhánach and then this inbetween phonetic spelling.  We should try to standardise it.  The House <Col N="1232" /> should declare for some one of these forms of spelling so that there would be uniformity and not the confusion which in my opinion exists at present.</P>
    <P>I would plead with the Minister for uniformity in holidays.  I do not know whether Deputies in general are aware of the present position.  I have two boys going to school.  One gets his holidays on the 15th June.  The other does not get his holidays until the 29th June.  They are young boys.  The Minister will appreciate that there is great resentment, because they have not really come to the use of reason, at the fact that one does not have to go to school for a fortnight while the other has.  Then, when they resume in the autumn, there are still different dates&mdash;and this in the same town.</P>
    <P>It should not be an impossible task for the Minister to direct or advise the managers of schools that there should be uniformity.  If the primary schools are to get their holidays on the 15th June, it should be the 15th of June all around and, if they are to resume on the 28th August, it should be the 28th August for all the primary schools.  Without elaborating any further on that matter, I know the Minister can appreciate the point I try to make.  It would do a great deal to eliminate the discontent which must be in the minds of young children from the same family when they see a member of the family having a holiday at a time when they themselves must go to school.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I could not agree with Deputy Dr. Browne about corporal punishment.  In saying that, I will not say I do not appreciate his point of view.  He may approach the question in a different light from me and his experience may have been different from mine.  I may have to change my mind.  I may be persuaded to change my mind.  Events may change my mind.  My thoughts at present are certainly in favour of a form of corporal punishment.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as one who supports or condones the idea that children should be beaten about the head or humiliated by being beaten in the face or that they should be beaten excessively.  For the life of me, however, <Col N="1233" /> I cannot see what harm it does to slap a child on the hand.  For the life of me, I cannot see why a child cannot be slapped on the rear end when he will not do what he is told.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the time when a child comes to the use of reason differs.  It is very controversial.  I know a young boy of eight years who insists on making fires in every conceivable part of his garden.  His father warned him three or four times.  He appealed to his reason.  He told the child what might happen.  He told him he would probably burn himself. After warning this child three times, he insisted on lighting the fire again, not deliberately of course&mdash;just casually, incidentally.  The father gave him a good few skelps.  That was far more effective than trying to appeal to the reason of the eight years old boy. He could not reason.  He was having fun with the fire.  He had never burned himself.  The father was afraid that if he got burned it would be the end of him.  The father was afraid his clothes would catch fire and that that would be the end of him.  The boy remembered the skelps.  I believe he will not attempt to make a fire again.</P>
      <P>I do not think it unreasonable to slap a young boy when he will not do his exercises at night.  I am saying this in respect of boys up to 12, 13 or 14 years of age.  When a boy passes from the primary school into the secondary school I think he is big and old enough to be able to reason to some extent for himself.  He ought to know that if he does not do his lessons and behave himself at school he has little chance of getting a job or making a career for himself.  I believe young boys from seven to ten or 11 or 12 years who are not chastised in some way, say, for not doing their exercise, just will not do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If boys of seven, eight or nine years go to school and the master asks them for their exercise and they reply that they have not got it and then if the master says to them: &ldquo;Sit down there; if you do not do your exercise you will not be a Civic Guard or a civil servant or a doctor&rdquo; the boys, at that age, <Col N="1234" /> could not care less.  But if they get a few smacks on the hands they will remember it and realise that if they do not do their exercise they will get the smacks the next day and every day in respect of which the exercise has not been done.  They will remember the smacks if they pain or hurt them.  They will not be humiliated or embarrassed by being slapped on the hands.  A child would resent being slapped on the head or on the face or being punished brutally in any way.  However, for the life of me, I cannot see why anybody should object to the chastisement of a child on the hand or on the nether portion of his body.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's point of view.  It may have been shown to him.  I have still to be convinced that young boys or girls from seven to 11 or 12 years of age do not need chastisement to remind them that they must do this, that and the other.</P>
      <P>The newspapers especially have reported many acts of violence by youngsters, teddy boys and girls, in Dublin, Birmingham and Glasgow.  I wonder is it of any significance that this reign of violence has come about when there is emphasis by many people on doing away with corporal punishment?  Perhaps there was much more violence 20 years ago, but in the papers nowadays we see described shocking incidents of young boys, teddy boys and girls, attacking violently elderly people and persons of their own class.  I wonder whether or not that reign of violence has coincided with the doing away with corporal punishment in many of the schools in Great Britain and, to some extent, here in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to conclude by asking the Minister to ensure that there a will be more emphasis on vocational guidance.  Deputy Dr. Browne also spoke about this matter and I do not think I would disagree with much of what he had to say in that respect. There is an acquaintance of mine who has a family of two boys and one girl. I asked one day what this young girl was going to be when she left school She was 12 or 14 years of age at the <Col N="1235" /> time and the reply I got was: &ldquo;I do not know.  She is going for education.&rdquo; I think that attitude is unfortunately fairly common with parents, parents who assume that if children go beyond the age of 14 years, they are merely going to school to be educated and have no ideas where that education is to lead.</P>
    <P>They have no idea as to whether or not the education is of sufficiently high a standard to enable the child to take up a position in the Civil Service, in C.I.E. or any other such organisation or to go on to a university.  Therefore, I think the Minister should endeavour to see that there will be much wider consultations with parents by school teachers and school authorities generally. The function of the teacher, in the main, is to teach.  He does not get many opportunities of speaking to the parents and advising them as to what a boy or girl is fitted for on leaving school.</P>
    <P>The children must come to school until they are 14 years of age.  Many schools will keep them on until they are 16, 17 or 18 years of age and will not have any regard to the ultimate objective of getting a job.  How many hundreds of boys are there who are just fairly good, or a little below average, who get their intermediate and leaving certificate and then say to themselves: &ldquo;Where do we go from here?&rdquo;  They must be pretty good to get into the Civil Service, C.I.E., Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna or any of these State or semi-State bodies.  The boy who just gets honours in the leaving certificate is not, in my opinion, good for much as far as these State or semi-State bodies are concerned, and the unfortunate ends up by becoming a clerk with a small wage and little security or a temporary clerk with some local body.</P>
    <P>After a few years he realises that he is not equipped for this life and he goes to England to become a builder's labourer or an unskilled labourer of some sort.  For that reason, I would think that, at the age of 14, when a boy or girl is finished with primary school, there should be some sort of consultation between the parents and <Col N="1236" /> the school authorities.  There should be a fairly frank discussion and the teacher can advise whether the child can go ahead and have a chance of a job in a State or semi-State body, whether he should try for a scholarship, or whether the parents, if they can afford it, should send him to the university or whether the parents, on the advice of the teacher, should decide that a boy could become a good fitter or a good carpenter and that the most appropriate place for him is the technical school.  Or it might be decided that the boy should start at 14 and apprentice himself to a trade or that he should even become a builder's labourer straight away, if there is no chance of his becoming anything else.  It is better that he should go out to work at 14 rather than that he should kid himself that he is going to become this, that or the other.</P>
    <P>I again ask the Minister to consider what can be done with regard to the revival of the Irish language.  The question has gone on for too long and the Irish language will only get into further disrepute.  We are now at a very critical stage as far as the language is concerned and there must be a lead from somewhere or other. The Minister commented during the debate that it was not his responsibility alone, that all of us had responsibility.  I agree with that, but as long as the language is regarded as a very definite subject to be passed in examinations, there is not much chance of a survival.  If the children are to love and respect the language, it should not be treated in the same way as the ordinary subject taught in school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When I find a Deputy taking three and a half hours to say what he has to say, experience has taught me that he has not much of value to say.  You cannot spend three and a half hours saying something that is worth listening to.  I do not want to criticise anyone for speaking for three and a half hours because it is one of the proudest boasts of this House that a Deputy can speak as long as he likes and there will be occasions when filibustering will be necessary to defend some important fundamental right.  You cannot say anything of <Col N="1237" /> substantial value if it takes you three and a half hours to say it.</P>
      <P>I want to say to Deputy Corish now that it takes moral courage to deal as honestly as he has dealt with the question of corporal punishment, particularly after the tripe he listened to from Deputy Dr. Browne.  I agree with Deputy Corish.  I think Deputy Browne's talk made more impression on Deputy Corish than it made on me but whatever consolation it means to Deputy Corish, when the band begins to play and the old ladies and the whiskered gentlemen start telling him that he is a brutal sadist, I should like him to know that I wish to be in his company.  But that will not protect him from the gentleman with the whisker or the lady in the low shoes and the tweed skirt and the man's hat&mdash;in fact, from the women who look like men and the men who look like women.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us, at some stage of these proceedings, how the surplus of teachers that existed ten years ago has suddenly turned into an acute scarcity.  I remember helping to legislate here a most elaborate scheme of setting up diocesan registers so that when teachers had become surplus, instead of relinquishing their posts, they continued in them but their names were put upon a register.  As soon as a vacancy became available they were transferred from the school where they were supernumerary into a school where a vacancy had occurred.  Now suddenly we have discovered there is an acute shortage of teachers.  Is there any reason for that?  How did it come to pass so quickly?</P>
      <P>The next matter I want to refer to is the question of Irish.  It is a legitimate view in this country that the Irish language should be allowed peacefully to die.  It is a view I do not share. I take the view that it is desirable to preserve the language, but I do not believe that there is any use in saying that if you are not prepared to suggest a means of doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the present policy.  I think that, judged by every available test, it is a bad policy.  The principal test is that it has notoriously <Col N="1238" /> failed.  I adumbrated a policy 11 years ago, in the discussion on this Estimate in 1947, which, if adopted then, I believe would have already yielded very abundant results.  I am going to adumbrate it again to-day.</P>
    <P>Before I come&mdash;to that I want to make some specific comments on the policy as at present operated.  I want to protest in solemn form against the outrage of addressing infant children, entering the national school for the first time, in a language which is not the vernacular of their homes.  At the present time, infant children going to school are addressed in class and instructed, in so far as they are instructed, through the medium of Irish, numbers of them never having heard a word of Irish before in their lives.</P>
    <P>Now it is a difficult thing for a small child to go to school for the first time in his life, without finding himself in a situation in which he is addressed for the first time in a language not one syllable of which he understands.  That seems to me so manifest an outrage that no rational person would defend it.  Yet it is the widespread practice in the national schools of this country and it ought to stop.  It ought to be provided that infant children going to school for the first time shall be addressed by their teachers in the vernacular of their home.  That means that it is just as important that children born and reared in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht be addressed in Irish when they go to school, as it is that children born in the Galltacht, where English is the vernacular of the homes, be addressed in English.  That is the first observetion I want to make.</P>
    <P>My second observation is that it is an outrage to try to teach children the other subjects of the curriculum through the medium of Irish.  In 90 per cent. of cases in the schools of this country, either the teacher or the children, and frequently both, are quite incompetent to teach or learn anything through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>I remember the Taoiseach saying on one occasion here that with his own knowledge of Irish he would not dream of attempting to teach anyone through <Col N="1239" /> the medium of Irish.  The Taoiseach is not very fluent himself, but he is a great deal more fluent than half the national school teachers of this country.  Whatever chance a teacher with an imperfect knowledge of the language has of instructing those who are fluent in it, it is worse when you are confronted with a situation where neither the teacher nor the pupil is fluent in the language.  It is a grotesque outrage to perpetuate a system in which that language, in which neither teacher nor pupil is fluent, is the medium through which the instruction is given in everything else.</P>
    <P>I know I shall be told that there are regulations which lay down that unless both teacher and pupil are fluent the teacher should not use the language as a medium of instruction.  We all know that is &ldquo;my eye and Betty Martin.&rdquo;  The teacher then does not get preferment and does not get good reports from the inspector.  In fact, the system presses continually towards the use of Irish as the medium through which to teach a subject, but neither pupils nor teachers are qualified for the procedure.</P>
    <P>The real truth is that the curse of the revival of Irish is the compulsion associated with it.  It has begun to stink in the nostrils of those who once loved it.  I myself have seen it operated in the Civil Service, where relatively incompetent people were preferred over highly competent candidates, because the relatively incompetent claimed and persuaded the examiners that they were relatively fluent in Irish, whereas the highly competent candidates did not get as high marks in that particular subject.</P>
    <P>I remember distinctly, when I was Minister for Agriculture, trying to appoint a veterinarian, who required to be of the highest standard, for a teaching position, and I was fortunate to find amongst the candidates a man who had been doing research work in Cambridge and who was in every way highly qualified for the job.  Of course, when he went to the Appointments Commissioners, he came out first by a street, in the technical examination. Then I was informed there was another <Col N="1240" /> examination pending in Irish.  By the time that examination was completed, I was presented with a first year graduate, a boy who had just come out of the Veterinary College.  I refused to appoint him and I left office refusing to appoint him.</P>
    <P>I believe there was an almighty row afterwards in which the Government was involved; there was &ldquo;meela murder&rdquo;, but as long as I was there he was not appointed and it was the subject of a great deal of comment that I did not take part in what would have been a disgusting fraud.  It was quite wrong that Irish should be brought into the matter at all.  There was not the remotest possibility of his ever having to use Irish in his work. He would never come in contact with a single creature who would discuss his work with him in Irish.  The man who got it, while he was fluent in the vernacular&mdash;I think he was a native speaker&mdash;would have been wholly unable to use the language for the purpose of instruction in the particular branch of veterinary science which he was called upon to teach.</P>
    <P>That is one single instance of the detestable scandal in which people who seek technical appointments are continually being ousted by inferior candidates who succeed in outstripping them in their facility in spoken and written Irish.  It is that element of fraud and compulsion surrounding the whole language movement which has reduced Irish to the deplorable state in which it now is.</P>
    <P>I have said before in this House &mdash;I do not think it is any harm to say it again&mdash;that I distinctly remember a time when many of us in University College, Dublin, used to adjourn on a Saturday night to the bandstand in St. Stephen's Green for the opportunity of meeting those who spoke Irish, just for the joy of hearing it spoken.  I declare now that to hear people talking Irish in Dublin one is inclined to ask oneself what are they after, what are they up to or in whose eye they are trying to put a finger now.  If you meet two civil servants talking Irish in Government Buildings it is a pretty good indication that there is a job on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1241" /> Everybody knows what I am saying is true.  It is time, long past time, when we should ask ourselves what requires to be done.  I am not prepared to content myself with describing these things as Deputy Dr. Browne did and then go on to say that something else should be done.  I believe in the language.  I should like to see it revived.  I believe it can be done even at this late hour.  It would have been much better done ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The first thing to do is to abolish all compulsion with regard to the Irish language and then provide that Irish be made a passport to higher education in this country.  Any child going to the national school who is prepared to show appropriate diligence within his own limited sphere, attains to a certain degree of proficiency and when he reaches his passing out diploma from the national school should be entitled to present himself for a scholarship examination in Irish written and oral.  If by burning his modest quota of midnight oil, he can reach an honest standard in such an examination he should become entitled to a scholarship to the secondary school.</P>
    <P>We should provide a special examination of honours standard with a proviso that those who took it and passed it would receive a scholarship to the university.  In the university they should be allowed to follow any faculty they choose, architecture, medicine, law or whatever they wanted to do, always provided that at the end of each academic year they would submit themselves for an examination of a high honours standard in Irish, written and spoken.  Those who did not choose to keep up that standard would lose their scholarships.  The standard should not be in excess of the child, the youth or the adolescent but should be graded according to their reasonable capacity.  It would mean that they would have to give special attention to Irish, written and oral.</P>
    <P>If that scheme operated for ten years you would have coming out of the universities and colleges every year a highly educated section of the community <Col N="1242" /> who would have one common denominator.  Some would be architects, doctors or lawyers and some would belong to the other learned professions. All would have this in common&mdash;they would speak Irish fluently.  If some particular quality becomes associated in the mind of our people with higher learning, nothing is looked to with greater admiration or longing than that particular quality.</P>
    <P>If Irish became synonomous in our society with superior education and learning that would be of infinitely more value to the revival of Irish than any compulsion which the genius of the Department or anybody else can ever think of.  It would also restore Irish to the honourable place once held in making the Irish language a badge of distinction instead of a badge of fraud which it is now commonly held to be.  I should like to see its dignity and its beauty restored.  That is one way to do it.  In our lifetime we could see Irish restored.  At the same time, we could open the door to higher education, to the élite of our young people whose election would be determined, not by birth, wealth or background, but by their own capacity to do well according to their own standard at each stage of their educational life.</P>
    <P>I remember adumbrating that scheme once from a lorry in York Street which is not very far from this House.  As I looked down on the children in York Street it struck me that there was something wrong with a society which seemed to say to these children that in no possible circumstances would they ever attain to the advantages which I, through no merit of my own, can enjoy. It struck me that here was a means of saying to all of them, the poorest and the simplest as well as the most sophisticated in the land, that it is now open to them all, on the basis of absolute equality, to secure each one for himself primary, secondary and higher education right up from the infant class to the doctorate in philosophy. That thus we repudiate the absurdity that all men are born equal but affirm anew in every generation that all children born into our society, boys and girls, will have equal opportunity, <Col N="1243" /> so that the gifts given by God to all of us will, in this country, have ample scope for development.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is an unreasonable price to ask the beneficiaries of such a scheme to pay that they should preserve, the language for the succeeding generation.  It is a price they are very glad to pay and it is a very simple and satisfactory criterion to apply to children who aspire to higher education and, though it is by no means an infallible test, it is not a bad guide whereby to pick out the children who will benefit from secondary and university education.</P>
    <P>Nothing can be more illusory than to imagine that it is a desirable thing to thrust on every child in our community or any other community secondary and/or university education. Many of them would be much better without either.  I heard some Deputy to-day talking about Ballylinan.  I could not help thinking of Mr. Grace, who left Ballylinan when he was 13 or 14 years of age to go to Buenos Aires. His grandchildren now have the Grace Line, the Grace Bank, the Grace Import and Export Company and dominate the trade of South America. Very possibly, if Mr. Grace had stayed at home and attended a secondary school, he would never have got cracking in Buenos Aires.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to know what kind of education can best help each individual child.  Probably, the children's parents, in consultation with their teachers, are the best judges.  The State is not equipped to carry out an accurate judgment of that kind.  But here is one useful test which would sort out at least the children who wanted to try and it is fairly true to say that children who yearn for higher education are certainly within the category of those who ought to get it.</P>
    <P>That may seem a simple device for the revival of the Irish language.  I have not the slightest doubt that it is the only hope of preventing the language dying in our time and, by dying, I mean ceasing to be the vernacular of any sufficient number of people to allow it to develop as a <Col N="1244" /> living language.  I am looking at an old colleague from Donegal and he and I know the extent to which the Fíor-Ghaeltacht in Donegal has shrunk in the last 25 years.  The same is true of Mayo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They brought the language into other spheres in the world, though.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree with me that the Fíor-Ghaeltacht that we knew 25 years ago in West Donegal has materially shrunk, that Irish is no longer the vernacular of the streets of Falcarragh as it used to be and that you must go west of Gortahork to find it, whereas, 25 years ago, it was the vernacular of Falcarragh.  The same is true in Mayo.  The same is certainly true in Galway.  I am not sufficiently familiar with the circumstances of the Kerry Gaeltacht to speak with authority about it.</P>
      <P>I want to turn from that topic to three or four others to which I wish to refer briefly.  There was started in this town by the voluntary effort of some public-spirited people a school for retarded children.  I do not mean imbecile children; I mean children who are just retarded and unable to keep up with the ordinary curriculum of the primary school programme.  By the unaided efforts of these people, they provided 28 places and they have not been going much more than a year and they have a waiting list of 1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely, if that is the size of our problem in the City of Dublin, it ought not to be beyond our resources to cater for it.  If there are 1,000 or 1,500 retarded children in this city, who are faced with the alternative of permanent disabilities throughout their lives if we do not look after them in the ten years that lie ahead, from four to 14 years of age or from six to 16 years of age, we ought to do something about it because it is not so large a problem as to create a serious financial problem which might be insurmountable. Despite what Deputy Dr. Browne says, financial problems sometimes are insurmountable if you have not got the cash wherewith to surmount them.  We have got the cash to cater for 1,500 retarded children, if I <Col N="1245" /> am right in believing that they are there, and so far we have been doing nothing about them.</P>
    <P>When you come to retarded children in rural areas, you are in a very difficult position because to gather them together for the kind of instruction by which they can profit is a problem the answer to which I do not know.  If I had to choose between gathering them together at the expense of taking them away from their home or leaving it to their fathers and mothers to do the best they can for them, I think I would leave it to their fathers and mothers. But, where you have a city situation in which it is relatively easy&mdash;and we know by experience that it is being done&mdash;to gather the children into suitable schools where, there are trained teachers to deal with the particularly difficult problem of educating retarded children, I would suggest to the Minister that he could sleep easier at nights if he took steps forthwith to provide for such children, at least in Dublin and Cork, and then let us go on to the less densely populated areas later to see what the dimensions of the problem may be there and what is the best way of grappling with it.</P>
    <P>Now I want to come to Marlborough House.  One of the great difficulties about dealing with matters of this kind is that retarded children have no votes. The residents of Marlborough House have no votes and they belong to no associations or do not send resolutions and in the busy life we all lead there is a natural tendency to forget them altogether.  I do not suppose the Minister forgets the children in Marlborough House but I cannot forget them. They are constantly on my mind.  We are in a most difficult position in regard to them.  The children in Marlborough House are the children on remand from the Dublin District Court. So long as they are in the hands of the Garda they are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  When they are delivered to Marlborough House they become the responsibility of the Minister for Education.  I have spent close on 20 years falling between the two stools, the Department of Education and the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1246" /> I remember once, when I was a Minister, falling between those two stools. A man stopped me in the street and said he was well nigh in despair because his six-year-old child had been put into Marlboroug House where he knew there was a 14-year-old boy who had been put there that morning for indecently assulting a girl.  As he expected there was no provision for segregation, he found it difficult to reconcile himself to his child's continued detention there.  As my son at that time happened to be six years of age, I asked myself how I would feel if he had been moved to Marlborough House, under the conditions that I knew obtained there, and so, in a week moment, I fell between the two stools, the Department of Education and the Department of Justice, and not for the first time.</P>
    <P>What I want done relates really to what subsequently happens in the court.  The Minister for Justice says he cannot do it because he is not responsible for Marlborough House and the Minister for-Education says he cannot do it because he is not interested in what happens in the police courts.  The moment children come out of Marlborough House and go into the police courts he is finished with them.  The Minister for Justice says that the moment they go into Marlborough House he has finished with them.  That is the position but what I want done is quite simple.  The Minister for Education could do it, if he wanted to.  Once, I very nearly got the Taoiseach to do it when he was Minister for Education.  I had him round the corner when he ceased to be Minister for Education and I had to start all over again.  I was not so successful the second time.</P>
    <P>Children are arraigned before the District Court and I suppose it is frequently very hard in the succinct procedure of these courts to determine precisely why a child does the things children do.  Why does a child go out and break every lamp standard in the street in which he lives?  Why does he set fire to the sitting-room couch?  Why does he do any of the strange things children do?  Some of them do things, no doubt, just because <Col N="1247" /> they want a &ldquo;clout&rdquo;, but the plain truth is that children who misbehave and who want a &ldquo;clout&rdquo; very rarely find their way into court because the Garda are very patient, humane and prudent in that matter and they will bring the child repeatedly to the parents and recommend that it be rebuked or checked before they dream of arresting it or bringing it before the Children's Court, so that when a child comes before the Children's Court it is pretty safe to assume that its conduct has been long continued and that it is becoming notorious for its fault.</P>
    <P>Usually, faced with that situation, if the district justice feels he cannot let the child go, he sends it to Marlborough House for a period on remand.  So far as I know, there is no seregation in Marlborough house between the various types of children lodged there. The accommodation caters for children who are in transit between one industrial school and another or in transit from the place where they were committed to an industrial school.</P>
    <P>That is the first thing to which I object most strenuosly.  The second thing is that there is no provision for psychiatric examination of any kind. I do not believe the district justice knows what he is doing when finally disposing of children in the Children's Court.  He has the story as set out by the Garda; he has the assistance of the probation officer but he may be dealing with a grave psychiatric condition which is evidenced by the condition of the child but without some skilled guidance as to the true significance of the events complained of by the Gardaí the district justice is completely at sea.  He has to deal with a situation he is not qualified to deal with and prescribe a remedy for a condition, the nature of which he does not understand.  Is it unreasonable to ask the Minister for Education to change that situation and do what I suggest?</P>
    <P>For a long time in Marlborough House the children would not be taken to Mass and I ask Deputies not to believe that what I am saying is extreme.  It took years of agitation to get the children taken to Mass&mdash;the theory was that there was nobody to <Col N="1248" /> take them.  Finally we got that remedied by shouting and roaring in this House and provision was made to take them to Mass.  That was regarded as great progress.</P>
    <P>All I am asking is that the Minister for Education, whether the Minister for Justice wants it or not, should provide the services of a competent child psychiatrist at Marlborough House and whether the district justice wants it or not, the Minister for Education should furnish a psychiatrist's report on the child committed to his care.  There is an excellent body&mdash;I think it is the Brothers of Saint John of God&mdash;which has an excellent psychiatric department and I have not the slightest doubt that, if asked to do so, they would most willingly provide such a service as a charity.  I do not think they should be asked to provide it as a charity but what I am asking is that the Minister for Education should say: &ldquo;I do not care a fiddle-de-dee what the Minister for Justice or what the district justice wants.  If a child is committed to my care on remand I shall ask for a report from a psychiatrist and, before surrendering the child back to the jurisdiction of the court and the Minister for Justice, I shall see that the child is accompanied by an adequate report on its true state of mental and physical health which will enable the courts of justice to do real justice when they finally come to dispose of the children of whom I have been custodian in Marlborough House.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I never doubted the Minister's interest in that point.  On more than one occasion it has been mentioned that there should be a rural bias in primary education.  I do not want to go too far into that but I had procured an agricultural reader for schools.  It is in the Department of Agriculture.  Would the Minister arrange to have it dug up and ask the national teachers to give it to the children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> Finally there are Parlophone records to teach people Spanish, Greek, French, Italian and every other language known.  Would the Department of Education take steps to get a set of Parlophone records to teach Irish because we all know that you can learn French, Italian, Spanish or any Continental language through that módh díreach available through gramophone records.</P>
    <P>There used be a set of Irish Parlophone records, but it has gone out of print.  I do not know whether the firm would be prepared to do it themselves without assistance from the State.  If they are, well and good.  If not, will the Minister for Education do something to stir them up and have a set provided?  Subject to that, will the Minister bear in mind my proposals for the revial of the Irish language? May I assure him that if he puts them into operation he will go down in <Col N="1250" /> history as the best Minister for Education we ever had because he will succeed, and if he does not put them into operation he will not succeed.</P>

      <P>I assume that the nylon stockings referred to by the Deputy are stockings which are knitted outside the sterling area, imported into this country for dyeing and finishing and re-exported to Great Britain. With the agreement of the exporters concerned I have arranged that each exporter will limit his yearly exports of these stockings in future to the quantities exported by him in the year ended 31st July, 1957.  I have also arranged with the Minister for Finance that foreign currency will not be granted for the purchase for processing and re-export by any person in any year of greater quantities of stockings than such person re-exported in the year ended the 31st July, 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken this action because I had reason to believe that if these stocking exports continued to expand they would be in serious danger of being stopped entirely by the British <Col N="1253" /> authorities.  The exporters agreed with this view and with the action taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>For valuation purposes all land is treated as agricultural land.  The answers to the specific heads of the Deputy's question are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) There can hardly be said to be a present system of land valuation.  The <Col N="1256" /> valuation of land was fixed in the years 1852-65 and has remained unchanged ever since&mdash;except in the County Boroughs of Dublin and Waterford.</P>
    <P>(b) As provided in Section 11 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, the general basis of land valuation was its net annual value by reference to a specified scale of agricultural prices.</P>
    <P>(c) Section 65 (1) of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, contains the only effective statutory provision for the revaluation of land.  This provision applies only to county boroughs.  While there is a provision for general revaluations in Section 34 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, it is ineffective as Section 39 of that Act which provided for the payment of expenses, was repealed in 1874.</P>
    <P>(d) Land has not been revalued since 1865 except in 1916 and 1926 in the then County Boroughs of Dublin and Waterford respectively.</P>

The total area now held there is 283 acres.  This land is attached to Rosscarbery forest and comprises part of the plantable reserve at that forest.  It is possible that some of the land will be planted this year, but at this stage I am not in a position to say when work may start.  I will have the Deputy notified when a decision has been reached in the matter.</P>

      <P>D'éist mé anseo ar feadh ceithre uaire a chloig nó mar sin leis an Teachta Dochtúir de Brún ag caint faoin gcóras oideachais atá againn sa tír seo.  Bé an méid a fuair mé as, go raibh barúil aige go bhfuil an córas oideachais is measa sa domhan againn, go bhfuil dúil ag na múinteoirí sa phionós corportha.  Labhair sé fá dtaobh de phionós corportha agus dúirt sé gurb é an fáith go raibh an oiread sin &ldquo;Teddy Boys&rdquo; ann ná chionns go raibh na múinteoirí ag bualadh na bpáistí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mhol sé an córas oideachais atá i Sasana agus i Meiriceá; ach tá a fhios ag gach duine sa tír seo nach bhfuil comparáidáidir an méid &ldquo;Teddy Boys&rdquo; atá sa tír seo agus atá i Sasana nó i Meiriceá.  Fiú amháin, ar na mallaibh, <Col N="1269" /> tá scéalta ins na páipéirí go raibh ar na póilíní i Meiriceá dul isteach ins na ranganna agus gunnaí acu, le smacht a choinneáil ar na páistí ann, le seans a thabhairt dos na múinteoirí teagasc a dhéanamh.  Níl a fhios agam cad é mar a thig leis a rá go bhfuil an córas oideachais ins na tíortha sin níos fearr ná an córas oideachais againne.</P>
    <P>Rud amháin a nrahothaigh mé, go ndeama sé iarracht athrú a dhéanamh ar an sean-chaighdeán críostúil a bhí againne sa tír seo&mdash;sin go mba cheart dúinne ómós a thabhairt do na seandaoine agus smacht a choinneáil ar pháistí.  Mhol seisean go mba cheart bheith umhal do na páistí agus na seandaoine a chaitheail amach as an mbealach ar fad.</P>
    <P>Sílim gurb é oráid an Aire Oideachais an óráid is tábhachtaí a tugadh le blianta, chionns go ndearna sé athruithe a bhí á lorg ag Cumann na Múinteoirí le tamall maith.  Bé an chéad cheann acu san ná an cose ar mhnápósta teagase a dhéanamh, a chur ar ceal.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil argóintí in éadan deire a chur leis an gcose seo.  Is é an aidhm atá ag an Aire agus ag an Roinn Oideachais, oideachas cóir a thabhairt do pháistí, is cuma iad a bheith ina gcónaí sa chathair nó in áit iargúlta sa tír.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil cuid mhaith páistí ins na háiteanna iargúlta nach raibh ag fáil oideachais chóir, go raibh ar na bainisteoirí daoine a chur isteach ins na postanna sin, daoine nach raibh cáilíocht ar bith acu.</P>
    <P>Sa tarna áit, tá socrú déanta ag an Aire go dtoghfaí na hábhair múinteoirí as na scoláirí a fhaghann na háiteacha is airde ins an.  Ard-Teistiméireacht. Gabhann sé le ciall nach dtiocfadh leat na daoine is fearr fháil, dá dtoghfaí na hábhair múinteoirí uilig as ceantar comh beag leis an nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile ann fosta.  Tá an tAire le triall a bheith aige chun a fháil amach an bhfuil na hiarrthóirí le haghaidh na gcoláistí ullmhúcháin fóirstineach. Labhair an Teachta Mac Cuinneagáin an lá fé dheire fá dtaobh de na daoine sna coláistí ullmhúcháin.  Séard a mholfainn féin sa gcás sin an triail a chur ar na scoláirí sna coláistí ullmhúcháin tar éis na meán-teistiméireachta. Thabharfadh sin seans do na scoláirí <Col N="1270" /> gur theip orthu sa triail an Ard-Teistiméireacht a dhéanamh ach a n-aghaidh a bheith dírithe acu ar shlí bheatha éigin eile in áit na múinteoireachta. Má fhaghann daoine sna coláistí ullmhácháin post sa Stát-Sheirbhís bíonn orthu an t-airgead a caitheadh orthu a aisíoc ach sa chás seo ní ar an scoláire féin atá an locht agus mar sin ní ceart aon airgead a bhaint de.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom an tAire a mholadh cionn is go bhfuil ar intinn aige scrúdú béil a bheith san Ard-Teistiméireacht. Is mór an chéirn ar aghaidh é sin. Bhí cosúlacht ar an scéal nár theanga bheo í an Ghaeilge taobh amuigh de na scoileanna náisiúnta.  Dá leanadh an dearcadh sin do bheadh an teanga caillte mar theanga bheo.  Ní bheadh suim inti ach amháin imeasc na scoláirí nach bhfuil dúil acu ach i dteangacha marbha.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a iarraidh ar an Aire cúpla rud a dhéanamh fá dtaobh den Ard-Teistiméireacht.  Ba mhaith liom dá ndéanfadh séisliú ar an gcaighdeán sa scrúdú scríofa sna páipéirí Gaeilge agus, chomh maith leis sin, nach mbeadh an scrúdú béil nua seo deacair.  Ag caint fé scrúduithe béil le haghaidh poist ar bith, ba chóir go ndéanfaí an scrúdú simplí i dtreo is nach dteipfeadh ach ar bheagán.  Níl aon dabht ná go bhfuil a lán daoine ag gearán go gcailleann siad postanna cionn is nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu.  Ba mhaith liom, dá bhrí sin, go mbeadh an scrúdú simplí i dtero is gur beag duine a theipfeadh air san scrúdú.  Tá na páipéir scrúdúcháin ró-dheacair, ró-liteartha.  Táimid ag lorg an chaighdeáin chéaima i gcás na Gaeilge agus atá ann i gcás an Bhéarla.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sin ciallmhar.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam gur chuir an tAire Coimisiún ar bun i dtaobh na Gaeilge. Ar dtús, shíl mé gur cuireadh ar bun é i gcás teagaisc na teangan sna scoilearma.  Tá áthas orm nach mar sin atá mar ní sa teagasc atá an trioblóid. Ní mian liom mórán a rá i dtaobh na ceiste seo cionn is go mbeidh an Coimisiún á hiniúchadh.  Ba mhaith liom dá rachadh an tAire isteach i gceist an bhun-theastais chun go bhfaghadh sé amach an bh'uil sé ag <Col N="1271" /> déanamh díobhála do labhairt na Gaeilge.  Tá cúrsaí san gciondargairtín agus ceol ag dul ar aghaidh go maith. Ba chóir don Roinn rud éigin a dhéanamh ar son na Gaeilge ar an dóigh céanna.  Ba cheart múinteoirí oilte agus cigirí oilte a chur i bhfeighil na gcúrsai seo.  Tá a sciar féin á dhéanamh ag Cumann na Múinteoirí sa mhéid seo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom dá rachadh an tAire isteach i gceist mhúineadh na staire. Tá barraíocht le foghlaim ag na páistí i rith na bliana.  Níl an rud ceart á fháil acu.  Ní fíricí atá uathu.  Séard atá uainn ná spiorad náisiúnta a chur isteach sna páistí agus saoránaigh mhaithe a dhéanamh díobh.  Níl ach uair sa tseachtain ann le haghaidh múineadh na staire agus, dá bhrí sin, níl na páistí ag foghlaim ach aimaneacha daoine.  An aon ionadh é go gcastar daoine orainn adeir nach raibh aon eolas acu fá dtaobh de Phádraig Mac Piarais?  Tá cúis ann go bhfuil an scéal amhlaidh.  Níl am ag na múinteoirí an cúrsa a chríochnú. Tá barraíocht míon-eolais de dhíth. Ba chóir an cheist uilig a iniúchadh.</P>
    <P>Do labhair Teachta éigin fá dtaobh de na meán-scoileanna inniu.  Tá barraíocht de na páistí ag freastal ar na meán-scoileanna.  Ba cheart dúinn níos mó béim a chur ar oideachas gairmscoile. Tá fíor-bheagán postanna sa tír seo le haghaidh daoine a thagann amach as na meán-scoileanna.  Ní thig ach leis na páistí is cliste postanna a fháil.  Níl aon tréineáil ann dóibh ach i gcóir postanna sa Stát-Sheirbhís. Mura bhfaghann siad iad sin níl a dhath acu.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhfuil an tAire ag iarraidh deire a chur leis na leabhair Chigire. Is rud maith é sin.  Sna scoileanna fé láthair tá rudaí scríofa fá dtaobh de mhúinteoirí atá marbh le 100 bliain anuas.  Bliantaó shoin scríobhadh rudaí suaracha fá dtaobh de mhúinteoirí go bhfuil gaolta leo beo inniu féin.  Dá dtéadh éinne isteach sna scoileanna agus na rudaí seo a fheiscint d'fhéadfaidís bheith ag caint fá dtaobh de dhuine atá marbh leis na blianta. Tá mé cinnte nach bhfuil sin ceart.</P>
    <P>Rud amháin eile.  D'iarr an Teachta Mac Cuinneagáin ar an Aire gach arbh <Col N="1272" /> fhéidir leis a dhéanamh ar son na múinteoirí atá imithe amach ar pinsean agus ar son na múinteoirí úd nach bhfuair an deontas.  Ba mhaith liomsa dá gcabhródh an tAire leo fosta. Ba mhaith liom a iarraidh ar an Aire fosta deontas a thabhairt don pháqipéar <i>Amárach.</i>  Páipéar tábhachtach é a léitear go forleathan ar fud na Gaeltachta agus ba chóir cuidiú fiúntach a thabhairt dó.</P>
    <P>I regret I feel obliged to continue speaking in this debate in English, particularly when my remarks are on the Irish language and the language revival.  We have in the main three groups of critics.  There are those who would like to see the language destroyed.  There are those who for materialistic reasons are opposed to the revival.  Finally, there are those who, while they are not opposed to the revival of the language, are opposed to the present methods and who are convinced that the methods are educationally unsound, that they harm the child's mental make-up, cause inhibitions, and so on.</P>
    <P>Having enumerated what appear to me to be the three main groups of critics, I find myself in a quandary. Those who are anxious to restore the language decry only one of those groups, namely, the group which would have the language destroyed.  It is extremely difficult to differentiate between the groups because this particular group rarely, if ever, argues along the lines that the language should die but rather uses one or other of the other groups' arguments, that is to say, that the language has no material value or is damaging to the child.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is difficult to decide who genuinely believes these arguments and who is using them to destroy the language.  There have been some vicious attacks on the language and on our educational system generally over the past few months, none the less vicious because of their subtlety, from O.B.E.s, retired British naval officers and so on.  We can say without fear of contradiction that these people are actuated simply and solely by their antagonism to the language and to all national movements.  They <Col N="1273" /> have been reared and steeped in the tradition that the British Empire is the be all and the end all of existence and that the mere Irish are Lilliputians living in a tin-pot Republic.  We have no intention of being led or said by these people.  I feel that what was worth fighting and dying for is worth fighting to keep.</P>
    <P>There are those who say that the Irish language has no material value or, as is heard very often from one particular group in this House, that it is of no value to our emigrants.  The Irish language has an educational value but, of course, the interjections that are made about emigrants are designed to give the impression that if the emigrants did not have to learn Irish they would reach a standard of education which would enable them to secure better jobs in exile.  To anybody who has made a study of education. that, of course, is nonsense.  While the vast majority of our children leave school at 14 years of age, it is a fallacy to suggest that their standard of education would be so much higher, simply by dropping Irish from the curriculum, that they would reach a standard of education which would enable them to get better jobs.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the defeatist attitude of those who by that type of supplementary question and interjection admit that they see no future for an Irishman in his own country.  It would be a very poor spirit, indeed, who would plan the future of the country on such a supposition.</P>
    <P>With regard to those who are opposed to the revival of the Irish language by present methods, I am glad that it has been decided to inquire, among other things, into these methods, not necessarily that I believe that the methods are educationally unsound, although I admit that I have many criticisms of the system, but rather because the misgiving of many people will be allayed and a weapon, which has been wielded indiscriminately over the past year and prior to that, would be removed from the hands of those who are deliberately intent on destroying the language. Where flaws are found by this commission, those flaws can be rectified and I admit that there are flaws in the <Col N="1274" /> system and am not in entire agreement with the present methods.  That does not mean that I decry them entirely.</P>
    <P>Has the effort to revive the Irish language failed?  In my opinion, it has not.  I believe that the language is like water in a main, ready to flow out when the tap is turned on.  What we have to discover is how the tap can be turned on.  As far as I can remember, Deputy Mulcahy had the same idea. Thousands upon thousands of our young people to-day know the language.  They do not speak it in any reasonable proportion to the number who know it. The reason is something that we must try to discover.  The commission may help to do that.</P>
    <P>Personally, I believe there was too much optimism in 1922, that the matter was over-simplified and that when the rapid progress which was then visualised was not achieved many people were inclined to go to the other extreme and to say that the revival was impossible.  We have plumbed the depths and the years to come will show a revival of the spirit of our people. Unfortunately, the attitude of defeatism towards the language is symptomatic of our attitude as a people towards practically every other important problem, social, cultural or economic. That attitude is responsible in no small measure for our present unemployment and emigration problems.</P>
    <P>I read recently a statement by a learned professor in Dublin in a debate, in which he said that it was fallacious to think that we could not be a nation if we had not got a language of our own.  I wonder on what basis the professor made that statement. I do not know.  What I do know is that conquerors have always believed the opposite to be true.  After the Norman invasion of this country, for example, the Normal Government in England endeavoured to build a wall around its own people in Ireland by forbidding them to speak the Irish language and to adopt Irish customs and so on, realising that if their people here adopted the Irish language and customs, it would eventually lead to their assimilation in the Irish nation.  In fact, that is what did happen for a very considerable number <Col N="1275" /> of centuries.  Later, they endeavoured, and succeeded to a large extent, to substitute their language for our own.</P>
    <P>Does anybody suggest that the reason the English Government did that was for our good?  Obviously, they realised that, if they could destroy our language and customs, eventually we would be assimilated as part of the English race.  There were many examples of that in world history.  If we go back very far in history, we find that many nations disappeared from the face of the earth simply because other nations succeeded in conquering and eventually assimilating them.</P>
    <P>Occasionally, when I listen to certain Deputies who claim to espouse the cause of Republicanism and in fact to be the only Republicans in this House, I am led to ponder as to whether a person can be a genuine follower of a particular teaching or ideal while at the same time reserving to himself the right to divest himself of part of that teaching or ideal as it suits him.</P>
    <P>We can sum up the teaching of our greatest hero, Pádraíg Pearse, a teaching for which he laid down his life in his words: &ldquo;An Ireland not free merely but Gaelic as well, not Gaelic merely but free as well.&rdquo;  Can a person consider himself a true follower of Pearse if he says he wants Ireland free while at the same time he is averse to its language or its customs?  Or must he believe that the language is a fundamental prerequisite of freedom as Davis did, when he said that a country without a language was only half a nation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>If he did not, he knew its value.  Presumably he did.  I know it can be said that Tone and Mitchel and several others of our greatest leaders did not speak the language but it is an altogether different matter to suggest that if they had been successful in freeing our country they would have decided to destroy the language.  Let us not judge what these great men might have done if they had succeeded, but let us remember that it was those men who <Col N="1276" /> put the saving of the soul of the nation on a par with its physical freedom who did, in fact, win for us our freedom. Those were men like Pearse, Clarke and MacDonagh and the rest who believed it was as essential that the soul of our nation should be saved as that we should be physically free.</P>
      <P>The Irish language is not dead and those who want to see it revived will do their utmost to revive it.  The revival of the Irish language does not mean the exclusion of other languages. We appreciate that English is a very useful language and we would be very foolish people if we decided to do away with that language.  That is not the case.  We are anxious to make this country bilingual and when I say that, I know the policy is one which is supported not just by one Party but by every Party.  We have a number of people in the different Parties very anxious that the language should be revived.  There is a considerable number in Fire Gael, notably Deputy General Mulcahy, Deputy Manley and many others; Deputy Corish, and I am sure others in the Labour Party. There are very many in my own Party. It is not a Party matter at all and it would be very wrong for any Party to suggest that saving the language was a policy peculiar to them.  It is not, and it is in that fact I feel the greatest hope lies.</P>
      <P>Finally-I think Deputy Dr. Browne made some reference to this&mdash;we all agree in this House that the material well-being of our people is of the utmost importance.  We know it transcends most other things but what we do not agree with is the suggestion that efforts to improve the living conditions of our people are in any way impended by our efforts to revive Irish. In fact, I feel the very opposite is true because the revival of the spirit necessary to revive the language would help in no small way to overcome the great problems with which we are faced of unemployment and emigration.</P>

      <P>It was customary for Deputies like myself when addressing the House on the Estimate for Education to go through a kind of rite.  It was like entering the temple.  You had to abase yourself, make your declarations <Col N="1277" /> of good faith; you had to say that you were not attacking the.  Department of Education or its officials and that you were not attacking the Minister or the Irish language.  Where that would bring you I do not know but when I came into this House first, I found perhaps one or two people getting up to say a few words in Irish on the Vote for Education and they were mainly members of the teaching profession.</P>
      <P>The burning topic in education to-day is the language and its revival.  I think the revival movement has not met with the success that it should have achieved in the past 25 years because if anybody dared mention that the revival was not going as well as it should, he would be trampled to death, howled down as a traitor, a West Briton or I do not know what else. We were told to-day that we strove for physical freedom.  Was it a good thing, in the movement to revive the Irish language, that it should be put as a shackle on the majority of our people who were unable to speak it, and on their children?  The young Deputy who has just spoken, and who is so full of crusading ardour, said he did not believe that there was no future for an Irishman here.  I am with him, but there are many people who fear there is no future for the Irishman who speaks only English and for his children, and who fear there is a Brahmiclass being created here by the language movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned this afternoon that when he wanted to employ a higher veterinary officer when he was Minister for Agriculture he wanted a man who would have reached great scientific attainments and have had great experience.  The Appointments Commissioners sent him a man with great experience in foreign universities&mdash;as we must describe English universities at present&mdash;and in foreign research.  Then Deputy Dillon was told that, of course, there would have to be another appointment and he was sent a young man just qualified, who was well ahead of the real scientist because he had a knowledge of the Irish language.  These are the things that have bedevilled the language movement. <Col N="1278" /> The Irish language was used as a fence or stumbling-block in that case to keep the most efficient and most suitable man for the position and for the training of future agricultural scientists out of that position.</P>
    <P>I have experience of that myself. Some years ago, in my constituency, the post of art master was advertised and on qualifications we selected an art master.  We were told some time later that we must get rid of him because he did not have a competent knowledge of Irish.  I said then&mdash;and rightly&mdash;that if Michelangelo or Raphael could have been resurrected and applied for that job, we would be compelled to turn him down, but if some payment artist came along with a competent knowledge of Irish he would get the job.</P>
    <P>We should be realistic about this. If we want Irish teachers and apostles of the Irish language, let us look for them, but if we want people in other walks of life and in other professions we should give these positions on merit. That is one aspect in which the Irish language movement has not been helpful. It has debarred merit many a time.  If the present system is continued, merit will be debarred again.</P>
    <P>I do not give two rows of pins for anybody in this country who tells me I am a traitor to my country.  I am tired of people talking like that at me.  I can only reply that I am in very good company with a lot of very fine patriots who have been branded as traitors by persons who were not fit to lick their boots.  It is not right to come in here, talk about Republicanism and to bring the memory of poor Pádraig Pearse into all this.  Another thing that has done the Irish language revival movement an immense amount of harm is the bringing of Pádraig Pearse's name and memory, and the bones, relics and records of fine people to the hustings, debasing their memory for political gun-powder purposes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon gave the Minister a system to-day which he said would revive the Irish language. His idea was to build up a great hard core of Irish scholarships, Irish speakers and Irish writers.  I think that that would be a good idea. Deputy Dillon says that if children in the primary schools are competent enough in Irish, they should be given a free secondary school education and that if they are competent enough to pass in honours Irish they should be given a free university education.  I am not against that.  However, I am against using the Irish language to rule out other boys and girls from the National University.  I am against putting up the Irish language as a bar to other boys and girls in entering any kind of a Government position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People use the expression &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo;.  I shall defend that in this way that you have compulsory English and compulsory arithmetic.  We were all compelled to learn everything in school.  The teachers did not appeal in any psychological way either to myself or to my contemporaries when I was going to school.  We were compelled to learn what was put up to us.  I would prefer to say that Irish should not be essential if a man wants to earn his livelihood in Ireland.  Just because of an accident of birth and geography, if a young man comes from an Irish-speaking family or an Irish-speaking place and goes into a school and is not half as good as another boy or girl-just because he <Col N="1280" /> is able to speak Irish&mdash;he is uprated in his marks and his examination is downrated for him.  These are the things that have done the language harm.</P>
    <P>This country always thrived on volunteer movements and not on conscripted armies.  A young man over there spoke about reviving the spirit and about plumbing the depths.  As far as the language is concerned, we are going down and I only hope we do not go down any further.  I hope the Minister will try to gather this even at this late hour.  The whole policy should be overhauled and approached in a graver manner.</P>
    <P>In the years preceding the 1914-18 war, 100 per cent. of the children attending schools in Ireland were taking Irish.  Nearly 60 per cent. of them were coming out of school at 3.30 p.m. or four o'clock in the afternoon and, after their tea, when they had finished their home exercises, they would go down to the Gaelic League to try to learn more Irish.  We have lost all that spirit which was there in those days. The Minister can check on what I am saying.  Notwithstanding the fact that, at the time I speak of, the children were taking Irish, 70 per cent. or 80 per cent. of them were taking French, German and Spanish as well. About 14 in 400 are taking foreign languages now.</P>
    <P>If we are to be moved by any spirit of Republicanism and nationality, we should also be moved by the last words of Robert Emmet's speech from the dock in which he said he hoped his country would take her place some day amongst the nations of the earth.  Now it is said that this country should take her place speaking the Irish language. This country, away back in the far-off days, took its place amongst the nations of the earth because the people going out from it spoke the languages of the countries to which they went.</P>
    <P>There is something rotten in this whole business&mdash;99,000 publications in Irish by An Gúm had to be destroyed last year.  They could not be given away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>They were offered to schools and to various people who would be very vocal about the revival of the language but who would not be very quick to put their hands into their pockets to pay the scrap prices at which the Department offered these publications.  If all those people who attack me, and people like me, are so true to the language, and if they are such great disciples, why did they not buy these books?</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred to corporal punishment.  We have a lot of trouble in this country and we read and hear about trouble in other countries with juvenile delinquency.  I think the whole thing starts in the schools. The Minister and his Department, and some of the Minister's predecessors, were being encouraged and lobbied to prevent corporal punishment in schools.  I do not agree with that at all. The type of people doing this and the idea behind it are ruining the whole world.  They are afraid to punish people.  They are afraid even to punish murderers in England to-day.  The children now are being turned into tyrants and they tyrannise over their parents.  The parents go to the schools and prevent the teachers from punishing the-children so that the teachers can do nothing with the children. That is leading to juvenile delinquency all over the world to-day.</P>
      <P>I should like to relate to this House something that happened to me on one occasion in the Library of Leinster House, something connected with the late Senator Seán Moylan.  He was then Deputy Seán Moylan.  I happened to go into the Library where he was talking to some gentleman.  They were talking grand Irish but he introduced me in English and the talk got round to corporal punishment.  He referred them to me in his own puckish way. Before I could say very much, one of the gentlemen said that they wanted the teachers to use the psychological approach to the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moylan said that he agreed with that to a certain extent and added that the teachers he had did not use either a stick or a cane and they seemed to get on all right.  The <Col N="1282" /> gentlemen were delighted with that but before they could say anything else Deputy Moylan added that the teacher had an ashplant with a knob on it and if the boy did not do his work he got a blow of that ashplant.  It was not necessary to use the ashplant; it was enough to know that it was there.  It was a great thing for the discipline of the school.  We all know the difficulties that teachers have in facing a school of 40 or 50 children particularly if they are deprived of the right of using corporal punishment.  If that is the case they will lose all control, there will be no discipline in the school and that will tell against the children for all time.</P>
    <P>I have seen many of these children whom the teachers were not allowed to punish.  I have seen them when they left school, got good jobs and went into factories.  Then it was only a matter of time until the mammas came to the local Deputy to say: &ldquo;I am in terrible trouble, Johnny has been let go.&rdquo;  Before the Deputy could say anything he was told that the foreman, the manager or the managing director was the most impossible creature that ever lived.  The Deputy on making inquiries would discover that the boy was an impudent and inpertinent young pup who could not be told to do anything and who had to be let go.  The real cause of that was that there was no discipline in the school which the boy had attended. That boy was never in the habit of taking orders and of doing what he was told.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister has removed the ban on married teachers is a confession of the failure of the policy under which teachers are recruited. There must be something fundamentally wrong with that policy when more boys and girls are not offering themselves as teachers.  I have been informed on very good authority that out of one school 14 boys were called to the training college and only six of them went.  There is something the matter there.  Perhaps it is that the commencing salary is not big enough or that the boys considered they had to take on too heavy a load. I have asked several boys about the <Col N="1283" /> matter and their answer is that they consider the whole drudgery of school teaching too much.  Of course, these boys have not a vocation for it and school teaching is a calling for which you must have a vocation.</P>
    <P>Here, again, I must bring in the question of the Irish language.  If one were to ask oneself what would be the best qualification a young boy should have to take up the teaching profession, one would be inclined to say that he should be capable of going into a classroom, taking control of 40 or 50 children and of being able to control them without punishing them.  Here we see again a matter that Deputy Dillon has already mentioned.  You would have, on the one hand, a young man who is possessed of that qualification as far as the approach to teaching is concerned, and, on the other hand, you would have a young man who is well able to speak the language but may not be able to control children. The man better able to speak the language will walk off with the job every time under present conditions.</P>
    <P>All these things have to be considered and it is up to the Minister and his officials to weigh up the results of the policy of the last 25 years.  They should ask themselves if these policies have produced the results for which so much money has been spent&mdash; although the money might not matter &mdash;and for which so many tears have been shed by schoolchildren over the last 25 years.  I would agree with Deputy Faulkner when he asked if it was possible for this young Minister for Education to take away from the language the objection which a great number of children have to it&mdash;that it is a stumbling-block and a penance to them.  If you can convince the children that the language is no handicap at all to them, then you are on the way to a revival.  If you cannot do that you are not on the way to a revival.</P>
    <P>People will say that I want to have the Irish language destroyed.  I have never heard anybody say that but the protagonists of the language have got their way for the last 25 years.  They have got everything they wanted&mdash;they have got all the money they wanted and they got power to inflict any hardships <Col N="1284" /> they liked on students.  We can judge by the results.</P>
    <P>Deputies are always inclined to be parochial and to get down to matters which concern their own constituents. When there were too many teachers in this country in the 30's the powers that be decided to close down the training college.  When anything is to be closed or taken away, if it is situated in Waterford, it will be taken from Waterford.  They close the De la Salle College in Waterford and say: &ldquo;That will do, take it out.&rdquo;  They took other things out of it, also.  I am only waiting for the Taoiseach's Vote when I shall relate the litany.  I would be afraid if I referred further to it now that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle might tell me it did not arise on this Vote.</P>
    <P>There is something else which is nearly on a par with the way the Republic is being shouted about.  Did any Deputy ever hear of any shouting or writing on &ldquo;our national heritage&rdquo;? What is our national heritage? Does anyone know?  Will someone tell me what it is?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the question.  I do not know what it is, I am just trying to find out.  There must be things we inherit.  It is not just a national heritage.  There is something which is in the bailiwick of the Minister that I want to talk about here.  It is a matter of national interest.  I refer to the treasures in our National Gallery, our National Museum and our National Library.  <i>Dublin Opinion,</i> and all the papers that brighten our lives, often give an idea that civil servants are having a wonderful time up there.  If anyone wants to see dedicated men, who are slaves to their jobs, they should go over to the National Library or the National Gallery or the National Museum and see people working under the most frightful difficulties.  I am quite sure that the Minister will take immediate steps about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have treasures there in the National Gallery and I make the deliberate statement here that we have <Col N="1285" /> no proper inventory of the treasures there.  That is not due in any way to the curator or his Staff, but is due to the fact that most of the treasures of the National Gallery are piled up higgledy-piggledy and stored in cellars. There is no room to take them out and have a proper inventory made.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister an idea of something he could find out. One often finds oneself up against the blank wall of departmental differences. There is another Department which has storage near at hand, but they might want this storage for shovels and buckets and &ldquo;to blazes with the masterpieces.&rdquo; They can get damp and go into dust.  Then perhaps some active newspaper reporter may find out what has been happening and there may be some holy horror about all this.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the National Library.  I do not know how the staff are able to carry on.  Thanks be to God, there are still people who are able to present them with material, and they buy more very rare works. They do great work in trying to catalogue them and store them and also to have them made available to students and others who go in there to do research. They work under frightful difficulties. I would appeal to the Minister for the three places in order&mdash;the National Gallery, the National Library and the National Museum.  The Minister could go there himself, go down to the cellars and see what the position is at present.  I have no doubt, if I know the Minister's form correctly, that this will be remedied.  Here I am appealing to a Minister for Education to change the policy of the Department.</P>
    <P>I shall close with this point.  Deputy Cunningham spoke yesterday about the pay and the superannuation of teachers and so on.  I was at a teachers' congress some years ago and I could not help noticing that there were 58 items on the agenda for discussion. Five of them related to teaching, teaching methods and pupils; the rest of them related to superannuation, teachers' conditions and so on. I went to a teacher of long standing and of great worth and I said to him: &ldquo;Look at that; that is not to the credit of you or your profession.&rdquo;  He <Col N="1286" /> said: &ldquo;If you were as long teaching as I am and if you knew the firm rock. that the Department is, as far as changing the system of education is concerned, you would realise that the teachers know their business and that they are right in putting down four or five harmless resolutions; it is better for them to devote themselves to their own conditions and to their own future because through the years they have been turned down so often that it is no use referring to other matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister will have seen the result not only of the 35 years during which an Irish Government has been in office, but of the years previously-during which the Irish revival was on. If one adds up all those years one can ask oneself: What result has been achieved?  Are we justified in continuing this policy for the results we have got?  Perhaps the Minister might say: &ldquo;If we continue the policy we have, we seem to be going down every year.  We shall destroy what we set out to restore.&rdquo;  Let me close with this observation.  Irish should not be essential.  Irish should not be a stumbling block.  Irish should not debar any son or daughter of an Irishman born in this country from earning a living in his or her country.</P>

Tá cuid acu ann <Col N="1287" /> leis na blianta agus tá siad ag dul in olcas.</P>
    <P>There are so many problems, many of them long standing facing the Minister and his Department that it is difficult to know where to begin.  One that has become progressively worse in the past few years is the problem of the number of untrained teachers taken into the service.  The Minister has taken a step to remedy that&mdash;a controversial step-but yet it is an effort to remedy the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referring to this problem seemed to think it would be a simple matter to overcome.  He seemed to think it would be simply a matter of erecting buildings, filling them with prospective teachers and that in a few years the problem would be solved.  I do not think it is so easy of solution as that, but whatever steps the Minister takes to overcome the position, I hope, as Deputy Cunningham reminded him last night, that he will not fall into the error made previously and run into the situation which the Deputy and I knew existed in the 1930s when there were teachers for several years without jobs.</P>
    <P>There were many who never taught and who gave up looking for jobs after acting as substitutes here and there for a few months and being a few months idle.  Eventually, they gave up in despair and took up other jobs.  I hope we shall not fall into that error again.</P>
    <P>I think there should be some reform in the training of teachers for primary schools.  I should like to see the position where there would be a common basic training for all teachers and in the final year a specialised course for those who would opt to go as primary, vocational or secondary teachers. All teachers should come from the training college with a university degree. I do not think it would be an insurmountable difficulty to achieve that. It would give us a unified body in the teaching profession.  It would help to give us an integration in education which I believe to be lacking.</P>
    <P>When speaking of university degrees for teachers, I should like to see a university education more readily available to those who are, capable of assimilating such education.  Deputy <Col N="1288" /> Dillon made a suggestion which I think is well worthy of close consideration. That is in regard to making not alone university education but a secondary or any other type of education more readily available for a child who showed aptitude for it.</P>
    <P>In the cities and in most large towns it is not so difficult for a child to receive secondary education.  Those who live in towns are lucky in that there is, in most big towns anyway, secondary education readily available at very little cost.  But there are many areas in which it is not so easily available.  The question of increased scholarships to make it possible for the child with ability to make use of that ability should be more carefully considered.</P>
    <P>I understand that night lectures are available in the National University for those who wish to go for a B.A. degree but if one does a B.A. degree through night lectures an honours degree cannot be taken.  Perhaps the Minister might have some say in that matter.  He might look into the question to see whether those who take a degree in that manner might be able to do an honours degree.</P>
    <P>Another problem of which Deputy Dillon spoke was the problem of the retarded child.  The ordinary child of slow intellect is a problem with which we all meet.  He mentioned some in the City of Dublin.  Possibly it would not be difficult in the City of Dublin to make provision for children of that kind.  We have that difficulty in small rural schools.  I wonder whether it would be possible in one of the larger schools in such rural areas to have a suitably qualified teacher to give such children in the area an opportunity of making something of themselves?</P>
    <P>It is impossible to teach properly in small schools in the rural areas where the teachers have to deal with four or five classes with almost 50 children.  It depends on the run of children.  You get a good run and a bad run.  It is impossible to give them any individual attention.  The child is more or less neglected through no fault of the teacher but as a result of the system, if you like.  The Minister gave the figure 37 in relation to the size of the <Col N="1289" /> classes.  It is an unrealistic figure.  In a small country school the average number with which the teacher has to deal may be anything up to 50 or more. Certainly, in a school which is bordering on a three-teacher school but has not yet reached the average for three teachers, frequently the teacher would have 50 children to deal with.</P>
    <P>There is the problem also that all children, whether retarded or otherwise, who reach the sixth standard must take the primary certificate examination.  The Taoiseach expressed surprise a couple of years ago that it was compulsory for all children who complete the sixth standard to sit for the primary certificate examination.  I thought then that something might be done about it but nothing has been done.  I do not know whether it is sound or not to ask a child of that age to sit for a written examination or whether or not the examination proves anything.  Many of the children who take that examination are in the 12-year-old group.</P>
    <P>Many children consider that when they have done the primary certificate examination, whether they pass or not, their education is completed.  From my experience there is no School Attendance Act in force as far as that is concerned. The question of raising the school-leaving age is often discussed, and I would like to see it raised, but the school-leaving age at present is not even 14.  My experience over a number of years is that children leave the primary school when they have taken the primary certificate examination. Some go to secondary schools, some to vocational schools and others remain at home and nobody bothers.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the teaching of history.  That is a matter to which I referred last year.  The history course that teachers are expected to cover in two years, devoting one hour per week to the subject, is from earliest days to the present time.  That is completely unrealistic.  The texts issued for primary schools are even more unrealistic. This year, for the first time, a new text was published which would bear some relation to the amount of work that could be covered in two years <Col N="1290" /> at one hour a week.  A very bare outline of the history of ireland is all that could be covered in that time and most of that could be covered in the ordinary reading lessons in Irish or English.</P>
    <P>The course I should like to see followed, and which would be capable of completion in the two years, would be the making of modern Ireland, say, from the 18th century.  In that way more detail could be given about the making of modern Ireland.  That would be better for the child who would have no opportunity of higher education.  It would be better to give such a child a course in the making of modern Ireland rather than a scanty outline of Irish history from earliest times to the present day which would be the bare bones of history and could not be anything else in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>While the texts in Irish have improved over the last few years, they still leave a great deal to be desired. Deputy Corish referred to the introduction of the new spelling and said that he disagreed with it.  It is something with which I agree, something that was long needed.  Teachers have experienced difficulty in teaching Irish because of the various types of spelling, various grammatical usages, and so on.  The problem was great enough without that added difficulty.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear a Deputy from the Gaeltacht, Deputy Cunningham, say that he agreed with the standardisation of spelling.  A standardisation of spelling and grammar and a standard language which could be taught in schools would help in the teaching of Irish.  A student of Irish in a Galltacht area, where there is no Irish tradition at all, is in the difficulty that he first learns, possibly, Munster Irish, later Connaught Irish and, later still, a smattering of Ulster phrases&mdash;a meascán of all the dialects.  There should be a standard Irish taught in the schools.  There is a standard English taught and that does not interfere with the dialects of various areas.  The same could apply to Irish.</P>
    <P>In that respect, a booklet on grammar has been issued, the <i>Caighdeán Oifigiúil.</i>  I have seen two or three books published which profess to follow that <i>caighdeán</i> but which do <Col N="1291" /> not follow the same rule, as far as I can see.  It is a matter which should be examined as to whether we should have a standard Irish which could be taught in schools and which would make the work of teaching Irish easier.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with those who say that no progress has been made in Irish.  Progress definitely has been made although the aim that we set before us may not have been achieved.  It has been said that we have failed to achieve the objective.  The difficulty was that we set ourselves too high a target.  We set ourselves out to do too much instead of attempting a little at a time and moving step by step.  The reaction as in the case of a pendulum of a clock which is swung too far to one side is to swing back violently again.  In the case of Irish, we tried to move too far and the reaction against that effort was all the greater. The aim should have been to make it possible for people to speak Irish or, as a Deputy has already said, to have the country bilingual.  If that had been the aim earlier on, more success might have been achieved.</P>
    <P>The difficulty was that the schools were asked to do too much.  The schools did not fail.  The teachers did not fail.  The pupils did not fail.  It was afterwards that failure came.  It was educationally unsound to ask that the use of the English language should be cut out in the lower grades of the schools.  One of the principles of education is to lead from the known to the unknown.  Obviously, in the schools in English-speaking areas, the English language should have been used.</P>
    <P>Irish was only coming into use when I was coming towards the old junior grade and the only Irish text that we used was the old <i>Irish Aids</i> through Irish and English.  Afterwards, when I went to a school where Irish only was spoken, I did not find any difficulty in following the lessons done entirely through Irish but then I had reached an age when it was possible to do that.  To try to impose that on a younger child is, I think, quite wrong.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" /> I referred already to the desirability of making of the profession a unified body, so securing more integration in teaching and co-ordination between the various bodies.  At present we have primary, secondary, technical and university education, four separate compartments. I think the Minister said last year that there was co-ordination. There may be co-ordination of a kind but certainly there is no integration. You have the position, say, where a child lives in a rural area, has done the primary certificate and gone into a vocational school.  You have some children who have done a couple of years secondary education and who may have reached or passed the intermediate certificate examination and who then leave the secondary school to go to the vocational school.</P>
    <P>You find all these in the one class &mdash;I am speaking now of the rural towns; it may not happen in the cities. You have the position of the teacher trying to teach children of primary certificate standard and of intermediate certificate standard in the same class.  It is an impossible task.  If the school leaving age were raised to 15 and primary education went to 12 or 13&mdash;12, I would say&mdash;then, from 12 to 15, children would go into a secondary school and from 15 on into a vocational school or remain in the secondary school but there would be no break between the completion of the primary course and the age of 15. There would be continuation of the subjects they had been doing in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>If we are to achieve any success in our education we must have a satisfied body of teachers.  We must give them school buildings that will help them in their work, a system of inspection that will help in the teaching of pupils and opportunities for teachers to secure promotion, opportunities which are denied to them to-day.  Deputy Lynch referred to the number of items on the congress agenda referring to salaries, pensions and gratuities and the small number referring to education. That is because teachers over the years have found less and less time at these discussions to devote to educational topics.  It should be the other way round; they should be <Col N="1293" /> almost entirely concerned with matters of education and improved methods of teaching.</P>
    <P>The question of parity was mentioned and perhaps the Minister would consider it further.  Perhaps he would also consider further, if he has not already done so, the limited opportunities for promotion which teachers have.  In the Six Counties and in England, teachers have opportunities for promotion which we do not have here and they also have opportunities to get bonuses or payments in respect of numbers attending school.</P>
    <P>With regard to the inspection question, I may have had differences with inspectors but I cannot say a great deal against them.  I found them all right on the whole but I would suggest that an inspection, especially for young teachers, should be more in the nature of help and advice to the teacher and should be used to demonstrate to the teacher, who is not using proper methods, how a particular subject should be properly taught and the proper methods to use.</P>
    <P>A problem on which Deputy Dr. Browne spent much time was that of replacing school buildings, building new schools and reconstructing old ones.  It is a big problem and I agree that the number of schools built may not be sufficient to overcome the deficiency but the blame should be placed where it belongs.  I understood from the Minister's opening remarks that the Board of Works is almost £4,000,000 worth of work in arrears in respect of plans already sanctioned. That is where the blame should be placed and, if the Minister has influence or power over the Board of Works, he should try to get them to increase their rate of building so that in the foreseeable future we could overcome the problem of supplying new schools.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne may have been misled by the figures given him in regard to the number of new schools required.  In answer to a Dáil question the other day the Minister said, referring to County Kildare, that certain new schools were needed and <Col N="1294" /> I noticed that the very first on, the list was one in my own town which is now practically complete.  There may be many more which are in the course of building and which the Deputy may have regarded as not even started yet.</P>
    <P>I would join with the others who asked the Minister to do something in the case of the pensioners.  Let us not have to ask year after year until they are all gone.  It would cost little to give them the balance they consider justly due to them and I would ask the Minister to come some of the way towards meeting them, if not the whole way.</P>
    <P>In regard to the programme in primary schools, I suggest these schools should not be asked to do the impossible.  These schools are supposed to give the <i>bun ábhair</i>, first training in moral behaviour, then principally the three R's and history and geography.  Beyond that the primary schools cannot go if they are to do that much effectively. If they can do that much effectively, they are doing good work.  I hope the Minister and his Department will continue the advance made this year and increase the rate of progress.</P>

      <P>My interest in this Vote arises from the fact that it affects the 80 per cent. of the school-children who are children of the workers.  I am not against the teaching of Irish and I have no great feeling about it.  I do not feel I am less an Irishman on that account.  I want to see English preserved. I should like to see this country bilingual, not just speaking Irish only.  English is of great economic value for the 80 per cent. that I have referred to.  Perhaps the other 20 per cent. of school-children will find all the opportunities they require here but there is only just about enough employment to satisfy that 20 per cent.  The remaining 80 per cent. must depend largely on manual work, on trades, and the majority of them leave school at the age of 14.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 10th June, 1958.</P>
